      <li>Does just I wanted it do, great buy</li>

      <li>I rotated the bonnet to where the drawstring was close to my ear and was good.</li>
      <li>Use in assisted living, good with dryer but to puffy for use with bed bound clients.</li>
      <li>It is a bit of a struggle to get the elastic to go around the end of the blow dryer but isn&#x27;t that a good thing so that it stays on and doesn&#x27;t get blown off?</li>
      <li>This works surprisingly well.</li>
      <li>love it works great</li>
      <li>very pleased with it</li>
      <li>My wife loves it so &amp; it makes her hair really straight so, if she happy im happy &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Works beautifully when connected to blow-dryer, very reasonably-priced &amp; delivered just 2 days later-excellent experience.</li>
      <li>There was some air that seeped out mostly around</li>
      <li>The idea is so much better than the reality.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>and it lasted for many years.</li>
      <li>Would have been better to order the hard-shell hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I love this item it makes transporting a hair dryer easier and faster to destination.i wanrt to buy more items</li>
      <li>yeah its alot better</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have a full hair dryer and need one, perhaps want to save money, this will do the trick!  </li>
      <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t read the fine print.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly and works great with a hand-held hair dryer to allow hands-free reading/writing.</li>
      <li>The bonnet fit over all the rollers fine.</li>
      <li>I have attached it to an antique hair dryer -  hands free even.  </li>
      <li>I got one of these for myself but my mother in law liked it so much she wanted one also.</li>
      <li>Great product used to have one similar years ago.</li>
      <li>The drawstring on the hood does not keep the hood secure on your head.</li>
      <li>Overall, I like it and would buy it again, great buy for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veronica</li>
      <li>Even though I look like an alien with this on and dries my hair wonderfully  and covers all my rollers with no issues.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this product for the price.</li>
      <li>Very well designed and works fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably worth the $10 I paid for it.</li>
      <li>I think I am not the right consumer for this product.</li>
      <li>Halfway through using it the first time I noticed air was not blowing through.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Not too hot at all.</li>
      <li>You will look like a space cadet while wearing it, but it evenly distributes the heat well, is easy to use, big enough for very large rollers, and stores/compacts easily.</li>
      <li>An easy fix it just to hold it down with your free hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t have taken as long.</li>
      <li>or however you want to dry and enjoy pampering yourself!</li>
      <li>I have short hair and it dries very quickly.  </li>
      <li>You have to hold the dryer in a certain position</li>
      <li>Works great, but its a little big for my head</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see how it could fit over rollers, as I just deep conditioned my hair in a bun with this</li>
      <li>It probably wouldn&#x27;t fit hand-held dryers.</li>
      <li>to really look for hair dryer with smallest nozzle&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
      <li>It really worked.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very jelly.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t overly loud or too hot.</li>
      <li>I recommend using your dryer on a low, cool setting.</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be fast as even most hair dryers at the salon take a little while.</li>
      <li>If I had used more rollers with less hair in each roller</li>
      <li>The only thing to be aware of with this is that it will get hot along the hairline depending on what setting you have your blowdryer on.</li>
      <li>I did not try it on the high setting.</li>
      <li>I am using it on my portable hair dryer ( not blow dryer)- working very well so far.</li>
      <li>BUT I think its worth it especially for travel &amp; space saver</li>
      <li>I did adjust the bonnet a couple of times after I started but the first time can&#x27;t really count as when I put it on the first time I did not think about the drawstring ends hanging down in front of my face</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit over bigger curlers, doesn&#x27;t stay on head, the drawstring is in your face, and will burn the back of your neck...</li>
      <li>I just used tis product for the first time last weekend.</li>
      <li>It does get hot on the back of the neck and around the ears.</li>
      <li>I carry it on the road , only have it for a few days but so far works well with blow dryer, only issue is staying on my head when blown up by dryer, keep coming off my head, the heat circulates throughout the cap very well and gets very hot, and its easy to manage.</li>
      <li>and she use it to blow dry my hair and its a better then blow dry</li>
      <li>With only a drawstring to hold the dryer on your head against the resistance of the air flow, you either have to cinch it so tightly that loss of blood flow is a legitimate concern, OR  (and this is a particular favorite of mine) rig</li>
      <li>It works fine even though it&#x27;s a little flimsy, but does what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I only have a high and low and only the one heat setting on my blow dryer with a button for cool air and the low was just right.</li>
      <li>I had such visions of getting ready efficiency.  </li>
      <li>However, when your blow dryer is on high (or even low for that matter), the product tends to lift off of your head.</li>
      <li>would also recommend you use a cheap plastic hair cap or a plastic bag if you&#x27;re lazy</li>
      <li>This product is not bad if you are only drying your hair for less than one hour...because you have to keep balancing it on your head.</li>
      <li>, however is was hard to fit over my blow dryer.</li>
      <li>the only drawback is that the elastic opening doesn&#x27;t fit all blow dryers, it&#x27;s rather small.</li>
      <li>I have 3b/c naturally curly, very fragile hair that needs LOTS of moisture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used once so far</li>
      <li>If tied too tightly, the heat is unbearable in certain spots.</li>
      <li>Noticed that it was dryer on on side more than the other but not a lot of difference, switched the bonnet to the other side (gather around my other ear) and 20 minutes later my hair was dry.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s usable but when it&#x27;s on it keeps slipping off my head.  </li>
<li> Was what i expected.  </li>
<li> Only to find that you still have to blow dry your hair like usual because its still wet.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The idea is so much better than the reality.  I had such visions of getting ready efficiency.  I could jump out of the shower, pop this dryer on and do my make up simultaneously.  Uh no.  Turns out - heads are round. With only a drawstring to hold the dryer on your head against the resistance of the air flow, you either have to cinch it so tightly that loss of blood flow is a legitimate concern, OR  (and this is a particular favorite of mine) rig the extra cord around your head creating a chin strap.  Only to find that you still have to blow dry your hair like usual because its still wet.  This is a pass.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used once so far but....This works surprisingly well. After reading the reviews I was expecting to have to modify it to keep it on my head but was happy to find out I didn&#x27;t have to do anything. It is a bit of a struggle to get the elastic to go around the end of the blow dryer but isn&#x27;t that a good thing so that it stays on and doesn&#x27;t get blown off? It does take a while for your hair to dry but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be fast as even most hair dryers at the salon take a little while. It took about 1 1/2 hrs for my hair to dry. I used a combo of ex-lg rollers to 1&amp;#34; rollers. If I had used more rollers with less hair in each roller I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t have taken as long. It stayed on and all I did was tighten the drawstring and tuck it around the all the rollers, leaving my ears out of the bonnet. It wasn&#x27;t overly loud or too hot. I only have a high and low and only the one heat setting on my blow dryer with a button for cool air and the low was just right. I did not try it on the high setting. Not too hot at all. There was some air that seeped out mostly around where the drawstring gathers but not enough to bother me. The bonnet fit over all the rollers fine. Not a lot of room to spare but I didn&#x27;t have to struggle to get it on. I did adjust the bonnet a couple of times after I started but the first time can&#x27;t really count as when I put it on the first time I did not think about the drawstring ends hanging down in front of my face (LOL). I rotated the bonnet to where the drawstring was close to my ear and was good. I checked for dryness after 1 hour (I set an alarm) I got a drink while my hair cooled so I could check the dryness. Noticed that it was dryer on on side more than the other but not a lot of difference, switched the bonnet to the other side (gather around my other ear) and 20 minutes later my hair was dry. This is not a product to use if you are in a hurry but if you have a couple of hours it works well. Especially for the price!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s usable but when it&#x27;s on it keeps slipping off my head.  It&#x27;s probably worth the $10 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Was not aware that this was coming from China, I was in need of the product I purchased before Christmas.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and works great with a hand-held hair dryer to allow hands-free reading/writing.</li>
    <li> The Aisilk Safety Portable Hair dryer works well, however is was hard to fit over my blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Does just I wanted it do, great buy</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have a full hair dryer and need one, perhaps want to save money, this will do the trick!  It works well.  Keep your blow-dryer on low heat.  Put the bonnet on your head with rollers on or however you want to dry and enjoy pampering yourself!</li>
    <li> I like this product and it allows me to move around within the bathroom to do my toenails or make up.</li>
    <li> No lo he recibido desde el 12 de nov. 2013 que lo ordene. :( i didnt get my my hair dryer. Help</li>
    <li> love it works great and I will use it often it is like a hood hairdryer but compact happy I bought it</li>
    <li> I have long hair and sometimes use curlers. My Krupps dryer of 30 years is starting to sputter so I needed to find something else to replace it before it died. The bonnet hose is fairly small so I had to carry it with me when looking for a hand held dryer. Found one and the two together meet my needs.</li>
    <li> I have 3b/c naturally curly, very fragile hair that needs LOTS of moisture. This cap works great for at home hair treatments. You will look like a space cadet while wearing it, but it evenly distributes the heat well, is easy to use, big enough for very large rollers, and stores/compacts easily. The only thing to be aware of with this is that it will get hot along the hairline depending on what setting you have your blowdryer on. To fix this, I simply put a terrycloth headband on. It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m very happy to have it in my &amp;#34;arsenal&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Works well...the only drawback is that the elastic opening doesn&#x27;t fit all blow dryers, it&#x27;s rather small.</li>
    <li> I am using it on my portable hair dryer ( not blow dryer)- working very well so far. Very good price</li>
    <li> My wife loves it so &amp; it makes her hair really straight so, if she happy im happy &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;thank u</li>
    <li> I love this item it makes transporting a hair dryer easier and faster to destination.i wanrt to buy more items</li>
    <li> Love it.  Very well designed and works fantastic.</li>
    <li> Works great, but its a little big for my head</li>
    <li> it&#x27;ll fly off your head you&#x27;ll just need to hold it down.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and it dries very quickly.  I can pack it up and travel with it.  I am going to buy another one.</li>
    <li> a friend a mine did my hair and she use it to blow dry my hair and its a better then blow dry the do it by hand so yeah its alot better</li>
    <li> I like that I carry it on the road , only have it for a few days but so far works well with blow dryer, only issue is staying on my head when blown up by dryer, keep coming off my head, the heat circulates throughout the cap very well and gets very hot, and its easy to manage. Overall, I like it and would buy it again, great buy for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veronica</li>
    <li> Works beautifully when connected to blow-dryer, very reasonably-priced &amp; delivered just 2 days later-excellent experience.</li>
    <li> Melted the mouth of my hair dryer.</li>
    <li> very pleased with it and it works great&lt;br /&gt;Had to really look for hair dryer with smallest nozzle&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten much use out of this because I was hoping to use it when I have curlers in... but it won&#x27;t fit over them :(</li>
    <li> Great product used to have one similar years ago. Worked great!!</li>
    <li> You have to hold the dryer in a certain position LOL WHICH CAN BE ANNOYING BUT I think its worth it especially for travel &amp; space saver</li>
    <li> The product is a cost efficient way to have a head bonnet hair dryer, without the cost.  It does get hot on the back of the neck and around the ears. I just it is because of the placing of the holes. I recommend using your dryer on a low, cool setting. It will take longer to dry, but you will save your neck and ears from the heat.</li>
    <li> Does not stay on head once you turn on blowdryer.</li>
    <li> It works great!  I have attached it to an antique hair dryer -  hands free even.  I bought one for a friend also.</li>
    <li> It has a long hose and a tight opening. It probably wouldn&#x27;t fit hand-held dryers. That said, it works for me.</li>
    <li> Even though I look like an alien with this on and dries my hair wonderfully  and covers all my rollers with no issues.</li>
    <li> I am fully upset that I spent money on this, I wish I could give it less stars!  Halfway through using it the first time I noticed air was not blowing through. The stitching ripped from the air flow! Terrible.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit over bigger curlers, doesn&#x27;t stay on head, the drawstring is in your face, and will burn the back of your neck...bought another one from a different company and hopefully it works! not recommended...</li>
    <li> Does an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; job of drying for the price paid. Hard to keep tied to my head. If tied too tightly, the heat is unbearable in certain spots. Would have been better to order the hard-shell hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Was what i expected.  Use in assisted living, good with dryer but to puffy for use with bed bound clients.</li>
    <li> It definitely gets the job done. However, when your blow dryer is on high (or even low for that matter), the product tends to lift off of your head. An easy fix it just to hold it down with your free hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend you use a cheap plastic hair cap or a plastic bag if you&#x27;re lazy so the product itself doesn&#x27;t get wet</li>
    <li> Waste of money, does not stay on your head</li>
    <li> I got one of these for myself but my mother in law liked it so much she wanted one also. I ordered her one and she is so happy with it. The package came on time and works well but the description said that it would be gray like mine but it&#x27;s pink. I&#x27;m very jelly. Still 4 stars from me.</li>
    <li> meh.  Great idea.  The end of the hose is very small and hard to get over the nozzle of the hair dryer.  I think I am not the right consumer for this product.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product for the price. Shipping took too long, because it came from overseas. I guess I didn&#x27;t read the fine print. This product is not bad if you are only drying your hair for less than one hour...because you have to keep balancing it on your head. The drawstring on the hood does not keep the hood secure on your head. I had another and it had elastic around it and it lasted for many years. If you just needed something to semi-dry your hair this will do it. I will us again.</li>
    <li> Will recommend family and friends.</li>
    <li> It works fine even though it&#x27;s a little flimsy, but does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  It is a tight squeeze over my tiny head with gigantic velcro rollers (primarily blue and purple).</li>
    <li> too small for my rollers.</li>
    <li> Hose does not stay on dryer nozzle even on medium setting.</li>
    <li> I just used tis product for the first time last weekend. It works great.</li>
    <li> The elastic is VERY tight, it took me awhile to get this on my blow dryer. I don&#x27;t see how it could fit over rollers, as I just deep conditioned my hair in a bun with this and it was a bit of a struggle. HOWEVER - I could tell a difference in how my hair felt. I&#x27;m not sure if I would use this for any other purpose than deep conditioning/hot oil treatments though.</li>
    <li> It really worked. Great product.</li>
