### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>best after shave balm I have ever used.</li>
      <li>One of the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>This is a very good product.</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel great after a close shave.</li>
      <li>Has a great scent as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been great</li>
      <li>Amazing results!</li>
      <li>and I honestly feel like I got a great deal on it after it&#x27;s usage and effectiveness.</li>
      <li>it is a perfect fit for a gym locker.  </li>
      <li>On one hand I want to give this 5 stars because it has brought good results after shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works well, very refreshing and soothing.  </li>
      <li>I want to give this 3 stars because it has a kind of sticky residue and a smell kind of like maple</li>
      <li>It is pretty good but the smell on its own is not that great</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is great, but not bad.</li>
      <li>but it is not even close to my two favorite aftershaves (#1 Acqua Di Parma and #2 The Grooming Lounge.)</li>
      <li>Love using this product.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure some people would love it.</li>
      <li>Excellent after shave balm - soothes freshens up the skin, and a pea-sized drop is enough for the whole face.</li>
      <li>instead it is a light, soothing, fresh light moisturizer....</li>
      <li>I tried this stuff using a pea-sized amount, and it completely prevented razor burn or any kind of ingrown hairs or anything.</li>
      <li>Kyoku men&#x27;s products are so good, my beautician has replaced all my facial products with the Kyoku line.</li>
      <li>I have really been happy with the Koyoku line and have used several of their products.  </li>
      <li>it actually works better than many for relieving the burn after shaving, but I can&#x27;t get used to the scent.  </li>
      <li>I can understand why some people feel the way the do regarding the size of the product; but this stuff is potent and highly liquid.  </li>
      <li>The smokey saki scent is very masculine and lingers for most the day.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, yet it&#x27;s just enough to be pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Great product for those with heavy beards and razor burn</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin so most products cause a breakout...never a problem with any Kyoku products.</li>
      <li>Therefore, it gets four stars because it really does bring a good result, but is not something that I would want to smell like all day, much less have a sticky feeling on my face all day.</li>
      <li>Has a light sting on minor cuts, but it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at sealing up small bleeders.  </li>
      <li>If you use it sparingly, it does a good job and lasts long enough so that you do not feel as if you way overpaid.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate after I haven&#x27;t shaved for a coulee of daYS.</li>
      <li>I would really like to give this a four star</li>
      <li>I enjoy the Kyoku face products and use the daily face cleanser and the face scrub.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soothing when you apply it.  </li>
      <li>Its very distinctive</li>
      <li>Nothing really to say.</li>
      <li>If it were reasonably priced, I would recommend the product.  </li>
      <li>My new favourite!</li>
      <li>There are better aftershave balms around at half the price.</li>
      <li>Actually, I have gotten better results from a $6 bottle of Nivea bought at my local CVS.</li>
      <li>Extremely subtle scent, very light, and simply feels right.&lt;br /&gt;Seems very natural, without all the toxins most products have these days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This is a high quality product with a high price tag.</li>
      <li>I like using this at the gym because it is smaller than the other one I use the most</li>
      <li>True - not much.  </li>
      <li>lemony...and clean without a heavy feel...and WORKS to stop razor</li>
      <li>This one is hard to judge, it&#x27;s a little sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell particularly good</li>
      <li>the US, where products are generally a bit coarser.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll only use it if I happen to shave at night before an early start because of the walnut like fragrance.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have really been happy with the Koyoku line and have used several of their products.  This one is hard to judge, it&#x27;s a little sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell particularly good although I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells bad.  I&#x27;ll only use it if I happen to shave at night before an early start because of the walnut like fragrance.  I suppose it works as intended but I don&#x27;t see any benefit over a Nivea or Dove product.</li>
    <li> Nothing really to say. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost three weeks and have seen no results. Actually, I have gotten better results from a $6 bottle of Nivea bought at my local CVS.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders.  I can understand why some people feel the way the do regarding the size of the product; but this stuff is potent and highly liquid.  It&#x27;s been great and I honestly feel like I got a great deal on it after it&#x27;s usage and effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the Kyoku face products and use the daily face cleanser and the face scrub.  My wife bought me the Kyoku shave creme, so I decided to try the Shave Balm.  I like the balm, but it is EXPENSIVE.  If it were reasonably priced, I would recommend the product.  At the current price, I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product.  There are better aftershave balms around at half the price.</li>
    <li> Great product for those with heavy beards and razor burn</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had an issue with razor burn after shaving.  Aftershave helps, but doesn&#x27;t cure it.  I tried this stuff using a pea-sized amount, and it completely prevented razor burn or any kind of ingrown hairs or anything. It&#x27;s very soothing when you apply it.  Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, yet it&#x27;s just enough to be pleasant.  100% recommended! I will never stop using this product!  It&#x27;s miraculous!</li>
    <li> I used to get terrible razor burn after I shaved. I used to use a Nivea for Men Aftershave Balm for Sensitive Skin, but I like the other Kyoku products and decided to try this out...Amazing results! I would recommend Kyoku products to everyone</li>
    <li> it actually works better than many for relieving the burn after shaving, but I can&#x27;t get used to the scent.  Its very distinctive so I&#x27;m sure some people would love it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It works well with any shaved surface. I really appreciate after I haven&#x27;t shaved for a coulee of daYS.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product with a high price tag. If you use it sparingly, it does a good job and lasts long enough so that you do not feel as if you way overpaid.</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself.  It&#x27;s basically a tube of witch hazel and a thin, light moisturizer.  The smell of the witch hazel lingers with me for hours afterward, which I don&#x27;t like.  Has a light sting on minor cuts, but it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at sealing up small bleeders.  I still prefer either The Gentlemens Refinery &amp;#34;The Standard,&amp;#34; or Kiehl&#x27;s &amp;#34;Ultimate Men&#x27;s After Shave Balm.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works well, very refreshing and soothing.  One of the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Love using this product. Extremely subtle scent, very light, and simply feels right.&lt;br /&gt;Seems very natural, without all the toxins most products have these days.&lt;br /&gt;A refined Japanese sensibility must have dreamt this one up. Couldn&#x27;t see it made&lt;br /&gt;in the US, where products are generally a bit coarser.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when I bought the kyoku shave cream.  I was expecting a bigger bottle.  The after shave works as stated but, it has a slightly unpleasent smell.  I don&#x27;t think it works as well as some of the other after shave balms I have tried.  After I use this product up I will be going back to my art of shaving after shave lotion.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel great after a close shave. Has a great scent as well.</li>
    <li> I found it to be too thick and has a drying effect.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Kyoku men&#x27;s products are so good, my beautician has replaced all my facial products with the Kyoku line. I have sensitive skin so most products cause a breakout...never a problem with any Kyoku products. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> On one hand I want to give this 5 stars because it has brought good results after shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand I want to give this 3 stars because it has a kind of sticky residue and a smell kind of like maple syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it does what i had hoped for a repair balm to do, but doesn&#x27;t feel or smell how I would have hoped.  Therefore, it gets four stars because it really does bring a good result, but is not something that I would want to smell like all day, much less have a sticky feeling on my face all day.</li>
    <li> best after shave balm I have ever used. However, I just started to use an alum block for after shaving and the two don&#x27;t mix well</li>
    <li> Excellent after shave balm - soothes freshens up the skin, and a pea-sized drop is enough for the whole face. The smokey saki scent is very masculine and lingers for most the day. My new favourite!</li>
    <li> Other reviews have complained about how little product is in this container.  True - not much.  But if you spread it out pretty thin, you don&#x27;t need as much as other products I&#x27;ve used.  It doesn&#x27;t burn.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it is great, but not bad.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a very fluid almost alcohol based mix.....instead it is a light, soothing, fresh light moisturizer....lemony...and clean without a heavy feel...and WORKS to stop razor burn redness...Will keep this around as long as it is made.</li>
    <li> I like using this at the gym because it is smaller than the other one I use the most but since that is in a glass bottle and this is plastic and much smaller it is a perfect fit for a gym locker.  It is pretty good but the smell on its own is not that great however it seems to go with the Cologne I use.  If you don&#x27;t use cologne the smell does not last long.  I would really like to give this a four star but it is not even close to my two favorite aftershaves (#1 Acqua Di Parma and #2 The Grooming Lounge.)</li>
