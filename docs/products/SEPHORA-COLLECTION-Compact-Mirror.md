      <li>Very light weight and seems to be constructed well.</li>
      <li>The close up mirror could have had more magnifying power (i guess its just 2x), but it&#x27;s still fine and one can make the difference between the two mirrors that it reveals!</li>

      <li>To Be Able To Use.</li>
      <li>Othewise - ok product</li>
      <li>Great mirror nice and big love it</li>
      <li>Easy to use, slim  case.  </li>
      <li>If you press your nail into this recessed area, the mirror opens easily.</li>
      <li>Slides easily into my purse.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfect size for me when I don&#x27;t have wall mirror or just want to do my makeup sitting down on my bed.</li>
      <li>slim, black in color and very attractive..</li>
      <li>It has a magnifying mirror on one side and a regular mirror, which is a great feature.  </li>
      <li>After about 17 months of light usage where I kept it in my desk draw, one of the mirrors separated from the plastic frame.  </li>
      <li>Great for my travel needs, as well as daily use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size purse/pocket mirror but agree it takes real effort to open it.</li>
      <li>(you know, make sure lipstick is applied right, no broccoli stuck teeth, etc.).</li>
      <li>The only problem I had with it was that under bright light I can see a lot of scratches.</li>
      <li>What good is a mirror that you can&#x27;t open?  </li>
      <li>Quick service and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>It looks pretty manly if you cover the Sephora name in electrical tape!</li>
      <li>This mirror will be so handy and especially when traveling to touch up makeup with the magnifying side.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think is worth $9.</li>
      <li>Able to sit on a flat surface and position without the need to prop it against something  Good quality mirror over all (both the regular and magnified)    </li>
      <li>It came pretty quickly, about 2 days after I ordered it.</li>
      <li>Now I have to see if I can find the right glue to try and repair.  </li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t mess with tiny cheaply made mirrors because this one is awesome and only cheap in price.</li>
      <li>It was larger than I thought it would be, but that was okay.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the rather non super girly and classic look of this mirror, but was bummed when I finally got it.</li>
      <li>The rectangular shape over the round is better to work with  Perfect thin design for purses -</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t want to dig around for a tiny, easy to lose, item from Office Max in my purse</li>
      <li>Great, simple little compact mirror.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprise at how much use</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those perfectionists and just knowing that those scratches were there really annoy me</li>
      <li>Good mirror, bit larger than i expected,</li>
      <li>Very convenient, and much better than the flat metal types, since there&#x27;s no sharp edge and not prone to bending.  </li>
      <li>This is just the right size to fit conveniently in my purse and I love the fact that there are two mirrors - one plain and the other magnifying.</li>
      <li>I will be trying to super glue it back together.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice but a lot smaller than i expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;Picture is deceiving</li>
      <li>I got out of this thing I love the mirror big and compact enough for me.</li>
      <li>How about especially in those quick no-time-to-mess-around moments where you only need a quick glance</li>
      <li>The color is light blue not black.</li>
      <li>The top and bottom close tightly together.  </li>
      <li>but men need high quality portable mirrors too.</li>
      <li>Very functional, fits easily into any space, has two mirrors of which one has a a slight magnification.  </li>
      <li>In short, if i ever need it again - i will definitely buy this again in future, and from this seller in particular! :)</li>
      <li>love the double mirror style and shape that enables me to look at hard to look places with a full view.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very simple and basic in style which suits me fine.</li>
      <li>even small purses too  Has a sophisticated look -- not too foofey/</li>
      <li>I am giving this one 5 stars because its been very useful in getting make up on, and plucking eyebrows, for those girls that get ready without their glasses on its nice to have the mirror a closer, but like a lot of other reviews said it is very hard to open with one hand.</li>
      <li>Fits comfortably in my hand and yet is wide enough to clearly apply my makeup.</li>
      <li>Great compact and is NOT that difficult to open.</li>
      <li>The case cover does not protect the glass mirrors very well as if it is in your pocket, don&#x27;t lean against anything because the glass mirror will cracked, Mine did in several places.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s exactly as it appears.</li>
      <li>I really like the compact mirror itself because I wanted one that was double sided and entirely black in color, something simple.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was nice and very handy</li>
    <li> Sleek and stylish.  love the double mirror style and shape that enables me to look at hard to look places with a full view. My favorite to-go mirror. It is sleek enough to put in my skinny jean pockets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man who knows nothing about makeup but men need high quality portable mirrors too. This one is excellent and my wife knew the Sephora name right away. So don&#x27;t mess with tiny cheaply made mirrors because this one is awesome and only cheap in price.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for a friend who had been looking for a small mirror.  She loves it.  It was larger than I thought it would be, but that was okay. It has a magnifying mirror on one side and a regular mirror, which is a great feature.  Now I wish I had ordered one for myself :).</li>
    <li> I can see why some folks complain about how the case has to be opened.  The top and bottom close tightly together.  There is a small indent that you have to slip your nail into in order to open the case.  After about 17 months of light usage where I kept it in my desk draw, one of the mirrors separated from the plastic frame.  There is something wrong with the glue that they used to glue the mirror to the plastic.  Now I have to see if I can find the right glue to try and repair.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to keep in my makeup bag which I use at home and when I travel for work. It&#x27;s a perfect size for me when I don&#x27;t have wall mirror or just want to do my makeup sitting down on my bed. Fits comfortably in my hand and yet is wide enough to clearly apply my makeup. It&#x27;s very simple and basic in style which suits me fine. The only negative thing about it is that I find it a little difficult to open at times - it needs to be pried open with my fingernail because it doesn&#x27;t simply pop open. Other than that, it&#x27;s exactly as it appears.</li>
    <li> It is sturdy, perhaps too sturdy given that I have to pry a bit to get it open.  It does what it needs to do, and perhaps this one is more difficult to open due to small differences in the plastic hinge construction.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. I just wish it were bigger.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but a lot smaller than i expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;Picture is deceiving</li>
    <li> Nice mirror. It was a little smaller than I thought but I should have checked the measurements. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is just the right size to fit conveniently in my purse and I love the fact that there are two mirrors - one plain and the other magnifying. This mirror will be so handy and especially when traveling to touch up makeup with the magnifying side. Very light weight and seems to be constructed well.</li>
    <li> I wanted a pocket mirror for my desk at work that was simple and unobtrusive. I was pleased with the rather non super girly and classic look of this mirror, but was bummed when I finally got it. It&#x27;s simply hard to open. I have to use my fingernails sometimes which is painful--and even then it still won&#x27;t open on the first few tries. They should have made the \\&quot;latch\\&quot; area larger, and not as tight. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister and niece and they are happy with this stylish and functional mirror. I like the slim design.</li>
    <li> Hard to open. Othewise - ok product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s large enough yet small enough (you know what I mean)! This is the third time I&#x27;ve got this same mirror. I think you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> Very convenient, and much better than the flat metal types, since there&#x27;s no sharp edge and not prone to bending.  The case keeps it from scratching inside a drawer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size purse/pocket mirror but agree it takes real effort to open it. I carry it in my make up bag but I find that I reach for my compact mirror instead because it&#x27;s easier to use.</li>
    <li> The case cover does not protect the glass mirrors very well as if it is in your pocket, don&#x27;t lean against anything because the glass mirror will cracked, Mine did in several places.</li>
    <li> I got this today and I am soo happy with my purchase! The size of the mirror is perfect as well! Great for my travel needs, as well as daily use. Slides easily into my purse. The close up mirror could have had more magnifying power (i guess its just 2x), but it&#x27;s still fine and one can make the difference between the two mirrors that it reveals! Its stylish and I love the matte finish on the top surface! In short, if i ever need it again - i will definitely buy this again in future, and from this seller in particular! :)</li>
    <li> Easy to use, slim  case.  Fits easily into purse!</li>
    <li> This mirror is the perfect size for fitting into a purse (including wristlets!) but I was disappointed when the mirror on mine reattached from the outer shell within a week or two of light use. I will be trying to super glue it back together.</li>
    <li> It came pretty quickly, about 2 days after I ordered it. I really like the compact mirror itself because I wanted one that was double sided and entirely black in color, something simple. I tried finding one at the malls but all of them were the kind with makeup in it so this was perfect. The only problem I had with it was that under bright light I can see a lot of scratches. I&#x27;m one of those perfectionists and just knowing that those scratches were there really annoy me but...oh well. It&#x27;s still a pretty great mirror.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t Even Open. Take about 2min For Me To Be Able To Use. By That Time I Could Be In The Bathroom Looking At The Mirror.</li>
    <li> The color is light blue not black. But I guess its okay. But I don&#x27;t think is worth $9.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprise at how much use I got out of this thing I love the mirror big and compact enough for me. Lovveeee itttt</li>
    <li> Best compact mirror ever. It&#x27;s slim and the perfect size to fit easily in your bag/purse. Has two sides with different magnifying qualities but it is so PERFECT</li>
    <li> What a great price for the compact mirror. Has dual mirrors inside, one for a super close up and the size is perfect for my purse.</li>
    <li> Pros:  The rectangular shape over the round is better to work with  Perfect thin design for purses - even small purses too  Has a sophisticated look -- not too foofey/girly  Able to sit on a flat surface and position without the need to prop it against something  Good quality mirror over all (both the regular and magnified)    Con:  *IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN WITH YOUR BARE HANDS!*    It opens only with the assistance of a tool -- like a paper clip. So that just sucks.  I really don&#x27;t want to dig around for a tiny, easy to lose, item from Office Max in my purse every single time access to this mirror is necessary.  How about especially in those quick no-time-to-mess-around moments where you only need a quick glance (you know, make sure lipstick is applied right, no broccoli stuck teeth, etc.).</li>
    <li> Very functional, fits easily into any space, has two mirrors of which one has a a slight magnification.  The mirror cover has a recessed area under the latch. If you press your nail into this recessed area, the mirror opens easily. The lines of the mirror are clean &amp; attractive.</li>
    <li> What good is a mirror that you can&#x27;t open?  I&#x27;ve broken 2 nails trying to get this thing to function properly.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the way the seller stored it, possibly creating a suction effect, or if the latch is just defective.  What a disappointment.  I&#x27;ll be returning it,</li>
    <li> similar to other reviews, was unable to open. gave up after a couple of minutes and sent it back. perhaps i&#x27;ve just been lucky, but firmly believe compact mirrors should require very little effort to open.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS BROKEN WHEN I RECEIVED&amp;#62; SO unprofessional. No follow up from them either</li>
    <li> I am giving this one 5 stars because its been very useful in getting make up on, and plucking eyebrows, for those girls that get ready without their glasses on its nice to have the mirror a closer, but like a lot of other reviews said it is very hard to open with one hand. I combat this by trying not to close it all the way.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 of these as gifts. Both mirrors were smashed. Haven&#x27;t heard from the company yet. I also would agree with some other customers that the compact isn&#x27;t the easiest thing in the world to open. Too bad because the design is sleek and elegant.</li>
    <li> Keep this little fellow in my bag just in case I need it and it&#x27;s great. It stays closed and is durable.</li>
    <li> Works great, love it!</li>
    <li> Great mirror nice and big love it</li>
    <li> Quick service and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Love this mirror! Although I Purchased it for my daughter..I find myself&lt;br /&gt;going in her room to borrow it all the time..I think it&#x27;s time to purchase one for myself! :)&lt;br /&gt;Its slim, black in color and very attractive..goes well with any purse you carry.</li>
    <li> Great, simple little compact mirror.  I bought this for my soldier husband to help him shave while away field training.  It looks pretty manly if you cover the Sephora name in electrical tape!</li>
    <li> There were knicks in the mirror and scratches on the case when I received it.</li>
    <li> Good mirror, bit larger than i expected, but i did not pay attention to the item description. I like it.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a week and I was actually very pleased that it worked as advertised. But then I opened it and the mirror fell out to the ground and shattered. So if you need to purchase a product that will give you maybe a fifteen minute life span than this is your product. I cannot reommend.</li>
    <li> Great compact and is NOT that difficult to open.</li>
    <li> Love this compact mirror! I had one for years and it broke. I found it on amazon! The size is a little bit smaller, which is disappointing but still like a lot. Perfect for travel, at work, on metro, etc.</li>
