      <li>Awesome sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I like all products of La roche, and this one is very good for my skin.</li>
      <li>This is the best suncreen on the market and the protection factors are great.</li>

      <li>Great sunscreen</li>
      <li>Great for PMLE.  </li>
      <li>This does a great job of blocking the sun and stopping bumps from forming.</li>
      <li>Your best bet for SAFE sunscreen</li>
      <li>the best, most effective sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I loved it</li>
      <li>Good stuff</li>
      <li>It has good UVA and UVB protection which is the reason that it was physician recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it hasn&#x27;t been good to me.</li>
      <li>I recommend this for fair skin.</li>
      <li>No doubt this is a good product to protect against the sun</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned</li>
      <li>Except on the top of my foot where I didn&#x27;t apply this lovely, wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>Best sunscreen for anyone with PMLE or photosensitivity, it really protects!!</li>
      <li>A great product, better than the nationally known brands you can buy everywhere.  </li>
      <li>While the product took quite awhile to arrive - we have been very pleased with it and will definately be a return costumer.</li>
      <li>I was able to apply some face powder over the sunblock and it look like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any sunblock at all, which was great.  </li>
      <li>so this is amazing for me.  </li>
      <li>I also use the ultra light sunscreen and it is great.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this product and does a great job.</li>
      <li>supposedly many sunscreens do not offer good protection against longer wavelength UVA rays, which contribute to PMLE eruptions, but the Mexoryl ingredient in this seems to have a broader spectrum of protection.</li>
      <li>Fair skinned here and the sun is not my friend - however, love the beach,etc. -</li>
      <li>Since I play tennis, bicycle, walk, and garden, I need a product that will be effective.  </li>
      <li>Superior skin protection, easy to apply, and stays put on your face.</li>
      <li>I liked the Neutrogena with helioplex better.  </li>
      <li>sunscreen is protecting my skin from the sun very well, and it&#x27;s a perfect fit for me.</li>
      <li>My husband and I are avid golfers and love this product!!</li>
      <li>If I was in the sun for more then a day or two, I&#x27;d get itchy bumps all over my hands, arms and feet.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure negating the SPF 40 rating.</li>
      <li>I switched to Keys brand zinc sunscreen and love it.</li>
      <li>I also tried applying mineral makeup on top of this to reduce the white-out look, but the camouflage does not work too well.   </li>
      <li>Burnout ,which has zinc oxide, works better for me.</li>
      <li>which by the way I have many times).</li>
      <li>more seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Until now I have mostly been an indoors person who used sunscreen when I knew I was going to get a lot of sun exposure.</li>
      <li>I say \\&quot;not terribly harmful\\&quot; because sunscreens that have chemical ingredients are always going to be noted as having components that may produce an allergic reactions.</li>
      <li>I love the sun</li>
      <li>But it is the best and longest lasting protection from the sun.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it because it is the most effective sunscreen available for purchase in the US.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad we have it in the US.</li>
      <li>I feel safe wearing La Roche-Posay products.</li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen because stays on and blocks the sun.</li>
      <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>I am willing to put up with a lot for a good sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product since I&#x27;d heard and read so many good things about it online.</li>
      <li>I blend in well on top of moisturizer and find it looks fine on me.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen is good for people with sensitive skin (as are most/all La Roche-Posay products) and it&#x27;s considered to have fewer harmful chemicals than most sunscreens, so it&#x27;s good for the whole family!</li>
      <li>I can buy something just as good at the&lt;br /&gt;Walgreens and not as much money</li>
      <li>I was most worried about how my makeup would sit on top, but luckily it looks just fine.</li>
      <li>It glides on easily and absorbs well.  </li>
      <li>**:  When you can no longer easily get the product out of the tip of the tube, cut off the bottom and get the rest.  </li>
      <li>Both are supposed to provide strong uva protection.  </li>
      <li>other wise it&#x27;s a good sunscreen</li>
      <li>It has a white creamy texture but blends beautifully with my foundation (which I opt for a shade darker than my skin).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t mind looking like a mime.</li>
      <li>This turned out to be a smaller tube than anticipated, but great pocket book size.</li>
      <li>I then tested all the spf products available over the counter.  </li>
      <li>Terrific product and great seller.</li>
      <li>I had been using Ombrelle from Canada but saw that this was locally available.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this product--thanks for making it available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>For a research paper discussing this, search &amp;#34;Prevention of Polymorphous Light Eruption and Solar Urticaria by R. Bissonnette, MSc, MD,</li>
      <li>This results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination.</li>
      <li>Free radicals are known to induce indirect DNA DAMAGE and an increased concentration of free radicals might have contributed to the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-users.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen definitely does a great job of protecting your skin.</li>
      <li>polymorphic light eruption.  </li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It is light, fragrance free and has a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; feel.</li>
      <li>Not a bargain, but this is a very good sunscreen, with the right ingredients to actually protect from sun damage, and my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
      <li>But the most important factor for me is -- it really works!  </li>
      <li>&amp; I probably was better with a higher SPF.  </li>
      <li>The older formulations for the face were very good with no white residue at all.</li>
      <li>(one day was a 3 hour bike ride which almost entirely in the bright sunshine).  </li>
      <li>I really liked the coverage of this product, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well at all, so you kind of get that white, vampire-face look.</li>
      <li>I wanted a sunscreen with powerful UVA protection and this seemed to fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>This one is thick and isnt the best if you have acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>However, this product costs too much for me to not be completely in love with</li>
      <li>I work outside all day and was impressed with the actual quality of the product and effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Also, I put a light moisturizer on first, and then let it absorb.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found this product and will keep using it, none of the other sunscreens I have used compare in protection!</li>
      <li>I rubbed it in unsuccessfully but because it gets humid where I live, the sweat forming on my skin made the look of the film a bit better.</li>
      <li>I wanted so much to like this sunscreen as I had heard many positive things about it from online reviews.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Another active ingredient, avobenzone, easily penetrates the skin and is a strong free radical generator as well.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product when watching a special with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on CNN and it really does the trick.</li>
      <li>great, better then SPF 100 Aveeno and various other high SPF brands</li>
      <li>I am very fair (red head), do not tan, have adult acne and rosacea, and so wear SPF 30 daily.  </li>
      <li>I am not a doctor, so I can&#x27;t exactly comment on its effectiveness -</li>
      <li>34;BASF sunscreen simulator&amp;#34;)--</li>
      <li>I had read that this sunscreen was good for people with my condition (apparently because it blocks both UVA and UVB rays), so I bought it to use for my last two beach trips.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I enjoy using this product and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen but it is pricey.</li>
    <li> There is skin cancer in the family so I use a formula with Mexoryl. I had been using Ombrelle from Canada but saw that this was locally available. Before switching I did a search and found Consumer Reports stated that the sunscreen was the most expensive, it performed less well than several brands at 1/10 the cost.     I will stick with Ombrelle, were I have found positive reviews (though not from Consumer Reports - none so far).</li>
    <li> I like all products of La roche, and this one is very good for my skin. I was looking for sunscreen with not only UVB (like most sunscreens) but also UVA protection. In addition, this cream doesn&#x27;t contain oxibenzone I have an allergy to.</li>
    <li> Too expensive to buy again.  I can buy something just as good at the&lt;br /&gt;Walgreens and not as much money</li>
    <li> The other reviewers are too kind. This product leaves your face with a greasy white look. Virtually unusable on the face. I recommend the SPF 15 product which had none of this effect. Must be too much titanium dioxide.     Overall: Unless you want to look like a Geisha, skip this product on your face. For how much it costs, it shouldn&#x27;t be this dreadful.</li>
    <li> I always wear sunscreen under makeup or alone.This one is thick and isnt the best if you have acne prone skin.It doesnt cause my skin to break out any worse but it also doesnt help when breaking out.</li>
    <li> I had tried the Anthelios daily moisturizer with SPF 15 and while it was pretty much the only product on the market that didn&#x27;t make my rosacea flare up and cause me to break out, it was so oily/greasy that I felt gross wearing it!  Not to mention, it was only SPF 15.      The Anthelios 40 Sunscreen Cream product description said it was not greasy, so I gave it a try and it&#x27;s perfect!  Very thick and prone to leaving you white if you don&#x27;t get it rubbed in well, but at least for me, it helped cover up my red patches from the rosacea.  I was able to apply some face powder over the sunblock and it look like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any sunblock at all, which was great.  It lasted all day and kept me from burning on a long car ride facing the sun.  The only problem is getting it washed off completely, but I have that problem with any sunblock, so it&#x27;s not unique to Anthelios.      If you&#x27;ve tried everything else out there and are still breaking out, try this product.  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I like it because it&#x27;s thick by texture, it covers well, absorbs normally fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my face all greasy. I&#x27;ve used it for long time and face hasn&#x27;t burned yet.</li>
    <li> Great for PMLE.  I mix it with the La Roche-Posay Anthelios SX Daily Moisturizing so that it&#x27;s not so thick and white.</li>
    <li> This will be the 3rd tube I have purchased.  I am a 70 year old grandmother with sun-damaged skin from waterskiing in my young years.  This product is wonderful.  It has stopped the liver spots caused by the sun on my hands (yes I put it on my hands and face).  It has a white creamy texture but blends beautifully with my foundation (which I opt for a shade darker than my skin). The liver spots on my face have really decreased especially on the side of my face that gets all that sun from driving.  I wear a huge brimmed hat (sunblock fabric)  and live in the high desert of Utah where the sun is intense. I&#x27;m a gardener, biker and love to play with all 17 of my grandkids outside. Only wish I had the product when I was young and could have prevented so much of the sun damage and wrinkles my skin and I have to live with now. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends (which by the way I have many times).</li>
    <li> Superior skin protection, easy to apply, and stays put on your face. Does not run into your eyes and burn them. Here in Arizona it&#x27;s hard to find a great sunscreen, look no further.</li>
    <li> Terrific product and great seller.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product when watching a special with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on CNN and it really does the trick. In addition, the products used to protect your skin are, overall, not terribly harmful as indicated on data found when I researched it on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s data base. I say \\&quot;not terribly harmful\\&quot; because sunscreens that have chemical ingredients are always going to be noted as having components that may produce an allergic reactions. However, since my family is in Florida and when the sun is out we need to cover up, I use this on everyone.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen because stays on and blocks the sun. Some say it makes you look white, but I just rub it in and would rather be on the pale side then burn.</li>
    <li> Yes this goes on thick.  Yes its very milky white and might make you a bit pasty looking especially if you are not pale as a ghost like me (this white was a pretty close match to the skin on my legs).  Yes it is very pricey.  But yes it also works like it should.  I bought it at the last minute for a trip to New Orleans where I would be spending hours upon hours out in the sun (one day was a 3 hour bike ride which almost entirely in the bright sunshine).  If you have polymorphous light eruption you dont mess around with UVA protection unless you happen to enjoy getting a full body rash akin to the chicken pox.  Good stuff but I do hope to find an equivalent at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I had been using Ombrelle lotion 30 spf but could not find the same mixture so I tried Anthelios 40 cream. It makes me look like a ghost so I only use it on my hands and arms.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my 46yo face. I havent tanned in several years due to suns potential damage. It does contain protecton for uva and b rays. Applies a little thick at first but does blend well after awhile</li>
    <li> Yes, it doesn&#x27;t blend in too well.  Yes, you will look whiter than white.  (Well, it&#x27;s not really that bad, but the negative reviews based on that do have some merit.)  However, none of that matters.  I have PMLE that only seemed to get worse every year, no matter how much drugstore high-SPF sunscreen I slathered on.  I got this sunscreen for my trip to Arizona after a long PacNW winter, laid around the pool all day and .... nada.  Nothing.  Not one blotch or blister.  Except on the top of my foot where I didn&#x27;t apply this lovely, wonderful product.  Since then, I have been gardening outside for hours ... still no problems.  Freedom to actually live outside without being shrouded from head to toe in fabric would be worth it at 10x the price.  Highly, highly recommended.  As an additional plus, my face is pretty sensitive to cosmetics of all kinds, and this did not make my skin irritated or broken out.</li>
    <li> I wanted so much to like this sunscreen as I had heard many positive things about it from online reviews. However, unless you are extremely pale I would not recommend this at all. I have medium toned skin and found that I literally could not leave the house with this sunscreen because it made me look so ghostly. Considering how expensive this product is I was expecting a much better product. I contacted the seller to return it because I had used such a small amount and the rest would be wasted but was denied my request. Overall I would never buy from this company or this seller again! I do not recommend to people with even the slightest tinge of color in their skin; I can&#x27;t imagine what people with darker skin look like with this if I was looking so bad...</li>
    <li> I need to use sun protection daily, especially in the sunny months and when traveling to sunny climates.  Since I play tennis, bicycle, walk, and garden, I need a product that will be effective.  This product has high safety ratings with EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep.  The only negative is the same one that is true of all the products with high safety ratings--it does not absorb as well as other products with chemical additives.  I will continue to use this product--thanks for making it available on Amazon.  I was not able to find this specific product from La Roche-Posay locally.</li>
    <li> Very good protection but much too thick and heavy.</li>
    <li> too thick/viscous. Horrible under makeup. Oily. Caked on look.</li>
    <li> Fair skinned here and the sun is not my friend - however, love the beach,etc. - This product works VERY well and stayed on even after several trips into the waves.  It is a small tube, so mainly used for the face, legs, tops of feet, etc.  It does leave a bit (very minor) of a white residue, even after rubbing it in thoroughly - but I did not care about that.</li>
    <li> Wish I liked it better, but it was actually less effective than the lower protection daily moisturizer with Mexoryl and felt terrible on my face. No help for my PMLE. It only gets two stars because I&#x27;m not allergic to it.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from PMLE, this is a godsend. It goes on white and yes you do not look pretty with a whitish haze on your skin and it is expensive as hell. But if you suffer from pmle there is no price you can put on relief from this horrible affliction. You don&#x27;t get much product for the money but man does it do it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen after reading about its improved protection against both UV A and UV B.   I have no complaints about the sun protection - it seems to work, though of course a true test of protection is long-term sun damage avoidance, and not from a few days&#x27; use.  But I dont like the texture of the cream. First, it is not a lotion but a cream. By which I mean its semi-solid and does not blend well on the face. I tried using a lotion moisturizer blended with this sunscreen to make it blend better, but its not easy.   Second, the sunscreen is very whitish and looks that way even after applying very little of it. So if you are somewhat tanned and apply this cream it will show up in whitish streaks on your face that do not sink in.   I also tried applying mineral makeup on top of this to reduce the white-out look, but the camouflage does not work too well.   Third, the sunscreen is not marked as &#x27;non-comedogenic (does not block pores) so that might be an important factor for you to consider if you tend to have large pores, whiteheads or blackheads.    Summary: if you are going to spend a long time in the sun and want a high performance sunscreen, use this one. If you want something more mild for daily use, try out the SPF 15 version of this same brand, or look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My mother recommended this sunscreen, and her dermatologist recommended it to her.  It has good UVA and UVB protection which is the reason that it was physician recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other customer reviews complain of this:  It is thick, and if you apply too much it will leave your skin very pale.  However, if you apply just a dot to your finger, and spread evenly, the cream will absorb, and you will not look ghostly.  Also, I put a light moisturizer on first, and then let it absorb.  Then, I apply the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Leaves a pretty awful white film.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t make your skin look &#x27;white&#x27; as other people commented. All you have to do is to rub into the skin a little bit more. It&#x27;s not too greasy. My husband and I are avid golfers and love this product!!</li>
    <li> Excellent all around, but the quantity is minute for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick cream. The titanium dioxide definitely adds a white cast. I use just a little over the LRP SPF 15. It cuts the greasiness of the SP5 15 a bit. I also use this on my hands every day.    I always wind up cutting the end off the tube to scrape several weeks worth of product out when it will no longer squeeze out. This annoys me.    If you are worried about whether a product is \\&quot;noncomedogenic,\\&quot; please look up the actual facts. There are no FDA regulations for the term and also none for the claims that cosmetics companies make using the term.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my pharmacist.  A great product, better than the nationally known brands you can buy everywhere.  A little price-y, but not greasy, doesn&#x27;t make skin break out, you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there until you come in from a day in the sun without a burn.</li>
    <li> I always get a severe itchy rash (PMLE) when out in the sun for prolonged periods.  I had read that this sunscreen was good for people with my condition (apparently because it blocks both UVA and UVB rays), so I bought it to use for my last two beach trips. It is SUPER thick (leaves the skin pretty white looking) but it really does the trick blocking the sun- no rash!  It is very expensive for a super small bottle, but I&#x27;ll keep buying it because it works to prevent my rash.  It works better than other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried with much higher SPFs.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit thick and white and looks odd  -- especially on olive or darker skin.  But the most important factor for me is -- it really works!  Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used 100 SPF which did not work at all!).  Don&#x27;t slather it on heavily, use more sparingly.  And I do find that after about a half hour it sort of sinks in and doesn&#x27;t look quite so white/pasty.  But as I said, I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s white/pasty, as long as it works!</li>
    <li> The formula must have changed because I have never had so much trouble getting it to rub in and not leaving me looking like Casper the Ghost.  I will only use it for long periods outside in the sun.</li>
    <li> *Updated Review*&lt;br /&gt;I previously wrote a review giving this product only two stars because of its THICK, pasty texture.  After trying the product a few times and ending up with horrible white streaks on my face, I threw it away.  Well, I&#x27;m back to using the product, and in fact, ordered two more bottles.  And no - the texture has not changed.  I&#x27;m using it because it is the most effective sunscreen available for purchase in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After throwing away the anthelios, I began purchasing the ombrelle line (which is also made by loreal and also contains mexoryl) through an online Canadian pharmacy that ships internationally.  The only difference between ombrelle and anthelios is that ombrelle has mexoryl xl, which is oil soluble, and anthelios has mexoryl sx, which is water soluble.  Both are supposed to provide strong uva protection.  However, when I tested the active ingredients in the Ombrelle 60 on the basf sunscreen simulator, it showed only an spf of 15 (not 60).  The basf sunscreen simulator is a fantastic website that cuts through all the fake spf marketing.  I then tested all the spf products available over the counter.  I literally sat in the aisle at Target for over an hour inputting all the active ingredients of all the sunscreens into the basf sunscreen simulator.  I was shocked and horrified by how grossly overinflated the spf ratings on sunscreens were.  For example, the neutrogena spf 110 sunscreen only came out to a real life spf of 12!  The anthelios 40 with mexoryl sx ended up with the highest real life spf rating on the basf sunscreen simulator (total 30).  The second closest was 15.  So after doing the research, I&#x27;m back to the antheolios 40 sunscreen.  And yes, it is still very pasty and leaves white streaks.  In fact, my niece told me that I looked like a clown whenever I put on the sunscreen.  But despite all its drawbacks, it&#x27;s the best, most effective sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------Previous Review----------&lt;br /&gt;This is the textureof toothpaste.  I am willing to put up with a lot for a good sunscreen.  I will leave the house looking like Caspar the ghost to avoid sun damage.  But this is absurd.  It is literally the texture of toothpaste.  It streaks horribly and then clumps.  Every time I attempt to apply this, I end up washing my face and reapplying, only to have to rewash and reapply.  I am purchasing and using this for the mexoryl.  I really wish La Roche Posay would make a sunscreen with mexoryl and an spf above 35 that didn&#x27;t leave me looking like I have some sort of weird skin disease.</li>
    <li> I did not get the quality I expected from this brand. This sunscreen applied thick and white, did not absorb well and left a chalky appearance behind.</li>
    <li> Pay attention to the size.  This is half the amount of product I paid previously but at the same price.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product zero stars. It contains octocrylene, which \\&quot;can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer. This results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination. Free radicals are known to induce indirect DNA DAMAGE and an increased concentration of free radicals might have contributed to the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-users.\\&quot;  This is from a peer-reviewed, science journal.    Another active ingredient, avobenzone, easily penetrates the skin and is a strong free radical generator as well. It also contains titanium dioxide (causes breakouts and a possible carcinogen) and a whole host of other chemicals.    The whole purpose of sunscreen is to protect you from damage, not CAUSE it.     Your best bet for SAFE sunscreen: mix a little unrefined shea butter with either unrefined coconut oil, jojoba oil or avocado oil. That&#x27;s all. Toxic chemicals not included.    If you MUST use a chemical-based sunscreen use only zinc oxide (it is photostable when exposed to radiation-aka sun rays.     FYI: you should also avoid sunscreens containing PABA, Oxybenzone and any other benzene compounds.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Mexoryl products for many years, for a long time from Canada or when I was in Europe. The older formulations for the face were very good with no white residue at all. This was incredibly white. For the face, I can only apply a very thin layer - I&#x27;m sure negating the SPF 40 rating. On my arms and hands with a heavier application you can see the white residue, worsening with any sweat. What&#x27;s the point of the expensive Mexoryl? - you can get pretty efficient UVA and UVB coverage with screen with heavy Titanium Dioxide. I really hope things improve - and the FDA approves the European formulas. This is really not wearable on the face unless I&#x27;m just hiking or at at the beach and don&#x27;t care about looking like I&#x27;m getting ready to perform a mime routine.</li>
    <li> I really liked the coverage of this product, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well at all, so you kind of get that white, vampire-face look. Overall not bad though.</li>
    <li> The product is very dry and chalky. You have to rub it in with a moisturizer but other wise it&#x27;s a good sunscreen</li>
    <li> The product works very well. It goes on like the white sunblocks you see on the beach but eventually blends in and you only have to use very little to be effective.</li>
    <li> This was very expensive, but people said it was the best so I wanted to try it.  I didn&#x27;t really like the texture.  It clumped up for me &amp; I probably was better with a higher SPF.  I liked the Neutrogena with helioplex better.  I wanted to like this because I&#x27;d invested in it, and there was nothing wrong with it, but I found myself reaching for the other stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really thick. I bought it to use on my face and found that it doesn&#x27;t rub in well. I also wish the ingredients were even safer for my skin... I switched to Keys brand zinc sunscreen and love it.</li>
    <li> While this stuff does work well and as advertised I was shocked at the small size of the tube. Not worth the exorbitant price. I bought sunscreen at my dermatologist&#x27;s office for half the price and it works as well.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST sunscreen I have ever tried!</li>
    <li> This turned out to be a smaller tube than anticipated, but great pocket book size. I now use this product at the suggestion of my dermatologist and after reading an article that mentioned it as being healthier as far as the chemicals found in it.</li>
    <li> It works really well, but the Zinc Oxide turns you white.</li>
    <li> The sunblock works extremely well as mentioned in past reviews. I work outside all day and was impressed with the actual quality of the product and effectiveness. It is light, fragrance free and has a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; feel. It does , however, leave a white tint on your face, but it&#x27;s a small trade-off for the coverage it supplies. I have health issues that are aggravated with sun exposure, so the product is worth the price, just wished it came in a larger tube. I have had several comments about the product making my skin look smoother, which is a bonus at my age !</li>
    <li> Not a bargain, but this is a very good sunscreen, with the right ingredients to actually protect from sun damage, and my dermatologist recommended it. I feel safe wearing La Roche-Posay products.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product since I&#x27;d heard and read so many good things about it online. I took the plunge and purchased the product, hoping that this would be the last sunscreen I&#x27;d try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For background, I am a darker skinned African American with allergies, really reactive, sensitive skin and adult acne. Therefore, I can&#x27;t deal with really heavy sunscreens, creams, harsh cleansers or things like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the sunscreen did protect my skin from feeling like it was slowly burning, I looked grey. The sunscreen doesn&#x27;t fully rub in, leaving a white film that makes my skin look ashen. It was so not cute. I rubbed it in unsuccessfully but because it gets humid where I live, the sweat forming on my skin made the look of the film a bit better. However, this product costs too much for me to not be completely in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not give up on LR-P, though. Their thermal water is a staple of mine. Whenever I need to wake up a little or want fresh clean skin during the day, I reach for it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t mind looking like a mime. It does offer protection, but so does a paper bag.</li>
    <li> I used to use Ombrelle from Canada and switched to Anthelios when I had difficulty getting it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difficulty applying the product; maybe that&#x27;s because I spritz my face with water before I put it on.  I don&#x27;t know.  It glides on easily and absorbs well.  My skin is pale, so I am not sure whether I would notice if it didn&#x27;t go on evenly.  I like the product.</li>
    <li> I received a different product from the one the seller advertised on the web. The product I received has some sort of a chemical smell. And I do not like the texture of the product either. After applying, my skin felt dry, and I can see powders left on my skin.</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist recommended this product d/t my husband&#x27;s recent basal cell carcinoma removal. While the product took quite awhile to arrive - we have been very pleased with it and will definately be a return costumer.</li>
    <li> I wanted a sunscreen with powerful UVA protection and this seemed to fit the bill.  I&#x27;ve read a few complaints about it making you look white and pasty, but I&#x27;m already quite pale so it made absolutely no difference on my skin tone.  I was most worried about how my makeup would sit on top, but luckily it looks just fine. Yes, it is thick, but not unbearably so.</li>
    <li> Does it make you look like a ghost? Yes.  Is it thick?  Yes.  Does it virtually eradicate all signs of PMLE?  Yes.  I went to Mexico with no base tan and no previous sun exposure and I put this on my feet to knees, hands to shoulders, face, neck and chest-all the places I would get that horrible, itchy rash</li>
    <li> I am very pale, and there is skin cancer in my family. Until now I have mostly been an indoors person who used sunscreen when I knew I was going to get a lot of sun exposure. I recently adopted a lovely dog, and I have been walking him twice a day around our neighborhood. I didn&#x27;t think I was getting enough sun exposure to warrant sunblock. When I started seeing tan lines, I knew I needed to take daily sun protection more seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use [[ASIN:B0037LOQ9U Neutrogena Ultimate Sport Sunblock Spray, SPF 100+, 5 oz.]] for my body coverage. For my face, I decided that the low SPF in most facial moisturizers and makeup wasn&#x27;t enough. When I read about the benefits of Mexoryl XL, I decided to take a chance on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the benefits of UVA &amp; UVB protection far outweigh the drawbacks, but your mileage may vary. It does go on white, and you&#x27;ll need to blend it well. I can see how this might look pasty on darker skins. If you&#x27;re very pale like me, this won&#x27;t be much of an issue. It is thick, but it&#x27;s easy to massage it into your skin, and I have no trouble using makeup on top of it. I was expecting a hard, wax-like consistency, but that&#x27;s simply not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am acne prone, but this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t aggravate the condition. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, but I do feel like I have a coating of some sort on my face. Most other facial sunscreens get into my eyes somehow, but this one stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is protecting my skin from the sun very well, and it&#x27;s a perfect fit for me. This product is hard to find, and costs more than other sunscreens, but I think it is worth every penny. This product is for anyone who is serious about sun protection and doesn&#x27;t mind extra effort blending, or a possible white sheen on darker skins. For pale people, it&#x27;s a must-have for summer.</li>
    <li> No break outs yet, been using it for a week. Leaves me looking really white. Seriously just need a dot</li>
    <li> I have extremely fair skin and after a long drive cross country and getting a horrible burn on my left arm I started getting a yearly rash.  If I was in the sun for more then a day or two, I&#x27;d get itchy bumps all over my hands, arms and feet.  Nothing fixed this except for staying out of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried every sunscreen out there and nothing worked until I found an article that finally alerted me to what I have... polymorphic light eruption.  Realizing that I couldn&#x27;t find true UVA protection from a product in the states I tried this one and it has allowed me to go on vacation to the beach without having to worry about being stuck in the room half way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, lets talk about the product.  Does it work? YES!!  Is it extra white and greasy, absolutely.  But this is a small price to pay for being able to enjoy the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat who might have sun allergies.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would protect me from all the bad rays and I may have found it.  This product is fantastic. I live in AZ and have used it there and now in San Diego at the beach all week. No burn at all and I am fair skinned so this is amazing for me.  I also used it on my grandkids in 115 degrees in AZ and it protected them from burning. I recommend this for fair skin.</li>
    <li> thick and doesn&#x27;t rub in.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t be buying this sunscreen again.  I am using it and plan to use it up.  I only wear it when running and not planning on going anywhere.  It goes on like glue and leaves you looking like a ghost.</li>
    <li> Extremely thick.  Leaves a white sheen on skin.</li>
    <li> Discovered this product in Italy in 2005 (it&#x27;s rated at 60 SPF in Europe) after seeing it in various fashion mags.  I am very fair (red head), do not tan, have adult acne and rosacea, and so wear SPF 30 daily.  Since I live in Seattle, I am incandescently pale!  This sunscreen saved my skin (and expensive trip) to Italy and Greece in August -Sept 2005.  I did not burn once, despite being outside daily for hours in 90 degree sunny weather.  Caused minimal acne flare ups too.  I now use this for gardening in Seattle -works great, better then SPF 100 Aveeno and various other high SPF brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Works for face and body. It IS thick and white  tho so I took off a star.  I blend in well on top of moisturizer and find it looks fine on me.  When I want to look less ghostly, I mix in a little tinted BB cream with a high SPF. Voila! Tinted high performance SPF.  Pre-Amazon, I had to go to Canada to buy formula with Mexoryl (SX formula).  Other formulas (L) don&#x27;t have it, and for me it&#x27;s the magic ingredient.</li>
    <li> I also use the ultra light sunscreen and it is great. It blends well on my dark skin. This sunscreen has titanium dioxide which doesn&#x27;t absorb/disappear as well. Burnout ,which has zinc oxide, works better for me.</li>
    <li> I have an auto-immune condition exacerbated by sun exposure.  My doctor recommended I purchase this specific brand of sunscreen with Mexoryl, for daily use on my face, so I did.  It is a very thick, but non-greasy formula that I have been using for several weeks without any negative impact to my skin - no acne or oily skin or anything I&#x27;ve experienced from sunscreen use in the past.  I am not a doctor, so I can&#x27;t exactly comment on its effectiveness - I rely on it for daily out-and-about exposure, rather than direct, sustained beach-type sun exposure, and it seems to be doing the trick.  It is, as you have noticed, very expensive for a very small amount, but it does go rather far.</li>
    <li> In the past two years, my mom started developing a rash whenever she went out in the sun. After some investigation, it seems like she has PMLE. She has tried using various drugstore sunblocks, up to spf 70, but still was breaking out from the sun. I bought her this sunblock based on reviews and by running the ingredients through the BASF sunscreen simulator (I don&#x27;t know if I should post links in a review, so just google &amp;#34;BASF sunscreen simulator&amp;#34;)-- supposedly many sunscreens do not offer good protection against longer wavelength UVA rays, which contribute to PMLE eruptions, but the Mexoryl ingredient in this seems to have a broader spectrum of protection. For a research paper discussing this, search &amp;#34;Prevention of Polymorphous Light Eruption and Solar Urticaria by R. Bissonnette, MSc, MD, FRCPC.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom tried it once so far, and said she didn&#x27;t break out after a day on the lake. It seems to be working, and I&#x27;ll update if that changes.</li>
    <li> The other reviews were correct.  This does a great job of blocking the sun and stopping bumps from forming.</li>
    <li> Not recommend! Maybe it does the work, but it&#x27;s thick toothpaste consistency will leave an awfully white powdery film on your skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome sunscreen. I am really fair with a tendency to freckle and this stuff has saved my skin! It used to come in a cream that was tinted and I loved it but they stopped making the tinted cream. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts either.</li>
    <li> La Roche-Posay Anthelios sunscreen is thicker than most sunscreens, so you don&#x27;t need to use as much or keep reapplying as often as you do with local drugstore brands. Anthelios&#x27;s ingredients are practically the same as Neutrogena&#x27;s, protecting against both UVA and UVB rays. But Anthelios lasts longer, though it is significantly more expensive. There is one drawback: the thicker cream tends to stain your clothes if it gets on your hands. But it is the best and longest lasting protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is good for people with sensitive skin (as are most/all La Roche-Posay products) and it&#x27;s considered to have fewer harmful chemicals than most sunscreens, so it&#x27;s good for the whole family!</li>
    <li> The real thing as far as sunscreen goes ; this one works and you can feel the difference. Hard to spread on your face so check if you&#x27;re using make up over.</li>
    <li> My daughter is eleven and has had a sun allergy since she was three and this works great for her!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from PMLE for over 20 years and have extreme photosensitivity. Even with lots of sunscreen on, I will have a skin reaction after being exposed to the sun for only 10 minutes. I have tried many, many sunscreens out there from organic ones to chemical ones to a combination but they all had the same effect- which was not much. Finally, after doing some research and reading reviews I decided to give Anthelios 40 a try and add it to the list of the many sunscreens I have tried. To my surprise- there is actually something in this sunscreen that makes a difference and allows me to be exposed to the sun without having reactions!!! Yes, it is thick and goes on like paste and stays that way, but I would rather that, than break out in an itchy, uncomfortable, rash. It is also extremely expensive, especially since I have to use it on a daily basis, but again, it is worth it to me rather than hiding all day from the sun. Don&#x27;t get me wrong- I still can&#x27;t sit out and tan at the beach and I still have to limit my sun exposure but at least I can do normal, everyday activities without having any kind of severe sun reaction. Best sunscreen for anyone with PMLE or photosensitivity, it really protects!! I&#x27;m so happy I found this product and will keep using it, none of the other sunscreens I have used compare in protection!</li>
    <li> This is the best suncreen on the market and the protection factors are great. Mexoryl SX is the best ingredient&lt;br /&gt;you can use.It protects against UVA rays, that cause wrinkles and protects against UVB rays.I hightly recommend this product and will but again. This product has been used in Europe for years and I&#x27;m glad we have it in the US.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has the 4 top sunscreen ingredients, especially for blocking UVA and UVB (short and long wave length) light.  Your sunscreen needs to have Mexoryl SX.  Worth the price.  I have had melanoma on my face so this is an essential product for me.  I wear Coolibar swim products as well.  I love the sun but it hasn&#x27;t been good to me. **TIP**:  When you can no longer easily get the product out of the tip of the tube, cut off the bottom and get the rest.  There is a LOT of product still left in the tube just keep in a plastic bag/container so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  This is a staple for me.</li>
    <li> No doubt this is a good product to protect against the sun but it goes on white and stays on white.  My shade of skin was way whiter than normal after I put this on.  Very thick, good for the beach not everyday life.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen definitely does a great job of protecting your skin. The only problem is that it is not only really thick but doesn&#x27;t blend will. At times, I ended up looking like a Morlock (from the Time Machine). If you&#x27;re a guy with any facial hair whatsoever, I&#x27;d try to find a more emollient sunscreen. The La Roche-Posay will make it look like you have powdered donut all over your face. I&#x27;d definitely use this sunscreen if I was doing something outside with no possibility of running into anybody; however, I&#x27;d definitely avoid it for any outdoor activity that might involve some kind of social interaction especially with those who might be faint of heart.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen on the planet. Enough said!</li>
</ol>
