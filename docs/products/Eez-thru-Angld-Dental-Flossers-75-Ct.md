      <li>The &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; end is what makes it the best because it is not blunt and can reach the smallest of spaces.  </li>
      <li>w/ adjustable tension the best</li>
      <li>These are the Best.  </li>
      <li>These are the best flossers.</li>

      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>These are great.</li>
      <li>These are the best for flossing- easy to use and sturdy!</li>
      <li>Very happy I was able to get them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Mother was satisfied and It&#x27;s perfect material</li>
      <li>The mild mint flavor is a pleasant addition.</li>
      <li>Even my Hygenist said best results she has seen in me (After traditionally using string flossers and then trying side-handled flossers)... arrived quickly - so great product in a quick and easy purchase.</li>
      <li>The angle on the handle allows for a better reach.  </li>
      <li>satisfied with this product</li>
      <li>With these devices my gums are are in better condition that they were a month ago.</li>
      <li>I find myself flossing more.  </li>
      <li>Like most I don&#x27;t like to floss.</li>
      <li>Love the angled design though</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>these flossers are just ok.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more based on reviews</li>
      <li>IT WORKS MUCH BETTER.</li>
      <li>and I have come to Amazon for more.</li>
      <li>The angle is perfect for getting between back teeth and the pick on the end gets in and around my permanent retainers.</li>
      <li>And since this floss shreds easily, it&#x27;s going to get even tougher with each tooth as you go along.</li>
      <li>The thread on these flossers doesn&#x27;t get in between my teeth that easy.</li>
      <li>Problem we&#x27;ve experienced is finding these in the stores locally anymore.  </li>
      <li>am always watching for when products disappear from markets, because I see many changes in good products when a big company takes them over.</li>
      <li>The built in floss is the perfect match to allow all functions to remove every type of lodged particle from hard to stringy.</li>
      <li>These flossers do a good job removing food particles from the teeth in the back of the mouth.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s best to have two kinds of flossers really; the more common kind for the front teeth and these for the back teeth.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without theses the ends are perfect for tight places</li>
      <li>They are not so great in tight spaces like w/ molars.</li>
      <li>That happened with my favorite deodorant stick, and some adult wipes.</li>
      <li>These are no longer available at our normal pharmacy.</li>
      <li>I bought the first bag at my pharmacy on spec</li>
      <li>Love that these flossers can reach to the very back of my teeth!</li>
      <li>That said, these are essential to keeping your teeth clean out in the world, where you are likely to run into a food situation of some kind.</li>
      <li>and I like it much better than flat one.</li>
      <li>They do an excellent job, especially in the hard to get to places.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s never been so easy to keep my teeth and gums properly flossed.</li>
      <li>Helps reaching the molars much easier.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>They get all your back teeth with no problem and they are comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>Other flossers were too flimsy; I had to use more than one each night.</li>
      <li>Would be nice to have a small protective &amp;#34;cover/case&amp;#34; for pocket or purse</li>
      <li>And because these are angled, the handle actually tends to bend a lot more than the traditional, non-angled design when you are exerting downward pressure on it--even though these have a thicker handle.</li>
      <li>They are much thicker and sturdier than the other out there so the price is justified in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The way they are angled is s unique and makes them so much easier to use then regular flat flossers.  </li>
      <li>These are much stronger and last much longer than any</li>
      <li>He loves these and has a much easier time flossing his tightly spaced teeth - meaning that he flosses more often because it&#x27;s not such a struggle.  </li>
      <li>The other models are better for front teeth cleaning only.</li>
      <li>Thus you don&#x27;t have as much leverage as with the traditional design.</li>
      <li>Finally, to add insult to injury, these are actually *more* expensive than most other brands/designs.</li>
      <li>there is no guard on the sharp end of the handle, so it tends to poke you in the hand repeatedly as you try to use these--and of course if you have to exert more pressure to get these between your tight teeth, it is really going to poke hard.</li>
      <li>The deodorant line expanded and does not seem to include the original which, seriously lasted for years.</li>

<li> Sadly, due to the limited choices on the market these are better than some others out there but still not great.</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve tried several other brands, but they either break to easily, not long enough, do not have a pick,</li>
<li> First of all, the floss is too thick</li>
<li> The long curved shape gives access to every area.</li>
<li> Having tried several different brands of flossers, I can safely say that these are absolutely the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
<li> Having to put all that pressure leads to the the floss (when it does finally get in between the teeth) &amp;#34;slamming&amp;#34; down into your gums, causing pain and bleeding.</li>
<li> Well designed floss to get to between tight back teeth.</li>
<li> I bought these for my husband, who has trouble using the standard floss picks because the angle of the handle/head.  </li>
<li> Sometimes I have trouble getting them at the local chains.</li>
<li> Furthermore, unlike some other designs.</li>
<li> After trying some other products I found these</li>
<li> Does not shred or break like some of the other brands I have used</li>
<li> but I can&#x27;t seem to use them effectively in my back hard to reach teeth.</li>
<li> so if you have tight teeth, forget about it.</li>
<li> The wipes went from 105 count down to 42 and the price went up!  </li>
<li> The pharmacy said they were resetting the display, everything left is a poor buy. .</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> That, along with the thickness of the floss, simply makes these extremely difficult to use if you have even slightly tight teeth.</li>
<li> but they are near impossible to find these days.</li>
<li> The floss is thin, so can make it through tight contacts</li>
<li> /&gt;Unfortunately they are hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> I hate plain old floss and have been using these for years.</li>
<li> You are going to have to work very hard to get the floss in between your teeth.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore for whatever stupid reason.</li>
<li> Terrible all around.</li>

    <li> Handy,easy to use. Would be nice to have a small protective &amp;#34;cover/case&amp;#34; for pocket or purse</li>
    <li> Well designed floss to get to between tight back teeth. Does not shred or break like some of the other brands I have used</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s never been so easy to keep my teeth and gums properly flossed. They do an excellent job, especially in the hard to get to places. My dental hygienist gave me a couple and I ordered them immediately.</li>
    <li> These are great. The long curved shape gives access to every area. The built in floss is the perfect match to allow all functions to remove every type of lodged particle from hard to stringy. The mild mint flavor is a pleasant addition.</li>
    <li> These are the best for flossing- easy to use and sturdy!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without theses the ends are perfect for tight places</li>
    <li> These are the best flossers ever. They get all your back teeth with no problem and they are comfortable to use. Love them.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Helps reaching the molars much easier. The angle on the handle allows for a better reach.  The other models are better for front teeth cleaning only.</li>
    <li> Product as listed.  Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used wrap around my fingers, cut off circulation floss, but thought I would try these.  Takes a bit of getting used to, but is a lot easier on the fingers.  The floss is thin, so can make it through tight contacts and it doesn&#x27;t break.  I find myself flossing more.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I hate plain old floss and have been using these for years. Sometimes I have trouble getting them at the local chains. Very happy I was able to get them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> these flossers are just ok. I was hoping for more based on reviews but I can&#x27;t seem to use them effectively in my back hard to reach teeth. They are not so great in tight spaces like w/ molars. I will finish the bag since I paid for them but won&#x27;t purchase again. Sadly, due to the limited choices on the market these are better than some others out there but still not great. I prefer oral B flossers w/ adjustable tension the best but they are near impossible to find these days.</li>
    <li> Mother was satisfied and It&#x27;s perfect material and I like it much better than flat one. IT WORKS MUCH BETTER.</li>
    <li> The thread on these flossers doesn&#x27;t get in between my teeth that easy. Love the angled design though</li>
    <li> These are the Best.  We&#x27;ve tried several other brands, but they either break to easily, not long enough, do not have a pick, etc.  Problem we&#x27;ve experienced is finding these in the stores locally anymore.  Again, these are the BEST!</li>

    <li> Having tried several different brands of flossers, I can safely say that these are absolutely the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried. First of all, the floss is too thick so if you have tight teeth, forget about it. You are going to have to work very hard to get the floss in between your teeth. And since this floss shreds easily, it&#x27;s going to get even tougher with each tooth as you go along. Having to put all that pressure leads to the the floss (when it does finally get in between the teeth) &amp;#34;slamming&amp;#34; down into your gums, causing pain and bleeding. And because these are angled, the handle actually tends to bend a lot more than the traditional, non-angled design when you are exerting downward pressure on it--even though these have a thicker handle. Thus you don&#x27;t have as much leverage as with the traditional design.

    <li> These are no longer available at our normal pharmacy. The pharmacy said they were resetting the display, everything left is a poor buy. . These are much stronger and last much longer than any we have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I am always watching for when products disappear from markets, because I see many changes in good products when a big company takes them over. They reduce the quantity and raise the price. That happened with my favorite deodorant stick, and some adult wipes. The wipes went from 105 count down to 42 and the price went up!  The deodorant line expanded and does not seem to include the original which, seriously lasted for years.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore for whatever stupid reason. Even my Hygenist said best results she has seen in me (After traditionally using string flossers and then trying side-handled flossers)... arrived quickly - so great product in a quick and easy purchase.</li>

    <li> I bought these for my husband, who has trouble using the standard floss picks because the angle of the handle/head.  He loves these and has a much easier time flossing his tightly spaced teeth - meaning that he flosses more often because it&#x27;s not such a struggle.  These are shaped like a disposable razor, with a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; shape head/handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pack of 75 will last him several months, and at $4 and change, these are an inexpensive way to protect his dental health.</li>
    <li> These are the best flossers. The floss doesn&#x27;t break or get caught in your teeth. The angle is perfect for getting between back teeth and the pick on the end gets in and around my permanent retainers.</li>
    <li> Like most I don&#x27;t like to floss. After trying some other products I found these and they are great. I bought the first bag at my pharmacy on spec and I have come to Amazon for more. Other flossers were too flimsy; I had to use more than one each night. With these devices my gums are are in better condition that they were a month ago.</li>
