      <li>Try it; you will love it</li>
      <li>I have the old Merkur Razor that I loved, this one now is my favorite!</li>
      <li>EASY PULL TOP TO INSTALLED BLADE PUSHED LOCK BLADE IN PLACE</li>
      <li>SINGLE BEST SHAVE</li>
      <li>Nobody needs a $70 razor right, but this this is a nice luxury item.</li>
      <li>I love this razor and cant say enough great things about it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had the issues others have mentioned regarding maneuvering the blade around my nose (although this razor will easily nick your nostril or ear if you aren&#x27;t careful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The fit, finish, feel and heft of this superbly crafted item is obviously apparent upon the first use.  </li>
      <li>The Futur is the best of both worlds as you can dial the aggressiveness up or down to you liking.  </li>
      <li>This razor, while aggressive, gives me the best shave of my life, with half the effort.</li>
      <li>After 6 weeks still on #1 setting still a fantastic razor.  </li>
      <li>It is very well made and has a nice heft to it.</li>
      <li>I truly enjoy shaving again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To remove the head of the razor, use your thumb to pop one side of the head free.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic razor.  </li>
      <li>I have been very pleased with this razor so far.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>I love my new Futur safety razor.  </li>
      <li>Nice and solid design.</li>
      <li>Once you hold it in the right angle.</li>
      <li>About half of the time, the whole head came free and life was good.</li>
      <li>It took me a few shaves to find the blade setting I liked, but once I did, I really started enjoying my morning shave.</li>
      <li>Weight is great for me, no need to press hard on the face.  </li>
      <li>If you have to adjust the settings while shaving, be careful; the razor slipped in my hand and I received a nice cut on my finger.</li>
      <li>love the different settings and</li>
      <li>how aggressive the higher settings can be set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I first started using this razor and needed to change the blade, I would pop one side of the head up with my thumb.</li>
      <li>Just flip off the top replace blade and snap back on.</li>
      <li>This is my first DE razor.</li>
      <li>GOOD FEEL HEAVY , HANDLE 4 INCH.</li>
      <li>After getting used to DE shaving with a very basic Merkur, I decided to go with something a little more fancy, and I&#x27;m very glad that I did.</li>
      <li>Installation is easy enough and I prefer to position the blade onto the handle and then pop the head into place.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and a mild to medium beard.  </li>
      <li>I like the modern style</li>
      <li>There is a learning curve, as with any other fine tool, but once you master it, it will serve you very well.</li>
      <li>I had high expectations.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for both shaving face and head.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I highly recommend this Merkur Futur.</li>
      <li>Turn the razor around and gently push the other side free</li>
      <li>I have been using DE razors for years now....and researched the right razor, but did not want to spend extra money for just a razor.  </li>
      <li>After starting wet shaving again After many years, I first went with an Edwin jager DB89; then moved to a Parker 22c open comb for a little more aggressive shave.</li>
      <li>What I do know is that it cuts my face raw on its most conservative setting.</li>
      <li>use level 4 on the first pass and level 2 on the second pass.</li>
      <li>So, after reading reviews, mostly positive, I finally ordered one.</li>
      <li>Great disappointment.</li>
      <li>I really had a terrific shave.</li>
      <li>At its minimum setting this razor was not harsh on the skin.</li>
      <li>I have not looked at the blade under a lens, but perhaps there is something to the comments of other reviewers that this razor has a systemic design flaw so that the blade never rests true and flat -</li>
      <li>SUPER HEAVY....</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a great razor. I just put it on the #2 setting and just use the weight of the razor for a great shave. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have the old Merkur Razor that I loved, this one now is my favorite! I look forward to shaving now with this razor. Highly recommended for both shaving face and head.</li>
    <li> Very nice!! Great price. Amazing shave with some feathers:)</li>
    <li> Nice and solid design. Enough adjustments to get the job done. In my daily rotation.</li>
    <li> Beautiful razor with a very functional design. The quality of the shave continues to improve as I experiment with various settings. Has made shaving a very enjoyable experience!</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this razor. It shall be the last I ever buy. I truly enjoy shaving again. The only drawback is the handle is not knurled. This can be a bit slippery at times if you are not experienced.&lt;br /&gt;I use level 4 on the first pass and level 2 on the second pass. No need for a third pass. No nicks at all.</li>
    <li> After using a Merkur 38HD for about 4 years, I decided it was time for an upgrade. I have been very pleased with this razor so far. It took me a few shaves to find the blade setting I liked, but once I did, I really started enjoying my morning shave. I haven&#x27;t had the issues others have mentioned regarding maneuvering the blade around my nose (although this razor will easily nick your nostril or ear if you aren&#x27;t careful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one issue I want to discuss. Changing the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of my previous razors required the shaver unscrew the head somehow to replace the blade. The Futur is different in that the head is held in place by two knobs which you push between two spring bars on the handle side. Installation is easy enough and I prefer to position the blade onto the handle and then pop the head into place. Removing the head can be a bit tricky. Learn from my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this razor and needed to change the blade, I would pop one side of the head up with my thumb. About half of the time, the whole head came free and life was good. The other half, only the one side would come free and it was very difficult to remove the head by continuing to apply pressure on that initial side. This is how I eventually sliced my finger open! Don&#x27;t be like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove the head of the razor, use your thumb to pop one side of the head free. Turn the razor around and gently push the other side free and you&#x27;re set. This may be obvious to most of you, but it took me a nasty cut to figure out, so learn from my mistake!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor. It is very well made and has a nice heft to it. After starting wet shaving again After many years, I first went with an Edwin jager DB89; then moved to a Parker 22c open comb for a little more aggressive shave. The Futur is the best of both worlds as you can dial the aggressiveness up or down to you liking.  I started with a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; and went to a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34;. I really had a terrific shave. You can actually hear the whiskers being sheared off your face. It sorta &amp;#34;sings&amp;#34;. This heavyweight enables you to just let the razor do the work without any pressure on your face. I had no nicks, cuts, scrapes or weepers at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont understand some remarks that it is difficult to change the blade. I actually find it easier than my 3 piece razors. Just flip off the top replace blade and snap back on. This came with a Merkur blade which is really sharp. One caveat! If you have to adjust the settings while shaving, be careful; the razor slipped in my hand and I received a nice cut on my finger. Otherwise, I highly recommend this Merkur Futur. I think it will become my go to. Try it; you will love it</li>
    <li> I love this razor and cant say enough great things about it. I get the perfect shave everytime. This was the end all for razor purchases for me.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic razor.  I had a Gillette adjustable razor as a teenager, always left it on #3.  The Merkur Futur shaves me on #1.  I read every review and It is as advertised, fantastic!!!  After 6 weeks still on #1 setting still a fantastic razor.  I have sensitive skin and a mild to medium beard.  I hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, just what I was looking for, shaves close just like it.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor. And I just love it. At its minimum setting this razor was not harsh on the skin. Once you hold it in the right angle.</li>
    <li> GOOD FEEL HEAVY , HANDLE 4 INCH. EASY PULL TOP TO INSTALLED BLADE PUSHED LOCK BLADE IN PLACE&lt;br /&gt;IF HANDLE MADE LONGER MUCH BETTER TO HANDLING</li>
    <li> This is the best razor that I have every used!  I have been using DE razors for years now....and researched the right razor, but did not want to spend extra money for just a razor.  I finally decided on the Merkur Futur..........I used it this morning..........SINGLE BEST SHAVE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  (Used Gillette Silver Blue razors with the Merkur)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the different settings and how aggressive the higher settings can be set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered on Friday afternoon....and had it in my hands Sunday afternoon! SUPER FAST SHIPPING!!!!!!!  I recommend this product if you want a BB shave!  No nicks...or irritation!  SUPER HEAVY....and it does the work for you!!! I am a life member using Merkur from now on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nobody needs a $70 razor right, but this this is a nice luxury item. Weight is great for me, no need to press hard on the face.  I love that the blade is adjustable.  I like the modern style and It just feels good to use.  It will pay for itself after just a few time of not having to spend $$$ on those overpriced replacement blade cartridges.</li>
    <li> This is the best safety razor I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to use. I like it enough that I&#x27;m getting two more for my sons. The adjustment allows you to get a shave that fits your beard. And the space behind the blade resists clogging even on my heavy beard.</li>
    <li> After getting used to DE shaving with a very basic Merkur, I decided to go with something a little more fancy, and I&#x27;m very glad that I did. This razor, while aggressive, gives me the best shave of my life, with half the effort. I use the &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; setting with no pressure at all, and I&#x27;m amazing every day at how close my shaves are. There is a learning curve, as with any other fine tool, but once you master it, it will serve you very well.</li>
    <li> A well made beautiful razor</li>
    <li> I had high expectations. I&#x27;d watched a video about the manufacture of the Futur on The Learning Channel. So, after reading reviews, mostly positive, I finally ordered one. Great disappointment. It can&#x27;t manage to provide a shave that does not draw blood from places on my face that have no problem with other razors. Even when set on the lowest setting, 1. Oddly, in that setting, the shave is simply not as clean as the shave from a plain, simple Merkur 34c. I have not looked at the blade under a lens, but perhaps there is something to the comments of other reviewers that this razor has a systemic design flaw so that the blade never rests true and flat - I take these comments to mean that other writers have observed a warp in the positioning of the blade. Maybe. I don&#x27;t know. What I do know is that it cuts my face raw on its most conservative setting.</li>
    <li> Fantastic safety razor! Definitely worth the money! Go ahead, spend some money on yourself. You deserve it!</li>
    <li> Best, closest and comfortable shave yet. Love it. Bay Smoot on two passes. I use with astra blade and will never look back.</li>
    <li> An awesome razor for a great price!  I would shop with this seller anytime and recommend them to all.</li>
    <li> I love my new Futur safety razor.  After sitting on the fence for literally years, I took the plunge.  Now I only wonder why I ever waited so long.  The fit, finish, feel and heft of this superbly crafted item is obviously apparent upon the first use.  Highly recommended.</li>
