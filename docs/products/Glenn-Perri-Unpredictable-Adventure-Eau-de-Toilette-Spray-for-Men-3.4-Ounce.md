      <li>Nonetheless, if you are looking for inexpensive &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34;- this is great!</li>
      <li>Awesome scent, best for night and winter!!!</li>
      <li>A very good alternative to Creed Aventus, and come in at almost 10X cheaper.</li>
      <li>Great price for a great product</li>
      <li>Great scent, and</li>
      <li>, I have a great</li>
      <li>Love the scent for my bf...!!</li>
      <li>Very nice cologne.</li>
      <li>This smells great nice smokey fruity smell.  </li>
      <li>Smells really good</li>
      <li>You can tell the company was trying to be unique and they were, but it wasn&#x27;t thought out perfectly.</li>
      <li>You can tell the company was trying to be unique and they were, but it wasn&#x27;t thought out perfectly.</li>
      <li>Fall and winter fragrance would be best in my opinion and even cool spring days.</li>
      <li>Great product, cheap packaging.</li>
      <li>This cologne is getting a lot of buzz, so I thought I would offer my honest</li>
      <li>I wanted to buy someone nice to wear for work and I heard about Glenn Perri&#x27;s Undpredictable Adventure.</li>
      <li>#34;That&#x27;s some nice twang you have on.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Great price, quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Honestly, buy Aventus since it is so much better than the clones.  </li>
      <li>The sprayer is a triangular button on the top close to the front of the bottle that is flush with the top.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re more into celebrity colognes, Ed Hardy, anything that you could probably define as inoffensive</li>
      <li>This has a distinctly more synthetic character to it.  </li>
      <li>The sprayer is a triangular button on the top close to the front of the bottle that is flush with the top.</li>
      <li>More of a summer smell.</li>
      <li>If you like more of the pineapple note I would get Fresco instead.</li>
      <li>It focuses more on the leathery note.</li>
      <li>Some have more pronounced pineapple</li>
      <li>Some have more pronounced pineapple</li>
      <li>/&gt;Happy sniffing :)</li>
      <li>This is a non offensive scent which lasts easily for 6-8 hours.</li>
      <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s a pretty nice box.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t smelled Aventus, but this smells pretty nice.</li>
      <li>In order to get a full press, you have to keep a finger curled otherwise you won&#x27;t easily get a full spray because of the flush nature of the button; it presses into the top.</li>

      <li>There&#x27;s plenty of inexpensive colognes that actually are quality juices and smell great.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think this would be a fragrance I would enjoy.</li>
      <li>think the sillage is great with this one, and it lasts several hours.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think this would be a fragrance I would enjoy.</li>
      <li>It smells like Creed&#x27;s Adventus but in a cheap way.</li>
      <li>I enjoy cologne collecting.</li>
      <li>Aventus still smells better, richer (i.e., higher quality ingredients) - imo.  </li>
      <li>I say let them participate in their conspicuous consumption, and everyone else can enjoy this very pleasant fragrance for very little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>For the price its not bad.</li>
      <li>A quick glance at the bottom says this is a Geparlys, Paris product.</li>
      <li>A pretty cheap, and cheap-smelling, Creed Aventus clone.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how that company did it, but the consensus across the Youtube videos and forums seems to suggest that Glenn Perri Unpredictable Adventure is a mind bogglingly close copy of one of the most popular fragrances of all time.</li>
      <li>For that price, it&#x27;s 100% worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s clear which is better quality.</li>
      <li>Projection and Longevity are not even close, but the smell and the way it progresses its right on point.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an imitation of Paco Rabane Invictus, but not as good as Invictus</li>
      <li>Its different, unique in its own sense and if you don&#x27;t want to smell like everybody else like Aqua Di Gio, Bleu de Chanel, Paco Rabbane 1 Million, D&amp;G Light Blue and so on, then this is worth the $20.</li>
      <li>I enjoy picking them apart and trying out new scents</li>
      <li>I got a compliment for a lady the first night I went out with it on.</li>
      <li>the spritzer is pretty poor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am incredibly satisfied with this purchase and would say that if you are into more mature colognes this could be a blind buy for the incredible low price it is.</li>
      <li>When I first sprayed this on my wrist</li>
      <li>When I first sprayed this on my wrist</li>
      <li>This smells almost exactly like Creed&#x27;s Aventus.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see the point in dropping that kind of cash on a single cologne when copies like this are rated as to be so accurate that all but those crossed with the DNA of a bloodhound can&#x27;t apparently tell the difference.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
      <li>However, I would go with Insurrection Pure II if you&#x27;re a college kid on a tight-budget.</li>
      <li>some have a more smoky nature and Unpredictable Adventure, to my educated guess, falls into the latter; it feels more smoky and musky than these notes suggest.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I wanted to try Aventus, but not so much that I felt the need to cough up two pictures of Ben Franklin for it.</li>
      <li>Also doesn&#x27;t project much.</li>
      <li>really  </li>
      <li>probably most sintetic that I&#x27;d expected it to be.</li>
      <li>I try not to spray this too much because it makes my nose hurt.</li>
      <li>silage is very poor...not recommendable...</li>
      <li>Very close,</li>
      <li>What hit my nose was a simply divine sweet, smoky, fruity fragrance that exuded confidence and masculinity.</li>

      <li>An older lady even joined in by saying &amp;</li>
      <li>Smell is not as strong as I expected.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too detailed, or loud, but it has enough to get the job done; it&#x27;s a classy box.</li>
      <li>If not, a somewhat less costly alternative is Mancera Cedrat Boise ($160) and a really cheap alternative would be Insurrection Pure II (about $30 with shipping).  </li>
      <li>At the open it gets pretty close; I get the fruit, the leather, some of the smoke, but it&#x27;s just not quite there.  </li>
      <li>Pretty similar to Aventus, even in the name,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought a couple bottles of Aventus over the last three years, but after finishing off the last bottle, I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to lay down that kind of cash again.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the nose who created this was actually trying to emulate Creed&#x27;s Aventus (as has been suggested here and elsewhere), but there&#x27;s definitely a certain similarity.  </li>
      <li>Very similar to Aventus from Creed but at a much much lower price.</li>
      <li>far as longevity, it lasted about 30 minutes on my arm, and about 55 minutes on my shirt.</li>
      <li>yes, it does smell good (not great) and it actually has an Aventus vibe.....</li>
      <li>So fellow Amazon Cologne Connoisseur, if you&#x27;re here looking at this particular cologne, you&#x27;re probably here for the same reason</li>
      <li>The note breakdown for Creed Aventus is top notes of blackcurrant, bergamot, apple and pineapple with a heart of rose, dry birch, Moroccan jasmine and patchouli and a base of oak moss, musk, ambergris, and vanilla.</li>

      <li>this was an imitation not the real cologne</li>
      <li>Opens with a very sharp woody and smokey scent, but dries down quickly and becomes soft.</li>
      <li>Unpredictable Adventure captures this more or less on the dot but with less pineapple on the opening; it&#x27;s there, but not as pronounced.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price for a great product</li>
    <li> Very nice cologne. Woodsy, citrusy, with a Lil bergamot. Great price, quick shipping. Get lots of compliments with this fragrance</li>
    <li> Love the scent for my bf...!!</li>
    <li> I like different and it&#x27;s definitely different. Opens with a very sharp woody and smokey scent, but dries down quickly and becomes soft. Still woody, but less aggressive. If you like Angel Men and Fafrenheit then you&#x27;ll like this one. Fall and winter fragrance would be best in my opinion and even cool spring days. Does it smell like Adventus??? Don&#x27;t know what Adventus smells like, so don&#x27;t let that be the factor of you buying this fragrance. Its different, unique in its own sense and if you don&#x27;t want to smell like everybody else like Aqua Di Gio, Bleu de Chanel, Paco Rabbane 1 Million, D&amp;G Light Blue and so on, then this is worth the $20. Just don&#x27;t tell anyone what your wearing and keep it different then the rest.</li>
    <li> If this what creed Aventus smells like, i def need to get me a bottle.  This smells great nice smokey fruity smell.  Only complaint is last only 3-4 hours.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  That&#x27;s why I give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t smelled Aventus, but this smells pretty nice. Definitely smell a pineapple/smokey vibe. The bad thing is the longevity on the skin, only 1-2 hours and its gone. On clothes it last a little longer.Also doesn&#x27;t project much. For the price its not bad.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent, best for night and winter!!!</li>
    <li> I got mine in the mail today and sprayed a blast on before I went to work, it smells like Swisher sweets cigars. I don&#x27;t known if I&#x27;ll wear it again it snit really  what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Smells really good I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very similar to Aventus from Creed but at a much much lower price. Projection and Longevity are not even close, but the smell and the way it progresses its right on point.</li>
    <li> this was an imitation not the real cologne</li>
    <li> A pretty cheap, and cheap-smelling, Creed Aventus clone.  If you can afford Aventus, then buy Aventus.  If not, a somewhat less costly alternative is Mancera Cedrat Boise ($160) and a really cheap alternative would be Insurrection Pure II (about $30 with shipping).  Honestly, buy Aventus since it is so much better than the clones.  However, I would go with Insurrection Pure II if you&#x27;re a college kid on a tight-budget.</li>
    <li> Great scent, and I got a compliment for a lady the first night I went out with it on. Other women just rudely sniffed me, kissed my neck, and did not give a compliment. An older lady even joined in by saying &amp;#34;That&#x27;s some nice twang you have on.&amp;#34; (Not sure if that is a compliment)</li>
    <li> Smells a lot like  grapefruit. But it doesnt smell bad. More of a summer smell.</li>
    <li> Winter scent smells like creed cologne adventis</li>
    <li> Smelled this side by side with Aventus at the mall. Very close, but it&#x27;s clear which is better quality. That said, this stuff costs $18. For that price, it&#x27;s 100% worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the snobs throwing this 2 stars, there is absolutely no reason this deserves it. I say let them participate in their conspicuous consumption, and everyone else can enjoy this very pleasant fragrance for very little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the sillage is great with this one, and it lasts several hours. I will second the comment on the crappy sprayer, however. Great product, cheap packaging. One of my better blind buys.</li>
    <li> Yup, smells a lot like Aventus and lasts on my skin. Aventus still smells better, richer (i.e., higher quality ingredients) - imo.  Nonetheless, if you are looking for inexpensive &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34;- this is great!</li>
    <li> Smell is not as strong as I expected. silage is very poor...not recommendable...</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy someone nice to wear for work and I heard about Glenn Perri&#x27;s Undpredictable Adventure. It smells like Creed&#x27;s Adventus but in a cheap way. I would not recommend this fragrance to anyone especially when you can have Perry Ellis Red or Coolwater for around the same price. Oh and I haven&#x27;t got one single compliment within fragrance.</li>
    <li> probably most sintetic that I&#x27;d expected it to be. Pretty similar to Aventus, even in the name, but I&#x27;d say it is like Aventus poorly done.&lt;br /&gt;Also the spritzer is pretty poor.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it as a house fragrance rather than a Aventus alternative for outdoors.</li>
    <li> This cologne is getting a lot of buzz, so I thought I would offer my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars simply for the initial smell.....yes, it does smell good (not great) and it actually has an Aventus vibe.....but I think these days any cologne that has pineapple in it will always be compared to Aventus.&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed two spritzes on my left arm and two on the front of my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;Directly out of the bottle this juice has NO projection (sillage)&lt;br /&gt;It was an immediate  &#x27;skin scent&#x27; on my arm as well as my shirt. I had to hold my nose at least 3 inches close to smell it, and trust me, I have a great sniffer.&lt;br /&gt;As far as longevity, it lasted about 30 minutes on my arm, and about 55 minutes on my shirt. Granted, there was a trace of something still on my shirt after the 55 minutes, but unfortunately it was a very faint, synthetic smell......similar to WD40 lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I would never recommend this cologne, not even for $20. dollars.  There&#x27;s plenty of inexpensive colognes that actually are quality juices and smell great. (see Perry Ellis&#x27; entire stock for example)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a couple bottles of Aventus over the last three years, but after finishing off the last bottle, I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to lay down that kind of cash again.  That said, I searched for \\&quot;Aventus clone\\&quot; and found this.  I don&#x27;t know if the nose who created this was actually trying to emulate Creed&#x27;s Aventus (as has been suggested here and elsewhere), but there&#x27;s definitely a certain similarity.  This has a distinctly more synthetic character to it.  At the open it gets pretty close; I get the fruit, the leather, some of the smoke, but it&#x27;s just not quite there.  After about half an hour, however, this fragrance is unbearable: The scent turns bitter (at least on my skin) and starts to smell like burnt motor oil.  That&#x27;s when I scrub it off my skin and change any clothing that may have been a part of the Unpredictable Adventure.  Unfortunate, because the first few moments with this cologne are so promising, but even at less than 20 bucks this just isn&#x27;t a keeper.</li>
    <li> This smells almost exactly like Creed&#x27;s Aventus. It focuses more on the leathery note. If you like more of the pineapple note I would get Fresco instead. I try not to spray this too much because it makes my nose hurt. I spray it on the lower half of my body.</li>
    <li> This is a non offensive scent which lasts easily for 6-8 hours.</li>
    <li> I actually got the wrong item and didn&#x27;t feel right about sending it back?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an imitation of Paco Rabane Invictus, but not as good as Invictus</li>
    <li> So fellow Amazon Cologne Connoisseur, if you&#x27;re here looking at this particular cologne, you&#x27;re probably here for the same reason I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably heard through the internet grapevine that Glenn Perri Unpredictable Adventure is a clone of Creed&#x27;s Aventus. If you did not know this, go do some research on Fragrantica or Basenotes on Creed Aventus because at the very least you should understand the bar that is being set here regardless of if you own/have owned/have smelled Aventus. The reviews and forums will speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I do not own Creed Aventus. I haven&#x27;t smelled Creed Aventus. Why? Because it&#x27;s over two hundred dollars that&#x27;s why. That&#x27;s bonkers. I don&#x27;t see the point in dropping that kind of cash on a single cologne when copies like this are rated as to be so accurate that all but those crossed with the DNA of a bloodhound can&#x27;t apparently tell the difference. I wanted to try Aventus, but not so much that I felt the need to cough up two pictures of Ben Franklin for it. I enjoy cologne collecting. I enjoy picking them apart and trying out new scents but am I a snob? No. That being said, Aventus diehards need not apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay. Rant over. Now on to the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glenn Perri Unpredictable Adventure arrived in a box that is trying to copy the Aventus box. I mean, it&#x27;s supposed to be. It&#x27;s a black box with an embossed silver plate with embossed lettering. The front of the box is ridged akin to Aventus box to match the aesthetics as closely as possible. Honestly, it&#x27;s a pretty nice box. It&#x27;s not too detailed, or loud, but it has enough to get the job done; it&#x27;s a classy box. It isn&#x27;t trying to compensate for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Unpredictable Adventure Bottle is a bit weird. I like it, but it&#x27;s weird. It can either sit upright or tilted as shown in the image; though if you try to sit the bottle upright it still has a tendency to fall backwards. The bottle is thick glass below the silver center trim and plastic above. The plastic has an edge to it probably from where it was cast or molded which is a bit of a turn off but hey, no big deal. The sprayer is a triangular button on the top close to the front of the bottle that is flush with the top. You can tell the company was trying to be unique and they were, but it wasn&#x27;t thought out perfectly. In order to get a full press, you have to keep a finger curled otherwise you won&#x27;t easily get a full spray because of the flush nature of the button; it presses into the top. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty nice. Oh, it&#x27;s a gloss finish too so fingerprints will show up on this like food stains on a white shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright now for what you&#x27;ve been waiting for. The juice itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to give the note breakdown for Aventus as that&#x27;s what Unpdredictable Adventure is trying to copy. I also couldn&#x27;t find a breakdown for this one itself. The note breakdown for Creed Aventus is top notes of blackcurrant, bergamot, apple and pineapple with a heart of rose, dry birch, Moroccan jasmine and patchouli and a base of oak moss, musk, ambergris, and vanilla. Unpredictable Adventure captures this more or less on the dot but with less pineapple on the opening; it&#x27;s there, but not as pronounced. Creed Aventus is known for having different \\&quot;batches\\&quot; that all smell different. Some have more pronounced pineapple some have a more smoky nature and Unpredictable Adventure, to my educated guess, falls into the latter; it feels more smoky and musky than these notes suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on what I read online I didn&#x27;t think this would be a fragrance I would enjoy. Smoky colognes were never big with me save for Ungaro Man. When I first sprayed this on my wrist I was \\&quot;Meh, I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is, is this what Aventus smells like? Who cares?\\&quot; Then I waited about ten minutes and that all changed. What hit my nose was a simply divine sweet, smoky, fruity fragrance that exuded confidence and masculinity. It was at this point why I iabove. The plastic has an edge to it probably from where it was cast or molded which is a bit of a turn off but hey, no big deal.

It was at this point why I imagined Aventus was such a point of contention. The depth for Glenn Perri is unreal for this price point. This cologne is mysterious; it almost makes you want to keep smelling yourself because you almost can&#x27;t believe this note combination could exist in unison. If this is what Aventus smells like, I can see why it&#x27;s so popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on Unpredictable Adventure at 7:15 AM before I left to go to work, at almost 1:00 PM I can still smell it. A quick glance at the bottom says this is a Geparlys, Paris product. I don&#x27;t know how that company did it, but the consensus across the Youtube videos and forums seems to suggest that Glenn Perri Unpredictable Adventure is a mind bogglingly close copy of one of the most popular fragrances of all time. I am incredibly satisfied with this purchase and would say that if you are into more mature colognes this could be a blind buy for the incredible low price it is. If you&#x27;re more into celebrity colognes, Ed Hardy, anything that you could probably define as inoffensive this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using every last drop of this. If Glenn Perri Unpredictable Adventure is Aventus, then I found MY Aventus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy sniffing :)</li>
    <li> A very good alternative to Creed Aventus, and come in at almost 10X cheaper.</li>
