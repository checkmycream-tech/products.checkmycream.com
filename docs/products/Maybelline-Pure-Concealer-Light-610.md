      <li>skin is fair, light shade is perfect.</li>
      <li>It is also a good concealer to use under your make-up.</li>
      <li>this is a good cover-up for bumps or inflammations that come up on my face.</li>
      <li>The price was good for something I could not find anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
      <li>Really good, not oily, matched my skin tone (for once).</li>
      <li>Great concealer for acne-disappointed this item has been discontinued in stores but thankfully I am able to find it through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I really like this concealer because it contains salicylic acid which is the best thing to eliminate blemishes.</li>
      <li>This is the best concealer I have used; It blends perfectly with my skin and looks natural, and it allows the most precise application.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this many times now.</li>
      <li>and I love it for concealer on a couple spots on my face.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite concealer product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and the pencil size</li>
      <li>I like this product because it is more than a concealer.  </li>
      <li>The best thing about it is the fact it can actually reduce pimple size very quickly, in comparison to others that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Like everyone else says, I fell in love with this product years ago (when I was in High School) and haven&#x27;t found anything as good since.  </li>
      <li>The downside it that It is very light coverage and runs out quick.</li>
      <li>Had difficulty finding it in Light.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a medium also in the event the light was lighter than my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>Good luck in finding it in local stores.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged to protect the contents.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it goes on easily, non-greasy, has salicylic acid to fight acne, and lasts a very long time!  </li>
      <li>I like this product a whole lot !  </li>
      <li>So glad to have found it on Amazon, but it seems it is getting in short supply.  </li>
      <li>I like this concealer because it comes in a pencil form so it can be applied exactly where you want</li>
      <li>I love this because of the precise tip and because it&#x27;s thick enough to conceal effectively.</li>
      <li>Very nice to have especially when dealing with the public or for a special event such as an interview.</li>
      <li>It is no longer available in stores and I can only purchase it on amazon.</li>
      <li>Maybelline REALLY screwed up when they discontinued this one</li>
      <li>Other than that, I LOVE this product</li>
      <li>This product is great for covering up small red spots and spider veins.</li>
      <li>This is a treatment with a little bit of color that is great when you first notice a red blemish and makes it go away by the next day.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t get why this product is so highly rated here,</li>
      <li>It lasts forever and covers up EVERYTHING and looks very natural on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have trouble wearing some anti-acne products because my skin is very sensitive and tends to flake off, if the chemical is too strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because there&#x27;s nothing else I&#x27;ve been able to find that works as well for concealing small problem areas, and doing it nearly invisibly.</li>
      <li>If used on large areas, especially around the eyes, you can get creasing.</li>
      <li>This concealer is very slender and is easy to use for simple touch up of small areas.</li>
      <li>Since Pure Concealer has medication to dry the pimple, it&#x27;s a win-win situation.</li>
      <li>It conceals against my very pale skin (golden undertones in my T-zone) VERY well, but not so much for my cheek areas (which have natural pink undertones).</li>
      <li>Apparently it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>

<li> Apparently it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
<li> I finally had to break the cap to get it open, so it will probably dry out before I can use it up.</li>
<li> Light shows up orange against my very pale skin, and looks cakey and dry even when I moisturize and only apply a little.</li>

<li> After applying foundation, using a magnifying mirror in a well-lighted area, carefully cover the spots or lines and blend with a make-up sponge.  </li>
<li> This one, however, could not be opened, like it was glued closed.  </li>
<li> Not good coverage on red spots and pimples, even when you layer it on, you can still see the red through the orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I agree with the other reviewers.  </li>
<li> Can be used in combination with other makeup or concealers.</li>
<li> Small tip covers just the spots you need it to.  </li>
<li> The small stick lasts forever too.</li>
<li> is it so hard to find?</li>
<li> At least you have a chance to find it here.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
<li> but on Makeupalley it&#x27;s rated very poorly.</li>
<li> I am very sad that it has been discontinued by Maybelline.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I agree with the other reviewers.  I love this product and the pencil size is perfect.  Like the other reviewers, I can no longer find this in my local stores and don&#x27;t know  why they stopped carrying this product.  But Thank Heavens for Amazon.  Please don&#x27;t stop carrying this item</li>
    <li> This is a great concealer, perfect size and formula.&lt;br /&gt;I always keep 2, 1 in the purse and 1 in make up bag.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t get this at the store anymore, I prefer this over all others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is fair, light shade is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite concealer product.  I am very sad that it has been discontinued by Maybelline.  So glad to have found it on Amazon, but it seems it is getting in short supply.  Had difficulty finding it in Light.  Great product.  Great service by seller.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged to protect the contents. The price was good for something I could not find anywhere else.  Would buy from them again without reservation.   Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> Really good, not oily, matched my skin tone (for once). Covers blemishes, can even be used as a reverse lipliner. If you look at the prices of things marketed as reverse lipliner or a nude liner then this is a total deal. Compare to the 16$ Cargo Nude Liner...</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is more than a concealer.  It also treats blemishes.  I ordered a medium also in the event the light was lighter than my skin tone.  Both are great.</li>
    <li> I had used this product for a long time, until I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. Apparently it&#x27;s been discontinued. It&#x27;s a shame, because there&#x27;s nothing else I&#x27;ve been able to find that works as well for concealing small problem areas, and doing it nearly invisibly. I wish Maybeline would reconsider the discontinuation of this item.</li>
    <li> This blemish stick actually works.  It dries out the pimple that you apply it on.  Within two days the pimple is practically gone.</li>
    <li> Light shows up orange against my very pale skin, and looks cakey and dry even when I moisturize and only apply a little. Not good coverage on red spots and pimples, even when you layer it on, you can still see the red through the orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get why this product is so highly rated here, but on Makeupalley it&#x27;s rated very poorly.</li>
    <li> I like this concealer because it comes in a pencil form so it can be applied exactly where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;Why is it so hard to find?</li>
    <li> I really like this concealer because it contains salicylic acid which is the best thing to eliminate blemishes. I read that Maybelline has discontinued this product so I was very happy to find it at Amazon.  Please continue to carry it!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it not only hides my blemishes, it also heals them.  If I don&#x27;t wear make-up this is a good cover-up for bumps or inflammations that come up on my face. It is also a good concealer to use under your make-up.</li>
    <li> Ordered for our daughter. This is the ONLY place she can find it. I think it&#x27;s being discontinued or something... But she LOVES it!!</li>
    <li> Great concealer!  I love the fact that it goes on easily, non-greasy, has salicylic acid to fight acne, and lasts a very long time!  Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect concealer! Small tip covers just the spots you need it to.  Great color, great coverage AND controls the oil!</li>
    <li> This product is great for covering up small red spots and spider veins. The pencil-thin design allows you to apply the product only where you need it. After applying foundation, using a magnifying mirror in a well-lighted area, carefully cover the spots or lines and blend with a make-up sponge.  Great results.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else says, I fell in love with this product years ago (when I was in High School) and haven&#x27;t found anything as good since.  It lasts forever and covers up EVERYTHING and looks very natural on my skin.  I&#x27;m so thankful I found this product again!!</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer I have used; It blends perfectly with my skin and looks natural, and it allows the most precise application.This is an amazing product and I won&#x27;t ever use anything else!</li>
    <li> I am assuming Maybelline does not make this any longer and I love it for concealer on a couple spots on my face.  I would highly recommend it.  Good luck in finding it in local stores.  Thank God for Amazon.l</li>
    <li> Maybelline REALLY screwed up when they discontinued this one, this was the best concealer ever made!! At least you have a chance to find it here.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they took this product off the market. It is the best cover up I have ever used. I have break out prone skin and this cover doesn&#x27;t promote zits. The pencil tip is perfect to target just the area you want to.</li>
    <li> I have trouble wearing some anti-acne products because my skin is very sensitive and tends to flake off, if the chemical is too strong. However, this product is GREAT. It conceals against my very pale skin (golden undertones in my T-zone) VERY well, but not so much for my cheek areas (which have natural pink undertones). The best thing about it is the fact it can actually reduce pimple size very quickly, in comparison to others that I&#x27;ve used. I have ordered this many times now.</li>
    <li> This is a treatment with a little bit of color that is great when you first notice a red blemish and makes it go away by the next day. Very nice to have especially when dealing with the public or for a special event such as an interview. The small stick lasts forever too.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and like the way it conceals.  This one, however, could not be opened, like it was glued closed.  I finally had to break the cap to get it open, so it will probably dry out before I can use it up.</li>
    <li> I love this because of the precise tip and because it&#x27;s thick enough to conceal effectively. Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> I like this product a whole lot !  IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;It covers well  and seems almost invisible!&lt;br /&gt;Yes,  I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> This concealer is very slender and is easy to use for simple touch up of small areas. Can be used in combination with other makeup or concealers. It is low cost compared to other concealers. I keep it on hand at all times. The only draw back is that it is for small areas, not large. If used on large areas, especially around the eyes, you can get creasing. Other than that, I LOVE this product</li>
    <li> Love this product! I am a grandma and still get an occasional pimple. This concealer not only covers the zit, yet works well when applying face powder over it.  Since Pure Concealer has medication to dry the pimple, it&#x27;s a win-win situation. It is no longer available in stores and I can only purchase it on amazon. Please do not stop carrying this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this concealer because it has a low toxicity rating on the EWG Skin Deep Website. The downside it that It is very light coverage and runs out quick.</li>
    <li> Great concealer for acne-disappointed this item has been discontinued in stores but thankfully I am able to find it through Amazon. Nothing compares to this Maybelline stick!!!</li>
