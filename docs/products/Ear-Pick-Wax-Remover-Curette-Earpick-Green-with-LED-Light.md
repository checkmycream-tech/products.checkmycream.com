      <li>It works good and it has a bright light.  </li>
      <li>nice product.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m good :).</li>
      <li>Nice LED Q-tip cleaning tool, but the plastic handle fall apart if you hand it too often.</li>
      <li>I did not disassemble it to see what kind of cell batteries it takes.</li>
      <li>He was so good about having me try to flush out the ear wax many times and put in the softening ear drops, but that wax wouldn&#x27;t move.</li>
      <li>Since I now own one of these, I will have to try to think of an alternative use for it that doesnt involve inserting it into a body cavity.</li>
      <li>All attachments can be handily stored inside the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Both boys have tried debrox and peroxide with warm water.  </li>
      <li>good light n good use twizzers can be made better but still gets the job done...</li>
      <li>You can hurt someone VERY easily by poking around with it</li>
      <li>The top head piece that goes into your ear loosens up very quickly and easily and will just sort of fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery for the light is great though, as I&#x27;ve had mine for months and haven&#x27;t had to change the battery once!</li>
      <li>The product itself is good and cheap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ever found at any store and this one is by far the BEST!  </li>
      <li>It really is a bright led light..</li>

      <li>This earwax removal tool is the best one I have tried so far.</li>
      <li>The light is bright.</li>
      <li>The light is really bright.  </li>
      <li>The light is quite bright, the three attachements store in the handle&#x27;s end</li>
      <li>So far this is my best purchase for under 1 buck.  </li>
      <li>LED quit working and VERY cheaply made.</li>
      <li>The ends don&#x27;t stay on, it&#x27;s very cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>Granted, it is very cheap, but</li>
      <li>Trying to dig it out can do more harm than good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If, when trying to retrieve a chunk of wax, it happens to get pushed farther into the canal, one would be better off using an ear-wax softener and syringe to remove the wax plug in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>it was inexpensive :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product for two purposes... to clean my toddler&#x27;s ears and to check his ears for anything unusual.&lt;br /&gt;The LED light is great for illuminating the ear canal so you can check in the ears for things like ear wax or dried blood.</li>
    <li> Worked for some time, but one tool broke after ~6 months, and the connecting portion became too loose at ~7 months. It&#x27;s probably a good idea to glue one of the attachments that you use onto the LED unit.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Very cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;Took over a month till I received it since it came from China.&lt;br /&gt;It does work, but can be broken easily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter&#x27;s ear. It works good and arrived as planned. I would def buy it again. The light is very bright and you can see really good.</li>
    <li> Budget friendly tool, but with flaws. This is not a perfect tool. I&#x27;ve had 3 or 4 of them and use them about once every 10 days on my kid. You should get about 8 months of use out of it. I have to take a nail file (a fine grained one) and smooth down the edges of the semi-clear plastic scoops, because they are too sharp when new. If you are considering this, then buy a couple as the battery will wear out within a year (good luck trying to replace the battery). Also, the unit is extremely easy to break where the tips fit into the base. I have had to repair with scotch tape on some. It works. Hopefully, you understand the drawbacks now. For my kid&#x27;s ears, I absolutely need this tool.</li>
    <li> The Amazon description and even the product instructions describe this as taking AA or AAA batteries but it actually uses 3 button cells. The light is LED. You may know these buttons can cost many times more than the value if the item to replace. The light is usefully bright with or without the probes installed and will work as a compact flashlight in a pinch. In any case it&#x27;s only a buck. Shipped straight from China in less time than predicted.</li>
    <li> Unlike the metal ones, this is plastic so my son seems to be able to tolerate it better.</li>
    <li> Price is right (cheap) and shipping (from China?) is fast.&lt;br /&gt;A great help in getting the ear wax out. I use to hold a flash light in one hand and open up the ear with this same hand, and get the cleaning tool by other hand. This make ear cleaning more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Cheap and attachment wouldn&#x27;t stay on. Good idea but useless. Should have sent it back.</li>
    <li> While US Pediatricians strongly urge parents to leave the earwax removal to professionals, people in Asia do this all the time. I was able to see the earwax with the light and gently scoop out the canal.  The big scoop and the tweezers were too big for his 9 year old ears but the smaller scoop worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: DO NOT try this on yourself or go too deeply in the canal.  It&#x27;s long enough to do some real damage.</li>
    <li> It was not the item or brand as pictured. I ordered 3 of these thinking it had the same quality as one&#x27;s I had ordered in the past from a different seller. Now I know why these are less expensive. Poor quality. Soft, bendable plastic. One of them had the name&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;DOMECI&amp;#34;, the other 2 were blank and could barely be switched on without damaging them. I&#x27;ll spend the extra dollar for the good ones next time not these crappy ones.</li>
    <li> Its well lighted and not extremely flimsy. The tips are delicate and you definitely have to use care and common sense.</li>
    <li> Took a while to receive and one of them had a dead light. However they were exactly as shown on the photo and are as sturdy as what I had in the past.  Great for cleaning my kids ears. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool to use to get rid of wax in hard to reach places.  I used this tool first and then the ear drops and water pick.  Cheaper then going to the doctor when you go deaf.</li>
    <li> I really like it until it started to break-off.  If often use, it probably last you two weeks.  But you get what you paid for.  CHEAP</li>
    <li> Life saver for us to see ears of my kids...</li>
    <li> This is what I want. The light is very convenient for picking inside stuff out.  But the eage is a little bit sharp,which is the reason I took away a star.</li>
    <li> Works well and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! Terrible product. Made from extremely cheap plastic. Things that should stay attached to the green light/battery section wont stay connected. Light doesn&#x27;t work. Everything the ad and packaging claims are false, (at least with my own experience) I will NEVER buying it or any aimilar tools, I would NOT recommending this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Light starts off very bright but then flickers and becomes very dim (almost no light). Unable to use at all after 5 minutes. Still works well for self cleaning.</li>
    <li> This tool is wonderful for ears and also a great too for blackhead removal. The tweezers are useless but I never found their purpose anyway.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moC39N2L5P79MF]]I am a family nurse practitioner working in multiple locations that don&#x27;t always have the tools and supplies I would like. Because I am always on the go, I need tools that are small, light, reusable, and battery rather than plug in operated where applicable. I love that this product stores its accessories within the handle so that they do not become lost. This is comparable to the Bionix product, but rather than disposable light sources (not very green)- this one is designed for longer term use. I do wish it had a clip on magnifier like the Bionix product ([[ASIN:B0013Y761I Bionix Lighted Ear Curette Kit - Box of 50 - Model 2245]]), but for the substantial savings, re-usability, and pocket friendly design, I can live with this- especially since it comes with the light up tweezer attachment- never seen that before! It seems like the tool ends might eventually break, but for the low price, I can deal with that. With this being an import product, it takes a little while to get here, so I think I may order a second one to have a backup!&lt;br /&gt;It goes without saying, but just to be on the safe side: this is not intended to be used on your own ear! I recommend this tool for professionals only.</li>
    <li> These really are great to look in your ears and look for ear wax or if your child has an ear ache and you need to check and see how bad the ear looks. The Ear Pick is really easy to use, you just need to be very careful not to poke the ear and just remove the wax that you can see, The light really helps the job of removing was so much simpler.</li>
    <li> For the price and material, this is one great little curet.  The light works well to light up the ear canal and it comes with two different sized heads for different sized ear canals and a tweezers attachment.  All attachments can be handily stored inside the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a medical professional, I would caution anyone buying this to be very careful when using it on another to remove wax.  The small spoon-shaped heads are sharp plastic, and the ear canal&#x27;s tissue is fragile and sensitive.  It can be easily damaged as can the ear drum itself.  One should try not to make direct contact with the walls of the ear canal.  If, when trying to retrieve a chunk of wax, it happens to get pushed farther into the canal, one would be better off using an ear-wax softener and syringe to remove the wax plug in my opinion.  Trying to dig it out can do more harm than good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curet was received in good time.  It is made in China and is well-made; however, you have to remember that you&#x27;re not buying a professional curet; you&#x27;re getting a plastic curet with a bonus light that lights the ear canal very well.  For what it is, it works very well, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing:  The packaging states that \\&quot;this product uses AA battery.\\&quot;  It does not; it takes cell batteries.  I did not disassemble it to see what kind of cell batteries it takes.</li>
    <li> Tool works great, want to buy another, thanks.</li>
    <li> The edge of the attachments is rough and had to be filed down to get the burrs off. Besides that it works okay.</li>
    <li> Nice LED Q-tip cleaning tool, but the plastic handle fall apart if you hand it too often. good for the price.</li>
    <li> Gets a little lose after a few uses</li>
    <li> The pieces fall out easily and falls inside ear.</li>
    <li> I Bourgt this for my son because this tool has flashlight eazy for my to clean his ear&#x27;s. It is very good quality.</li>
    <li> Cheap stuff from China but still works, nothing to complain with this price. Using many times for my little one, the light still not dead.</li>
    <li> One of the tips broke off before it could even be used and the other tip edges were so rough I would be afraid of cutting into anyone.  It is complete garbage.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it say it is. I just don&#x27;t like the feel of it , would rather use a hair pin.</li>
    <li> This thing is dangerous even in the hands of an experienced health care professional. I can&#x27;t imagine what would happen if a child picked up any of the pieces and tried to use them. It is very poorly made and the parts are easily misplaced. Since I now own one of these, I will have to try to think of an alternative use for it that doesnt involve inserting it into a body cavity.</li>
    <li> I really like the flashlight feature, although I imagine it&#x27;s only useful if you&#x27;re using it on someone else. My husband and I like this so much we&#x27;ve purchased 3 of them. The battery lasts about a 1/2 year in our experience and it&#x27;s so cheap we&#x27;ve been replacing the whole thing.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical but they are just perfect - hubby loves them too.  Economical and easy to carry with you....</li>
    <li> good light n good use twizzers can be made better but still gets the job done...extra tools were handy ok</li>
    <li> This is your typical Made in China cheapo plastic product. I had to take a nail file to the edges of the scoop to smooth them down. Jagged plastic edges. OUCH! It does light if you jiggle it a bit and then play with the positioning to actually use the light. Only buy it if you can get it really cheap and don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 of these since they&#x27;re cheaper than buying the batteries. They get the job done. The plastic tips are not all created equally. Some are rougher or smoother than others. Tweezers don&#x27;t last - one tweezer came all wonky. Some tips fit better in the handle than others. Helpful in getting out earwax out of my kids&#x27; ears regularly before a trip to the doctor for impacted earwax.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, very goo seller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much bought every lighted ear cleaner I&#x27;ve ever found at any store and this one is by far the BEST!  It&#x27;s very CHEAP, the light is VERY bright, and it&#x27;s the only one that&#x27;s come with two sizes of picks (the 3rd tool is a set of clear tweezers). Great item!</li>
    <li> Brilliant invention, and very useful. It is best to have somebody else remove your earwax for you instead of poking around your ear by yourself. The light accompanying this pick is adequate and is so much easier than trying to use a small flashlight because you&#x27;d then have to use a separate hand to hold the flashlight.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more cheaply built...Not a problem. Still works.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers should be re-designed...can&#x27;t be used when inserted into the ear.</li>
    <li> Love it. I order it every few months. It is always what I expect. Cleans ears great. Will be back</li>
    <li> Broke when I got it. It looked like a toy that someone would get out of a quarter machine.</li>
    <li> The switch for the light doesn&#x27;t work well so you have to hold it in the exact right position to keep it on. The spoon part has sharp edges from where the plastic is molded together. I realize it was only .98 cents but save your money. It took about 3 weeks to ship as well.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for...I wait long time to received damage product. waste my time waste my money so disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product could use more light and batteries seem to run right threw it ..</li>
    <li> The product fell apart before it was ever even used. I would not reccomend to anyone to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> The ends don&#x27;t stay on, it&#x27;s very cheap plastic. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend even though it&#x27;s cheap price because none of the ends will stay on. I had to tape them on to use them.</li>
    <li> I have a strange obsession with clean ears so I am constantly picking at my families ears. Well this little gadget makes it easier to do that AND get all the crappy crap out of their ears.</li>
    <li> First thoughts, it does light up the tip well, but not very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the biggest reason I picked this one is it said its powered by 1x AAA. Nope... Not a AAA but a small watch like battery that is inaccessible.</li>
    <li> It works great! I use it to clean my child&#x27;s ear, she loves it better than q-tips! Such a great product.</li>
    <li> Works as intended. The tiny flash not only helps seeing inside the ear, it can be used for other purposes too, e.g. checking mouth.</li>
    <li> LED quit working and VERY cheaply made.</li>
    <li> i Purchase this item because my little got wax in her ear and i din&#x27;t want to put a Q-tip so i purchase this and she love it. you have to be like always be careful but it works great..</li>
    <li> Light doesn&#x27;t really work. Disappointed I waited so long for this.</li>
    <li> I have used and ordered one of the ear cleaners before.  The last time we purchased (from a different seller) we rec&#x27;d the cleaner in a plastic package, sealed (i.e. CLEAN!) The two I ordered from this seller arrived loose in the shipping envelope only!  How do I even know it&#x27;s not been used?! Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;I was also very disappointed to see that it runs on 3 small cell/button type batteries.  I specifically bought this one because on the product description it states that it is powered by 1x AAA battery.  Having a toddler, I try to avoid the button batteries whenever possible due to the danger.</li>
    <li> this is a pretty good tool to use for tonsil stones as someone else recommended. It is coming from China so it does take a long time but worth the wait for the price. I still have to say that nothing works as well as a metal tool for popping pimples. It is long and sturdy and just works best. You need to use a light as well, so that is the tricky part.</li>
    <li> Look at the price! It is what it is and it does do the job. We used it on our son and it worked fine. For the money, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> For a pediatrician&#x27;s office, these work very well. The light is bright. It&#x27;s lightweight. They&#x27;ve lasted long. Very inexpensive too.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! Took forever to get here and it is very fragile. Be carful not to break it!</li>
    <li> its not the best tool to clean your ear but it helps a small tool for a bigger job, just be careful not to hurt yourself</li>
    <li> When the item finally came weeks later! The item was broken. The item was poorly package with no protection what so ever. Its not very durable so the slightest thing will break it. It was in a small envelope. Contacted the company and they only wanted pictures nothing has been done to make this right</li>
    <li> This was such a disappointment. Is there no quality control in some places? The green housing was falling apart on arrival, but at least the LED light is super bright. However the ear cleaning plastic part had little sharp tags on them, rendering them useless. Not something I would recommend buying, the metal ones without a light were much better. I ended up giving my toddler the green handle as a toy. A piece of tape kept the housing together, but i still would not use it for its intended purpose. I tried to order something cheap and I got something cheaply made. I&#x27;d say the fault partially falls on me since it was my choice, but not a choice I would not make again. Save your money and do not order this or one made like this.</li>
    <li> As a physician, I&#x27;m always looking for better ways to clean ears. I currently use my otoscope and a curette. This seemed like a good idea. It isn&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t see the ear canal well with this in it, and it is not any better than my current method. I guess for kids&#x27; ears it may work better because of the shorter canals, but for adults, it leaves a lot to be desired. Plus, it&#x27;s not very bright..</li>
    <li> theyre not good :( im dissapointed</li>
    <li> It would have worked well...but fell apart first use. Poorly constructed...cheap...cheap...cheap. Do not order. Takjes three weeks to get and then it isn&#x27;t worth it</li>
    <li> My three year old son had a chunk of hard ear wax in both his ears. He was so good about having me try to flush out the ear wax many times and put in the softening ear drops, but that wax wouldn&#x27;t move. So soon as I got this tool I used it on him right away. I pulled out a BIG chunk of wax with this awesome tool showed it to him and he said lets do the other side. Tool worked perfect on his little ear. The light on it was the ticket to safely see. With little kids you need to have a still kid to use this tool. The tools that go on it are plastic not metal so they don&#x27;t scrape or poke. I know I will be using this tool in the future. It saved me a trip to the Dr. ,money, time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m assuming this device is helpful and reasonably safe for careful laypeople</li>
    <li> Product is ok but the plastic tip doesn&#x27;t stay on when cleaning the ear. It comes out which is a little dangerous</li>
    <li> THE EAR PICK DOES NOT STAY INTHE HOLDER WHEN USING.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE BUT THE LIGHTING OF THIS UNIT IS VERY GOOD.</li>
    <li> I really just use it to view my childs ear to see if she has buildup. The tools aren&#x27;t that great for scooping the wax out unless it&#x27;s extremely soft or loose.</li>
    <li> the idea behind this tool is fabulous, lighting up a dark space so you can work on getting the crud out.  However it is very cheaply made and the scraping tool has sharp edges on the mold lines that can be very painful.  It also helps to have the otoscope to see the inside of the ear first before you go sticking something like this in there.</li>
    <li> I got the in a very good time given where it was coming from. I got it and was happy to use it, it worked wonders.</li>
    <li> I only paid $.78 for this, and I still feel like I got ripped off.  It took forever to get here - almost a month, and it it so poorly made, it went in the garbage immediately.  The tips don&#x27;t fit on the base securely, so they do not work when trying to get wax out of the ear.  I guess if you only wanted a flashlight, it would work.</li>
    <li> Holy crap! You should have seen the size of the cockroach I pulled out of my girlfriends son&#x27;s ear!  It had grandchildren already! After removal, he said the voices in his head stopped!</li>
    <li> i am surprised these even lit up! these fell apart too easily, thank god they didnt even last long enough to actually stick in our ears!!</li>
    <li> I order this product atleast once a month. It is safer than a qtip and more accurate to remove all the wax!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time tonight on my 84 year-old mother.  I was extremely nervous at first because there is a great potential that you could harm the ear if you are not careful.  However, with proper care and a steady hand it worked extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this!</li>
    <li> This little tool was better than I thought. I am able to see much better in my children&#x27;s and my husband&#x27;s ears. It is brighter than I thought it would be. It is a little cheaply made but it does the trick.</li>
    <li> this item seemed like a great deal. and it is if you need to do someone elses ears but you can not safely do your ears with this item</li>
    <li> One of the interchangeable parts wasn&#x27;t in the package, but wasn&#x27;t worth returning since it came from CHINA!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this little tool!! My 1-year-old son gets frequent ear infections, and this tool makes it super easy to get any wax out of the way so I can check his ear drums with my otoscope. It&#x27;s not the highest quality plastic and it did take a long time to be delivered, but the functionality is great (I haven&#x27;t had any issue with the attachments not staying put as some others have mentioned). I also ordered the Ototek Loop; it&#x27;s decent but it was really hard to see what I was doing in his little ears! The flashlight on this tool totally solves that problem and I don&#x27;t even use the Ototek Loop at all anymore. Very happy with this purchase  : )</li>
    <li> Fell apart on first use.</li>
    <li> Lights up well. I sell these to moms whose kids have chronic wax in their ears.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this cheap product the spoon part was not smooth enough so it hurt not to mention it didn&#x27;t scoop out much wax at all</li>
    <li> fell apart, doesnt work. flimsy from opening the package. eventually broke into several pieces. dont buy it. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this product, i reorder them and give em as gifts to other moms who have kids. Best way to keep their ears clean. ***UPDATE** I received this product today because I misplaced my previous one. BUT this one has an issue with the light. When you turn the light on, it starts to blink, which makes it impossible to use.  I&#x27;ll be contacting the seller and ask for an exchange, it could be just a bad one.</li>
    <li> this is the best ear cleaning tool ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it was inexpensive :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the best dollar or so spent on ears</li>
    <li> Works great. The light made it so easy to use. I don&#x27;t know how they can sell them so cheap.</li>
    <li> These work great but make sure the person assisting you doesn&#x27;t go too deep with it.</li>
    <li> I use it regularly.  It is very useful.  The light helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> Description says it is powered by 1 AAA battery but it isn&#x27;t. The whole thing is just cheaply made and comes apart easily, including the attachments. I would not recommend using this on a child.</li>
    <li> This made things so easy on getting those balls of ear wax out of their heads. Thanks so, so much.</li>
    <li> Its The beast ear cleaning tool  I ever used easy to use does not hurt&lt;br /&gt;Espacialy for older peopel thank you</li>
    <li> A decent product, but the attachments don&#x27;t stay on. I would think there is a better product that does the same out there that is safer. You just don&#x27;t want the attachment falling into your child&#x27;s ear when you are looking in there!</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically because it is labeled AAA battery in the description but it is using another type of battery.</li>
    <li> This wobbles around when you&#x27;re trying to get wax, the picks come off the handle easily, and the little bowls that collect the wax are sharp... I highly recommend Dr. Mom Otoscope.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, but isn&#x27;t very sturdy. Looks like it may break easily.</li>
    <li> This product looks very similar like one that is advertised for tonsil stones but is a lot cheaper so I decided to buy this instead. It worked fine for that, was able to get in there and take some out that I would not have been able to without this tool. The tip can become lose if you do not attach it well, so be careful. It is cheaply made, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Ordered 5 and as soon as I used the first one the battery went out. I hope the others function as expected.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed to see that one of the attachments was missing. The product also appeared scratched like it was used.  Gave two stars because of those reasons, although the tool itself is very decent, considering the price.  The item is not worth returning - I got mine from the seller that offers shipping from Amazon Prime, but I don&#x27;t think that is the way to go.  Probably more worth it to take your chances with a less expensive seller.</li>
    <li> I ordered a couple of these figuring that if one didn&#x27;t work then the othter would. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with these yet. I was able to use this to get a glob out of my youngest child left ear that I could see but couldn&#x27;t get to, had tried the sweet oil &amp; stool softener in her ear massaging it while she laid down a couple of times to no avail. I used the smallest of the attachments to scoop/hook the glob &amp; it came right out with no problems. The light is quite bright, the three attachements store in the handle&#x27;s end &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price of 98 cents. My only complaint is the shipping takes forever but it was free shipping for China &amp; actually arrived a week early.</li>
    <li> Came broken. Wasnt worth a penny</li>
    <li> ...and it will be the last. Ouch! I actually bought it to clean my daughter&#x27;s ears, and she complained that it hurt, even when I was being super careful. I tried it on myself and it did hurt!</li>
    <li> nice product.  light weight, very bright and i like all the different tips that are included.  replacing an older AA regular flashlight  bulb type cleaner.  i&#x27;m sure the batteries will last quite a long time!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly great little tool :)</li>
    <li> This little guy has been used several times to look into the ear, nose and mouth of adults and children.  It even works great to get a fuzz ball out of an adults ear with the tweezers attachment.  The scoop attachment works great at getting the orange discharge out of ears when we are sick. It also works great at getting the blackheads that sometimes lurk in the ears.  Husband is a first responder and he carries one in his bag. I even have given one to my in laws and they use it as well.  It has a strong light and I love how the attachments light up.  Makes seeing what you are doing so much easier.</li>
    <li> had sharp plastic pieces sticking out of the part that is supposed to go into the ear, you would cut yourself if you used this</li>
    <li> Use it to clean ears then after you throw the tips out, it is a flashlight. I wish someone would make a reasonably priced handle with batteries you could replace and inexpensive single use tips. Bionix seems overpriced to me</li>
    <li> No original packaging. Not three accessories but rather 2 because the scoops are the same size (not a small and a large scoop). Poor molding so there are gaps. I&#x27;ve purchased supposedly the same product from a different company on amazon last year and it was for the same price but came with original packaging and had better molding. Plus it came with 3 accessories rather than 2 same ones and 1 different accessory. Was wanting to use this in our clinic but it looks too cheap and is too flimsy. The other company&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t as bad as this one and was able to use in a different clinic last year. Had liked it so bought three of these this time thinking it was the same. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cheap! Doesn&#x27;t work! Waste of money! Fell apart as I just turned it on!</li>
    <li> Horrible piece of plastic! The light doesn&#x27;t stay on either. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I saw many reviews about this having the tip being sharp. I tried it, and I don&#x27;t think so. I was planning to file down the mold flashes, but I don&#x27;t find any. The little clip works great since I can use it to pick up the larger piece of ear wax from my kid so she won&#x27;t be scared when I need to &amp;#34;scape&amp;#34; it out. I think the little kids have more sensitivity so even a light scraping in the ear seems lot more painful. I used a smaller tip for the kids and works great. The lighting is great for both tips and the clip. I can see better and my actions can be faster. I do recommend to practice the technique so that the kids won&#x27;t be scared. The body seems loose but it doesn&#x27;t bothered me since this is a simple tool. It&#x27;s nice that you can change batteries and a small space to store 2 accessories. It does the job.</li>
    <li> Excellent instrument for ear war removal when used by skilled, healthcare professionals.  A must for any pediatric provider.</li>
    <li> It is very interested to see the the flashlight and imagine the light in your ears. The product itself is good and cheap.</li>
    <li> Spoon end is helpful, but the quality of the product seems a bit less than desired. Doesn&#x27;t need to be metal, but the edges of the ear wax spoon ends are a little rough.</li>
    <li> Units are well made and should last for many years of use.  I don&#x27;t understand why they have the builtin flash light?</li>
    <li> An amazing handy tool indeed. It does a really good job cleaning your ear with three different set of accessories.</li>
    <li> Light doesn&#x27;t work well and tips are rough</li>
    <li> Its cheap but upon placing the heads are a little bit unstable. I&#x27;am careful upon using this product because it feels it going to come off whenever I use it. the light is very bright when actually using it.</li>
    <li> A little flimsy, cheaply made but works better than all other tools I have owned, definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping takes lonnnnnnng</li>
    <li> received earlier than expected, will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect thing for checking for ear wax and removing ear wax.  I ordered another one from a different company because I thought they were different.  This was came earlier and was quite a bit less expensive.</li>
    <li> It is cheap in all areas from cost to purchase to quality. It broke after three days. I could return it but why would I want another one.</li>
    <li> works great.  the only piece that&#x27;s less than satisfactory is the tweezer.  it&#x27;s pretty much useless because of its length.  due to having to squeeze it when operating it, your fingers already take up to an inch of the surface of the tweezer so it doesn&#x27;t go in as far.  the other tools work great.</li>
    <li> dab the ligth not funtion</li>
    <li> The light is very bright so it illuminates perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The different accessories are really helpful too so it has been very satisfying.</li>
    <li> Its cheap quality, but what can you expect for its price? it came a full week before I was expecting it to, which is nice. even though it seems like it&#x27;ll break easily, I was able to pull a huge chunk of impacted skin/ear wax out of my sister&#x27;s ear with no problem. she used to get her ears surgically debrided, but this&#x27;ll make it easier to do it at home. I got this as a sort of trial to see if this instrument would work for her, and it does. I&#x27;ll probably invest in a better quality one soon.</li>
    <li> For 2 bucks it is made well and should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;A great tool for reaching into dark holes and putting some light in there.&lt;br /&gt;Its shipped from China so it took several weeks to get it.</li>
    <li> It is made out of plastic, it is not fancy or perfect. There is a room for improvement but for the cost, it is well worth it. My best friend had a baby and I purchased one of this for him</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. It is so useful.</li>
    <li> It is inexpensive for a reason.  Still a nice light to check out the granddaughter&#x27;s ears with while it lasts.</li>
    <li> Crappy, cheap plastic. The plastic attachments won&#x27;t stay on. The light barely works on it. It&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
    <li> There were no 3 attachments as stated in the description of this product.  It is very cute, the light is bright on it and it has only one attachment on the tip of it already placed.  I&#x27;m disappointed that it came without the attachments, and it took quite a long time to be delivered over 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Granted it came on time but now without the other attachments it&#x27;s not as useful as I thought it would be.  I will not buy it again.  I previously stated that I should of bought two of them but I had no idea that there were no attachments  I simply did not look inside the green hand peace for them.</li>
    <li> Very very very bad!!!</li>
    <li> these work great.  small and cheap but gets the job done so what more can you want.  good for cleaning someone else&#x27;s ear basically as you can not see into your own ear of course.  be careful not to scrap may also have to file down rough edges.  I love these and ordered 4 more for others who saw ours and wanted one.  good stocking stuffer or something a little extra.</li>
    <li> The light really helps to see. It&#x27;s flimsy and cheaply made but I didn&#x27;t pay more than a dollar for it so I&#x27;m good :).</li>
    <li> Ordered five of these from Deal Simple and four were packed wrong. Three had two adult tips instead of one adult and children tip and another was missing the teeth part. Only paid a buck apiece for them so be careful.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  It have bright  light that help you to see very well. It comes with 3 button cell battery.  I highly recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> The quality is cheap like the price! I like using it and it works freat with my 21 months old daughter. But the quality is really bad that each time I use I feel that I&#x27;m gonna break it! Howeever, It collects wax very well :)</li>
    <li> Poor quality because it&#x27;s cheap!!</li>
    <li> Really disappointed in the quality of  this product.  The pieces are falling off that is they are becoming detached from each other even with the slightest of handling.  I purchased a while back, several White Ear cleaning tools that looked exactly like the Green one BUT the White plastic ones were strong, unfortunately the batteries died. I should have thought about replacing the tiny batteries rather than repurchasing.  I removed the batteries from the new shipment and put them in my strong white ear cleaning tools.  It is a simple procedue.  The small batteries, when purchased alone, are not expensive.</li>
    <li> The batteries are all rusty and i can&#x27;t even turn the light on. the package is all dusty and very poor quality.</li>
    <li> This earwax removal tool is the best one I have tried so far. Since the shaft is lighted it makes it very easy to see the wax buildup and scoop it out without going too far into the ear canal. Also the price was unbelievable, under two dollars with free shipping. Will buy again if I need another one.</li>
    <li> My pick was missing one attachment, but for the price, I can&#x27;t complain. It was a really good deal, the light worked fine, it did the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> The tool is neat, compact and comes with batteries.  Although the description states it is A type batteries, it is actually more like watch batteries.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love the light. Makes cleaning easy.</li>
    <li> I mean for a buck you can&#x27;t really give it a bad rating. It doesn&#x27;t reach the core of the ear.</li>
    <li> Looked for something like this to clean outer surface of daughters ear.  Light shines through it.  I think it should only be used by an adult.</li>
    <li> I was so excited the first time I used this on my son&#x27;s ear. It makes you see the inside of the ear and for less than a dollar a piece, nothing can beat that. It is very fragile so you just have to be very careful when using it. And I didn&#x27;t even care that it takes almost a month before I received my first order (it&#x27;s shipped from Hongkong) that I ordered 6 more units to give away to friends.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price of this tool.  The light on it is great.  My 7 year old had glue ear (and subsequently had his tonsils and adenoids removed later in the year).  He allowed me to use the product but was scared.  He said it hurt when I pulled the wax out (about the size of a quarter between both ears).  He immediately said, \\&quot;will you stop talking so loud.\\&quot;  It was clear he couldnt hear us prior to the cleaning.  He even had his speech evaluated because of it and started correcting himself after the tonsils and adenoid were removed and the wax was removed.  My 4 year old has a lot of wax but small tonsils and no hearing problems.  He will not allow me to put this tool in his ear.  He said it hurts.  Both boys have tried debrox and peroxide with warm water.  Peroxide seemed to help with hearing but didn&#x27;t remove the wax.  Its good to soften the wax prior to using this removing tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, this tool only lasted about 9 months before the light dimmed and the cap holding the cleaning qtip cracked, allowing the tip to fall into the ear.  I had to throw it away.  But, I am on here today to purchase another one.  I use it on my 8 month old daughter.  I also use hylands ear drops on my kids and they never had ear infections.  I start them when they begin a bad cold and it prevents them.</li>
    <li> Worth the price and functional but cheaply built</li>
    <li> Use it often! See thru part comes off easily so be sure to steady it!</li>
    <li> The perfect tool for cleaning ears!!</li>
    <li> The first thing that put me off about this product is in the picture it looked more like the J type of end and not the spoon end, i never liked the spoon end due to it not being very quick to clean, but despite that i still used it, its edges are rigid and harsh to the ear, the tool dosent want to stay attached to the flashlight part and falls off while in use(All upon day 1 out the package), and it is overall a very very cheap product that no one should get, im going to stick to the bamboo ear cleaners even though their use is limited they are at least reliable for a few months instead of just a day.</li>
    <li> First off, they sent me a pink one instead of the green one pictured.  Also, I knew it was going to be cheap, but the quality is even worse than I thought.  The body is very flimsy and feels like it could fall apart at any moment.  And the tips are rough enough to scratch my ear.  I had to take fine sandpaper and smooth it out before use.  It also took over a month to receive it.  I would NOT recommend this.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve always used a flashlight in one hand while trying to clean my child&#x27;s ear with the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, without a doubt, the easiest and most convenient tool I&#x27;ve come across.  Wish I found this years ago. And I can&#x27;t complain about the price either.</li>
    <li> Got yellow one. Eventually broke into several pieces. dont buy it. Total waste of money. dont buy it. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Finally I can see the little ears well enough to do the work right.  Great invention, good price.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I use it to clean the ear wax out of my son&#x27;s ears. I&#x27;ve changed the attachment and then used it to remove tonsil stones.</li>
    <li> This took for ever to get and it was BROKEN.  If you don&#x27;t have a lot of wax in your ear, it may be worth the wait.  If you can make a candle out of your ear wax this isn&#x27;t for you.  If you have a terminal disease or are very old you probably are wasting your money.</li>
    <li> Came broken and missing parts.  Not worth returning for $1.99 and it took too long to get to me.  They ship from Hong Kong (I think.)</li>
    <li> As a mom i loved this product, i use this to clean my toddlers ears and the light really helps me do it easily unlike the regular ear cleaning tools out there. The reason why i rated it 3 stars is because it says it comes with the THREE ACCESSORIES, however it came with ONLY ONE ACCESSORY.</li>
    <li> The light lasted about a week before not turning on anymore. The light was dim and dull to begin with.</li>
    <li> It arrived in 7-10 days for me so not bad at all! Works great! Some might think it&#x27;s scratchy but hey don&#x27;t assume you should use everything right out of the box. Before sticking it in the ears, I feel the tip with my fingertips, and my lips, to see if the finish is rough. It was kinda rough so I use fingernail file to file it down a bit. Finally it feel very smooth then I know it&#x27;s time to put it to good use.</li>
    <li> I love the product, I use it on both of my kids, I need to to make sure that I clean it everytime I use it.  I love the light&#x60; that its on it, it makes it alot easier to see inside the ears.</li>
    <li> Got this because my husbands ears are terrible. it came last night and asap i was ready to use. it says it takes aa batteries(NO) it doesnt.. but it does have a compartment at the bottom so you can put the other pieces in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all it is worth it but the part i dnt like is it takes small batteries</li>
    <li> Yay now I can really clean my kids ears..  It really is a bright led light.. Just a note.. It said it takes aa battery but it&#x27;s actually those small tablet ones.. MOre expensive than the digger itself.. I rather just buy a new one.</li>
    <li> Very bright innovation! For years we&#x27;ve used a simple metal tool and struggled for the bad visibility. This little device has a self-illuminated head, which bright enough to see everything inside ear tunnel, and make the wax cleaning much easier, and most important, safer. So far, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to change the battery. May be never bother to change the battery because the tool is so cheap, just bought a bunch of them filling up the bathroom drawer.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this ear cleaning product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is a cheap toy that was made in China&lt;br /&gt;- You can hurt someone VERY easily by poking around with it&lt;br /&gt;- This is NOT a professional instrument, not medical grade at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: NONE. If you want to clean your ears, use what the professionals use, an \\&quot;Elephant Ear Washer Bottle\\&quot;. It works very well without risking damaging a sensitive ear.

    <li> I love this tool! The LED light is why I bought it. I couldn&#x27;t do without it. I&#x27;ve used it to get huge pieces of earwax out of my children&#x27;s ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries are easily replaceable, and they only cost 13 cents each. The size is LR41.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor complaint is that the tips aren&#x27;t very secure, so you have to keep pushing them back on to make sure they don&#x27;t fall off. I plan to superglue the tip on mine. I&#x27;ll buy a second unit for the tweezers accessory and glue that on as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Common sense: Be careful when using it! Make sure no one will bump into you. Make sure your child&#x27;s head won&#x27;t move when you&#x27;re using it. Stay FAR away from the eardrum. Only remove large obstructions. Don&#x27;t go obsessive compulsive and try to get everything out. Minor obstructions are harmless!</li>
    <li> Cheap looking...it wasn&#x27;t even in a packages and plus it came only with one accessory the one shown, not three.</li>
    <li> I had a plain cleaner before to do my wife&#x27;s ears, but could never see inside her ears clearly. Trying to hold a flashlight in my mouth got old, and it was still tough to shine the light in at the right angle. This works PERFECT, it&#x27;s a nice basic trinket that does its job really well. And at this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> love the idea of lighting up....love the idea of thin pliers!!!  However, the pliers don’t work b/c it doesn’t line up properly and b/c it’s cheap plastic.  This was SUCH a cheap item that I bought it.  The price is obviously not my complaint but that the pliers didn’t work and can’t grab properly. Also the scooper is too rough for the ear.  prefer the metal scoopers b/c it has smooth edges.</li>
    <li> Works great with the light</li>
    <li> Okay, my husband has compacted HARD earwax, and he&#x27;s stubborn about doctors. So, I looked online and found this little miracle. I read the reviews that said it&#x27;s cheap plastic and it broke... I can see what they mean about the platic. It&#x27;s very lightweight, but mine didn&#x27;t break. This light is SO BRIGHT, and the three different instruments are so handy.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my entire family.&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> Not sealed in the product package. Looks like a used one. Dirty! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> great price and device.</li>
    <li> I just received the items and only used once.  My review is based only this experience  Pros: 1. light is very good. 2. Tools are lightweight, easy to grip, simple to use In general, i was able to see and pick up my kids&#x27;s ear wax; however, before doing that I dropped earwax softener into their ears for a few min. It&#x27;s not an easy task. Using any tools, expensive or not, i believe it requires patience, soothing talk to kids (mine are all under 5 yrs. old), and gentle hands.  3. Of course the price. So far this is my best purchase for under 1 buck.  Cons (updated a year later) 1. Use: for some reason if I hold the tool long enough, it started to be loosen (sp?). The assessory loose out from the handle.  But I can easily twist it back up. 2. Tool: some of the assessories are kind of sharp ( I feel it by my fingers). So I won&#x27;t use it yet until I fill it down. 3. It&#x27;s sent straight from China, thus took about a month to arrive. 4. Bright light only last for about a month or two (weekly use for ~20mins).  I bought six due to good impression at 1st and wanted to share w/ family, but end up keeping all for me due to cons #2 and 4 above.  I now just purchased a different one made in Japan ... More expensive, but seems very good so far, will write review after at least 2 months use.</li>
    <li> It works good and it has a bright light.  I accidentally left it in my shirt pocket and it went though the wash.  It still works so it must be well built.</li>
    <li> ill pick something elese next time the price is cheap and it does the job . I highgly doubt that it will last very long</li>
    <li> these small ear picks work well and are easy to fit in purse or compact tote lights up well !!</li>
    <li> Works great as a flashlight to look into the ear canal, however the plastic is flimsy. I rather use a wood or bamboo cleaner instead. I&#x27;m not as confident using the plastic (flexible) scoops as I am with a wooden or bamboo scoop.</li>
    <li> The tool isn&#x27;t fancy, but It works fine for my son&#x27;s ears. It was only $.75!! Can&#x27;t beat that price!!</li>
    <li> The flashlight part is great. But the scoop style curette isn&#x27;t good at grasping wax. If the scoop had an open inside like a traditional curette where the wax could cling to it, it would work much better. My daughter is a wax machine and I usually have to clean her ears as the sunlight radiates in the room. I was hoping this would be a better solution but back to how I did it before.</li>
    <li> Very cheap - single use only</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the 3 accessories as desribed. The top portion is not firmly attached, it shifted when I used it. I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> This was a pleasant surprise when I found these. We need them in our house do to a hearing aid wearer.&lt;br /&gt;The wax builds up pretty quickly and uncontrollably sometimes. This helps get that wax.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that is hurts his ear sometimes but that may not have anything to do with this products itself.</li>
    <li> Plastic piece is deformed and not smooth and round like it should be. I wouldn&#x27;t ever put this inside my child&#x27;s ear.</li>
    <li> It looks like I received a used piece. The product package does not look original, the caps are loose. I just used it for 5 minutes and it will break apart if I use it for another 5 minutes. Not worth it and I don’t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> very cheapy item&lt;br /&gt;recieved today 5-27-14&lt;br /&gt;case was already cracked open&lt;br /&gt;one of the tip broked when trying to clean the ear even though I was trying to be very gentle</li>
    <li> sharp and scratchy! keep that away from your ears if you know whats good for ya!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd one I bought. Maybe the brand is different, and they are from different sellers. But they are equally low quality, broke on the second day. I just tape them, and they worked fine. Love the idea of having the light. Just wish the qualify could be better. I don&#x27;t really need the 3 pieces exchangeable heads. I wish the head does not fall apart so easily, and the edge be more smooth.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I neefed</li>
    <li> Very handy. But it gets broken very easily. One of the accessories is already broken after two months.</li>
    <li> Able to clean out my daughters ears with out the pain and suffering.  It was nice because its plastic and did not dig into the ear.  The light worked great so I could see in to the ear.</li>
    <li> Works well, so no problems, have to wait to see if it stands up to several uses.  Use alcohol between ears.</li>
    <li> This tool is pretty sharp considering what it is designed for. With that being said, it does the job. Just be careful!!!</li>
    <li> The pieces that fit in this will not stay in place and constantly fall out when you try to use it. Also, one of them broke in my ear.  The LED light is bright, but doesn&#x27;t make up for the loose fit of the accessories.</li>
    <li> The light is really bright.  Works well.  The tool is a little hard to get off at first, but that the only problem I had so far.  It also came in the mail on time.</li>
    <li> The title tell is all. The product is very low quality. Granted, it is very cheap, but the ear picking devices are also very sharp. This is dangerous for your ears.</li>
    <li> the curette doesnt stay in the handle, youll have to hold it in between to make sure its not going to separate while scrapping the ear wax</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t kow about others but for me it&#x27;s a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for my kids for almost 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;I have 3 of them in case the battery runs out.</li>
    <li> The actual part that you use to clean the ear appears to be a cheap grade of plastic - not well trimmed so it is sharp and painful.  I will be filing mine down with an emery board and think that will do better.  The LED light is great and definitely lights up the ear canal - basically, pretty happy with it for the price, but it took a very long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> Eh.  Works well to see into the ear canal however, I had to super glue it because it was broken when we received it.  My kids hate for me to use it because it either tickles or scratches.  I filed with a nail file which helped but still scratches.  But for $1.50 what more can I ask.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not AAA battery. It&#x27;s not very bright when I received, but I can&#x27;t changed battery.</li>
    <li> Arrived in the time frame that was stated, works great!</li>
    <li> Took forever to arrive so I bought a water pic while waiting. It&#x27;s a good thing because you won&#x27;t be able to use this to clean ears, only to look into them. But cheap enough that I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> This tool is perfect for removing unwanted earwax easily and safely. Gone are the days when you need to buy those disposable Q-tips that are prone to having their ends fall off during usage with this green gadget. This is perfect for all my hygiene needs.</li>
    <li> It is just pretty cheaply made and I don&#x27;t expect the plastic to hold up.At least it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
    <li> It is what I am looking for and works exactly as I expected.  Good buy</li>
    <li> The tip has a prong that scrached  my inner ear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nifty little device, but it&#x27;s sort of cheaply built, you have to be careful when storing the attachments or it might fall apart.</li>
    <li> This thing here is a piece of junk, just absolute garbage. It is not sturdy enough to even pick the wax from your ear as it is intended for. This thing would break before finishing such a task. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works well enough. It&#x27;s a little slack in holding the attachments.</li>
    <li> It´s necessary for my job</li>
    <li> Flimsy tip, loose connection of the tip to its holder.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, literally cleaned gobs of earwax out of my husbands ears. He can hear again :) It definitely helps to use peroxide first. Let it soak then drain it, dry up with a qtip and you can scoop ear wax out easily and painlessly with this tool. Be very careful it goes deep. Saved us a ton of money on ENT visits.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and not very safe to use.</li>
    <li> Very good. Second buy. Think you need to rebuy when the light dies.</li>
    <li> I am the designated ear cleaner of the family.  I first learned of these ear scoops from the one yen stores in Japan.  I liked these ear scoops because the lighted mechanism allowed me to see even in hubby&#x27;s deep cavernous ears and my daughter&#x27;s dainty and narrow ear canals.  Unfortunately these broke within a 6 month period of time.  I have now moved on to purchasing the metal scoops which are great for my own personal use since I go by feel rather than sight but I miss the lighted mechanism offered by the plastic ear scoops.</li>
    <li> A little flimsy at connection point and plastic.</li>
    <li> Like the Green Ear cleaning Tool Q-tip with flashlight and three accessories  just as advetised received the product almost instantly will order from this store keep again. So little for so much. not sure which cost more the product or the shipping.</li>
    <li> It keeps my ears clean an was incredibly cheap, but it&#x27;s very flimsy. The top head piece that goes into your ear loosens up very quickly and easily and will just sort of fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery for the light is great though, as I&#x27;ve had mine for months and haven&#x27;t had to change the battery once!</li>
    <li> Have trouble with ear wax building up that a Qtip just makes worse. So these ear tools work perfectly for regular cleaning, removing wax from the middle walls. Although looped tools work just as well, if sometimes better, depending.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these and NONE OF THEM WORKED.  The product design is good - I&#x27;ve used other brands that have been great.  Not a single light as functional from the lot I purchased, though.</li>
