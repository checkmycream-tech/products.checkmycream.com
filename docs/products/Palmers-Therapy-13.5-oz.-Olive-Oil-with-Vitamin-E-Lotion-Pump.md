      <li>so I was thrilled to find it on amazon.</li>
      <li>Non-greasy/non-oily feel and smells nice.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, absorbs quickly and moisturizes very well.  </li>
      <li>I bought several \\&quot;try me\\&quot; bottles of this product at the beauty supply store and was impressed with the feel of the cream from the begining.  </li>
      <li>and I have tried so many over my lifetime.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions and never been pleased with them.  </li>
      <li>Most hand lotions are ALL chemicals.</li>
      <li>I love this,  </li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t buy again but worked ok</li>
      <li>It turns into almost a sort of \\&quot;fish slime\\&quot;, which for me is better than a salty crust from sweat, but that may not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love using this because it softens and makes my shin like velvet.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s mostly gone.  </li>
      <li>pump bottles :-)</li>
      <li>Great lotion for the price, absorbs fast, no greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>I love Palmers&#x27; lotions and soaps.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use and make my body smooth and looking very nice</li>
      <li>Palmers olive seems to be the perfect weight for body lotion... not too sticky, not too dry.</li>
      <li>Best hand lotion on the market for dry or itchy hands.</li>
      <li>Smells like clean soap!  </li>
      <li>We live in the desert and using a good therapy, moisturizing cream is very important.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the scent, it is not bad, just prefer Palmer&#x27;s shea butter Formula.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also incredibly important to apply the lotion as often as you can when your skin is still moist from showering, it helps lock the moisture in.  </li>
      <li>It is light but keeps you moistureized all day.  </li>
      <li>My wife swears this lotion has kept her stretch mark free during three pregnancies.  </li>
      <li>I originally found this lotion at Target when I was visiting family in Australia.</li>
      <li>And it ships quickly and is well packed to avoid crushing the bottle.</li>
      <li>but this particular one is hands down the best!</li>
      <li>The lotion absorbs quickly but the moisturizing effect lasts.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find in the stores any more, so we&#x27;re happy to be able to purchase it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I finally received my two bottles of Palmer&#x27;s this morning and I absolutely love this brand!</li>
      <li>This lotion has a powerful sweet/chemical/bitter smell that lingers even after washing.  </li>
      <li>Very nutrient rich for just-out-of-the-shower skin.</li>
      <li>This Olive Butter collection is just right for my skin.  </li>
      <li>Admittedly, I&#x27;m sensitive to strong fragrances, so others may not find the smell offensive.</li>
      <li>It made my skin feel silky smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>keeps your skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, it isn&#x27;t too thick, it doesn&#x27;t dry too fast, it&#x27;s just perfect!  </li>
      <li>Very supple and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m currently waiting for the 4 pack to be available.</li>
      <li>The lightweight formula absorbs very well.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>One of my new staples.</li>
      <li>This is a new must have item for me now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I would recommend an olive oil based lotion for folks in more humid regions.</li>
      <li>The first two listed ingredients are water and organic extra virgin olive oil , it also contains coconut and mineral oil and vitamin E.  </li>
      <li>Just be aware that you are using a product that is not 100% organic and contains some potentially harmful things in it.</li>
      <li>I went back to the beauty supply expecting to find large bottles of this product and the owner told me that she was not going to stock it.  </li>
      <li>There is a fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The olive oil content definitely isn&#x27;t just for show on the label, it really makes all the difference when applied to irritated skin.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft and supple for days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and I get compliments on how soft my skin is.  </li>
      <li>The lotion feels greasy and does not soak in completely, leaving a tacky residue.  </li>
      <li>She says the lotion seems thicker than what she generally uses, and feels more substantial / like it lasts a long time compared to other lotions.</li>
      <li>When I went to the Palmers website it says that it uses organic extra virgin olive oil, which does not mean the product itself is organic.</li>
      <li>It absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any acne... or at least any more than can be expected from working out 2-3 times a day.</li>
      <li>That means I take a lot of showers and my skin gets very itchy and dry.</li>
      <li>I use no other body lotion.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend this product for all dry skin.</li>
      <li>Olive oil was used back in the early days of Israel to annoint kings and put all over ones body - suntan lotion did not exist back then.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Palmers Olive Oil and Vitamin-E lotion is just so good.  It is light but keeps you moistureized all day.  One of the few lotions I can use on my skin and not feel like my skin is all clogged up and can&#x27;t breathe.</li>
    <li> I bought several \\&quot;try me\\&quot; bottles of this product at the beauty supply store and was impressed with the feel of the cream from the begining.  It made my skin feel silky smooth and soft.  I went back to the beauty supply expecting to find large bottles of this product and the owner told me that she was not going to stock it.  I told her how great I thought the prouct was and  expressed my disappointment that she was not going to stock it.  I then went online to Amazon.com to look for it and was delighted to find that you carried it.  I had to fight with my daughter to keep my small bottles of the cream, so I ordered two 13.5 oz. pump bottles :-) I am very happy to know that I can get this product from you.  You made my day!</li>
    <li> This is the best hand &amp; body cream out there. We live in the desert and using a good therapy, moisturizing cream is very important. It&#x27;s difficult to find in the stores any more, so we&#x27;re happy to be able to purchase it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a powerful sweet/chemical/bitter smell that lingers even after washing.  The lotion feels greasy and does not soak in completely, leaving a tacky residue.  Admittedly, I&#x27;m sensitive to strong fragrances, so others may not find the smell offensive.</li>
    <li> greatest lotion!!!! love it! will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. Ever since I can remember my upper arms have have been dry and have had like permanent goose bumps. This lotion with only 2 uses has all but made them disappear! The lightweight formula absorbs very well. I cannot stand the heavy forever wet formula&#x27;s of some other heavy moisturizing lotions; Palmers&#x27; Olive Butter gives you major moisturizing and absorbs very quickly. It leaves my skin soft and supple for days. One of my new staples.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for the price, absorbs fast, no greasy feeling. I&#x27;m not in love with the scent, it is not bad, just prefer Palmer&#x27;s shea butter Formula.</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry skin-year &#x27;round. This product is wonderful. I cannot find it anywhere but Amazon-please don&#x27;t quit carrying it. I started using it when it was suggested to me by a physical therapist after having a total knee replacement. It left my scar very soft and pliable with a very thin line of scarring. My family member who had a mastectomy also used it on her scar healing and she was very pleased with the healing. I would suggest this product to anyone for scar therapy, excessive dry skin or whatever your skin problem is. Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this and really liked the way it felt on my skin.  With the name, \\&quot;organic therapy\\&quot;, I wondered if the product was certified organic.  Coming to amazon to check it out, I noticed in the ingredients that there were artificial dyes and a paraben (Propylparaben) listed.  When I went to the Palmers website it says that it uses organic extra virgin olive oil, which does not mean the product itself is organic. Just be aware that you are using a product that is not 100% organic and contains some potentially harmful things in it.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again but worked ok</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve bought 17oz. bottle for 5.99 , the one i got from you was over $15.00 , i won&#x27;t order it again ! .</li>
    <li> My very favorite lotion but I can&#x27;t find it now in a pump anymore.</li>
    <li> Palmers Therapy 13.5 oz. Olive Oil with Vitamin-E Lotion Pump&lt;br /&gt;Works good,easy to use pump. keeps your skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use and make my body smooth and looking very nice</li>
    <li> I finally received my two bottles of Palmer&#x27;s this morning and I absolutely love this brand! Non-greasy/non-oily feel and smells nice. I&#x27;ve wanted this ever since one of my co workers came to work with it one morning a few months ago, but was disappointed to find out the larger chain stores stopped carrying it! I was relieved to discover your site has it in stock and I&#x27;m currently waiting for the 4 pack to be available. My only complaint, like other reviewers, is that it&#x27;s soo hard to find. Otherwise, I love this product!</li>
    <li> Does not have the great smell like the conditioner for your hair.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and this is the only product that helps me!  The stores in my area have discontinued carrying this product, so I am happy I can order it here.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in any of my local stores so I was thrilled to find it on amazon. Had purchased a bottle in the uk and loved it. The lotion absorbs quickly but the moisturizing effect lasts. Very pleasant fragrance and a silky texture makes this lotion feel awesome. Plus it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion on the market for dry or itchy hands. The first two listed ingredients are water and organic extra virgin olive oil , it also contains coconut and mineral oil and vitamin E.  Most hand lotions are ALL chemicals. It has a pleasant smell too. Olive oil was used back in the early days of Israel to annoint kings and put all over ones body - suntan lotion did not exist back then. Blessings!</li>
    <li> I have a picc line and so I have to wash my hands 10+ times a day before I can flush it or anything. My hands started getting SO dry because of all the washing.  I have literally bought over 15 lotions in the last month. I found a travel size bottle of this at Fred&#x27;s for $1 and got it (I got 4 other brands too).  This is perfect. It isn&#x27;t greasy, it isn&#x27;t too thick, it doesn&#x27;t dry too fast, it&#x27;s just perfect!  I went back to Fred&#x27;s today and they had a bigger bottle which I bought. This is a new must have item for me now. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion and I have tried so many over my lifetime.  Palmers makes great lotion anyway but this particular one is hands down the best! I love using this because it softens and makes my shin like velvet.I use no other body lotion. This is the best.</li>
    <li> I love Palmers&#x27; lotions and soaps.  This Olive Butter collection is just right for my skin.  And it ships quickly and is well packed to avoid crushing the bottle.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever!  Smells like clean soap!  Works spectacular!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from Curel, Aveeno, Renew, etc and this stuff works the best!  I put it all over my body every morning and every night as soon as I step out of the shower while my skin is still damp and I love it!!  It&#x27;s not greasy and I get compliments on how soft my skin is.  I used to have bad eczema when I was younger, but now that I am 36 it&#x27;s mostly gone.  The chain stores like WalMart suddenly stopped carrying this lotion about 6 months ago (bummer) but I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this,  It smells wonderful, absorbs quickly and moisturizes very well.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions and never been pleased with them.  This is the best.</li>
    <li> The Palmer&#x27;s Olive Butter Formula works well for my eczema and I highly recommend this product for all dry skin.</li>
    <li> I originally found this lotion at Target when I was visiting family in Australia. When I got back, I couldn&#x27;t find it in a store here anywhere! So I have to order it from amazon. I work out several times a day (before, during, and after work). That means I take a lot of showers and my skin gets very itchy and dry. Palmers olive seems to be the perfect weight for body lotion... not too sticky, not too dry. It absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any acne... or at least any more than can be expected from working out 2-3 times a day. I&#x27;m not sure if I would recommend an olive oil based lotion for folks in more humid regions. It does come away from my skin when I go for workouts that cause me to  sweat heavily. It turns into almost a sort of \\&quot;fish slime\\&quot;, which for me is better than a salty crust from sweat, but that may not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.</li>
    <li> My wife swears this lotion has kept her stretch mark free during three pregnancies.  Imagine that&#x27;s from the olive oil.  She says the lotion seems thicker than what she generally uses, and feels more substantial / like it lasts a long time compared to other lotions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno, Cetaphil, Cerave, and Eucerin for eczema. Just tried this lotion, and it beats the others at reducing redness and inflammation. There is a fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I do wish it was fragrance free, but the lotion certainly doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. Goes on smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My Husband has sensitive skin that often gets crazy itchy during the dry Winter months, and this has been an absolute Godsend! The olive oil content definitely isn&#x27;t just for show on the label, it really makes all the difference when applied to irritated skin.  It&#x27;s also incredibly important to apply the lotion as often as you can when your skin is still moist from showering, it helps lock the moisture in.  Will be ordering this on a regular basis in our house, can use it all over, even on chapped lips!</li>
    <li> Very supple and moisturizing. Very nutrient rich for just-out-of-the-shower skin. Smells great!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion!</li>
</ol>
