      <li>Great product received quickly!</li>
      <li>It is a good product, but I like Milbon Fierli Treatment much better.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good product, and good price!</li>

      <li>I was hoping to see more drastic changes after using it, but that&#x27;s not the case.</li>

      <li>I hope this review helps. :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>when i took it out my hair was so much better, i love it and recommend 100%.</li>
      <li>The authentic one from Japan which has the number #13911.</li>
      <li>I use this once a week now and just bought a heated hair wrap to really get the best out of this treatment, but even without it I saw immediate and very gratifying results.</li>
      <li>This smells so good and makes the hair feel so soft!</li>
      <li>After a TV show or two....the hair is transformed....it feels silky and light...</li>
      <li>And it works just as great if done regularly at fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>It works &amp;amp; it is useful!</li>
      <li>I get the full treatment at the salon after about a month or 2 from my semi-annual thermal relaxing treatment (liscio).</li>
      <li>Again, the authentic one is much m</li>
      <li>Good for dry and damaged hair</li>
      <li>It really makes my hair smooth &amp;amp; shiny, which solves the problem</li>
      <li>My hair is soooo damaged,although those are small,theyre so worth it.</li>
      <li>I found out that I could buy this online for much much much cheaper price!</li>
      <li>My hair was so soft and smooth,</li>
      <li>And the result wasn&#x27;t worth it as I didn&#x27;t see much difference from my normal conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely luvvv this stuff.</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t get much in each tube.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist normally gives me a pack of those to follow up for a weekly treatment</li>
      <li>Beside the package, the effect of this product is totally none, it just feel like the same as the cheap Loreal hair treatment.</li>
      <li>Please look at the back at the right side where have some white stuff which look like it has been erased something.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good and left my hair soft and silky feeling, but i guess my hair is too coarse and it went back to frizzy again :(</li>
      <li>I have short length (about 4 inches) coarse hair and it made my hair feel really soft and manageable.</li>

    <li> I won&#x27;t be buying this again.  I have shoulder length curly hair that I color and highlight.  I had to use all 4 at once just to cover my hair.  And the result wasn&#x27;t worth it as I didn&#x27;t see much difference from my normal conditioner.  It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> When I got a hair treatment from a salon, I had to pay more than 50 dollars for the treatment. This is the product that the salon used. I found out that I could buy this online for much much much cheaper price! Fast shipping, good product, and good price! This is my third or fourth time ordering this product! Love it!</li>
    <li> This smells so good and makes the hair feel so soft! I apply very little of this as a leave-in conditioner and it keeps the hair moisturizerized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I had received this product on time. I have short length (about 4 inches) coarse hair and it made my hair feel really soft and manageable. I will continue to use this product to see if it will help my hair to grow and to prevent shedding. My hair sheds a lot and sometimes in clumps :(. I&#x27;m black and my hair is natural (no chemicals). My hair can be very dry and fragile. However, I had to use almost all of the tubes (3 tubes). I hope this review helps. :)</li>
    <li> Very good conditioner but you don&#x27;t get much in each tube. I have think hair and need to use 2.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for hair treatment, and are thinking about spending those 200+ on hair conditioning at salons (3 step japanese treatment etc) that lasts only like a month. Try this !! this is actually the 4th step of that 3 step treatment, but for home. And it works just as great if done regularly at fraction of the cost. I put them on, cover with hair cap and towel and put hair heat cap over them. After a TV show or two....the hair is transformed....it feels silky and light...I&#x27;ve recommended to all my friends.</li>
    <li> My Japanese salon gave me these after a protein treatment to use at home ( my hair was SO bad that the stylist gave them to me for free...!) I used them in the shower, put a shower cap over my conditioned hair and let the heat of the water drum down on my head as I went about my shower routine.  My hair was so soft and smooth, especially the fried ends, a result of a terrible perm job from another salon. (I know, I deserve it for straying...) I use this once a week now and just bought a heated hair wrap to really get the best out of this treatment, but even without it I saw immediate and very gratifying results. I&#x27;m a permanent fan now and will continue to use this even when my hair recovers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I&#x27;ve used drugstore products that work just as well.  I&#x27;m not likely to buy this again.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, but I like Milbon Fierli Treatment much better. This is supposed to work as a booster. I was hoping to see more drastic changes after using it, but that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
    <li> Not so good for my hear, i haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> Good for dry and damaged hair</li>

    <li> Absolutely luvvv this stuff. I get the full treatment at the salon after about a month or 2 from my semi-annual thermal relaxing treatment (liscio). My hair stylist normally gives me a pack of those to follow up for a weekly treatment but I buy an additional pack here on Amazon to extend treatment time. It coats the hair, giving it lustre and elasticity. I really love the effects on my hair for weeks on end!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good and left my hair soft and silky feeling, but i guess my hair is too coarse and it went back to frizzy again :(</li>
    <li> It works &amp;amp; it is useful! It really makes my hair smooth &amp;amp; shiny, which solves the problem w/ the ends of my hair splits! Luv it &amp;amp; recommend it! Will definitely buy it again &amp;amp; regularly!</li>
    <li> Great product received quickly!</li>
    <li> My hair is soooo damaged,although those are small,theyre so worth it. i kept it on for about an hour. when i took it out my hair was so much better, i love it and recommend 100%. thank you.</li>
    <li> The package looks totally fake compare to the one I bought from Japan. Please look at the back at the right side where have some white stuff which look like it has been erased something. The authentic one from Japan which has the number #13911. Beside the package, the effect of this product is totally none, it just feel like the same as the cheap Loreal hair treatment. Again, the authentic one is much m</li>
