### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with it.</li>
      <li>This would be the perfect product if I could make it work for me because of the ease of using it.  </li>
      <li>Very good quality.</li>
      <li>Loved it!</li>
      <li>She is severely allergic to hair dyes, but the beautiful collection worked on her.  </li>
      <li>Great hair rinse product</li>
      <li>Great deal for the money.</li>
      <li>Great seller.  </li>
      <li>I used Clairol Beautiful Browns for years and loved the results.</li>
      <li>Clairol doesn&#x27;t expand the AGS shade range to more closely match that of the Beautiful Browns line.</li>
      <li>Better than permanent dye at hiding gray!</li>
      <li>Okay color did not cover most of the gray at my temples but very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>just okay.</li>
      <li>Would love feedback...</li>
      <li>However, there are only 5 available AGS shades, compared to over 20 shades of Beautiful Browns.</li>
      <li>I switched to the AGS (Advanced Gray Solution) line, and while it faded faster than I would have liked, it&#x27;s definitely longer-lasting, and better in covering larger amounts of gray than Beautiful Browns are for me now.</li>
      <li>If they had and it didn&#x27;t fade too quickly, it would be a 5-star product.</li>
      <li>This brand is very good brand, when you color your hair it stays much longer the the other brands</li>
      <li>As I got more and more gray hair, that product didn&#x27;t cover gray as effectively or as long as it had before.</li>
      <li>I have to stick with loving care only.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with these 5 shades, alone and in combination together, and none of them is even close to being right for me.</li>
      <li>Is it recommended to use conditioner when one is rinsing out the color or should conditioner be used right after shampooing?</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work!</li>
      <li>and I followed the instructions exactly</li>
      <li>The best there is on the market for hard to color grey hair.</li>
      <li>Really at the edges after about 4 wks but.</li>
      <li>I will stain your skin however applying a petroleum product to the hairline and ears is very efficient way of preventing this.</li>
      <li>ORDER DID COME FAST, I OPENED THE PACKAGE</li>
      <li>The light brown was a horrid shade of red at first, but settled down with a good washing the next day.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several months and it is effectively covers my grey hairs.</li>
      <li>love this product because the co lor covers my gray and last longer than regular haircolor, will buy again and again</li>
      <li>The black is rich and not to crayon like.</li>
      <li>AND IT SAYS PROFESSIONAL USE</li>
      <li>PROFESSIONAL USE</li>
      <li>I am in my fifties with soft black straight and fine hair and some white hair along the hairline and middle part.</li>
      <li>I an wondering whether it is because of the constrast in color of the white hair with my natural hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really wanted this to work! I am in my fifties with soft black straight and fine hair and some white hair along the hairline and middle part. I have only used semi permanent color since my forties on the roots  I wanted a non ammonia/peroxide formula and I followed the instructions exactly but there are still roots that are quite visible and the color looks faded without even one shampoo. I an wondering whether it is because of the constrast in color of the white hair with my natural hair. At any rate, it looks like I need to dye my hair again. I had hoped it would last at least a few weeks!  Is it recommended to use conditioner when one is rinsing out the color or should conditioner be used right after shampooing? This would be the perfect product if I could make it work for me because of the ease of using it.  Would love feedback...</li>
    <li> Great seller.  Very fast shipping.  Great deal for the money. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I used Clairol Beautiful Browns for years and loved the results. As I got more and more gray hair, that product didn&#x27;t cover gray as effectively or as long as it had before. I switched to the AGS (Advanced Gray Solution) line, and while it faded faster than I would have liked, it&#x27;s definitely longer-lasting, and better in covering larger amounts of gray than Beautiful Browns are for me now. However, there are only 5 available AGS shades, compared to over 20 shades of Beautiful Browns. I&#x27;ve experimented with these 5 shades, alone and in combination together, and none of them is even close to being right for me. It&#x27;s too bad Clairol doesn&#x27;t expand the AGS shade range to more closely match that of the Beautiful Browns line. If they had and it didn&#x27;t fade too quickly, it would be a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> ORDER DID COME FAST, I OPENED THE PACKAGE AND IT SAYS PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY AND THATS IT.  I CONTACTED THE SELLER TO ASK IF I COULD RETURN IT AS I EXPLAINED I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL, THIS IS MY 1ST TIME DOING THIS  AND THE PRODUCT DIDNT COME W/INSTRUCTIONS.  MY BOTTLE DOESN THAVE INSTRUCTIONS IT JUST SAYS PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY, I GUESS THAT&#x27;S THE INSTRUCTION, SO SINCE I&#x27;M NOT A PROFESSIONAL  I BOUGHT A USELESS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The black is rich and not to crayon like.Leaves my gray in for a little longer , doesn&#x27;t damage after my 8 wk touch up. Really at the edges after about 4 wks but.</li>
    <li> Okay color did not cover most of the gray at my temples but very easy to use.  I will use again between semi-permanent color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I won&#x27;t have to leave home when I am not feeling well to get the product. Just have to remember not to run out.</li>
    <li> The best there is on the market for hard to color grey hair. Loved it!</li>
    <li> Better than permanent dye at hiding gray!</li>
    <li> stays in for a long time</li>
    <li> just okay. Doesn&#x27;t last very long if you use head and shoulders or do oil treatments, it lasted me 2-3 washes both times I used it. i have a lot of gold tones, and this didn&#x27;t seem to cover them. If i NEED to cover my roots for an event i  will use this but i will keep searching for a black rinse.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s semi-permanent, but my mom still had an allergic reaction to it.  She is severely allergic to hair dyes, but the beautiful collection worked on her.  She assumed the gray coverage would too. Thank God I made her test it.  She has a HORRIBLE reaction to it.  What&#x27;s the point of semi-permanent if it&#x27;s not hypoallergenic?</li>
    <li> Very good quality. This brand is very good brand, when you color your hair it stays much longer the the other brands</li>
    <li> I ended up being allergic to the product, so I can not use it .  I have to stick with loving care only. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;m not allergic to.</li>
    <li> The light brown was a horrid shade of red at first, but settled down with a good washing the next day. Color lasted for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me, It turned my hair green and it took several shampoo&#x27;s to wash out, I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and it is effectively covers my grey hairs. I will stain your skin however applying a petroleum product to the hairline and ears is very efficient way of preventing this.</li>
    <li> will not order again does not work well at covering the gray.</li>
    <li> love this product because the co lor covers my gray and last longer than regular haircolor, will buy again and again</li>
    <li> Great hair rinse product</li>
