      <li>Yes... your hair doesn&#x27;t feel the exact way it did before the product was put in, but why would it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine soft easily damaged hair.</li>
      <li>foam adds thickness to your strands giving a nice illusion of bigger hair.</li>

      <li>hair falls wherever it wants to fall since it&#x27;s so fine and soft</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this stuff has extreme hold, but it is functional and smells nice.</li>

<li> Arrived broke, managing to work around that but only to have my hair feel coated and not much</li>
<li> Going back to my other brand.</li>

<li> The feeling you get once your hair is dry</li>

<li> I apply it at my roots and out a few inches, then blow dry my hair upside down</li>

<li> Average.  </li>
<li> Usually any styling product makes my hair look darker and makes it feel \\&quot;crispy\\&quot;.  </li>
<li> so I should have known but don&#x27;t even waste your $3.00 on this!</li>
<li> Bottle came without a cap, not sure why :/</li>
<li> Buy this product if you want a little somethin somethin added to your dull thin hair.</li>
<li> I remember my sister actually was shocked and asked &amp;</li>
<li> This left my hair feeling weighed down and awful.</li>
<li> Once the water from the shower hit it, it was even worse!  </li>
<li> I felt like a weird science experiment.  </li>
<li> I applied an anti-frizz lotion to try and help but it felt like the worst dried out straw</li>
<li> Damage product so disappointed.  </li>
<li> but this was the worst product I&#x27;ve ever put on my head.  </li>

    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this stuff has extreme hold, but it is functional and smells nice.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works well, good price.</li>
    <li> No problem. Same as if purchased at a bricks &amp; mortar srore.</li>
    <li> Damage product so disappointed.  What a rip off</li>
    <li> I bought this as an add on for free shipping. The product arrived on a 90 degree day and had been sitting in a hot truck I can tell. The mousse is runny and sticky.</li>
    <li> I have naturally light ash colored hair.  It is also very fine and thin.  Usually any styling product makes my hair look darker and makes it feel \\&quot;crispy\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m very happy with the Garnier Fructis Style Sky-Hi, it goes on light, has good hold, doesn&#x27;t leave a build up, or make my hair look darker. Has a pleasant scent as well.  I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>

    <li> hold not as good as it said</li>
    <li> Both times I ordered this product, they were delivered with the top busted off. The first time I thought was a fluke so ordered again and that one was also busted. Of course, no returns...will not buy again!</li>
    <li> This left my hair feeling weighed down and awful.</li>
    <li> Arrived broke, managing to work around that but only to have my hair feel coated and not much umph. Ok if you don&#x27;t need a lasting hold. Going back to my other brand.</li>
    <li> I felt like a weird science experiment.  I used this mousse and couldn&#x27;t even get a hairbrush through my hair.  I applied an anti-frizz lotion to try and help but it felt like the worst dried out straw I could imagine.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home at the end of the workday to wash it out.  Once the water from the shower hit it, it was even worse!  I couldn&#x27;t even get my fingers through my hair to shampoo it.  I put conditioner on it and them shampooed it twice.  I have good thick hair that is straight and it is color treated but this was the worst product I&#x27;ve ever put on my head.  It&#x27;s cheap so I should have known but don&#x27;t even waste your $3.00 on this!</li>
    <li> Affordable, efficient, smells great.</li>
    <li> Average.  Not worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I have white hair that is limp and fine.  This gives my hair volume and makes it easier to hold a curl.</li>
    <li> worked just great on my fine hair</li>
    <li> Works perfectly without stickyness.</li>
    <li> Great product, but after just using it twice the mousse became liquid, no more foam.  No amount of shaking makes it foamy.&lt;br /&gt;What can be done?</li>
    <li> Yes... your hair doesn&#x27;t feel the exact way it did before the product was put in, but why would it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine soft easily damaged hair. This product works great. It gives my hair 3x more volume than it had beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;My hair falls wherever it wants to fall since it&#x27;s so fine and soft and this gives it some texture allowing it to stay put and also not lay too close to my face and eyes. When I lose volume throughout the day, all I have to do is lift up my hair and drop it and it will be voluminous again. I also brush it to bring back the volume, which is the opposite of what you may think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam adds thickness to your strands giving a nice illusion of bigger hair. When I first started using this product I remember my sister actually was shocked and asked &amp;#34;why does your hair look like that?! It never looks that full!&amp;#34; so it does it&#x27;s job for sure. Buy this product if you want a little somethin somethin added to your dull thin hair. It&#x27;s worth getting rid of the softness to have some oooomphhhh! Also if you braid it or do something like that overnight to get waves, this helps a bunch!</li>
    <li> WOW what hold this mousse has -- it says extra hold and it isn&#x27;t kidding.  I have fine hair and need real help, this mousse is very impressive.  I haven&#x27;t used Fructis before but am now thinking of looking at some of their other offerings.  This is great for me, definitely give it a try if you&#x27;re looking for something new with good hold.</li>
    <li> Garnier Fructis Style Sky-Hi Volume mousse will give you added volume especially if you have fine hair. I think this would work best on curly hair that didn&#x27;t need drying with a brush. The reason I say this is because once you have this in your wet hair it is almost impossible to get a styling brush through it easily. I had to fight my way to dry hair. Yes it gave me a lot more volume but I felt I was sacrificing softness for volume. The feeling you get once your hair is dry is sort of like what your hair feels like after you use hairspray. Although not quite as sticky. My hair looks better when I use this but I don&#x27;t like how I have to fight with my hair to get it styled. If I had a perm and just needed to add volume and scrunch my hair this would be perfect. So I don&#x27;t think this is for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I have used many store brand volume mousse products, and this one seems to give me the most volume for the money. I apply it at my roots and out a few inches, then blow dry my hair upside down and I have volume that lasts all day. I have very fine hair and it is always a goal of mine to find product that will give me lasting volume.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...Adds volume to my fine, straight hair like no other product I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like it&#x27;s loaded with product. Got it at a great price here on Amazon...</li>
    <li> Usually I love their products but this one made my head itch..</li>
    <li> seems to work well.  I have such thin baby fine hair and need every volume stuff there is. I will up date later</li>
    <li> This mousse does a great job in adding body to your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product- fast shipping</li>
    <li> gives volume and style, works great on shorter hair</li>
    <li> works well smells good to.</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight hair and have spent a lot of money on products for volume throughout the years. Although no product is perfect, this one does a pretty good job of giving me enough volume so that I can use my curling iron for added fullness. Many more expensive products have not done as well!!</li>
    <li> followed instructions, doesn&#x27;t actually do anything except sticky fingers.</li>
    <li> I love this product.It gives my hair good volume</li>
    <li> Gives my hair pure body, love this mousse, has a clean feel not sticky. Keeps my style all day, with great hold.</li>
