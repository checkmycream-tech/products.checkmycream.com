      <li>we had been looking everywhere for some more....</li>
      <li>I always make sure he has plenty in storage</li>
      <li>I am so glad to have found them.</li>
      <li>I won&#x60;t be purchasing any more of these.</li>
      <li>They are better than the wood toothpicks that seem to always break off in between your teeth and get stuck along with the food.  </li>
      <li>I remember using this style of toothpick many years ago.  </li>
      <li>Thank You ProPicks !! :)&lt;</li>
      <li>The ones they used to make we&#x27;re a lot more sturdier.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a family member, but he was very excited because he couldn&#x27;t find them any where.</li>
      <li>Still, These are much better than the cheap stuff they sell at Wal Mart and Target these days.</li>
      <li>These are good and sturdy with a curved end and a straight end.</li>
      <li>They arrived very quickly.  </li>
      <li>easy to use and convenient.</li>
      <li>Perfect for implants and other problem dental work!</li>
      <li>They work fine.</li>
      <li>These little guys are awesome!</li>
      <li>These work great and cheaper than in the big box stores</li>
      <li>They break immediately &amp; won&#x27;t fit between our teeth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I liked the old style pick much better.</li>
      <li>Enjoying propick very much.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used these yet but have used them for years and the angle is what makes these unique.  </li>
      <li>out of one of these....keep it clean and</li>
      <li>They are perfect for hard to get at places.</li>
      <li>The curved end makes it easy to access any tooth, and the fact that they are plastic instead of wood makes them very sturdy and comfortable.</li>
      <li>The older version was much better (</li>
      <li>The price was right and delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>They are a great little pick</li>
      <li>I liked the non tinted and they were selling the dyed white ones</li>
      <li>Exactly what we werree looking for, and the price was right.</li>
      <li>There is no brush end, which I like, because the brush picks really wear out quickly and they are wimpy.</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t not as good as the old style, the plastic is a different material.</li>
      <li>Yes, product is different material from original, but works fine for me.</li>
      <li>Wooden toothpicks do much better.</li>
      <li>I am looking in similar products hoping to find one better.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for; thank youj.</li>
      <li>The newer picks are made using a different material and are more opaque in color.  </li>

      <li>Our entire extended family loves these picks and we haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores anymore.  </li>
      <li>The older version of their pick was made from a white plastic material and  was much more rigid.  </li>
      <li>They bend/flex more easily and are not as stiff or rigid as the older</li>
      <li>hard to find these picks good to find</li>
      <li>My whole family uses them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nicely shaped.  A little too soft on the tips, however,</li>
    <li> We love these tooth picks!</li>
    <li> It was just we expected and arrived in fast time.</li>
    <li> These picks are not as good as the ones this company used to make. These are thinner and sometimes often break. The ones they used to make we&#x27;re a lot more sturdier.</li>
    <li> These are impossible to find in stores. We had bought some a couple of years back but when we ran out we could not remember where we bought them, and we could not find them anywhere. Finally, we were able to track them down here, and ordered several packs in case they disappear from the internet also. Once you use these toothpicks there is no going back! Nothing will measure up to these. The curved end makes it easy to access any tooth, and the fact that they are plastic instead of wood makes them very sturdy and comfortable. There is no brush end, which I like, because the brush picks really wear out quickly and they are wimpy. These are good and sturdy with a curved end and a straight end.</li>
    <li> Some were saying the toothpicks were too thick. This is totally not true. They work fine. In fact, they are a little thinner and more flexible than ones I used to purchase, That is why I gave it 4-stars instead of 5, But I haven&#x27;t used one very long, so I may upgrade my rating.</li>
    <li> They are to thick to slide between the  teeth. Not happy with this product</li>
    <li> Exactly what we werree looking for, and the price was right. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Been looking for these toothpicks in our local pharmacies for a few years as I purchased one box and found them to be an outstanding product. Now I have a lifetime supply. These are not as good as the ones I originally bought but very good to get into the crevices of your teeth.</li>
    <li> Best toothpicks on planet.</li>
    <li> I was veru disappointed  in Armonds;  I returned my order a month ago stating I wanted something with a brush on one side and  a pick on the other.  Never heard a word from  Armonds again.  Should have sent it Return Request Received but didn&#x27;t think Armonds needed that;</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and never can find in stores.</li>
    <li> these are not nearly as good as the much older version that I purchased many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic pics are too bulky to go in between teeth.  The older version was much better (perfect)&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy these again.  The manufacturer needs to figure out how to make them like they&lt;br /&gt;used to.</li>
    <li> Our entire extended family loves these picks and we haven&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores anymore.  So happy to have found these.  Will definitely be buying again.  These are great toothpicks and gum massagers.  Soft, yet sturdy enough.</li>
    <li> I love these toothpicks.  They are better than the wood toothpicks that seem to always break off in between your teeth and get stuck along with the food.  I reach for these all the time after dinner.  They are the best.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t not as good as the old style, the plastic is a different material. These break often and are not as sturdy. I wish they would have left them the same. I was very dissapointed they don&#x27;t offer the bright white hard plastic picks.</li>
    <li> The only toothpick that works for me!</li>
    <li> Mom was so surprised to see them in her Christmas stocking...we had been looking everywhere for some more....but no luck...found these and glad i did!</li>
    <li> I thought these were going to be hard plastic......NOT...very limber and not of the quality I expected or was wanting.</li>
    <li> Used to buy these religiously for myself &amp; our customers. Not any more. They break immediately &amp; won&#x27;t fit between our teeth. They should probably close their business or fire the moron who made this change.</li>
    <li> My husband just has to have these with him wherever he is. He is lost without them. I always make sure he has plenty in storage so he doesn&#x27;t run out. Nothing beats the ProPick.</li>
    <li> I have bought tons of toothpicks trying to find the ones that works for me .Finally I found pro picks. They work great for me .</li>
    <li> Best toothpick out there.  great price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for implants and other problem dental work!</li>
    <li> While my wife was alive we always used the Propicks, when i ran out I began to hunt for them here every where that looked I was informed that they did not carry the propicks. My daughter told me to try Amazon I am well satisfied with the price and the picks, thank you.Hall Mauney</li>
    <li> My husband tried these a few years ago but we haven&#x27;t been able to find them in a store ANYWHERE, he was completely surprised when he reached in his stocking and pulled out three packages of them. They are a great little pick</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I do like them. Can&#x27;t find them locally.</li>
    <li> The new version of Amonds picks are not as stiff as the previous model. I preferred the hard, white plastic over this new grey, pliable style. Still, These are much better than the cheap stuff they sell at Wal Mart and Target these days.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, work fine great customer service&lt;br /&gt;Tank you&lt;br /&gt;George L</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this type of toothpick locally  and I like this style toothpicks, so I am very pleased with the item and the service.</li>
    <li> Have used these picks for years and loved them. Can no longer buy them at Target, Walmart, or Walgrens. Was delighted to find them on line! BUT, I no longer will buy them as they are being made too thick now and don,t fit between my teeth like they used to. So sad!</li>
    <li> Everything went well and product is excellent.</li>
    <li> been looking all over the place for these.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for; thank youj.</li>
    <li> easy to use and convenient. I keep one box in the glove box of the car for when we eat out. Very handy for trips to the beach too.</li>
    <li> I have been a customer of this product for years. Recently they changed their mold and material.  I am no longer happy with the product as I once was.  I am looking in similar products hoping to find one better.</li>
    <li> Been looking for these for a long time, picked up some in a local store and have not been able to find them since.  Googled them up and Armonds Manufacturing, Inc. had them.  Will recommend and will be ordering more.  Thanks Armonds!</li>
    <li> These work great and cheaper than in the big box stores (if you find them--they seem to always be out). Good product..</li>
    <li> But can not find them in stors. Walmart used to carry them, but not any more and I can not find them anywhere eles. Thankfull i can atleast order them. It is the only tooth pick that will get in between my teeth and clean them, and they don&#x27;t break. My whole family uses them. They last forever and I am constantly giving a few to my friends. When they use them they are hooked and want to find where to get them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making a simple, awsome product for oarl hygine.</li>
    <li> They are what I wanted but not as sturdy as the ones I have now.  These are made of a semi-clear plastic and can break at the tips if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a family member, but he was very excited because he couldn&#x27;t find them any where. I came through for him. very happy with product...</li>
    <li> Very good.  Could be a little sharper to get between my crammed in teeth! But I find these easier to use than flossing and probably more effective for gum massaging.</li>
    <li> ProPick (Almonds Manufacturing) has changed their manufacturing process and/or the material used to make the pick.  The older version of their pick was made from a white plastic material and  was much more rigid.  The newer picks are made using a different material and are more opaque in color.  They bend/flex more easily and are not as stiff or rigid as the older style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I liked the old style pick much better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product – works great for me.</li>
    <li> Tom, I also used these as a cigarette substitute and was so happy to find them in a Food Lion in Virginia in 1998.  I bought from Max Blevins after that and then another company bought them out as the Ultra-Pik and I placed my orders with Pam as she moved with the new company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom, do you still know the person who makes these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last order I bought 4 bags of 1000 in 2003 and I am running out.  I liked the non tinted and they were selling the dyed white ones so now I have been looking for 4 months and found Armond&#x27;s in Bogart Georgia, but they don&#x27;t answer emails, phone or Facebook, so I don&#x27;t know which style they choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love if someone who has bought these could describe them and if they have found bulk pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> The Pro Picks are what I expected.  They arrived very quickly.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It feels like it may take the place of flossing. I even keep a box in my car for eating out emergencies!</li>
    <li> Functional, but not wonderfully well made (there are extraneous plastic nubs).</li>
    <li> I bought both styles of these, the green are suppose to be anti-Microbial I can&#x27;t verify that.&lt;br /&gt;Both types are of different material then older style. The old ones seemed to be of a plastic&lt;br /&gt;material and had very thin ends they also had a little abrasive feel on your teeth that made&lt;br /&gt;them feel they were doing a good job. These new ones are nylon? and glide like waxed dental&lt;br /&gt;floss (which I don&#x27;t like). I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
    <li> These are difficult to find, so I was happy to get what I did. They were gifts, so I was disappointed in the condition of the packaging. They were crumpled in a few corners, allowing some of the sealed area to be exposed. They were also covered in dust and dirt as if they sat on a shelf for years.</li>
    <li> Have used these things for years and continue to find them very helpful.  Unfortunately, they changed the packaging from a small, rigid plastic box to these little envelopes.  The toothpicks spill out of these envelopes very easily and I have found myself picking up bunches of these things numerous times.  Really a pain when they spill out in my car.  I wish they would go back to the old packaging.</li>
    <li> We like the old picks they used to make. They were sturdier and now they&#x27;ve changed one end and we don&#x27;t like them. Yes we will use them because we haven&#x27;t found anything else we like, but hopefully they&#x27;ll go back to the way they used to make them. Wished we hadn&#x27;t bought 6 (3 of the ProPick &amp; 3 MicroPick).</li>
    <li> I;ve been looking for  pro Picks for a long time. To replace other plastic picks of other name(exactly the same pick, that I would buy on the store shelf in Michigan, I&#x27;ve been looking for,for years!</li>
    <li> I had one of these in  my pocket at the dentist&#x27;s office and took it out to show her.&lt;br /&gt;She was wanting to know how to source these.  What is great is that you get so much&lt;br /&gt;usage out of one of these....keep it clean and wow months, years, all other toothpicks&lt;br /&gt;are junk compared to these.</li>
    <li> My mom loves these toothpicks but hasn&#x27;t been able to find them in our local stores. I was glad to be able to order these and give them to her. She loves them! They are sturdy and the curved pick on the end is what she loves about them.</li>
    <li> I am Pleased to say,that your ProPicks outperformed my expectations!  Thank You ProPicks !! :)&lt;br /&gt;Shipyard More than I expected !!!</li>
    <li> Although the angled style gets to hard to reach places, the plastic is too soft to be very effective.  This product is somewhat of a disappointment.  I remember using this style of toothpick many years ago.  Back then the item was sturdy enough to really work well.  I won&#x60;t be purchasing any more of these.</li>
    <li> They do exactly as advertised.  Hard to find but worth the effort.  No need for two hands to get flossing done.</li>
    <li> very good and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet but have used them for years and the angle is what makes these unique.  They do a great job!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen these picks for years. They work great and don&#x27;t splinter.</li>
    <li> I received a tooth pick like this from my dentist and thought this was the same item.  It isn&#x27;t.  From the dentist is solid white and a sharper version than ProPick.</li>
    <li> Excellent product as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> hard to find these picks good to find them.&lt;br /&gt;I got my husband to use these regualary&lt;br /&gt; he would not floss so this is a great choice.</li>
    <li> just what we have been looking for!</li>
    <li> These do a great job in getting stuck food from between your teeth.  I always carry some with me and they last a very long time!</li>
    <li> GREAT TOOTHPICK! Works well and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Have been trying to buy the ProPick locally without success.  I highly recommend this product for removing those little things when you are not able to brush.  They are great for using when you just need a quick pick!</li>
    <li> Enjoying propick very much.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Used to buy these propicks at the drugstore a few years ago and then they disappeared.  Was so glad to see them on Amazon but they are not the same product.  The material used is not the same and they are too thick to get between teeth.  Totally wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with the merchandise. Even though their shipping was very late</li>
    <li> These little guys are awesome! I have looked in stores and never fiound them. I am so glad to have found them. They are perfect for hard to get at places. The price was right and delivery was quick. You can re-use these also. Me happy!</li>
    <li> These are good for when I can&#x27;t brush my teeth and have run out of sugarless gum.  The bent end is a bit too pointy however and so you need to be careful not to injure your gum tissue.</li>
    <li> Yes, product is different material from original, but works fine for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pro Picks for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;and am very pleased with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started out when our National Sales Manager from our home office in Atlanta, GA&lt;br /&gt;came to Missouri to attend one of our Transportation Meetings in Springfield, MO and&lt;br /&gt;when I met up with him he saw me with a wood toothpick in my mouth and ask why I had&lt;br /&gt;in my mouth. I told him that I had quit smoking cigarettes and that that was my cigarette&lt;br /&gt;substitute and he said that the wood splinters could get into my system which wasn&#x27;t good&lt;br /&gt;and he offered me a Pro Pick Plastic Toothpick and stated that one of his friends made them,&lt;br /&gt;so every since my family and I have been using them and yes I still use them as a cigarette substitute.</li>
    <li> The picks bend very easily, and are useless for removing any food that is tightly lodged. Wooden toothpicks do much better.</li>
    <li> the service was great.  will order more-thanks</li>
