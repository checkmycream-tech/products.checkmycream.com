      <li>however MY Car smells great now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll make your hair smell great for when he leans in.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>My favorite perfumed lotion -- received promptly!!</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>The scent is excellent but please remember this is NOT a cream, it&#x27;s a lotion and is much more liquid than one might expect.</li>
      <li>The lotion smells great, and I love it!  </li>
      <li>You smell so good....</li>
      <li>I have always loved this product.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to be able to purchase it through Amazon and save money.  </li>
      <li>Will buy more!</li>
      <li>My sister really liked this Palomar Picasso body lotion.</li>
      <li>I received it incredibly fast for an incredible price.</li>
      <li>Could not have been a better experience for me.</li>
      <li>I had been told that men love this scent, after a shower one day, I applied the lotion; my husband ( who has a stuffed nose do to allergies)</li>
      <li>Love the scent of Paloma Picasso Body lotion</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love the lotion,&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sexy and feminine.</li>
      <li>I have been searching all stores for my Paloma Picasso body lotion and talc (still can&#x27;t find the talc), but it always came in a combo pack with the perfume which I have enough of, so I was beyond thrilled to find the product at a good price and viola in 3 days time</li>
      <li>Almost too much to wear to work, but great when I have a date and want to feel pretty and alluring.   </li>
      <li>Other than that it was great.</li>
      <li>I have had trouble finding my favorite body lotion, so receiving in a short time was great!!</li>
      <li>The body lotion is not thick and oily, but more &#x27;moisture&#x27; and perfume.   </li>
      <li>I love the body lotion, it  is fantastic and I find that the scent last for hours.</li>
      <li>but the lotion is just right.  </li>
      <li>Paloma Picasso has been around for a long time, and I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s still around.</li>
      <li>I feel wearing the same scent as a perfume is just too strong</li>
      <li>It smells strong enough that I can get away with wearing just the lotion, for a softer touch than the perfume.      </li>
      <li>Really didn&#x27;t smell like the fragrance should.</li>
      <li>This was a repeat order; I use the perfume and especially like the body lotion as a light scent after a shower.</li>
      <li>I can really recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It is a classic scent that never goes out of style.</li>
      <li>Which probably means I paid too much for the one item....and asks the question - just how old is this body lotion???  </li>
      <li>So along with many others I say I&#x27;m not sure what I grabbed</li>
      <li>said, wow!</li>
      <li>So next time, I&#x27;ll check out who is selling the product a little more thoroughly before I make a purchase..</li>
      <li>Before, when I had to pay almost twice as much, I would ration it out to make it last longer.</li>

    <li> I have been using Palomma Picasso perfume and lotion for over 15 years, and I can no longer find it in department stores, THANK YOU AMAZON!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body lotion everyday for years, and I love the way it stays on in a subtle manner during the day</li>
    <li> My sister really liked this Palomar Picasso body lotion.</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a woman in the mall or somewhere like that, years ago, and asked her what it was. I&#x27;ve been wearing it, off and on, ever since.   It&#x27;s sexy and feminine. Almost too much to wear to work, but great when I have a date and want to feel pretty and alluring.   The body lotion is not thick and oily, but more &#x27;moisture&#x27; and perfume.   It smells strong enough that I can get away with wearing just the lotion, for a softer touch than the perfume.      After you&#x27;ve rubbed it on your arms and legs, and some on your neck, take what&#x27;s still on your hands (if you don&#x27;t have oily hair) and run your hands through or over your hair. It&#x27;ll make your hair smell great for when he leans in. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> Love the scent of Paloma Picasso Body lotion</li>
    <li> I love the body lotion, it  is fantastic and I find that the scent last for hours. I get lots of compliments when I use it. I can really recommend this product. It is a classic scent that never goes out of style. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching all stores for my Paloma Picasso body lotion and talc (still can&#x27;t find the talc), but it always came in a combo pack with the perfume which I have enough of, so I was beyond thrilled to find the product at a good price and viola in 3 days time I received my package.  Could not have been a better experience for me.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble finding my favorite body lotion, so receiving in a short time was great!!</li>
    <li> I had been told that men love this scent, after a shower one day, I applied the lotion; my husband ( who has a stuffed nose do to allergies) said, wow! You smell so good....Thank you Paloma  Picasso!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I feel wearing the same scent as a perfume is just too strong but the lotion is just right.  It is not overwhelming and gives off a suble scent.  I was so happy to be able to purchase it through Amazon and save money.  Before, when I had to pay almost twice as much, I would ration it out to make it last longer. Now I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. However, on the back of the tube I purchased it says....&amp;#34;NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE...&amp;#34; Which leads me to believe at one time it was part of a lotion, perfume and powder set. Which probably means I paid too much for the one item....and asks the question - just how old is this body lotion???  So next time, I&#x27;ll check out who is selling the product a little more thoroughly before I make a purchase..</li>
    <li> When I wear the Picasso I get a lot of what are you wearing. Like everyone else, I don&#x27;t like giving out the name. So along with many others I say I&#x27;m not sure what I grabbed I was in such a hurry.  lol</li>
    <li> My wife is in Fiji.  I was going to visit her.  She asked if I could get her some Paloma Picasso lotion.  I was leaving in 4 days so I told her maybe.  I called Macy&#x27;s and other department stores and nobody had the product.  I checked Amazon and they did.  I paid a bit extra for expedited shipping and was informed it would arrive in 3-5 days.  It got here in 3 days., the day before I left  When I arrived in Fiji and gave it to my wife she was ecstatic.  I was her hero.</li>
    <li> The scent is excellent but please remember this is NOT a cream, it&#x27;s a lotion and is much more liquid than one might expect. I don&#x27;t care because the scent is so close to the perfume  and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product. It is the only scent I wear. I received it incredibly fast for an incredible price.</li>
    <li> It took longer than expected for it to arrive. Other than that it was great. It was almost lake for val. day.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion,&lt;br /&gt;How ever the bottle had a hole in the seem and I have lost some product. I am not sure if the was a defected bottle or not.&lt;br /&gt;But however MY Car smells great now.</li>
    <li> Excelente, mercadoria no prazo, em perfeito estado, o vendedor muito atencioso, forma de pagamento correta. Sem problemas com a mercadoria ou com o vendedor.</li>
    <li> I have been using Paloma Picasso for years and it never disappoints!</li>
    <li> The lotion smells great, and I love it!  Paloma Picasso has been around for a long time, and I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s still around.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for over 25 years and will keep buying it as long as I am on this earth and they continue to sell it.  LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lotion that goes on your skin and is greaseless and so fragrant.</li>
    <li> This was a repeat order; I use the perfume and especially like the body lotion as a light scent after a shower.</li>
