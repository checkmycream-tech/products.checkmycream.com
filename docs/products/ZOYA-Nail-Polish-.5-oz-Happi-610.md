      <li>I love Zoya.</li>
      <li>I LOVE Zoya.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite polishes ever.</li>
      <li>This shade is very bright, pretty, and fresh.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s pretty awesome!), but I have a new love in Zoya.</li>
      <li>I like it best as a top coat over pink, coral, and orange colors.</li>
      <li>very nice colors,good staying power and low toxicity</li>
      <li>High quality nice polish.</li>
      <li>Combine the nail color with their base coat (anchor), top coat (Armor) and Fast Drying Drops (more impressive than OPI&#x27;s) and you&#x27;ll have a  salon looking manicure at home. &#x27;</li>
      <li>Zoya polishes last longer than most polishes and they have the widest variety of exciting colors.</li>
      <li>I love the color, but it did require 3 coats for me to be opaque enough.</li>
      <li>Love the gold to pink effect.</li>
      <li>Very upset about returning policy.  </li>
      <li>Fast drying.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Happi&#x27; is a fantastic color for anyone, but especially for blondes!!!  </li>
      <li>Love the pink with gold!</li>
      <li>Lasts a decent amount of time.  </li>
      <li>A little more muted than in the image when it goes on.  </li>
      <li>I loved the color, but it was broken and spilled all over the package it was shipped in.</li>
      <li>You need to bring it to life with a glossy clear polish!</li>
      <li>so you will need 3 coats, however it will last so I will buy other colors from Zoya:-)  </li>
      <li>it was pretty, but a third coat would have probably made it to the color on the bottle.</li>
      <li>Such a pretty color for summer.  </li>

<li> The color is pretty but a bit dry or dull looking.</li>
<li> Other than that, I like it.</li>
<li> Plus, doesn&#x27;t have any of the yucky toxic chemicals that other nail polishes do.</li>
<li> I have nothing negative to say about this other than it&#x27;s a little lighter than I expected.</li>
<li> A little lighter than on screen.</li>
<li> Not a fan of the black, blue, and green nail polish shades that make you look as if you got careless with a hammer!  </li>
<li> Goes on thin</li>

    <li> Color is great.  A little more muted than in the image when it goes on.  Lasts a decent amount of time.  Goes on thin so you will need 3 coats, however it will last so I will buy other colors from Zoya:-)  Plus, doesn&#x27;t have any of the yucky toxic chemicals that other nail polishes do.</li>
    <li> I loved the color, but it was broken and spilled all over the package it was shipped in. I don&#x27;t have a phone with a camera so I could not send it back.  Very upset about returning policy.  I just want the polish.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite polishes ever. I like it best as a top coat over pink, coral, and orange colors. It transforms the color and delivers incredible shine and wear. It lives up to its name--makes me happy.</li>
    <li> A little lighter than on screen. Two coats and it was pretty, but a third coat would have probably made it to the color on the bottle. Love the gold to pink effect.</li>
    <li> Will never buy another brand of nail polish again!! Love this color and it lasts!!  Wear it on my toes and I am thrilled! :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, true to picture. Fast drying.</li>
    <li> this polish will go on my toes for sure. this polish brand is amazing to me with it being good to the nails and drying fairly quickly</li>
    <li> I love Zoya. This nailpolish basically only needs one coat (or two if you want the color to be very deep). Zoya polishes last longer than most polishes and they have the widest variety of exciting colors. I LOVE Zoya.</li>
    <li> I have nothing negative to say about this other than it&#x27;s a little lighter than I expected. Other than that, I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Zoya polish, for about a year now.  I have natural brittle nails, so this polish, stays on my nails longer than any other brands that I&#x27;ve tried.  The colors to choose from are gorgeous.  High quality nice polish.</li>
    <li> Such a pretty color for summer.  The hint of gold is just perfect.</li>
    <li> For years, I have been an OPI loyalist. I&#x27;ve swayed to use Essie for their &#x27;Cherry Pop&#x27; color with french manicures (it&#x27;s pretty awesome!), but I have a new love in Zoya. The colors are beautiful and its staying power is great. Combine the nail color with their base coat (anchor), top coat (Armor) and Fast Drying Drops (more impressive than OPI&#x27;s) and you&#x27;ll have a  salon looking manicure at home. &#x27;Happi&#x27; is a fantastic color for anyone, but especially for blondes!!!  Love the pink with gold!</li>
