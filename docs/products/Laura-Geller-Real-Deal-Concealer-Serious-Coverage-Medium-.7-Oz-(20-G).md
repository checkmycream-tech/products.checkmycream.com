      <li>Settled into fine lines around eyes.</li>
      <li>I have very dark circles under my eyes and this works awesome.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic.  </li>

      <li>the thing is still half full!!!</li>
      <li>During these hot summer months, I can just use this around my eyes and I&#x27;m set to go.</li>
      <li>I love this concealer and can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a good concealer that will not only brighten under my eyes and my eyelids, but will also give me that extra lil&#x27; kick.</li>
      <li>This concealer stays on all day and covers blemishes very well.</li>
      <li>If anyone is on the line about buying the Real Deal Concealer</li>
      <li>I use the Medium Deep color as Laura Geller&#x27;s color tones are on the light side.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true Smash Box High Definition concealer for my under eye area.</li>
      <li>I have tried a hundred high end/low end concealers.  </li>
      <li>Highly considering returning this.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, which is good.</li>
      <li>I use it primarily to lighten the dark circles understand my eyes; and, it works very well.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price, would definitely reorder .</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to buy a new one any time soon...</li>
      <li>My can&#x27;t live without product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smooth going on, coverage &amp; concealing ability fantastic, &amp; as another reviewer pointed out very little goes a long long way</li>
      <li>and it still does not cover my age spots completely.  </li>
      <li>Have also started mixing a tiny bit with different primers/lotions for an outstanding long lasting bb cream.  </li>
      <li>I have dark spots on my cheeks from too much sun/light exposure and very pigmented.  </li>
      <li>This is the only concealer that makes me feel like my skin is normal again (without discolorations).  </li>
      <li>I desperate need a good concealer to cover my age spots</li>
      <li>and for the price, it seems like any other concealer I can pick up at the drug store for much cheaper.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, it&#x27;s one and only major downfall (but it&#x27;s a big one!)</li>
      <li>Long lasting and completely natural looking.  </li>

<li> I did have to go up a shade that I usually order though.</li>
<li> I was scared of the size..because its small for 22 bux..</li>
<li> For everyday use, just a touch here and there, spready around and perfection!  </li>
<li> It got to the point that I just started buying any/all that were recommended to me in department stores because it&#x27;s all about a numbers game,</li>
<li> is that it settles into creases :(</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <li> good, a bit heavy, but thins out nicely.</li>
    <li> Good product at a fair price</li>
    <li> I have tried a hundred high end/low end concealers.  I have dark spots on my cheeks from too much sun/light exposure and very pigmented.  This is the only concealer that makes me feel like my skin is normal again (without discolorations).  I am so glad to have found this concealer.  I use the Medium Deep color as Laura Geller&#x27;s color tones are on the light side.  I&#x27;m Filipino and usually use a Medium Beige shade in Bare Escentuals (BE), but due to the dark pigments on my cheeks I&#x27;ve opted to use a darker concealer to blend it all together.  I use the Bare Escentuals on top of this concealer followed by Blush or Warmth (BE).  This is fantastic.  Please don&#x27;t hesitate to try this.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found in concealing dark pigmentation.  I can&#x27;t be without this product in my beauty bag.</li>
    <li> Settled into fine lines around eyes. Very little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a good concealer that will not only brighten under my eyes and my eyelids, but will also give me that extra lil&#x27; kick. I&#x27;ve wasted hours of my life researching and I&#x27;ve wasted even more money that I&#x27;d ever care to know trying to find the perfect concealer by way of giving every one a fair chance. It got to the point that I just started buying any/all that were recommended to me in department stores because it&#x27;s all about a numbers game, right? I dunno. But what I do know is that winter/spring/summer/fall...hot/cold/snowy/balmy...this concealer is all I need. It doesn&#x27;t make my lids oily. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have to check on it. It&#x27;s reliable. It brightens me and I swear I bought it over a year ago and I don&#x27;t have to buy a new one any time soon...the thing is still half full!!! During these hot summer months, I can just use this around my eyes and I&#x27;m set to go. I love this concealer and can&#x27;t say enough about it. It&#x27;s become like trusted friend.</li>
    <li> All you need is a small amount and it goes a long way.....great product...smaller than I expected but no need for a big one..this will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage. Use sparingly goes along way.  Just a few dots is all that is necessary.  Well worth the price, would definitely reorder .</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have very dark circles under my eyes and this works awesome.</li>
    <li> Believe the hype.  This concealer lives up to every one of it&#x27;s claims &amp; is amazing. It&#x27;s ALMOST perfect, but not quite. It&#x27;s very smooth going on, coverage &amp; concealing ability fantastic, &amp; as another reviewer pointed out very little goes a long long way so you get a lot of bang for your buck. HOWEVER, it&#x27;s one and only major downfall (but it&#x27;s a big one!) is that it settles into creases :( I&#x27;ll continue to use this for coverage of sun spots, blemishes, discoloration etc. but I&#x27;m going back to my tried and true Smash Box High Definition concealer for my under eye area.</li>
    <li> Not so great.. very average</li>
    <li> I was scared of the size..because its small for 22 bux..but literally u only need a dab...only a dab to cover up..and&#x3D;y more then that will ruin it. :) im in love.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. A little goes a long way.  And it lasts all day!  Great coverage, even under those pesky eye circles!  I often find I don&#x27;t even need foundation.  For everyday use, just a touch here and there, spready around and perfection!  My can&#x27;t live without product.  I did have to go up a shade that I usually order though.</li>
    <li> This concealer stays on all day and covers blemishes very well. I would purchase again. I wish it came in a larger portion.</li>
    <li> This Real Deal Concealer is going to be great if you are in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to put foundation on just put this concealer and it works perfect. I am really happy that I decided to try it. If anyone is on the line about buying the Real Deal Concealer I think you will be happy with the product. A little goes a long way, which is good. It will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;MLP</li>

    <li> I desperate need a good concealer to cover my age spots but this one did not deliver.  People said you only need a little bit.  I put a lot and it still does not cover my age spots completely.  It is no better than the Maybelline concealer that I had.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent for spot concealing. Have also started mixing a tiny bit with different primers/lotions for an outstanding long lasting bb cream.  Long lasting and completely natural looking.  A lot of value here.</li>
    <li> Highly considering returning this. It&#x27;s thick and too dark for me. I wasn&#x27;t sure and took a chance (my fault!) and for the price, it seems like any other concealer I can pick up at the drug store for much cheaper. This might be good for summer use, but I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, perfect color and it lasts for a very long time. I always buy two so I can have one in reserve.</li>
