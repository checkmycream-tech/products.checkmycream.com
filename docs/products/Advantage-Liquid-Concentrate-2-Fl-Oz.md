      <li>Glad I could buy it online.  </li>
      <li>I could not say for sure</li>
      <li>booklet included lists many other ways to use this wonderful product and it&#x27;s well worth to give it a chance and try!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m convinced the ALC in the water does a great job of keeping my nasal passages (and interior surfaces of mask/hose/tank) free of any possible sources of infection or</li>
      <li>I added some drops to my gallon container already filled with the concoction and used it immediately.</li>
      <li>Gargling with mixed in some water is also great for sore throats.</li>

      <li>vinegar).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put it in my laundry to get rid of any smells, also adding couple of drops to any of the (indoor or outdoor) water fountains keeps the water much cleaner and free of microorganisms for longer periods of time, and on and on.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think these are worth a try.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a regular (and enthusiastic)</li>

      <li>the bottle came in pretty quickly</li>
      <li>adding couple of drops to a glass of water makes great mouthwash, sore throat gargle, or overall internal body cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>This was our first time using \\&quot;ALC\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It started mostly after a kidney infection that I had 2 years ago and it never healed properly.</li>
      <li>At 1 to 2 drops per use, the bottle should easily last more than a year.</li>
      <li>we ordered this for my dad and are very pleased, next time i might order the six pack though and save a little more money.</li>
      <li>I was just using the recipe without the gse and wasn&#x27;t getting much results.</li>
      <li>This product works marvelously and my teeth have never been cleaner even with very expensive toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>, it felt gross and did not do anything for me, so I would not recommend doing that, but if you are adventurous enough you can always try it and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>even I almost forgot how it feels to be normal.</li>
      <li>After a few days of taking this liquid internally, 5 drops per glass of water morning and night, I felt good, just back to normal</li>
      <li>There are several other varieties of grapefruit seed extracts available, however to my knowledge, after extensive online research, this came out as the only one that is actually really safe to use internally.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>I bought this item because I&#x27;d read a recipe for a natural toothpaste made from baking soda and grapefruit seed extract.  </li>
      <li>Anyone who is sensitive to foods and products will react to this.</li>
      <li>ALC has my complete faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>Stopped it after 1 week and symtpoms started to appear so contiued it for another 7 days and after the 14 day use we never got the full blown whatever we were coming down with.</li>

<li> Whatever it was, the drops killed it.</li>
<li> We were both coming down with the flu or bad cold starting with the watery eyes, runny nose, headaches and some light sensativity.</li>
<li> I took 10 drops a day for about 7 days  and no more cough.</li>
<li> I had a cough for the past 2 months and it would not go away.</li>
<li> Just not pleased.</li>
<li> Find a quality product that is pure: 100% grapefruit seed extract with no added artificial and unhealthy fillers/ingredients.</li>

<li> Even when they are around other sick kids, they don&#x27;t catch what they have.  </li>
<li> I read that GSE attacks the germs associated with the common head cold because it&#x27;s a herbal antibiotic, but this product has failed in helping me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product regularly for a number of years and have never been sick or felt like I was getting sick.  </li>
<li> No doctors could find what was wrong with me</li>
<li> I&#x27;m skeptical about this product and company.</li>
<li> Again doctors did not find anything wrong with me and said that it was all in my head.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using ALC for years and am hardly ever sick.</li>
<li> taste is terrible and reminds me of drinking bitter water with rubbing alcohol in it.</li>
<li> I have been taking this faithfully for almost a week to help with an oncoming cold.</li>
<li> I was always feeling sick, not myself.</li>
<li> I refuse to get sick!</li>
<li> the taste is way to nasty even if you mix it with juice.</li>
<li> Horrible product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works wonderfully, both internally and externally.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Glad I could buy it online.  It&#x27;s the same product I buy from my doctor.  Now I can get it faster through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This was our first time using \\&quot;ALC\\&quot;. Was recommended by our Chiropractor. We were both coming down with the flu or bad cold starting with the watery eyes, runny nose, headaches and some light sensativity. Started using this every day and the following day the symptoms were 95% gone. Stopped it after 1 week and symtpoms started to appear so contiued it for another 7 days and after the 14 day use we never got the full blown whatever we were coming down with. Worked for both the wife and I. We ordered 2 more as backup now. Made believers out of us. With our other health issues it makes it much harder to deal with the flu or cold so this saved out butts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a regular (and enthusiastic) ALC user for fifteen years. Most of the uses are covered in the booklet. I will (hopefully) never be without ALC, and I start to get &#x27;antsy&#x27; when I&#x27;m down to my last bottle. ALC has my complete faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I use it for, that I&#x27;ve never seen mentioned anywhere: Due to Sleep Apnea, I use a C-PAP machine with a humidifier tank in which I use only distilled water. Every time I open a new gallon of distilled water, I squeeze a dropper-full (about thirty drops) of ALC in. Each day before I refill the humidifier tank, I give the gallon jug a shake then top up the tank.  I&#x27;m convinced the ALC in the water does a great job of keeping my nasal passages (and interior surfaces of mask/hose/tank) free of any possible sources of infection or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it in my regular weekly cleaning of the C-PAP tank, hose and mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great and unique product.</li>
    <li> Major improvement in a week after months of fungal problems.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;I put it in juice and drink it, I&#x27;ve put drops on cuts or sores, drops on toothpaste, and even another review gave me the idea to use in my neti pot, which seemed to help a lot last time I was sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t exactly know the science behind it but this stuff definitely has healing benefits.&lt;br /&gt;When I run out I will be buying another bottle.</li>
    <li> I think these are worth a try.  I could not say for sure but they seem to help.</li>
    <li> I have some kind of bacterial infection throughout my body similar to MS.  A friend recommended this and i used it for about 7 months to help me with the anerobic bacteria.  I had to up the ante and started using oil of oregano to finish the job of ridding the bacteria out of my body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about this product and company. Firstly, if the product does indeed contain GSE, why then does the ingredient list read &amp;#34;citrus seed extract?&amp;#34; Why are they being vague about the type of fruit being used? Secondly, their website provides very little info/description about this product. Not helpful, and not very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has not helped with my digestive issues. Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and can be used so many ways. Will not be without it!</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have found to cure sickness. As a natural antibiotic/antiviral it works just as good as an antibiotic if not better without the horrible side effects. We will always use this to prevent and cure colds and flu!</li>
    <li> This product is falsely advertised. Don&#x27;t buy it! It&#x27;s not pure. This also contains additional ingredients that are not listed, including ascorbic acid, citric acid, potassium sorbate, and dextrose. Anyone who is sensitive to foods and products will react to this. Find a quality product that is pure: 100% grapefruit seed extract with no added artificial and unhealthy fillers/ingredients. Horrible product.</li>
    <li> There is not much more to add to all the other reviews here, other than I have used this as both internal and external disinfectant for a long time and love it.  There are several other varieties of grapefruit seed extracts available, however to my knowledge, after extensive online research, this came out as the only one that is actually really safe to use internally.&lt;br /&gt;Just adding couple of drops to a glass of water makes great mouthwash, sore throat gargle, or overall internal body cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;My friend claims putting couple of drops in the water and running it through the nasal cavities always clears out her seasonal allergy symptoms.  I tried it once, it felt gross and did not do anything for me, so I would not recommend doing that, but if you are adventurous enough you can always try it and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the ladies - this is the best way I found to sanitize all my re-usable feminine products and also use as a douching solution (just couple of drops in clean water works even better than the apple cider vinegar).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put it in my laundry to get rid of any smells, also adding couple of drops to any of the (indoor or outdoor) water fountains keeps the water much cleaner and free of microorganisms for longer periods of time, and on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The booklet included lists many other ways to use this wonderful product and it&#x27;s well worth to give it a chance and try!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for grapefruit seed extract for a neti pot recipe I have found. I was just using the recipe without the gse and wasn&#x27;t getting much results. Soon as I received this concentrate  I added some drops to my gallon container already filled with the concoction and used it immediately. The difference was amazing. Feeling better already (chronic sinusitis)</li>
    <li> the bottle came in pretty quickly and i thought it had been packaged very nicely. we ordered this for my dad and are very pleased, next time i might order the six pack though and save a little more money.</li>
    <li> This works! You take it in juice or I put it in my tea and if I take it a couple times a day it keeps my stomach from hurting all the time and keeps sickness at bay. Gargling with mixed in some water is also great for sore throats.</li>
    <li> A friend suggested this natural product to me after a bad reaction to a generic z-pack. I had a cough for the past 2 months and it would not go away. After taking this for 4 days the cough was almost gone. I took 10 drops a day for about 7 days  and no more cough.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product regularly for a number of years and have never been sick or felt like I was getting sick.  While I cannot say for sure that the ALC is directly responsible for my health, I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  I take it daily by mixing the drops in my morning orange juice.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this faithfully for almost a week to help with an oncoming cold. Hasn&#x27;t made one i oda of a difference. I read that GSE attacks the germs associated with the common head cold because it&#x27;s a herbal antibiotic, but this product has failed in helping me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is terrible and reminds me of drinking bitter water with rubbing alcohol in it. Yuck!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband years ago. He was using it for canker sores in his mouth. I only recently decided to use it internally. I have read about it in one book called Herbal Antibiotics and decided to try. I had this chills and weakness for years in my body. I am only 40 now. No doctors could find what was wrong with me but I could feel that something slowly sucking energy and life out of me. I was always feeling sick, not myself.It started mostly after a kidney infection that I had 2 years ago and it never healed properly. Again doctors did not find anything wrong with me and said that it was all in my head.  After a few days of taking this liquid internally, 5 drops per glass of water morning and night, I felt good, just back to normal even I almost forgot how it feels to be normal. I hope that more people will discover this miracle product. Just wanted to share. I think that some kind of bacterial infection was torturing me for years but it was not strong enough to show it in my blood work. My blood was always withing norm but I wasn&#x27;t. I thought I had HIV and got tested but results came back negative. Whatever it was, the drops killed it. I am so happy that I have tried it.</li>
    <li> Works well for me as well as for my dog.  I use it in my humidifier for allergies through out the home.  I have the book that comes along with the product that I purchased somewhere else.  Will keep buying it</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I&#x27;d read a recipe for a natural toothpaste made from baking soda and grapefruit seed extract.  This product works marvelously and my teeth have never been cleaner even with very expensive toothpaste.  At 1 to 2 drops per use, the bottle should easily last more than a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ALC for years and am hardly ever sick. My children are also very seldom sick when they take these drops regularly.  Even when they are around other sick kids, they don&#x27;t catch what they have.  Can&#x27;t remember the last runny nose in our house.</li>
    <li> the moment I feel a scratchy throat, I take drops of this... I refuse to get sick!</li>
    <li> It didnt do what It said it was good for. the taste is way to nasty even if you mix it with juice. Just not pleased. Wont be recommending it.</li>
