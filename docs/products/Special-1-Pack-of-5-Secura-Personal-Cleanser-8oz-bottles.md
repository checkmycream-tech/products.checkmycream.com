<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is routinely used in nursing homes for personal care. It is safe and gentle. Yes, I use it on myself (&amp;#34;bidet in a bottle&amp;#34;), but my primary use is to clean my fat cat&#x27;s bum, since she can&#x27;t reach it herself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s getting to the point that my companion can&#x27;t get me in &amp; out of the shower like he used to. This is great for the days I need to take a sponge bath since no rinsing is required.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleanser as I have a disability so it is not convenient for me to get into a tub or shower to bath.  I first learned about this product when I was in a rehab center for a short time for my disability.  They used it to cleanse after using the commode.  It cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t cause irritations.  It has a nice fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger after usage.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone that cannot cleanse well through tub or shower.</li>
    <li> Use this on a regular basis after working out.....</li>
    <li> Excellant cleanser. I will reorder when this supply runs out.</li>
    <li> HELPS IN MY DAILY BATHING</li>
    <li> this is the best personal cleaner of them all.  it was given to me in hospital after extensive surgery and it  really works well.  i use it daily  now after showering and it really does eliminate odor  and keep you fresh all day.  especially good for people who may be incontinent.</li>

    <li> This is the brand I found they use in health care facilities.  It is great for between showers or baths for freshening up.</li>
    <li> When my husband was in the hospital they used this product.  When he got home I ordered 6 bottles from Amazon.com. This is a wonderful product.  Convenient &amp; easy to use. It works really well to clean the whole body and smells nice. Takes care of all body oders. It does NOT have a perfume or medical \\&quot;Cover up\\&quot; smell. Just leaves a clean fresh smell.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to. Mother in law loves it</li>
