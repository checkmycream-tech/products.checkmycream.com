<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> From the fast delivery time to the high end container, and to actual serum, I am very happy with this purchase.  The bottle is good quality, not flimsy.  I do not have to worry about breaking it with my manly-brute ways. :)  Seriously though, I am glad I do not have to worry about breaking the bottle.  The serum is good too.  I could feel it work on my face.  It reminds me of acne treatment serums.  It&#x27;s strong, yet it is safe.  I like getting products that work.  I can tell this stuff is going to make my wife want to kiss my face all the time. :)</li>
    <li> I apply this product in the morning after cleaning my face.  My skin is dry and sensitive and this sure has helped with no skin reactions.  This has helped with the dryness and I am very happy with the results.  Made in the USA is a big plus in my book.  I have only used this a few days but so far my feelings have been positive as skin isn&#x27;t as dry which in turn gives me a more youthful looking face.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I have not received any compensation for writing this post. I have no material connection to the brands, products, or services that I have mentioned. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.”</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been using it every night, it make my face feel so good</li>
    <li> When I saw this item I was hesitant at first to get it. I&#x27;ve only recently started to develop small wrinkles around my eyes, but I figured why not try it. I&#x27;m very happy I did. It&#x27;s only been a few days now but my skin feels wonderful. My sister ended up using it too, to help with some dark spots on her face. I would give this a full 5 stars, but I want to see how It helps her. I&#x27;ll post an update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> It is amazing. I got a high discount code, then I think I will give it a try. After I use it, it give me surprise. My skin become more smooth than before.</li>
    <li> Very impressed!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few days, but so far I really like it. Feels smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin SO supple! Vitamin C is great for brightening but also for tightening the pores and creating a smooth, soft complexion! After just a few days, I noticed a big difference in how soft my skin is and a huge improvement in the texture.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. I find it works really well as a moisturizer for my face, chest and neck. My skin usually feels tight and dry after a shower but after using this product it made my skin feel hydrated and soft without having a greasy effect like some other moisturizers do. I haven&#x27;t noticed any skin tone or complexion differences yet, but I definitely notice more radiance in my skin. I am also impressed with the quality of the ingredients. I will definitely be using this as a part of my moisturizing routine.</li>
    <li> Out of many products on the market right now, I liked this one the best of the new serum varieties.  It goes on a little oily, but quickly absorbed into the skin.  It could be a little thicker; the application pump spits out the serum with so much force it isn&#x27;t hard to miss your finger.  Put your finger next to the applicator, and the liquid tends to seep around your finger and down the nozzle.  Small complaint, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of use I began noticing my skin smoothing out a bit and pores clearing up.  I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to comment on long term usage, but I&#x27;ll update when I can.</li>
    <li> My Skin tone seems to have evened out and my skin feels firmer. It also has given my skin a bright glow like I had when I was younger. I even had someone comment on my skin and ask me what I was doing to have it look so good.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. It has a very light scent. It is non-greasy and smooth on my face. It makes my face feel soft and radiate. I feel it has helped repair my skin by minimizing fine lines around my eyes, reducing dark spots and improving firmness.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and absorbs quickly... a great follow to my face wash.</li>
    <li> The packaging for this serum is so very pretty! I love that it comes with a pump which makes it way easier to dispense. A little of the serum goes a long way. The directions suggest two pumps. I love that it has a light citrus scent but also a little floral. I prefer to use it at night and it makes my skin so soft and leaves it glowing all day long the next day. My absorbs vey quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy oily feeling to it. I love the way it&#x27;s makin my skin look more firm. I received it a discounted price to review but in all honesty this stuff is AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> This renew c anti aging serum feels great on my skin and makes my skin look smoother. It&#x27;s great that it has vitaman c and aloe in it also the pump is great it gives you the amount you need with one push of the pump.</li>
    <li> I have pretty damaged skin on my face and upper chest and neck area from sun exposure. So when I was offered this RenewC Advancede Treatment Serum for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I love how refreshed my face looks. It really feels tighter with lines that are fading slowly but definitely less defined. If you are wanting a light non greasy serum, I definitely recommend this one from RenewC.</li>
    <li> Great smell &amp; it seems to be working. My face is brighter and smooth. Huge bottle compared to some other merchants</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;It truly has delivered what it claims.  I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;many Vitamin C serums but none of them compare&lt;br /&gt;to the results I&#x27;ve gotten from this one.  My skin&lt;br /&gt;became instantly smoother and more even toned&lt;br /&gt;after only 3 days of instructed usage.  Penetrates&lt;br /&gt;well and visibly increased my skin&#x27;s density by fil-&lt;br /&gt;ling in my fine lines and wrinkles.  Hydrates really&lt;br /&gt;well without the need to apply a moisturizer after&lt;br /&gt;wards.  Overall, my skin has reclaimed it&#x27;s glow&lt;br /&gt;and the sun spots have continued to fade.  It&#x27;s been&lt;br /&gt;a little over a month now, so I know the results will&lt;br /&gt;continue to improve as long as I keep applying this&lt;br /&gt;product as prescribed.  The main ingredient in this&lt;br /&gt;product is the chiral version of vitamin C called&lt;br /&gt;L-ascorbic acid which makes all the difference&lt;br /&gt;in the overall effectiveness of this vitamin.  Plus it&lt;br /&gt;is incorporated in the right percentage which keeps it&lt;br /&gt;stable and potent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product love my renewc&lt;br /&gt; sereum my skin and complexion are more vibrant have a glow and I feel my skin more firm as well . I like the silky feel if has when I put it on and a light fragrant smell. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read this review with an unbiased opinion I have not received these products for free I have paid for them</li>
    <li> Renew C is one of my favorite products. I noticed a difference in my blotchy skin within the first couple of days. It smooths and hydrates my face very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks and I&#x27;m not sure about the anti-aging aspects, but I do like how the serum feels on my skin. I apply the solution to my face every night after washing my face which leaves my skin feeling clean all night. I&#x27;ll continue to use it for that benefit alone.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good item. Makes my skin feel really soft! #ILovetoReview</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It left my skin feeling very sticky.</li>
    <li> This product was ok. I did not like the texture or residue that was left behind after using. compared to more expensive brands, this is comparable and I may buy in the future</li>
    <li> I received the renewC Vitamin C Serum to review and I have been using it for the past few days as part of my morning and night routine. Already I am noticing that my skin is firmer and my skin tone is more even as compared to how it was last week. The best unexpected result is how my makeup foundation goes on so much smoother now since my skin is so taut. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this serum!  It is a little sticky going on, but that just shows there is real aloe vera in the product. It soaks in and makes the skin so smooth!</li>
    <li> I have tried several Vitamin C Serums over the last year. I have fine lines and my pores are starting to show. I&#x27;m turning 39 so it was expected right? There isn&#x27;t really much information I can give on the product that hasn&#x27;t been said several times before. If you are here reading reviews then you already know what a serum like this is supposed to do and how it is supposed to work over the long-term. My review is going to be on this product versus other leading products of the same kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the sticky residue feeling that I have felt with other serums.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like the face is being held in place by a film. Some of the other serums I have tried feel like you have a thin mask over your face.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t too runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to take a lot to cover the whole face. It was taking several pumps of the product to get the entire face covered. This means you&#x27;ll go through the product faster which I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone uses the serum as a full face treatment. Some just use it on trouble spots or around fine wrinkles. If this serum is for that and not for a full face treatment, I do feel the company should be clear about that on the packaging or in the description. That is why I&#x27;m giving it a four star rating and not a five.</li>
    <li> Loved the way it made my skin look. Made it feel very soft. My only complaint was that with the astaxanthin in it it leaves a slight fishy smell on my hands. Astaxanthin is an excellent supplement for making your skin look amazing but definitely wash your hands after! :)</li>
    <li> This product stung my eyes when sweating. I would not put on before a work out again. Otherwise it felt great on my skin. I love serums that are lightweight and not sticky and make my skin feel a bit tight before a moisturizer.  Did feel amazing after a sunburn. Has aloe which was pretty soothing.  I also dropped this in my bathroom. Almost towards the end of the bottle but it broke all over.</li>
    <li> This is good renew C good product, is amazing really give you best result, satisfied this product, helps my th face renew.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I will continue using :) I love that you only have to use a small amount of it &amp; the light texture is wonderful as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product. Especially if you are looking for a Serum</li>
    <li> I have been using the Treatment Serum for 2 weeks.  I do love how it made my skin feel and look.  Vibrant and Healthy.  I would definitely  buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for just a couple of weeks and as I&#x27;m sure the  results will get better and better as time goes by, but what I can say for the few weeks I&#x27;ve used it and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin texture and clarity in a  very good way, my skin seems brighter and the pores not as big, which on the cheeks is a problem for me  i&#x27;m sure with continual use my skin will get better and better I will keep you posted as I was asked to give my honest opinion on this product negative or positive for trying it out.  And with results I&#x27;ve got so far I would definitely recommend it !</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel soft, very nice smell, does not make your face greasy.  i use it before i put my makeup on.  I like it i would by it again.</li>
    <li> I received this serum through iLoveToReview and was excited to get it. The presentation is very nice and the serum itself is quite watery. I have very sensitive and oily skin which I&#x27;ve been able to control pretty well over the past years. This product applied to my face, however, makes me quite oily about an hour after I apply it (it did NOT break me out, though, which I am thankful for). I tested it for a while, making sure it wasn&#x27;t my diet or water intake that was producing the oil, and I believe it was the serum. What I&#x27;m doing now is applying it only to my neck and decolletage. It leaves a thin film which I don&#x27;t mind. I don&#x27;t normally take care of my neck and decolletage as I should, so I&#x27;m happy to have a product designated to those areas. If I see favorable progress, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for about a week. I have red tiny blood vessels on my cheeks that tend to even show through foundation which I use to cover the redness. Since I have been using this product, the tiny vessels are slowly disappearing and I am not needing to wear foundation anymore. I would recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to write this review this product, because I wanted to make sure I wasn&#x27;t doing a knee-jerk reaction to the product. Now, I&#x27;m not a particularly old woman - I&#x27;m 25 - however, I&#x27;ve been through enough stress that my face doesn&#x27;t necessarily look its age. I have dark circles and wrinkles in places that I feel should not be there at my age. I&#x27;m also unfortunate enough to have sensitive skin, so a lot of skin care products don&#x27;t play nice with my face and I end up looking worse than when I started.  So I decided to take my time with this one, as it&#x27;s supposed to be a long-term product being anti-aging and all. I will say that I was pleased the product didn&#x27;t damage my skin in any way, and it did make it feel very soft and pleasant to the touch. It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor, either.  Is it a miracle worker? Nah, I wouldn&#x27;t say that. It didn&#x27;t magically get rid of anything, but my face does look brighter, and my dark circles don&#x27;t look as noticeable as they did after maybe two weeks&#x27; worth worth of usage. It doesn&#x27;t leave a gross feeling, either, which some anti-aging serums I have used has done in the past.  I was hesitant to try this product out (discounted for unbiased review) because no anti-aging serum has been good enough for me to want to continue to use it. However, I feel that the amount of product that you get for the price, along with the refreshed feeling I get when using the serum, I feel that it is a good purchase and I plan to purchase another bottle once this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Did not buy this product</li>
    <li> This product works great my skin has never felt better. The only down side is that it is a little runny. It would be great in gel for otherwise it is awesome!</li>
    <li> This product has potential however there may be more bad than good. I wish I would have taken a before and after pic because you never really know if there was a change in this short amount of time. I did like how this product made my skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:  This product should not be in a pump type bottle. It specifically said shake and when I did that and then pumped it on my fingers it came out with a lot of bubbles and air. Sometimes it would even squirt of my hand. I feel like this should be in a bottle with a dropper or something along those lines.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing about this product is that its not only vitamin c but also has aloe vera. Im using this product currently because I applied a topical medication and it not only burned my skin but also dried it out and caused itchy flaky skin. One of the other features in this product that helped soothe my skin was that has skin cell renewing formula so now my skin has returned to feeling like skin and not like sand paper. When I buy products especially when they go on my face I make sure that they include organic ingredients. Right away this package lists that this product is paraben free, vegan and cruelty free. So I was elated to know Im using something good. I like to use this product best in the morning and night when skin better absorbs moisture. After using this product my skin just seems to feel much softer and fresh. Two pumps like the package says is what you need. Serum is watery not thick and goes on smoothly. You get 1fl oz which is quite a lot for using only two pumps of product at a time. Product should not be used on any irritated or broken skin since it does have ingredients that can cause further irritation and/or skin to sting when applied. I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I am a 26-year old female who has dry skin but generally has few problems in terms of acne or wrinkles.  I bought this serum because of the aloe and hyluronic acid, which are supposed to help with dry skin.  Admittedly, you won&#x27;t see major results in the first few uses but I have noticed an increase in the dewiness of my skin.  This seems to minimise my pores a bit as well since my skin feels smoother after use.  I will update you all on the more long-term effects but I do think that this is effective in reversing some of the signs of aging and improving the look of your skin.  The bottle itself is 1 fluid ounce and the product is liquidy so I&#x27;d imagine that this lasts about a month or two.</li>
    <li> This serum is great it has helped my skin texture/tone feel lot better. The serum doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. We use daily after a face wash and damp cloth.  I will purchase this brand again in the future. I got this for a very discounted price.</li>
    <li> Love the packaging, looks professional. I&#x27;m not used to shaking my serum before use, but followed the bottles directions for max benefits. The pump dispenses the correct amount of serum easily and I find I like it more than a dropper dispenser. I clean and tone my face as part of my regular routine, before applying the serum. The serum is light and glides over skin easily. The light floral scent is pleasant but is not perfumed enough to irritate my sensitive skin, which is important to me. The serum takes a min to fully sink into my skin. renewC leaves my skin dewy immediately after use, though I still apply my daily moisturizer which contains an SPF, important to use if going outside after renewC use. Paraben free, made in the USA and chocked full of beneficial ingredients for plump, even, glowing kin! *Discount given for unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is, by far, my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to skimp on my skincare, this would be the last to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start by rubbing it under my eyes, then use any excess on the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps with fine lines, but the reason I love it is how much it has helped the dark circles under my eyes (that I&#x27;ve had since I was a teen.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying it has eliminated them completely in the few months that I have used it, but they are definitely better. I have tried many creams over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, and it makes me so much more confident in my own skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this and how it makes my skin feel and I would buy it again. great price and wonderful product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have only been using this serum for over a week but I have already noticed a difference. First of all I love how nice the bottle this serum comes in is and the pump is very hygienic unlike other serums that only come with droppers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is lightweight, clear and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell I apply it at night before I go to bed it&#x27;s fast absorbing and it&#x27;s not oily at all it makes my skin feel smooth and soft. I have old acne scars, large pores and uneven skin tone the serum has definitely been helping me with all of this problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t make my skin look or feel more oily or dry and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin I would recommend trying this serum.</li>
    <li> This serum is not to heavy or oily.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and I love how it makes my skin feel, it feels nice and smooth. If your looking for a good serum that does exactly what it says it does give it a try</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C Serums for awhile. I feel they make my skin look youthful and moisturize well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This renewC Serum from Nora B is one of my favorites. It offers the 20-percent Vitamin C my dermatologist suggested. The bottle is a modern and lovely pump applicator. The consistency is very thin, as Vitamin C should be. It is clear. It has a very faint citrus smell. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review. I appreciate that in addition to the 20-percent Vitamin C  Nora B&#x27;s Renew C also includes Ascorbic Acid (L), Aloe Vera and Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this serum twice a day...once in the morning after cleansing my face and once in the evening after cleansing my face. It takes very little--2-3 drops is all I need to do my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great serum and one of my favorite beauty secrets.</li>
    <li> The serum was delivered in sealed, protective packaging and as described on product page.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased the renewC serum in a promotion for testing and review.  The serum is&lt;br /&gt;lightweight and quickly absorbs into skin, without leaving a &#x27;film&#x27;.  We have just started&lt;br /&gt;using the serum, so cannot comment on long term effects.  We like that the serum is&lt;br /&gt;made in the USA.</li>
    <li> My skin is acne-prone yet also dry, and this is one of the first serums I have tried that I have actually liked, rather than just was okay with. After a few uses, my skin began to look dewy and healthy, but it did not break me out (and even seemed to lighten some scarring and stuff), so I will most likely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if you can really call this a serum because it&#x27;s pretty watery ... most of the vitamin C serums I have purchased are quite watery though. I use it on my face. When I first apply it, it goes on super sticky. It takes a few minutes to dry but after it does it leaves my face feeling so refreshed and smooth. It smells great too! I would recommend this product, but I would suggest they relabel it as it is does not have the texture of a serum.</li>
    <li> Hi I am Trying this product for my review. So far I like the way it makes my skin feel very soft. I will continue to use  trying this product for my review. So far I like the way it makes my skin feel very soft. I will continue to use  and update my review I&#x27;ve only been using for two weeks but I do like the results so far.</li>
    <li> This was a lovely vitamin C serum. I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for almost two weeks now. Vitamin C serums take awhile to show their effects, so I cannot comment on the long term effects of this particular serum, however, having used several similar serums in the past, I feel like this is probably the most reasonably priced, best packaged serum I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t care for serums that come with an eye dropper application because those tend to oxidize quickly, which is a waste of money and product. I love the pump and the air-tight quality of the bottle and I&#x27;ve had no discoloration in the serum yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s pH is fairly low - according to the seller, it&#x27;s around 1.5 (I do not have strips left to confirm this). Most of the serums I&#x27;ve tried sit around 2.0-2.5 (you do want them lower than your face&#x27;s natural pH, which is about 3.5 otherwise they just sit on top of your skin), so I was originally concerned that it&#x27;d be too acidic. I assume it&#x27;s so low in order to keep the product from oxidizing quickly. However, I had zero issues with the acidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO off-putting smell to this serum, which such a huge plus. I cannot express how thrilled I am about this. Some vitamin C serums smell weird out of the bottle that are such a turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to add that when I sent the question to the seller, it was answered within hours, which I appreciate - thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to make note that this serum did leave my skin a little bit sticky/dewy to the touch, but thankfully, I did not look greasy or oily. I&#x27;ve had serums that made my skin very sticky and I looked terribly icky within an hour of so of application, but I was surprised that this one didn&#x27;t make me look as sticky as it felt (it&#x27;s not a goopy sticky, just a little tacky to the touch - if you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t touch their face a lot, you most likely will never notice this). My mom said my skin looked glowing when I saw her last weekend, so that must be the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; effect this has. Many people mention they use two pumps, but I found that I really need one pump for my face, half for my neck. Overall, this is probably my favorite serum that I&#x27;ve used to date and I will most likely purchase again at regular price.

    <li> I usually buy a lot of skin treatment products to give myself a nice glow. But I have to be picky since I have sensitive skin. Luckily, renewC has been working perfectly for me for the past few weeks. The serum itself contains none of those harmful chemicals and even has a nice fragrance too. It doesn&#x27;t smell to strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is easy, just pump it twice, rub it in your hands, and apply to your face. The serum itself did not feel overly viscous or sticky, which is a big plus. My face was able to absorb it quickly and I could put moisturizer soon afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an wonderful serum and I do play to purchase more in the future for relatives. I would also like to thank the manufacturers for generously providing me with a discounted sample to review. All experiences with this product are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> First I must disclose that I have been provided this product to test with the understanding that I will write a product review that is accurate and completely honest.&lt;br /&gt;I have gone most my life doing little if anything for my skin. Skincare is a very new thing for me, but one that I am reaping amazing results in a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my face in the morning first thing after a shower, followed by a light moisturizer - and what a difference for my face. For a couple of years I’ve had a one small area in the center of my forehead that was oddly “hard” and unlike the rest of my skin. After using this for 3 weeks along with a light moisturizer during the day, that hard area is gone gone gone. My face feels so amazing and I look more “alive” and less tired. The sensation is so impressive that I know that I am doing something really good for my face. I am excited to see what 3 months or six months has in store for me using this. Gratefully it is affordable enough that I can continue on and find out.</li>
    <li> The serum feels good. Doesn&#x27;t have a scent (what I prefer) Feels powerful 😀 will have to review later for results. Good product!</li>
    <li> Great quality product!! Goes on light and has really improved the overall appearance of my skin, will definitely keep in my skin care routine!</li>
