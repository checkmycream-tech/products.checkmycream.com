      <li>You won&#x27;t find a more comfortable shave at a better value anywhere.</li>
      <li>Good soap, actually a &amp;#34;croap&amp;#34;.  Easy to lather and has a good finish.</li>
      <li>The scent is moderately strong in the tub, but mellows when lathered which is fine with me.  </li>
      <li>This soap has a good consistency which provides just enough resistance/lubrication for a nice smooth shave.</li>
      <li>okay product, seemed to get used up quickly because it&#x27;s a cream.</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel smooth and</li>
      <li>Great glide for my double edge razors.  </li>
      <li>The lather is the important thing for me.</li>
      <li>The slickness of the lather helps the blade glide effortlessly for a smooth comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>This shaving soap lubricates for a close and comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>gives me a far superior shave.</li>
      <li>The scent is a rich and sweet almond smell which is like eating a cake for breakfast.</li>
      <li>This product creates an excellent lather that is very slick and protective.  </li>
      <li>If you enjoy a good wet shave this product will enhance your shaving experience.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild and pleasing.  </li>
      <li>Razorock makes a good, soft lather without a lot of effort and has a masculine smell that is not too strong or lingering.</li>
      <li>Easy Lather, easy cover with a nice fine badger brush &amp; my Colossus Razor.&lt;br /&gt;Its been only about 5 shaves and get a little redness.</li>
      <li>Got to love Italian shaving cream.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much effort to produce a lot of lather with this stuff!</li>
      <li>The cocunut scent really comes through!  </li>
      <li>When you first smell this soap you think...</li>
      <li>The almond scent is really nice and doesn&#x27;t clash with any other fragrances you might wear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few soaps and creams and this is hands down the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>My razor slipped over it really well.  </li>
      <li>Only a little bit on my badger brush lathers up very nicely.</li>
      <li>I found that it works best if lathered a little wet or the razor is likely to stick on areas that have already had a pass.</li>
      <li>The scent is the classic almond/marzipan.</li>
      <li>And that quality is glide  or how smoothly and without drag or irritation it allows your razor to do its thing.</li>
      <li>if it&#x27;s better than the green Proraso which I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
      <li>I have been comparing this with a new rising star in my entourage,i.e. Mitchells Wool Fat Soap.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong so it might not be pleasing to everyone, but it does not last long after the shave.</li>
      <li>It really makes every day shaving easier  because you don&#x27;t have to mess around with it to work quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite because it&#x27;s easy to lather, and it makes a fluffy, thick, slippery foam.</li>
      <li>The real test is how it deals with my Feather bladé..is it slippery enough, and will it hold it&#x27;s moisture?</li>
      <li>shaving cream will be Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
      <li>this Razo is not all natural, as per the lable?</li>
      <li>but I did not love the classic scent , it&#x27;s not bad .</li>
      <li>but I think by the reviews this will help my major razor burn .&lt;br</li>
      <li>Notwithstanding all the other rave reviews I have tried this puppy for over a week against another hard soap right side versus left, then left versus right.</li>
      <li>This soap/creme lathers quickly and is very slick.</li>

<li> Razorock are quality products at a price that is hard to beat.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
<li> The price, absurd!</li>
<li> bad</li>
<li> Give this soap a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lasted only a few weeks, and didn&#x27;t foam up very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Now it could be that the pre-shave oil used didn&#x27;t mix well? I can&#x27;t see that being the case but...</li>
    <li> Good soap, actually a &amp;#34;croap&amp;#34;.  Easy to lather and has a good finish.</li>
    <li> Some of the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve used. Their aftershave balm is some the best too. Real rich and soothing after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this combo of shave cream soap! Lathers up quite well and I forgo the pre shave oil when using it.</li>
    <li> Notwithstanding all the other rave reviews I have tried this puppy for over a week against another hard soap right side versus left, then left versus right. It lathers well and smells OK but it misses out on the critical quality. And that quality is glide  or how smoothly and without drag or irritation it allows your razor to do its thing. I have been comparing this with a new rising star in my entourage,i.e. Mitchells Wool Fat Soap. Having tried about 40 shaving products, from expensive to cheap I rate them on all the factors that I rate shaving products by. MWFS used to be in the next to highest category but as a result of cheek to cheek comparison with RazoRock it is up for re-evaluation for possible upgrade to highest rating. RazoRock is very average in glide, lubrication and comfort, closeness, irritability and how the skin feels afterward. Will probably not be using it again</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Son for Christmas, and he loves it.  He would purchase it again to use the product.</li>
    <li> Seems good, smell is OK..don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s better than the green Proraso which I&#x27;ve been using. The real test is how it deals with my Feather bladé..is it slippery enough, and will it hold it&#x27;s moisture?</li>
    <li> Produces a very good lather that protects well . Lathers quickly and has good slickness for the razor to travel over. May deserve 4.5 stars but I did not love the classic scent , it&#x27;s not bad . I just have others I like more . I will probably try RazoRock again , just another scent .</li>
    <li> razorock classic shaving cream is excellent. Great lather for a close, comfortable shave without irritation. this cream is in my regular rotation. a great value!!</li>
    <li> This will basically echo my review of the Fresco yesterday. This soap builds huge mounds of thick, slick lather. The scent is the classic almond/marzipan. Very nice. The slickness of the lather helps the blade glide effortlessly for a smooth comfortable shave. Give this soap a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Razorock are quality products at a price that is hard to beat. And the seller Bellezz is top-notch.</li>
    <li> Razorock makes a good, soft lather without a lot of effort and has a masculine smell that is not too strong or lingering. A little goes a long ways too; a tub lasts me several months.</li>
    <li> Easy Lather, easy cover with a nice fine badger brush &amp; my Colossus Razor.&lt;br /&gt;Its been only about 5 shaves and get a little redness. I need to let the razor do the work!&lt;br /&gt;Next shaving cream will be Taylor of Old Bond Street. Cost more but I think by the reviews this will help my major razor burn .&lt;br /&gt;To bad this Razo is not all natural, as per the lable?</li>
    <li> great lather, great sent, great shave.</li>
    <li> I had previously only used Proraso shaving soap which has served me well - less razor burn and a close shave. I love this soap even more. The scent is a rich and sweet almond smell which is like eating a cake for breakfast. The scent is strong so it might not be pleasing to everyone, but it does not last long after the shave. The lather is very rich. It definitely out performs my previous Proraso soap on both lather and smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few soaps and creams and this is hands down the best I&#x27;ve tried.  The scent is mild and pleasing.  It does not take a lot of work to produce a nice lather.  Worked well with a badger, a boar and a synthetic brush.  This has become my go to shave soap.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Classic scent at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m starting to work myself away from soap pucks and into stuff like this. Only a little bit on my badger brush lathers up very nicely. This soap has a good consistency which provides just enough resistance/lubrication for a nice smooth shave. The smell is very enjoyable as well. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I have trouble getting this on other shaving sites because they&#x27;re always out of it. It&#x27;s my favorite because it&#x27;s easy to lather, and it makes a fluffy, thick, slippery foam. It really makes every day shaving easier  because you don&#x27;t have to mess around with it to work quickly. The almond scent is really nice and doesn&#x27;t clash with any other fragrances you might wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m continually blown away by how good the Razorock products are. This provides an unbelievable lather and super slick shave.  The scent, unreal. The price, absurd! You won&#x27;t find a more comfortable shave at a better value anywhere.</li>
    <li> okay product, seemed to get used up quickly because it&#x27;s a cream. good shaves.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have some other proraso creams I like but, this stuff is the best and if lathered correctly makes a ton of slippery lather and gives a great shave. The smell is great for winter time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much effort to produce a lot of lather with this stuff! I found that it works best if lathered a little wet or the razor is likely to stick on areas that have already had a pass.</li>
    <li> I purchased this elsewhere, but I was planning on buying through amazon.  This product creates an excellent lather that is very slick and protective.  With a dense badger it happened within 15 seconds!  I had enough lather for 4 passes if I needed it.  The scent is moderately strong in the tub, but mellows when lathered which is fine with me.  If you like strong scents that last and last this may be a disappointment.  The lather is the important thing for me.</li>
    <li> Smells like almond cookies.  Very easy to lather.  Great glide for my double edge razors.  Makes my face feel smooth and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.  Got to love Italian shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving soap that I have ever used. I will purchase this product again. This shaving soap lubricates for a close and comfortable shave. I had been adding essential oil to my shaving soap and Razorock&#x27;s Shaving Cream Soap gives me a far superior shave. I do not hesitate to recommend Razorock&#x27;s shaving cream soap. If you enjoy a good wet shave this product will enhance your shaving experience.</li>
    <li> This soap/creme lathers quickly and is very slick. The smell is the strongest point of this product. It is the best smelling shave creme I own.</li>
    <li> I had to get use to the way the lotion style works with a brush differently than dry pyck but I am glad I teied. Great product. Mt favorite shave yet.</li>
    <li> Great lather very quickly.  I&#x27;ll be back for this soap. It performed above my expectations. After trying several soaps I think I have found one I could stick with for the long haul.</li>
    <li> When you first smell this soap you think... Man.  If I had some rum we could be having a party.  The cocunut scent really comes through!  The lather worked well with a stiffer brush.  My razor slipped over it really well.  I love having this in my rotation.</li>
