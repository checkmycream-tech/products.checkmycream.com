      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>but this one smells pretty awesome!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Way better!</li>
      <li>No chalky residue, no stiffness, just great full hair that smells awesome and fresh.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
      <li>This is effective.</li>
      <li>It smelled nice and worked well</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t shake, shake, shake (and then shake some more, for good measure)</li>
      <li>It smells nice, works well</li>
      <li>and my husband had no complains he liked the way my hair smelled.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a detectable residue, it&#x27;s easy to use, it has a mild, pleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger, it does what it says it will do, and my hair looks and feels great all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved this product for a week or so, great price, absorbed oil like magic</li>
      <li>I love this stuff; it smells reasonably good for something that comes out of an aerosol can, and it really works beautifully.    </li>
      <li>This works well, although I don&#x27;t know if it works any better than my Pssssst!, although the spray seems better on this one.  </li>
      <li>This one is by far the best one.</li>
      <li>I could see this being awesome for the women in the over 65 age set, or those with completely whitish gray hair already.</li>
      <li>While I was initially pleased with how effectively Got2b Rockin&#x27;</li>
      <li>A great fresh scent &amp; it will work well on lighter colored hair.</li>
      <li>It blows out a very fine, powdery substance that you work into your roots with your fingers.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it leaves your hair naturally soft and very clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with the Suave Keratin brand, but I like this so much more.  </li>
      <li>The scent lingered prominently all day (as did the headache), until I had a chance to wash it out.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>ok so i just bought this from walmart for 3 bucks</li>
      <li>Some of the &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; sprays make hair more greasy</li>
      <li>Also, this made my hair look MORE greasy.</li>
      <li>It meets all my expectations and more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for something better than Marc Anthony&#x27;s product, but I will never purchace this product again.</li>
      <li>and I just love how this one is.</li>
      <li>It would be perfect if I were blonde.</li>
      <li>Great if you&#x27;re into that dandruff-y look... otherwise, not so much.</li>
      <li>Thank you! :)</li>
      <li>Ta-da! :)</li>
      <li>brand instead, which works better for sure.</li>
      <li>even though you hit that snooze button one (or four) too many times.  </li>
      <li>It smells fantabulous!! &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>For years I used Klorane because it was simply the best product I could find.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and will keep it on hand at all times.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Then it&#x27;s like all the product magically disappears..</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I use to wash my hair a minimum of 3 times or more each week.  </li>
      <li>Okay, so this stuff really does work great</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better than klorane (it may be),</li>
      <li>but I just wish I could get more uses out of it.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get a lot more uses and it will give you some volume too.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff! The best I have used, and by far the least expensive. Really good deal.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for the product</li>
    <li> my favorite dry shampoo. the only one that works for the oiliest hair (mine lol) and yet doesnt leave toooo much residue..the bf approves (he hates my stiff hair caused by other dry shampoos) also it smells like fruit loops</li>
    <li> I really love got2b&#x27;s dry shampoo. It smells really great and actually works! All you have to do is spray small areas, rub it in with your fingers and then brush out. It will come out white, but once you brush it out it will become clear.</li>
    <li> So they say it&#x27;s better for your hair to skip washing it at least every other day. Well, I&#x27;ve tried that, and I just cannot get past the oily scalp feeling or the &#x27;dirty hair&#x27; smell that accompanies it. I bought this at Walgreen&#x27;s for around $4-5 and thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl.   This morning I wore a shower cap in the shower (sexy, right?) and after, made sure all the little pieces that stick out dried completely before using this spray. You have to shake the can well and hold it 8\\&quot; from your head while spraying short bursts here &#x27;n there on your locks. It blows out a very fine, powdery substance that you work into your roots with your fingers. After, you thoroughly brush it in and style as usual. It doesn&#x27;t take much spray. I have shoulder-length hair and just hit the top a few times and then lifted a layer to spray underneath a bit.  Well, I accomplished that over four hours ago, and my hair feels fresh as if I&#x27;d washed it. If I put my fingers on the back of my head and rub where it&#x27;s usually greasy, there&#x27;s nothing. Not even a chalky feeling like some dry shampoos give you. Also, there is no strange, &#x27;unclean&#x27; smell. My style is holding well, too.  The only downfall I see to this is, if you are wearing clothes while you spray, you might put a powdery film on them. And if you aren&#x27;t wearing any clothes yet, your skin will get the powder on it. It&#x27;s not a big thing, as you just brush it off of your skin, but I&#x27;m not sure what it would do to clothes, so that&#x27;s just something to think about.  I suspect I will continue to feel fresh the rest of the day, but if for some reason by 4 o&#x27; clock I look like I just combed my hair with the lint trap from my dryer or something, I will be sure to come back and update.</li>
    <li> I love using dry shampoo.  I use to wash my hair a minimum of 3 times or more each week.  When I use a dry shampoo, I can wash once or twice a week.  That&#x27;s amazing.  It really makes my hair behave and it actually looks better than if I just washed it.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is great!  Wish I could find a bigger can! And ive tested all kinds of dry shampoos and alot of them have weird smells but this one smells pretty awesome!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell very much… but works very well… I just think the smell is too strong and I can&#x27;t wear perfume when I use this product.</li>
    <li> Got to use the bottle once! Then nothing came out. Bad bottle</li>
    <li> i bought the dry shampoo a little while ago, but i really like it! it has a great smell, really makes your hair look like it just has been washed and the white powder that gets on your hair after you spray it goes away after just a few strokes on the hair! really good product!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and the company I purchased this through. I ordered my first bottle and it was defective. So I contacted the seller the day I found out and I had a response within minutes. They credited my account and sent me a replacement bottle free of charge. They also sent me an email giving me 20% off my next purchase with them. AND, I just used the dry shampoo this morning and it worked great! Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> While it works as a dry shampoo, I used it about 4 times, and then it was done.  So there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job giving volume to hair that hasn&#x27;t been washed in a couple days! The only thing is that it gets all over everything like hairspray so any bathroom fixtures tend to have a thin filmy coating, but the product itself works!</li>
    <li> This is the first dry shampoo I have used. It works if I use a lot of it. I have very, very thick hair and it&#x27;s hair to work into the roots without spraying everywhere.  Also, I have white blonde hair. This product leaves a white residue on hair. If I didn&#x27;t have my color hair, I think this review would be much lower. I couldn&#x27;t imagine being a brunette and using it!</li>
    <li> Got2b Rockin&#x27; Dry Shampoo is so helpful on days when you do not have time to wash your hair, but want/need to have a nice fresh look. The smell of the product, when you first apply it/spray it in your hair, is a little strong, but changes quickly to a very pleasant citrus flavor. I told my gym about it (where I work as a fitness instroctor) and they have put some in the ladies locker room!!! Highly recommend it. No need to spend tons of money for a more expensive brand when this works great!</li>
    <li> This is getting 4 stars as it works but it&#x27;s not my favorite.  I have dark brown long hair that starts to get greasy by the end of the day.  The first thing I noticed with this was the smell- it smells exactly like fruit loops, which might sound like a cool thing, except that it is strong and it lingers around for a while.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with this turning my dark hair grey- once or twice I had a white patch but they were easily massaged out.  Sometimes this did like to leave white dandruff-like flakes in my hair that I haven&#x27;t had before with any other dry shampoos.  Besides that, it did give my hair a second day of wear (I had to spray twice in one day sometimes, however), but my favorite dry shampoo is still Baptiste&#x27;s, which I would highly suggest. Overall, I won&#x27;t be getting this again unless I am in another situation where I can&#x27;t get ahold of Baptiste&#x27;s dry shampoo, but it is still the second best out of all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Does what it&#x27;s supposed to&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t turn hair grey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Chemical fruit loop smell&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally left white flakes in hair&lt;br /&gt;Had to use twice sometimes</li>
    <li> I love Got2b products, and this is no different. I&#x27;ve tried a couple other dry shampoos, but Got2b&#x27;s dry shampoo has been my favorite. I would spray some on my brush and run it through my hair. It always seemed to add a little more life (with less grease). Plus, I like the smell!  The only downside is that I only used it around 10 times, and the bottle is already empty! I went to use it this morning, and there&#x27;s like nothing left! I used it a couple days ago, and the bottle seemed to be almost full. I&#x27;m confused as to how to emptied so quickly! This product is almost $5 (not a terrible price), but for only around 10 uses, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it. I do like it though, but I just wish I could get more uses out of it.</li>
    <li> After ordering this on Amazon.com, I got it around 5 days later. It smells nice, works well but the bottle is very small. I am not sure how long it will last, overall I give it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I know what the manufacturer&#x27;s goal was in making this product, but the result falls far short of anything close to that. First off, if you&#x27;ve ever tried any of the higher-end products similar to this (Rockaholic, Big Sexy, etc.), don&#x27;t expect the same kind of performance for half the cost- not happening. I ordered two cans of this stuff hoping to share with a friend. However, after trying it the first time with less-than-amazing results, I came home roughly eight (8) hours later to find that the bottle had slowly leaked its entire contents throughout the day. Through no fault of my own, the aerosol button had gotten jammed and despite repeated attempts to \\&quot;un-stick\\&quot; it, I gave up only to find a completely empty can after only 3-4 sprays. The actual performance of this product is also pitiful when compared to other brands (particularly those listed above). My hair felt slightly less greasy for all of about three minutes and then lapsed back into that heavy, dirty feel. Basically: pointless. This product also coats all surrounding surfaces with a coat of not-so-fine powder. Great if you&#x27;re into that dandruff-y look... otherwise, not so much. Needless to say, will NOT be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon- good packaging, but pitiful product. Better luck next time.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY different types of dry shampoo in the past. I&#x27;m always looking for the one perfect drugstore brand that works as well as the expensive salon brands. Well this is NOT it!!! The product goes on white (as it should), and should be able to massage in &amp; brush out. It takes a LOT of work to get the white residue out. I&#x27;d say on a 1 to 10 scale of effectiveness, I&#x27;d give it a 4. And the SMELL - OMG I swear it smells EXACTLY like lemon Pledge furniture polish. NOT GOOD!!!</li>
    <li> This works GREAT and smells awesome for the first use or two. Then it&#x27;s like all the product magically disappears.. You can hear it in the can but the powdery substance no longer sprays out. Why make the bottle so large for 1-2 uses? Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo.  You do not need very much at all, just pull up sections of your hair spritz onto the roots.  Work it through the hair and brush it through - that&#x27;s it.  No chalky residue, no stiffness, just great full hair that smells awesome and fresh.  It&#x27;s a great product.  Wish I could give it ten stars.</li>
    <li> This was the first dry shampoo I tried and it did the job well. I had no idea how much better it was until I went to the local Target to get some more. I must have spent 20 minutes in that aisle reading all the labels and deciding. All of the brands there had the same main ingredient, which is some form of aluminum. The aluminum-based dry shampoo makes my hair feel brittle and coarse, and I believe is reacting with the color in my hair, making it more brassy. I haven&#x27;t researched this at all, but in the back of my mind I worry about what it does to breathe in the aluminum particles from the aerosol. It just can&#x27;t be good. The rice starch in this absorbs the oil better and makes my hair feel natural. I actually could go longer without shampooing with this brand. I am definitely buying this again!</li>
    <li> I seriously hate this stuff. It&#x27;s very thick, comes out in a blast, and smells terrible. I bought this with the hopes of a good dry hairspray for when I don&#x27;t have time to shower in the morning. I used it, and soon enough (after I brushed my hair), my hair was covered in a sheen of white dust. Disgusting! I guess this is what I get for purchasing a cheap dry shampoo. I&#x27;m very happy to say that I got a new dry shampoo, which is called Umberto Dry Clean Shampoo (sold at Target for around $8). It works! Anyone else who wants to buy Got2B, THINK TWICE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few dry shampoos before: this, TRESemme, Oscar Blandi, and Psssst!. This has GOT TO BE by far the WORST I&#x27;ve ever used. As a few reviewers have already mentioned, it does leave a film of powder.  I wear glasses and use it in the morning; when I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m always left with a layer of white powder on my lenses. And the thing is, the powder is thick and grainy, so I absolutely HAVE to clean it off or else I can&#x27;t see properly.  Another thing: the scent. I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s all that bad, but let me tell you this--when I spray it, both my sister and my mother immediately leave the bathroom. Take what you want from that comment, but it&#x27;s true.  I will most definitely stay away from this.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but the problem is I used my dry shampoo literally once and the next time I went to use it the bottle was completely empty.  I had bought two bottles (the price was really good) and I used the next bottle only once.  Once again, completely empty the second time.  I know around 5 dollars is cheap but not for a single use product.  I&#x27;m calling the company and trying to get my 10 dollars back.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> First, this stuff smells fantastic. It also does a great job of making your hair look non-greasy or sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the white powder is very noticeable, even after thoroughly brushing. My hair is half dark brown and half silver--not salt and pepper style, but big chunks of each color--and the shampoo considerably lightens the brown parts. I bought this product to use at work after my bike commute (which makes my hair sweaty) but the powdery residue gets all over my work clothes and the shampoo changes the color of the brown parts of my hair, so I&#x27;m now using it before bed. Even so, it considerably reduces both of my hair colors&#x27; shininess--but my hair does not look sweaty the next morning. I guess it is a pick-your-poison situation.</li>
    <li> Great price. Works well. Don&#x27;t spray too much, or you&#x27;ll get the white streaks throughout your hair. If you spray the right amount, it is easy to blend into your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year and I love it. The smell is fresh and the product gives my roots a nice lift. I have very thick, naturally wavy light blonde hair which I straighten and shampoo every other day. If you use the product according to the directions-massage into roots, sit, then brush, you will have great results. No powdery coating, etc. I have tried expensive products with less results and only 2-3 uses for the entire bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product. Used once, a few short spurts.  Went to use a few days later and nothing left.  You can hear the product swishing around when you shake the can, but no spray.  Oh well, should have listened to the other reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought this the other day, at the drug store and. It did the job, but after a few hours my hair way oily again and needed another spray. It had a really strong smell like a citronella candle, or pledge polish the lemon scented one. IF it kept mosquitos away i would consider using it again in the summer months, but as for now I think I&#x27;m going to keep searching for another dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the fructise dry shampoo and that smelled ok to me, and my husband had no complains he liked the way my hair smelled. I only had to spray my hair one good time to get the oiliness out of my hair, it lasted all day and didn&#x27;t have to re-apply. It does leave white in your hair though. I wouldn&#x27;t use for really dark hair. I have a medium to light brown hair it&#x27;s ok for me. Still looking for that one special dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> totally just bought this dry shampoo. It is perfect for the child who refuses to wash her hair daily, and has the greasy scalp of a 12 year old. I highly recommend this product, we just tried it (Sunday Evening) and her hair looks as soft and clean as it did when she showered Friday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about dry shampoos--but many complaints--so I was a little nervous to try it.  This dry shampoo ROCKS!  It works great, it smells nice and you totally have a head of hair that looks great and had nice body.  I will certainly have this on hand from now on.  I&#x27;m not a big \\&quot;product\\&quot; person, but this is now an essential.  The only warning/downside is when you use it, it leaves a powdering everywhere like you haven&#x27;t dusted in a month, but totally worth the results!</li>
    <li> I have been using dry shampoo for about a year now and have tried various products.  I love the schwarzkopf products so decided to try this one out.  It worked very well and smelled great, only the next time I went to use the product it was completely empty!  I decided to go back to the store and purchase another bottle and the exact same thing happened again.  I am going to write to the schwarzkopf directly to let them know as I think the bottles are defective.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an upgrade for my usual Pssssst! dry shampoo.  This works well, although I don&#x27;t know if it works any better than my Pssssst!, although the spray seems better on this one.  I have fine straight color processed hair that is oily but dry at the last few inches.  I normally would wash my hair every day which dries out the bottom portion even more.  With a dry shampoo I can go every other day to shampoo which is much healthier for my hair.</li>
    <li> It works like it says!  I&#x27;ve used it with a ton of product in my hair and it gets rid of it all! Love it!</li>
    <li> Spray comes out white (which for dark haired ladies like myself is unnerving), but you let it dry and brush it out and poof clean hair! Its that simple!! The trick is to not spray too close to the scalp and to let dry completely to avoid white chunks in the hair. It makes my hair feel cleaner, removes the greasy look of 2 or 3 day old hair, and makes my hair smell better. I get 2 good days out of my wash, sometimes 3 days.  Fantastic product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of dry shampoos...this stuff actually works...I have very oily hair but try to only wash it every other day because I have to heat style it, this is the first one I have used that actually works...LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! If you have sensitive or acne prone skin proceed with caution. I have natural strawberry blonde hair with bangs that get oily half way through the day, consequently I often use a dry shampoo to refresh my fringe. While I was initially pleased with how effectively Got2b Rockin&#x27; It Dry Shampoo degreased my &#x27;do&#x27; within a week I broke out in the most horrific forehead acne. Yuck!!!! A previous reviewer compared the product scent to furniture polish which is absolutely accurate. The cloying artificial citrus scent and underlying chemical odor is pungent and repugnant. It is entirely possible that it was the product fragrance irritating my skin as I&#x27;ve tried almost every dry shampoo on the market and this is the only one that has ever caused this-- I specifically avoided getting the spray directly on my face. The acne resulted just from my bangs contacting my forehead after Got2b Rockin&#x27; It was applied and the excess powder brushed out per product instructions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every dry shampoo product I could find anywhere, and I like Got2b the best.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a detectable residue, it&#x27;s easy to use, it has a mild, pleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger, it does what it says it will do, and my hair looks and feels great all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first dry shampo, found it on rollback at walmart, and let me share this with you... It&#x27;s the best!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smells awesome.. Some people said froot loops... It&#x27;s something like that, also it&#x27;s not strong when you breathe like HERBAL ESSENCES DRY SHAMPOO THE ONE WITH THE EUCALIPTUS.... Bought that one at my local walgreens because they didn&#x27;t Cary GOT2b.. Oh how I regret it...... Gonna throw that one away! ( left white residue and felt weird on my scalp, RED FLAG on first use.. STAY AWAY!!!)&lt;br /&gt;And placed an order for GOT2b as we speaking....&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this just shake it spray it and grease goes away instantly!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna stock up on these guys....&lt;br /&gt;No powdery weird stuff on your hair and makes it look freshly styled...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wanna try another brand.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to use this product because I had been using. BLOW for about a year now and just wanted to try something that was not a powder. I got this product, sprayed maybe 3 sprays. It smelled nice and worked well but after about 5 sprays it was completely empty. It was a shame. I will never purchase this again! I have had my small white bottle of BLOW for a year now. One bottle has lasted me a year! Although this product is nice the fact that is doesn&#x27;t last makes it a bad product.</li>
    <li> I bought three dry shampoos to try -- Sexy Hair Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing and Texturizing Powder, John Frieda Luxurious Volume Anytime Volume Refresher, and this product (Got2b Rockin&#x27; It Dry Shampoo).  I LOVED this product!!  A larger container than the John Freida (also very nice), and I really like its fresh almost-citrus scent.  My hair looks great after using it -- just ordered 3 more cans!!  (The the big sexy hair powder product you should avoid at all costs -- disgusting.)</li>
    <li> I got this product from a local drug store.  It is alright, but I would not buy it again.  The spray on the can is messed up and I have only used it twice.  After I finish spraying it, stuff still comes out.  I also did not really like the scent of this product.  It smells like baby powder, but worse.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product when I first found it. It isn&#x27;t visible, and it doesn&#x27;&#x27;t smell bad. Best of all it makes my hair look good and my scalp isn&#x27;t greasy. However two things came up that I&#x27;m concerned about and one of them is that this shampoo is flammable. For women who use hairspray maybe this wouldn&#x27;t bother them, but I don&#x27;t want to worry about that if I get too close to smoke or something that my head is going to go up in flames, you know what I mean? Another is that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t last long. I only got it 2 weeks ago and it&#x27;s gone already. Granted I didn&#x27;t pay much for it but what if I had? That&#x27;s a lot of money in the long run. Bottom line- good product but I will look around to see if I can find something that will last longer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that makes your hair soft, shiny and it looks like you just washed it. I have thin hair and it gives it alot of volume too plus gets rid of any oil onmy scalp. I love this product and will keep it on hand at all times. i have a bottle for home and a bottle for travel. My kids use it and it works on them great. I have always heard it wasnt good to wash your hair everyday and this is good to use in between washes or when your in a hurry. I just take a bath and then spray this in my hair for a just washed look and lots of volume. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different dry shampoos and this one is nothing special.Not terriable but not exceptional either.  I get white flakes on my scalp (I have brown hair) from using this. No different then putting baby powder in my hair except it&#x27;s easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I would get multiple uses out of the bottle like the other got2b dry shampoo I have. I literally used this twice before the bottle went dry!! It was completely empty and I used it sparingly the two applications I got out of it. Not worth what it costs. Poorly designed! If you want a better bottle and more product, try the got2b fat-tastic collagen boosting dry shampoo. You&#x27;ll get a lot more uses and it will give you some volume too.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair &amp; thus used very little product ONCE. I attempted to use it 36 hours later &amp; I couldn&#x27;t even force one tiny spray out. I ensured it wasn&#x27;t clogged &amp; realized for a fact there wasn&#x27;t any product left. What an absolute waste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoos and this is my favorite. Others can feel sticky or not comb all the way through and look gray. I&#x27;ve even used some VERY expensive salon quality ones like Kevin Murphy and this one is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very oily. If I don&#x27;t wash it every day it looks like I combed it with a pork chop. This stuff works wonders!</li>
    <li> I have used every expensive dry shampoo available at Sephora and ran across this one accidentally. Thinking it was cheap and I&#x27;d give it a whirl, I was extremely impressed. I have very fine reddish blonde hair and this stuff boosted the volume, kept my hair really soft, and did not leave any residue. Love it!</li>
    <li> Product did not work and left horrible white residue in my hair even after brushing.  White powder stayed in my hair for a couple of hours and was very visible even though I have very blonde hair.  Plus can quit spraying after 1 use.</li>
    <li> Smells fab and works great !</li>
    <li> So, I only shower 1-2 times a week and my hair gets very oily.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few other dry shampoos and this is the best one so far.&lt;br /&gt;The others I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair/were powdery/didn&#x27;t last more than like 3 applications.&lt;br /&gt;This makes my hair look like it was just washed.&lt;br /&gt;And I got it at Walmart for only $4.50! Blows the expensive stuff out of the water in every way.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would actually find a dry shampoo that I would use and like. It makes my 2nd day fine hair which is usually slightly oily and totally flt against my head full and bouncy again. My favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel icky, dry, or brittle like other dry shampoos have. I do feel some powder left over afterwards on my fingers when i run them through my hair but I am blond and don&#x27;t see any of the powder so I could care less. I am able to no wash my hair every 3rd day which will enable me to grow my hair out longer than I have been able to the last few years. YAY!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dry shampoo!  I just discovered dry shampoo about a month ago and I am obsessed!  Just for the heck of it I wanted to go as long as I could without washing my hair, so I went 5 DAYS without a shampoo and just using this dry shampoo.  It worked great and the only reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was because my head did start to get pretty itchy around day 3.  I have ordered a bunch of different brand like Suave, Dove, Tresume, and TGI brand to see how they compare, but this one will be hard to beat.</li>
    <li> I give it a 3/5.&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Smells like old fashioned lemon wood polish (to me)&lt;br /&gt;Got about four uses out of the whole can&lt;br /&gt;Did not give any volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Did not come out powdery&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t feel tacky or powdery&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t show up on my dark hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would hesitate in buying this again, simply because I got so few uses out of it compared to other dry shampoos that gave me lots of volume.</li>
    <li> Only got ONE USE out of it before it was empty, not clogged, literally empty. It would only spray air the second time I attempted to use it which was only 20 hours after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is absolutely repulsive.</li>
    <li> First, the good.  I got this because the reviews were good enough to convince me it would work and it&#x27;s cheaper than klorane.  It works, really well.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better than klorane (it may be), but it&#x27;s definitely not worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not overly picky and I&#x27;m not sensitive to fragrances.  However, the smell of this, right next to my face is intolerable.  I feel really dirty when I use this, because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to be OK with this, but I&#x27;ll shell out the bucks and go back to klorane.</li>
    <li> I use this when my hair starts to get on the greasy side. I spray, massage it at the roots, than comb through, than style. it gives me a clean refreshing feel without having to go into the shower to get it. I haven&#x27;t tried any other dry shampoos yet but right now I&#x27;m so content on this one I don&#x27;t really want to go and try another!</li>
    <li> Smells like Pledge furniture polish. Super powdery: hard to &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; it into my dark hair color—doing so probably means I&#x27;m just rubbing it out.</li>
    <li> ok so i just bought this from walmart for 3 bucks and i followed the directions exactly and now my black hair is white and gritty....looks gray. i have brushed it for at least 10 minutes and its still gritty. do not buy this dry shampoo. this may be a good product if you have blonde hair but if you have brown or black hair STAY AWAY!</li>
    <li> Not super-effective. Had to pile it on just to get some results. I prefer suave, dove, Aussie, and Vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> Talk about a life saving product! This is my absolute favorite product in my beauty collection. Especially for women who color their hair, this keeps the need to get your hair wet down to a minimum. Because we all know that water is the enemy of hair dye. If you know you won&#x27;t have the time, or don&#x27;t feel like, going through the whole wash and style rigamarole in the morning, just spray this on  your scalp before bedtime and awake to clean, voluminous roots in the morning. Kiss your greasy hair goodbye. No joke. This is a major time saver and a must have for women OR men.</li>
    <li> I use this product for quick relief if i dont have time to wash my hair and it works great, i took off one star only because sometimes the white powder can be a bitch much but you just have to rub it in real good</li>
    <li> Good idea, but the actual function of the product is awful. Dry shampoo actually came out the first two times I used it and was great. Then after that, just freezing cold liquid with white lumps running down my hands when I tried to press the spray nozzle. It would go all over the bathroom and my clothes... and NOT my hair. Definitely not worth the $$. I would recommend the &amp;#34;not your mother&#x27;s&amp;#34; brand instead, which works better for sure. I feel like I got ripped off!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of dry shampoos, from the cheap Tresemme (horrible) to the expensive Bumble and Bumble (decent). This one is by far the best one. While it obviously has an arosol smell, it doesn&#x27;t force me out of the bathroom immediately, unlike some other dry shampoos. Plus, the scent is neutral for both genders. It&#x27;s pleasant, like baby powder.  Best of all, it leaves your hair naturally soft and very clean. You do not feel the product in your hair nor does it make it stiff, which is the biggest problem with most other dry shampoos. (I used to resort to the ponytail, but with this I can wear my hair down and it will still style the way I want.) The strength of the spray is also stronger than most so hits the roots perfectly and evenly. If you&#x27;ve hated other dry shampoos, try this one. I have extremely oily roots and this took care of it very quickly and without having to over use the product. This is what dry shampoo is supposed to be.  The one downside, if you can call it that, is the slightly smaller can. At 4.3 ounces it comes in slightly less than most other brands, like Batiste Dry. But keep in mind this stuff outbeats some very expensive brands, so it&#x27;s still a steal.</li>
    <li> This product left a powdery residue in my hair that I could not brush out (I have fine, dark hair), and the scent was overpowering.  I am not normally so sensitive to perfumes, but within minutes of using this product I had a terrible headache. The scent lingered prominently all day (as did the headache), until I had a chance to wash it out.</li>
    <li> My favorite dry shampoo</li>
    <li> I could see this being awesome for the women in the over 65 age set, or those with completely whitish gray hair already. I brushed, and brushed, and brushed, and it still left me looking like I was doing a Golden Girls Halloween costume. Which, maybe, would be a good reason to keep it. If that&#x27;s not your hope with this product, get something else. I&#x27;m going back to by Not Your Mother&#x27;s dry shampoo. Way better!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo on the market! Always works and it&#x27;s by a well known salon company so it&#x27;s probably a better quality product than some of the other brands. I will admit by the end of the day my hair does feel a little oily but that is how dry shampoo works anyway!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  It gets my hair much cleaner than other brands of dry shampoo do.  It makes my fine, blonde hair look super clean and voluminous, not greasy at all.  If I&#x27;m planning to wear my hair up, I won&#x27;t wash it that day and will just use this spray.  It adds more volume and texture than if I&#x27;d shampooed it fresh that morning.  I&#x27;m sometimes even able to push my hair into a third day without washing, using this spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my 6th or 7th use and there&#x27;s no sign of running out yet (Even if it only did last a few uses, though, I think it would still be worth the money for the time it saves on hair washing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I definitely recommend this product, especially for fine, blonde hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Just like many other reviewers I got one use out of this. On the second use, air wouldn&#x27;t stop spraying out from the nozzle no matter what I did. It emptied itself. Bummer. However, it DID work well.. that one time...</li>
    <li> I usually buy Batiste dry shampoo, but I tried this after the BX stopped carrying it. You get very few uses in this bottle. Very powdery, doesn&#x27;t brush in well. I had to use a lot to hide the oil in my hair, white powder went everywhere. I did like how powerful the stream was, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I have used dry shampoo for years. I prefer Batiste, but they havn&#x27;t really mastered a scent that&#x27;s appealing. So, I decided to buy a can of this. The good news is it smells nice, the bad news is it&#x27;s a horrible dry shampoo. It takes so much more spray to do the same job as just a few spritzes of Batiste or another dry shampoo. Even worse, the residue it leaves is really gritty and evident in your hair. Everytime I touch my scalp, I can feel it like fine sand :/ It was such a waste of money but I&#x27;m not a waster so I just use it when I won&#x27;t be out much.</li>
    <li> The product works. I like the smell, it&#x27;s a little strong in the beginning but it fades after a few minutes. I got it at Walmart for $4. Great price right?&lt;br /&gt;Well here&#x27;s the down fall. I used very little, just enough to do the crown and by the second time I go to use it its empty. It&#x27;s great but not worth the $4 when you only get two uses out of it. I was very disappointed but I&#x27;m going to try got2b fat-tastic collagen boosting dry shampoo this next time as one of the other reviewers suggested it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the shampoo, but received conditioner instead, which I neither use nor like.  Recently found the shampoo at Walgreen&#x27;s so I&#x27;ll be buying it there.</li>
    <li> I have very oily hair, so a quality dry shampoo would be great for me.  I have only tried two brands.  First, I tried 2nd Day: Clear Dry Shampoo by Marc Anthony.  It worked pretty well.  My hair certainly seemed cleaner, had more body, and did not have any powder residue.  The only thing that could make this product better would be if it left my hair with more shine, so I tried Got2b: Rockin&#x27; It Dry Shampoo.  It does make my hair seem cleaner, but it did not add as much body, and my hair looks even more dull.  Worst of all, within 24 hours of use, my scalp itiches terribly and seems to have a coating of the spray covering it.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for something better than Marc Anthony&#x27;s product, but I will never purchace this product again.</li>
    <li> I used this product once and immediately noticed the strong old person type smell. Also, this made my hair look MORE greasy. The only plus was that it gave my hair a little more body, but I had to wear it up because of the greasy look. No flakes or residue. Just a smelly greasy mess.</li>
    <li> This will be awesome for my trip to LA next week, I won&#x27;t need the blow dryer or shampoo, conditioner, etc.....only this and some hair spray will get my hair-do done quickly before the show. It arrived on time and was securely packed...thank you for getting it to me so fast! It smells fantabulous!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I used this the day after washing my hair. I followed directions and began choking over the nauseating smell of talcom powder. The powder got over everything my desk/computer/clothes not to mention in my eyes and mouth. My hair looked slightly less greasy but more coarse on the lengths. My scalp still felt just as unwashed and my hair only felt slightly better. The smell faded off my hair gradually but was replaced with pain in the areas I rubbed it into the scalp. I should have washed it out but didn&#x27;t. After washing it out in the shower the next day my scalp is still very sore. Maybe it has something to do with the ingredient list?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:isobutane, oryza sativa, alcohol denat, butane, propane, parfum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the smell, it makes my hair feel dirty and the TOXIC ingredients irritated my scalp and faded my atomic pink hair dye as much as washing it every day for a week would!</li>
    <li> A great fresh scent &amp; it will work well on lighter colored hair. The only down side is that it runs out very quickly. I would say it is very similar to Batiste dry shampoo spray.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is good, i&#x27;m a brunette and it works fine, but i used it 3 times and it was empty!!! that&#x27;s kind of ridiculous! I&#x27;m letting my hair grow, so i don&#x27;t wanna wash it too much, i didn&#x27;t even apply that much at all, just applied it to my roots because i was wearing a head band, and that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s gone! I will not be buying this again, going to try another dry shampoo that has more product in it.</li>
    <li> This worked great but i only was able to spray a little one day and when i went to use it the following week the can was empty.  This is a scam. I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of dry shampoo before and usually one bottle last me about a month or two, not one use!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great. My hair gets really oily after one day of not washing but i know that its not good for your hair to wash it every day. This dry shampoo lets me go an extra day or two without having to wash my hair. When used as directed, it does what it says and it smells really good. Short bursts 8 inches away from the scalp. It leaves a light white residue but don&#x27;t worry. ( I have black hair)  I leave it on for about a minute. Then I rub it in and brush it out and the white residue is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product a lot and will be ordering it again soon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands, like Ojon and Bumble &amp; Bumble, but this stuff is my favorite.  The nozzle doesn&#x27;t get stuck like Ojon, the smell is pleasant, and it leaves your hair feeling great and looking clean.  I use treatment oils when I style my hair, and this stuff is great for a quick fix if I accidentally use to much.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> Not enough in can. Smells better than others I have tried</li>
    <li> Ive used ALOT of dry shampoos and this one is by far the best one! It works great, really drys out the oils when I have skipped a shower.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t washed my hair in 3 days and still going strong. Smells normal like hairspray with a kick. good for covering up dirty hair stench .</li>
    <li> Works great and shipped fast</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have oily hair so it&#x27;s hard to go a day without washing it but this stuff makes it possible. It does leave a white possible all over your head but if you rub your hair well, it goes away and leaves your hair feeling light and fresh. Plus, this stuff smells AMAZING! Fantastic oil and odor eliminator.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s pretty good. You HAVE to shake it well before use and blend a bit to get rid of the white it leaves (I have black hair). The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried but it did bother me when I used too much of the product.</li>
    <li> Okay, so this stuff really does work great IF you use it correctly.  The key is to vigorously shake the can not just before each use, but IN BETWEEN EACH SPRAY too.  If you don&#x27;t shake, shake, shake (and then shake some more, for good measure) your can might clog up, lose pressure, and then be useless thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, try this:&lt;br /&gt;1. Spray your roots anywhere they look greasy (not just along your part), shaking the can in between each spray.&lt;br /&gt;2. Flip your head upside down and massage the powder into your scalp with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;3. Standing upright again, blast your roots with a blow dryer to spread the powder evenly.&lt;br /&gt;4. Brush your hair from root to tip with a bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And ta-da!  Fresh looking hair even though you hit that snooze button one (or four) too many times.  Works like a dream!</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good product. It dries out the oil well, but hair is a bit stiff due to the dryness after you use it. For thick hair, you need to use a bit more. Thank goodness the scent is not too bad, as opposed to some other brands where you are nauseous smelling your own head all day. I&#x27;m sticking to this one, it&#x27;s effective!</li>
    <li> I am one of those women who has oily hair and thought I needed to wash my hair every morning. That was before I bought this product. I lift my hair, spray the roots-area, then gently rub in with my fingertips, brush, style, and voila, I feel confident enough to walk out the door and start my day. This dry shampoo has a light smell, is easy to use, and I do not see any powdery residue on my scalp/in my hair after brushing and styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True what they say about holding it 8\\&quot; away from your head when you spray--poof comes out strongly and showers your head (and surrounding counter tops) with a light mist (that very easily wipes up). At first I didn&#x27;t use very much--didn&#x27;t want white dust all over me--but it is absorbed quickly and I realized I could use more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a dry shampoo. The price was right (for me, about $6 at a drug store) and as long as things continue to go well, I will definitely purchase again. Good luck!</li>
    <li> It does what dry shampoo is supposed to do and it smells nice without making my hair dull and tangled like some other dry shampoos. If the product didn&#x27;t come out so white I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I just had to for this product. I read some previous reviews where people said they only got one use out of this, and I thought \\&quot;No way that can be true!\\&quot; So I decided to try it. Well, they were right. I have thin, blonde hair and so did not have to use a lot of this product. It worked fairly well. Decided to try it out the next day...too bad there was nothing else in the bottle! Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I had to throw away this product after only one use. It would no longer spray. I tried to rinse it out, if it was somehow clogged, but no luck. The nozzle was just plain broken and wouldn&#x27;t dispense any product. Wasted my money, sadly.</li>
    <li> I came to order another can for a backup since I loved it so much the first time. I looked down the page at recent reviews &amp; saw a few of them saying that after one use it was empty. I thought that was strange and honestly didn&#x27;t believe them so I got up and checked mine. TOTALLY &amp; COMPLETELY EMPTY. I used this ONCE! I truly loved it and was going to give it a great review. It worked wonderfully and although it sprays out pretty strong and it really is only for light hair as it comes out pretty dang white, it was great for my blond hair. I am in shock at the fact that this thing emptied itself and I had no idea until I went to check it. It was stored in a cabinet (not near steam or any weird temp fluctuations). There was no residue anywhere around the can so I don&#x27;t understand where it all went to. What sucks so badly is that I really did like this and was about to order more. Thank goodness I scrolled down the page for some reason. What a JOKE this product is!!!!!!!!!!!!! Would give it zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> For years I used Klorane because it was simply the best product I could find.  But, it ran me $15 - $18/bottle which wasn&#x27;t sustainable.  Thank goodness for Got2be Rockin&#x27; It Dry Shampoo!  It is incredibly reasonably priced and works as well as Klorane without the residue!!  The only catch is that it has a bit stronger smell than Klorane.  It&#x27;s true you only get a few uses, but the time saved in re-washing my hair more than makes up for this.  Keep an eye at other places of purchase (i.e., Walgreen&#x27;s).  They sometimes have 2 for 1 purchase deals and you can stock up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos and this is the worst one I&#x27;ve tried. Even after spraying a ton, I can still see a lot of oil in my hair. Simply doesn&#x27;t work. I also hate the smell.</li>
    <li> I have used other dry shampoos before so I know how to use them. But this one is by far the worst. All it did was make my hair gray. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend giving this dry shampoo a chance.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Aveeno, Dove, Tresemme, Pssst, Batiste and Suave. This takes the cake.&lt;br /&gt;Let me just also note, I have very oily/sensitive/acne prone skin. Which includes my scalp. All of the other dry shampoos I have tried have either broken out my scalp or my face around my hair line. Also, NONE of them have had such a wonderful lasting power against second day \\&quot;grime\\&quot; as this has. Meaning, if I found one that didn&#x27;t effect anything else, the lasting power was absolute crap. I aurally have a dark brown, multi-tonal hair color, but I dye it a dark black blue color so finding a dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t turn me old lady gray has been difficult as well. The other thing I started noticing about dry shampoo&#x27;s is that they all have a starch in them...aluminum, corn or otherwise...and this one has rice starch, which is a little less toxic.This also has wondrous volume that lasts and allows you to style your hair whatever way you want without getting in the way.You can also use it on freshly washed hair for some added volume and style ability / texture.&lt;br /&gt;So as you have probably guess by now...This is my HG dry shampoo. It meets all my expectations and more. The sent is very pleasant, but I know scent is a very personal thing so I really cant say everyone will love it. (I don&#x27;t like really girly fragrances) Anyway, so here is the best way to use this amazing product: Section hair; spray a small amount in a line along the roots of the section; message in with fingertips; let it soak in for 5 minutes; brush and/ or blow our hair. Ta-da! :)</li>
    <li> Purchased this item so that I could get rid of that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look so many people fear, without having to wash my hair daily. Washing your hair strips it of natural oils which can result in the hair drying out and having that &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; look. This product works very well as intended and rivals the effectiveness of products that have a much higher price tag. and would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to give their have a quick freshen up without having to take a shower, or those trying to combat dry, frizzy hair. Great Product, Great Price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have dark, long hair, and this product works very well for my hair. I will admit that it does leave some white residue, because I don&#x27;t have the lightest hand when it comes to spraying it, but it brushes out reasonably well, and it soaks up the oil in my hair super fast. I used to have to wash my hair every day if I wanted to go out in public, but now I just spray this in my hair by sectioning up my hair, then massage it into my scalp, wait a few seconds and brush it out. It gives my hair great volume and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling too gritty. The smell is nice and clean, as well. It would be perfect if I were blonde.</li>
    <li> I can only rate this in relation to the other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. By comparison, this is great. I&#x27;ve tried Tresemme Fresh Start and Dove Refresh. Both sucked. Tresemme didn&#x27;t work at all, in fact I think it made my hair more greasy. Dove worked, but left more residue. This is effective. However; all dry shampoos sort of suck. The whole point of the product is to spray some kind of starch on your scalp to absorb oil. So it&#x27;s all going to leave residue. That&#x27;s what the product is. Traditionally it&#x27;s cornstarch or talc. So you need to keep your expectations in perspective. Some products just have finer starch than others. The thing that I really hate about this product is the smell. It has citronella in it, which might help you repel mosquitoes, but the odor is pretty repellant to me too... reminiscent of floor polish, as other reviewers have said. I would say this is one of the better dry shampoos, but like I said, all dry shampoo is kind of a last resort for me.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of dry shampoos and I use them many times a week.  This product works and smells great! Some of the &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; sprays make hair more greasy I feel like, but this one does not at all. It soaks up any excess oil easily and quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best dry shampoo out there, have tried all the other over the counter ones, and this is the only one that works for longer than a couple hours! I have oily hair and sometimes when i want to go out after work but have no time to rewash my hair again and style, I will use this dry shampoo instead. They also make dry conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;If you use too much on dark hair you can kind of see it, but I have highlights so it blends in and looks shimmery.</li>
    <li> Really good dry shampoo. Works well, though I found it needs to be rubbed in a little more than the other got2b dry shampoo. Still good and can&#x27;t beat the price. Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff; it smells reasonably good for something that comes out of an aerosol can, and it really works beautifully.    I have extremely fine, curly hair that I keep blown out. I don&#x27;t like washing and then blowing it out every day, so i usually do so every two or three instead. But since my hair is so fine, the slightest bit of oiliness that appears after a day or so really weighs it down; enter Got2b dry shampoo. Immediately refreshes my hair into soft, voluminous tresses that actually look and feel better than my just-washed-and-blown-out hair.    I&#x27;m not sure why other reviewers complained about the white residue; you&#x27;re supposed to brush it into your hair enough that the white color dissapates. Powder is what dry shampoo is, basically. But I have blonde hair so maybe it&#x27;s easier for me to brush in than it would be for one with darker hair.    All of this said, I was slightly disappointed in the longevity of the product. Using it every two days, I needed to replace it after about three weeks (so that&#x27;s like, ten uses of the product). And it&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;m using this product on my little undercut; I imagine it&#x27;d run out even faster on someone with long hair. It seems like it should last a bit longer but maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much? I&#x27;m not sure what happens exactly, but the &#x27;active&#x27; ingredient (the white powdery stuff) seems to run out/low before the rest of the ingredients in the product, so the can isn&#x27;t even close to empty when it becomes unusable. That is, when I spray an older bottle into my hair it deposits a product that doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I&#x27;m happy enough with the initial results that I&#x27;m willing to put up with this and keep buying, but I&#x27;m still going to be on the lookout for a product that doesn&#x27;t run out so fast.</li>
    <li> I loved this product for a week or so, great price, absorbed oil like magic but then it disappeared and my scalp broke out like crazy.  I got this huge red bumps all around the nape of my neck that were painful and irritated.  No clue what it was but after I discontinued using the product my scalp was fine again.  If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I tried this dry shampoo.  I was in a bad accident a couple months ago and I&#x27;m not able to wash my hair every day.  I&#x27;ve always LOVED Klorane dry shampoo but it&#x27;s so expensive.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a cheaper alternative.  I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with the Suave Keratin brand, but I like this so much more.  I have blonde hair that typically gets greasy by the end of the day, but with this product my hair looks fresh even on day 3 (gross, I know, but I&#x27;m injured!).  The smell is a little strong when you first spray it, but it dissipates rather quickly.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have tried about six or seven different kinds of dry shampoo and this one is my favorite. It smells good and I love that it&#x27;s not wet when I spray it on my hair. I have had a couple that spray out wet and I just love how this one is. Highly recommend! Plus, GREAT price!</li>
    <li> My hair is fairly dark. I know dry shampoos are supposed to leave white powdery stuff once you spray it, but why is it so STICKY compare to other ones and leaves me with nasty flakes that almost resembles rice and dandruff? I got so frustrated after using this because my hair looked worse than before. So I had to go into the shower and wash my hair which defeats the whole purpose of using the dry shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t give me any volume either. My hair becomes flat so it&#x27;s difficult to play around when it comes to styling. I guess it does suck out the oil from the root a bit. The only pro about this is the smell. Nothing else.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and an oily scalp, so I&#x27;ve tried every dry shampoo on the market. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much money you spend, they ALL seem to run out quicker than you expect and leave a white powdery residue (unless you get the one&#x27;s made specifically for brunettes). I really like this one because not only does it work great, it smells good, it&#x27;s cheap, and it lasts all day long. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t waste your time or money on the expensive brands as you&#x27;re not getting any real value for the extra cost.</li>
