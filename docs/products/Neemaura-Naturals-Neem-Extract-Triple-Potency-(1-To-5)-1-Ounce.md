<li> I used that for few days</li>
<li> Wasted my money on garbage.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working, but it sure tastes horrible.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waist your hard earned dollars on this product by the pills instead.</li>
<li> It seems to soothe  the pain just as well as the expensive meds the doctors prescribe.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed and confused by this.</li>

    <li> I used that for few days and I did not feel anything as it promised, so I just keep it here.,  May be I will get back to that&lt;br /&gt;after a while and see how it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after watching the Dr. Oz show. It has a very interesting taste but I trust that it can aid in anti-inflammation especially when it comes the gums, they suggest a few drops would take care of any inflammations</li>
    <li> I apply it directly to Oral Lichen Planus ulcerations. It seems to soothe  the pain just as well as the expensive meds the doctors prescribe.  Yes, it tastes bitter for a few moments, but the relief is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have done quite a few studies on Neem Leaf Extract. The tree is based in India and has a ton of natural health benefits. This product is among the best I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s triple strength, so be careful if it&#x27;s your first time using it. Neem is great for intestinal health. It will purge your system of toxins, level out blood sugar and boost your immune system. I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> this really does help with hair growth. Found areas on my forehead with hair.</li>
    <li> Neem Leaf is great for so many things.You do some research and you find been around for over 5000 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product internally for a few weeks now and I like the early results.  The taste is potent and it will linger with you but I got used to it and it has actually grown on me a bit.  I&#x27;ve also used it directly on my skin a few times and have been very happy with those results as well.  I usually have dry, irritated skin going into winter and so far I have not had these issues.  Although I think it is too early to give all of the credit to Neem extract, I am willing to keep using the product.</li>
    <li> Should have had this in my house for years!</li>
    <li> This was shipped quickly and arrived exactly as described. My results were as promised and this product is clearly deserving of the excellent reviews. I intend to make this product a staple. Great seller!</li>
    <li> Just great product!!!!  I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
    <li> This is my medicine chest in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I got this to help open my third eye.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working, but it sure tastes horrible.  Yuck!</li>
    <li> seemed to help with detox and skin.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff but beware of the potentcy it might be to strong for some people.</li>
    <li> Is helping me fight a candida imbalance. I take 7 drops twice a day with food. Neem is powerful, and too much can bring on intolerable cleanse symptoms. Also it is important to work with a reliable practitioner who can test you, not to guess when fighting possible fungal infections. If it&#x27;s something else, you&#x27;re risking making it worse as well as delaying real healing. I&#x27;ve found an energy practitioner (in transdermal screening) who is quite skillful and referenced by many people.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if it&#x27;s doing anything. My daughter insisted I use it- said it cleared up her allergies. I didn&#x27;t notice any change.</li>
    <li> Great stuff !! Great price, the best I have found yet !!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My mouth feels very clean and fresh after useing my drops.</li>
    <li> Nowhere on the packaging can I find the word &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, even though it is advertised as such. Very disappointed and confused by this.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great and works good.</li>
    <li> I have used the product topically and internally to improve the appearance of my toe nails.  It seems to be working.  Can&#x27;t wait for the nail to grow back once the fungus is gone.</li>
    <li> Very bitter, but I just put a few drops in a little bit of water and use it as a mouthwash when I&#x27;ve still got Neem tooth powder in my mouth - that sweetens it up. I think it&#x27;s doing good things for my gum disease. I also used it today to wipe off the leaves of a plant that seemed to be getting some kind of fungus or mite - hopefully it will help!  From what I have read, this can be used for almost any antibiotic or anti-fungal purpose.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pure alcohol. Don&#x27;t waist your hard earned dollars on this product by the pills instead. Wasted my money on garbage.</li>
