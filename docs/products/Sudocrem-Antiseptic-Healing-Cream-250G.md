<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Thank you for sudocrem you send me, it help me a lot  off. Marian</li>
    <li> After reading this product was good for eczema I bought it. I had been putting up with a dry area with large peeling sheets of skin with annoying itchiness, in and around one of my ears that just &amp;#34;arrived&#x27; one day out of the blue.  I had my doctor look at it but got: &amp;#34;it&#x27;s just a little eczema don&#x27;t worry about it&amp;#34;. Well, after a few months it was spreading across the back of my scalp behind that ear. This was a few YEARS ago and I&#x27;ve just put up with it all this time. Since the doctor didn&#x27;t recommend anything it seemed to be up to me to get some relief. Research and reading brought me to Sudocrem. I used it 2-3 times a day - whenever I could remember to slather it on - and after a month the eczema has almost completely gone away. It also helped 100% to stop the annoying itch immediately after rubbing some on each time. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for eczema</li>
    <li> I have never used the stuff, but my mom heard about it from my sister who uses it for her diaper rash on her babies bums. Anyways, my mom uses it for underboob rash...something you only understand if you have huge boobs. She loves the stuff. I know this all is weird to put in a review, but maybe someone looking for relief will read this and find it!</li>
    <li> Terrific stuff.  Occasionally get abraded and if it&#x27;s not serious enough to whip out the Duo-derm I used this and it gives relief by the next day.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream for your family.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff next to a microwave oven!!!  It cures the skin softens rough hands minor burns to chaffing and rashes!!!  With 2 kids and a manual labor job I think this was mg best investment!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found that prevents/treats diaper rash. I tried everything before finding this and my daughter always had a little redness no matter how fast I would change her diaper. My husband also used this on a bee sting and he said it took the pain away almost instantly. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Of all the different creams and lotions we&#x27;ve tried, this seems to be helping the most, even more than prescription medications, on the pressure sore my mother has.  Physicians and Dermatologists have all tried unsuccessfully to treat it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Not only for diaper rash, but for dry &amp; cracked skin, blemishes, and even small cuts that aren&#x27;t healing quickly. It&#x27;s incredibly soothing. The scent, according to the ingredients, is supposed to be lavender, but it just smells very lightly of a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent, and I can&#x27;t describe it better than that.  The first time I read about this was from glowing reviewers who were stocking up on it every time they went to Canada or England, since it&#x27;s not available in the US. I brought back a bunch of containers from my last trip to England and have been hoarding them until I found that it&#x27;s now available through amazon.com. Score!!!</li>
    <li> My friend from Europe brought me a tub of this after I had my baby. Its amazing stuff, my baby had diaper rash as a newborn in the hospital and this cleared it up in days. Its thick enough that it creates a barrier against urine but also helps to heal the affected area. The only cream I would use.</li>
    <li> Best cream for a baby, money can buy. I also love the smell.  It&#x27;s expensive but worth the money.  Every parent should have a tub of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Sudocrem is something that has been sent from the gods. You can use this on anything imaginable and it clears it right up. I swear by this stuff, it&#x27;s honestly the most amazing thing ever!!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived with a cracked jar but not much leakage :) I really like the mild lavender scent and it does smooth on nicely, but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any of the \\&quot;magical\\&quot; qualities touted by others. To be fair, I haven&#x27;t had occasion to use it a lot, but I&#x27;ll be trying it out on the inevitable summer skin problems!</li>
    <li> The best cream for diaper rash.  Nice fragrance.  Works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Sudocream is the best antiseptic cream I used for my children.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using sudocrem on my acne and it helps reduce the redness straight away. I also imagine the anti-bacterial properties of the cream help speed the healing.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I, a young adult male, use it for clearing up ball-chafe (I know some of you can empathize with me here) and seems to work well. Most other products (neosporin, moisturizer, aloe vera, etc) don&#x27;t do much for me. This has helped significantly, but has not gotten rid of it. Still worth it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it for acne, but along side other products. It seems to work well on specific out-break locations, but not so much on places with a ton of acne (for me, my cheeks). Also, heavy layers can clog pores. But placing and rubbing it on single pimples seems to work!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best all around sootheing creams i have ever used.  It treats all the things and i would deffinately recommend this to anyone who gets dry patches-dry lips-etc.  its just amazing.  A+++</li>
    <li> Really helped the eczema.</li>
    <li> bought for my brother, who is after liver transplant surgery. sent to Israel, thats where my brother is, waiting for feedback from him.</li>
    <li> Better than other creams. And this 250g pot should last you a long time.</li>
    <li> We use it for Diaper Rash and it works great! I like knowing that if my kids get sunburn this is also an option.</li>
    <li> I found sudocrem while on a trip to Ireland with my then 6 month old daughter.She developed a diaper rash and I was told by the locals to use sudocrem. It goes on very smooth and creates a barries of protection. That was over 30 years ago..Through the years many family members have relied on Sudocrem for there babies and a few have used it to help heal minor burn, skin irration and swear by it.I am now using it for my own grandchildren...Love the Stuff !!!</li>
    <li> GREAT for diaper rush!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work for bacne. Unfortunately, it made it much worse as it caused me to break out really bad.</li>
    <li> Healed pityriasis rash very quickly. Just apply a light coating twice a day. Arrived in less than a week from UK. Way faster than the estimated arrival date. Son also uses it for acne and hair bumps. Husband uses for ezema dry patch. I like having this around. Jar is pretty big,use sparingly. Should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I struggle with pressure sores on my bum from having to sit almost 24/7 due to disability.  Some stubborn pressure sores just did not want to heal all the way.  This ointment had done the job!  I plan to use the ointment as a preventative to try to stay healed and more comfortable.  The ointment is very dense and stays put, and the pleasing scent is a plus!  Glad to have found Sudocrem!  It was worth the wait to arrive from Great Britain, and it came fairly quickly from that distance. Very glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> My mum used this on us when we were little in the UK. In the years between then and having my own baby, I moved stateside. In all the baby preparation confusion and choices, this was the one solid decision that I did not need to make. And 15 months into this lark, I have lost count of the number of times I&#x27;ve been so grateful for it. If nappy, sorry diaper, rash has come up - and even the reddest, nastiest of rashes which have baby squirming when getting his nappy, sorry diaper, changed - in 12-24 hours it is totally gone with Sudocrem. On application, I have seen the little look of relief on the little one&#x27;s face. I even use it myself on my skin if it has become irritated. It&#x27;s just brilliant. We have sudocrem in bulk in our house.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It cleared up a stubborn rash on my husband&#x27;s arm. It is amazing how quickly it works. I just placed an order for 4 more of 125 mg size so that I can give them out to my mom, sisters and nieces. This is truly a miracle cream. You won&#x27;t  regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of products from Amazon and this is the first review I wrote.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is just amazing! My third kid&#x27;s skin is extremely sensitive that she gets nappy rash easily. She suffered from all the pains you could imagine of the nappy rash 3 months after she was born. However, with a thin layer of Sudocrem, the rash just disappears overnight, or when the rash is really severe, in two days/nights. I also apply this cream to my 5-year-old daughter who just started Kinder since she can&#x27;t wipe 100% properly yet. It also works great when my son got the sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a GREAT product that every mom should have!</li>
    <li> This product works really well in case you develop a joggers rash . It reduces itching and redness in a couple of days use. It works better if you combine it with bodyglide. Use bodyglide before your training and sudocrem after . You will be rash free for the whole summer.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. noticed results immediately. I tried it on open wound that wasn&#x27;t healing for over a year (well it would slowly heal but it would be super itchy while it scabbed and then i would scratch while i slept and once again open the wound) but this stuff healed it in matter of days. I also tried it on an ingrown pimple that would usually go away after two weeks and it went away 2days. So far this stuff works great. wish i knew about it sooner.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It great and can be used for so many things.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream we use. It works quickly at getting rid of my baby rashes. She likes to use it as a hair gel. LoL. The best way to get it out of hair is shampoo and Epson salt.</li>
    <li> This cream is really amazing. The only cream that has been working (consistently) for treating napkin rash. After trying lots of creams, I am now using only this cream on my baby. Good price, very effective.</li>
    <li> Great deal -- you get a lot of product for the money. Great as a night cream for blemishes and eczema</li>
    <li> My whole family swears by this.  Cuts, burns, acne, weird rashes--whatever--it relieves it.</li>
    <li> My chubby baby was getting a rash under her neck.  After a bath and gently blow-drying area, we applied Sudocrem and it was practically gone the next morning!  Also, I burned my hand on a hot pot and after cooling under cold water for 15 mins applied this cream before bed and the throbbing immediately stopped and it was healed the next day.  This tub is large but will continue to purchase if we run out!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for diaper rash - my 2 girls (now out of diapers) only ever had a diaper rash problem on the odd occasion when I had run out of Sudocrem and had used a different type of cream. A small amount of Sudocrem at every diaper change always kept them completely clear of any kind of irritation. I recommended it to a friend whose daughter was suffering with eczema and she says it&#x27;s almost as good as the prescription steroid cream for that as well. Love my Sudocrem!</li>
    <li> I think it cured my black dot nose, i gave them to others to try too. however, if the product stick to the clothes, you will have some trouble with cleaning it. and 2 hours wear, it was a little bit longer than every body&#x27;s expectation.</li>
    <li> Really a good product</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve started using it 2 weeks ago , my acnee didn&#x27;t disappered entirely, but some small results i can surely see.</li>
    <li> A good product and useful in many skin problems.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever, we are using it for my 18 months daughter since birth, we tried other brand for once, and it caused redness so we go back to Sudocrem. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best cream for rashes and minor scrapes</li>
    <li> I knew this has been around for a long time so I trusted and it deserves the praise.&lt;br /&gt;My little one started to have rashes weeks after birth so I immediately got these and It worked right away!&lt;br /&gt;So literally I went back to the shop and got it like 5 of them and left it in every room and my bags to keep it handy.&lt;br /&gt;I never had to worry about rashes again ever. and my little is without nappies now. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The best cream around for women&#x27;s chafing issues and heat rashes.  Don&#x27;t use anything with zinc on diaper rash.  It will make rash worse</li>
    <li> This is like the Tycod cream that no longer sells.  I love the multi uses.  Smells great and I plan to use it for lots of things.  Thank you for the delivery and packaging.</li>
    <li> My son is already 6 months and I&#x27;ve used Sudocrem every day, it is amazing, my baby has never had a diaper rash! Works great on any kind of skin problem/irritation.</li>
    <li> Never without a jar in the house.  Excellent product</li>
    <li> I heard such wonderful things about this product and I have to say I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so special or how it&#x27;s different from other creams like it.</li>
    <li> The only thing that has worked for my son&#x27;s sensitive little butt.</li>
    <li> The &#x27;Cadillac&#x27; of bum cream for babies - quote from the Doctor who performed my baby boys circumcision.&lt;br /&gt;I pass this on to all parents with babies for prevention of diaper/ nappy rash.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took longer than expected.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is excellent!  I bought it to solve a chronic rash problem, but used it, also, to help with a wound on my knee.  I wish I&#x27;d had this when my kids were in diapers.  I bet it works like a dream on diaper rash.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know about his product for baby rash, among other toddler, teen, and adult skin irritations, it is incredible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something that would make a big difference with my sensitive skin. This product works well for me and my family. I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best diaper rash cream. Pleasant smell and very efficient</li>
    <li> This works very well, I like it better than what you can get local.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I recently moved to the US and had problems with my dogs skin, everyone recommended this so I was grateful for a reasonably priced pot to be sent over. Actually what happened was I got a cold and my nose was torn up by tissues. I used this and literally over night my nose was sooo much better in the morning!! I use it for every scratch and graze now. It&#x27;s like a miracle cream!</li>
    <li> I would not buy a product from England, made in Ireland if it was not worth it. Dries weeping wounds, smells great (I don&#x27;t care for perfumed products, this is an exception) In my book this is 7 stars out of five. Brian</li>
    <li> I love this Sudocrem!!  Helps my hands, feet, legs, and arms feel smooth and heals all cracking!!  I highly recommend this cream to everyone!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is miracle cream.  Every household should have it.  Great healing, no scaring.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with the price. This item can be bought much cheaper locally.</li>
    <li> Works on some actinic skin on my forehead. But very dense (the cream, not my forehead). I use only the smallest dab. Jar should last forever. Skin is improved and cream protects a little from more sun damage. Has a lot of zinc oxide.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless products &amp; many different vets visits &amp; Finally found this one that showed healing the problem in less than 2 weeks</li>
    <li> They call it magic cream at daycare! This stuff is amazing on my son&#x27;s sensitive skin and treats diaper rash is a day or two at most. I am going to buy this for every new momma I know!</li>
    <li> Works well for diaper rash ,bed sores .Smells good .Highly recommend .Best cream I ever used .&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste  $$  an  anything else.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended to me by my friend whose family is from Ireland.  They use it on everything, and it completely works!  It has a nice, subtle lavender smell and works wonders on hard to heal diaper rashes.</li>
    <li> Good but expensive. Used it for diaper rash.</li>
    <li> Sudocrem is the only ointment that my mom ever used. She gave me a tub for my baby (now 7 months) and it is all I will ever need. a very thin layer is all you need. We have only had one diaper rash and it was clear within one diaper change with Sudocrem. My son also has eczema and this clears it almost completely. I love it. The tub is a little bulky but we still bring it everywhere! Worth every penny-and worth the wait to get it in!!</li>
    <li> Best baby barrier cream I ever used.</li>
    <li> work best for my baby ,, its so amazing cream  ..............and we will buy it again if our baby needs it</li>
    <li> Good product, great service. This is not at all greasy and is very soothing. Will buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> I used this product before for my little girl. It helps for rushes as always. I will get more as soon a this one is gone</li>
    <li> Always used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame not available in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shall order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not yet been disappointed in 30 years.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream! Wished we could get it off the shelf in Usa. Would be so convenient.</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply miraculous. Its impact on a multitude of skin ailments is amazing.</li>
    <li> A family member introduced me to this item from overseas. I was sceptical, but holy cow, this stuff works! I had a small patch of chaffing from a long run and this stuff destroyed it. I had sun burn and it helped with the healing and cooling. Again, I had a bad case of razor burn and this stuff just made it feel better. There is only one negative thing I will say: Do NOT apply alot before going out...LOL...it does not fade very fast and you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re wearing a cold cream mask. But if you don&#x27;t mind, it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;The point is that this stuff works AWESOME! Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> this is good for doggies too and helps heal any wounds big or small and leaves skin nice!!!! does not make them sick either...</li>
    <li> Been hooked on Sudocrem for years. Great price, fast shipping even though estimated shipping was like a month. Great product. Can&#x27;t find anything better for zits or rashes on this kids. Wish it sold in the US but I&#x27;m glad I can order it from the UK and still get it in a decent timeframe.</li>
    <li> Great I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
    <li> great all purpose fix it cream</li>
    <li> They need to sell this everywhere. We&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and cannot live without it! Great for diaper rash, cuts, burns....everything! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> they are pretty good~they dont make my skin moisture but at least they heal my dry and crack skins. so I like it</li>
    <li> This cream is one of the best for just about anything you will apply an antiseptic ointment, or cream. I use for my athletes feet which crack and bleed. Within two days of applying cream my feet heal up. I also use on my eczema works wonderful.</li>
    <li> It is the best for my baby :-)</li>
    <li> Using it on my Bulldog.</li>
    <li> What I like about this cream is that it is light and easy to put on. But I also like that is uses lanolin rather petroleum jelly and contains a small amount of anti-fungal ingredients to prevent fungal/yeast diaper rashes.</li>
    <li> This cream is the BEST!  For rashes ...all ages 0-99.  I highly recommend this product to everyone.  I bought 3 containers. 2 for my family and one for my friend.  I hope they keep making this cream.  It does miracles.</li>
    <li> This product seems to cure everything My friend has sun exposure to his face he used this for 2 weeks even the Dermatologist was impressed.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a friend from England who gave her a jar to use when my granddaughter was born.  We have tried most of the products available in the U.S. and have found this works the best. The consistency is very easy to apply, thin or thick, and the fragrance is pleasant.  For a small rash, the affected area is usually back to normal by the next day. For a harsher rash, it may take another day or so depending if the precipitating cause has been eliminated. Since solid food has entered  my granddaughter&#x27;s diet, we used the small jar we had and finding it available on Amazon was an immense relief (to baby bottom and mother anxiety).  I would recommend new parents try this product if they haven&#x27;t found any other product that seems to work as quickly and thoroughly as they wish it would.  It&#x27;s worth the cost and even though it was shipped from overseas during the holiday season at the end of December, we received it long before the projected receipt date.</li>
    <li> Sudocrem is great for drying up acne spots! I&#x27;ve found that using it alone doesn&#x27;t work as well for some reason as when it&#x27;s layered over a plain moisturizer like jojoba or extra virgin olive oil. Only a little is needed as it can be really drying to the skin due to the zinc. The slight herbal scent of this is really nice too. Great price and the tub will last forever!</li>
    <li> So happy to have sudocream :)</li>
    <li> I came across Sudocrem on YouTube when I was trying to find a way to improve my skin. I was skeptical about this but thought give it a try. My my was I wrong! Now my whole family use this(we are in 40&#x27;s with teenager kids). I just put some on at night after wash my face. By next morning acnes are gone or better. My husband and I noticed our pores get smaller when we use Sudocrem too. My daughter loves it as well.Try and see!</li>
    <li> This is what I call this cream. Magic. Because it is. My son knocked off a third of his finger. FIXED in two days. A friend of mine was sick and in need of help. Not only does this cream help for acne, bed sores heal quick but it also helped my friends shingles. Yes. Not even on the tub but it did. love love love this product. I have it stored in my house. Great seller too. Shipped from England to the States in less than a week, even though was promised by the 16th of april. Incredible seller. Would recommend this cream BUT buy from this seller. I know I will again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used it for my son when he was little &amp; on dippers. And now I&#x27;m using it for my bed ridden dad.It keeps his skin soft &amp; prevents bed sores!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A few months ago I had a heat rash on both arms that would not go away with over the counter or prescription medication. After using antifungal and antibacterial ointments for several weeks and seeing little improvement, one of my friends told me about Sudocrem.  I ordered it that night and it arrived about a week later.  Within 2 days of using it there was a marked improvement in the rash and it was totally gone within 2 weeks. From now on Sudocrem will always be in my medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> Loved it as a healing cream for my horse&#x27;s belly itch and rubbed skin from sweet itch. Gnats don&#x27;t like the sticky cream and it relieves his allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERYTHING for my eczema and always reading about the latest treatments (prescription and over the counter). My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years!!</li>
    <li> The big problem I found with this cream is that it doesn&#x27;t rub in very well.  If you are using it at night where it may not matter if it just kind of sits there.  It seems to be helpful with the rash my husband has.</li>
    <li> Good transaction.  Will recommend.</li>
    <li> Ive used it a few times for butt irritation due to sweat and bike riding. It reduces inflamation nicely; but you really have to keep reapplying it because it rubs off on whatever you have on-underwear,running shorts etc, Its really tough to get off you in the shower and I have to use baby oil or a lotion,rubbing gently with a tissue which might reinflame the area. Its also very difficult to get off your underwear,bathing suit or what ever your wearing but; not as staining and thick as Balmex. I found that after the shower I use a blow dryer and then apply hydrocortisone 1% mixed with an aloe vera cream like Fruit Of the Earth,which has alot of soooothing aloe vera. Now thats if you dont have a fungal infection to go with your irritation too! Thats a whole different can of worms so to speak!  Next time i get a fungal problem down there ill use this stuff first to see if it helps.I used Sudocrem today before I went bikeriding and to the beach. I was very surprised that my butt was hardly irritated at all; i mean with a wet bathing suit and all. I must say I didnt have this problem for thirty years while I went nude bathing. I may have to go back to this as wearing a wet bathing suit in NOT healthy.</li>
    <li> Prompt international delivery, the best baby cream in the world!</li>
    <li> Did nothing at all for my infantile eczema, rather made it worse. Highly ineffective. Will not advise anyone with eczema to waste money on this stuff.</li>
    <li> Cream arrived ahead of schedule and worked great. It goes on great and works well. Normally we would have to carry this back from Ireland.</li>
    <li> I use it to do facial mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;It helps on removing the blackhead on nose in long term.</li>
    <li> Tried on my 89 year old incont. Mom...lessened irritated area but did not go away..Had better results with another ointment,which I will stick with. Will save this for sunburn.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my extremely dry feet. It helped with the dryness. It didn&#x27;t completely take care of the problem, but it did help.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to get  here but overall nice product.</li>
    <li> Cures almost any skin related issue, even sunburn. Very useful for sensitive skin and diaper rash. Has a pleasant scent as well.</li>
    <li> The best cream you can buy for babies rashes and soreness.</li>
    <li> First I wanted to say this shipped much faster than the estimate.  I received it a full week and a half before the soonest I was to expect it.  As to the product itself I have used it on the five year old&#x27;s eczema, which can get quite bad and it&#x27;s almost disappeared behind his knees where it is the worst.  I also used it on the little boy I watch who had a bought of diarrhea and had a super sore and red bum.  It healed it very quickly, almost within the same day.  I never give anything five stars  because I just don&#x27;t believe anything is perfect.  I believe that there is always room for improvement.  The only downside is the product is very sticky and stays white for quit a while before it absorbs.  Therefore you won&#x27;t want to put it somewhere it will be seen if you are planning on going out.</li>
    <li> Great cream for my baby who suffered from eczema. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Excellent for rashes and all other claims. Works very well for me and my skin (fair) and it goes a long way. Would definetly recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
