      <li>nothing works as well when it comes to really exfoliating.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other options but</li>
      <li>/&gt;You should for sure soak it in alcohol for ten minutes before using it and let it dry.</li>
      <li>Some people should for sure not be giving instructions on how to use this product at least in my opinion..</li>
      <li>The product is well made and it does what it says as long as used exactly as directed.</li>
      <li>but they are using them much more aggressively than I can stand at least at this point.</li>
      <li>I can really see the difference in my deep wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a few of the numbing agent but they really don&#x27;t appear to work very well.</li>
      <li>I am not certain about if it is really working yet.</li>
      <li>but the results were much better with less visible  trauma and little to no redness the next day.</li>
      <li>(e.g. a clear plastic with a blue roller that barely turned) housed in a plain white box and as many other reviews have noted, it came with needles askew.</li>
      <li>I have had very noticeable results on scarring and stretch marks in little time.  </li>

<li> Used this several times a,week, wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.</li>
<li> Not only are they a lot less painful</li>
<li> ; 540- the 500 needle by SGF seem to have a hard time doing its job and squeeks out of control.</li>
<li> The lines are now shallow and softer looking.  </li>
<li> It ended up being extremely painful and when it started to draw blood and made my face excessively flushed for days</li>
<li> but, they are extremely expensive and I just cant afford them.</li>
<li> You would not want any nasty infections!.</li>

    <li> Great deal, works great.</li>
    <li> I got two from another company on the site and they did not roll easily an fell apart right away. They stopped selling the one that I had problems with but he one from this manufacturer is made of much better quality and rolls easily. It does not fall apart and appears to be much better made. I am not certain about if it is really working yet. It does hurt quite a bit especially on my fore head and nose. I have tried a few of the numbing agent but they really don&#x27;t appear to work very well. I wish I could find something stronger so I could use it a bit more aggressively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think there are some out there but, they are extremely expensive and I just cant afford them. It does work better on my face than on my  stretch marks though. You tube has some videos on how to use the derma- roller but they are using them much more aggressively than I can stand at least at this point. It should NOT make you bleed! Some people should for sure not be giving instructions on how to use this product at least in my opinion..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should for sure soak it in alcohol for ten minutes before using it and let it dry. You would not want any nasty infections!.</li>
    <li> The product is well made and it does what it says as long as used exactly as directed. Good bye stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I have strech marks an I didn&#x27;t think anything would make them go away an after one use I seen a huge difference</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t painful at all and thus far my skin has improved considerably. I&#x27;m diligent with my routine but I know my skin wouldn&#x27;t have improved without this.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product! The device is sturdy and easy to glide upon the skin. I have only used it on my face so far and saw results in less than a week. Immediately after using the Melody Susie Derma Roller, I applied my skin care products. I literally could feel the products absorbing into my skin, which felt awesome!</li>
    <li> It doens&#x27;t hurt and I can use it with my hair wet. the length is perfect, goes through my hair and still does its job. I LOVE that it doesnt squeek!&lt;br /&gt;MUCH BETTER Than &amp;#34;SGF + FREE Travel Case - Titanium Micro Needle Roller-540.&amp;#34; 540- the 500 needle by SGF seem to have a hard time doing its job and squeeks out of control.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job very well of getting rid of stretch marks, the only problem was that the needles started to go dull after a few months. I would recommend taking care of the needles and being gently because it does hurt like heck!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Derma Roller for about 6 wks.  I love the glow that it gives my skin.  The moisturizer seems to just melt into my skin after using the Derma Roller.</li>
    <li> This works great, and was delivered as expected.  I have had very noticeable results on scarring and stretch marks in little time.  Works when nothing else seemed to.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 months.  I can really see the difference in my deep wrinkles.  I would have liked a faster result, but it took years to get these deep wrinkles.  The lines are now shallow and softer looking.  I am headed in the right direction, so I am going to keep it up.</li>
    <li> this product saved my face and gave me back my confidence and it is helping my son as well for his acne scars... my scars were really pitted but with continued use and follow directions it lessen my scars but I also made a scrub with vitamin c powder and coconut oil to use after I used the hyaluronic acid with vitamin c.. I can really see a difference but this is from my experience and my son which has really helped his skin too he is a teenager and yall know that they break out like candy...lol</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s alright. used it a handful of times.</li>
    <li> Who would&#x27;ve thought that such a thing would work, but it actually does! I am very impressed with it and will continue to use it until all of my stretch marks are gone!</li>
    <li> Just as described and quick shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> It works perfect! This is my favorite tool when it comes to cleaning my face! Literally this roller makes my pores feel so clean and clear it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m a long time user and I won&#x27;t give it up! I&#x27;ve tried so many other options but nothing works as well when it comes to really exfoliating. I love this system! It&#x27;s so easy to transport and it gives me more confidence in my skin.</li>
    <li> Some needles were bent but otherwise do what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
    <li> Used this several times a,week, wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable. Ski. Looks amazing  Will continue to use and will be purchasing  another one again.</li>
    <li> Great product...as promised packaged well.</li>
    <li> This was the first Derma Roller I ever purchased and it seriously put me off micro-needling almost for good. The model I received looked completely different from what is pictured here (e.g. a clear plastic with a blue roller that barely turned) housed in a plain white box and as many other reviews have noted, it came with needles askew. These needles were very sharp so I decided to go ahead and use it. It ended up being extremely painful and when it started to draw blood and made my face excessively flushed for days I ended up stopping.    I know all of these are intended to be disposable single use instruments for use in a dermatologist office or med spa but the quality of what I received was pretty poor and only lasted eight uses before the needles became dull and bent. I tested it again on my hand and I could see not only prick marks left behind but the needles snagging my skin which caused scratches and swelling. Almost a month later and I can still see the rows of these prick marks on my hand giving the appearance of large pores. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t use this on my face again.    After retiring this one I ordered Derma Rollers with over 500 needles and will continue to use those from now on. Not only are they a lot less painful but the results were much better with less visible  trauma and little to no redness the next day. We&#x27;ll see if they last longer than this one but eight times is not enough to see if any improvement is being made to your skin and any cost effectiveness is being eaten away by constantly having to order replacements.</li>
