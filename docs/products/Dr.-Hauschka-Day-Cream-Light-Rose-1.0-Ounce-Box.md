      <li>I was originally going to order the Day Cream, Rose and after reading reviews, changed to the Day Cream, Light, Rose, which was a mistake.  </li>
      <li>It makes me winter-skin look wonderful with a super soft feel.  </li>
      <li>Really great stuff - not heavy or oily at all.</li>
      <li>Dr. Hauschka makes the most fabulous skin care products, and this one is no exception.  </li>
      <li>Great for sensitive or sunburned skin.  </li>

      <li>Very mild smell &amp; viscosity.</li>
      <li>I like the regular version better than this Light one, but still a great product.</li>
      <li>Enjoying this product tremendously.</li>

      <li>I heard about this product after reading an article citing what the gorgeous and famous female celebrities use as a moisturizer.  </li>

      <li>It is readily absorbed by my skin, smells amazing, but it is truly much lighter and not quite as oily.</li>
      <li>It feels great on both the dry part and the oily part of my face.</li>
      <li>The regular Dr. Hauschka Day Rose Cream was a bit too heavy/oily for me, but the light version is just what I needed!</li>
      <li>It smells light soft roses and feels amazing on your skin.  </li>
      <li>The light version makes makeup much easier to apply and really gives me a nice glow.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the smell, but I do not recommend this product if you have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I like the regular version better than this Light one, but still a great product.</li>
    <li> not as fluid as I would have liked</li>
    <li> I could tell results in just a few days. Love the way my skin looks.</li>
    <li> Good price for an amazing product. I love this stuff! Wish Dr. H made it in a larger tube.</li>
    <li> This product is a wonderful product that I have used for years. I like the all natural ingredients of Dr. Hauschka and this product hydrates my skin nicely.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about the Dr. Hauschka Sensitive Skin products. I have tried SOOOOO many different products in the past couple of years, so was excited to read such great reviews on these sensitive skin products. I purchased the cleansing milk, toner and rose day cream-light. After 2 days my face felt like it was on fire and since has been extrememly flakey all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had problems finding a good facial treatment since cutting out parabans, sulfates, etc from my products. I found out the reason... just bc it&#x27;s organic or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; does not mean you can&#x27;t be allergic or sensitive to it. Apparently you can develop just as bad reactions to them (maybe even more likely) than others unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tons of seasonal allergies, so makes sense that I&#x27;m allergic to ingredients in the natural products with herbs, tree extracts, etc. These products also have alcohol! I have no idea how alcohol is acceptable in a sensitive skin care line. Dermatologists will tell you to stay away from alcohol, especially if you have sensitive skin. Disappointed in this line. Be wary of the ingredients if you have truely sensitive/allergenic skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few years now, and I am very happy with it. I have a combination skin, so some creams that worked well for the drier parts were too greasy for the oilier parts of my face. I also had to reapply creams multiple times during the day in winter season on the dry patches on my cheeks. Not with Dr. Hauschka! It is universal for the whole face, and I only apply it twice a day (in the evening and in the morning). My skin has become much more balanced since I started using it. The regular Dr. Hauschka Day Rose Cream was a bit too heavy/oily for me, but the light version is just what I needed! Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> lovely cream, nice scent, but very thick - felt like I was &#x27;stretching&#x27; my skin every time I applied it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this. I use the day cream (just reviewed that) and this is what I use for night. The scent is truly rose - not artificial anything. The rose cream (plain - not &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;) is heavier - like a night cream. This is light, as it says. Really great stuff - not heavy or oily at all. Read the ingredients and compare with the c - - - on store shelves - !</li>
    <li> The scent, to me at least, is not quite a light rose scent, but it just isn&#x27;t for me. You may like it.</li>
    <li> keeps my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another subject, I ordered a book from you and it came from a dealer in CA and it&#x27;s the wrong book.  I wrote them first using your form on 3/28, and then again a couple of days ago and have heard nothing.  I wanted to call and talk to you about it but no one can call you, which is not the best.  My order number was115-0931675-0115441.  This is not good customer service. Can someone look into this for me please?  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was originally going to order the Day Cream, Rose and after reading reviews, changed to the Day Cream, Light, Rose, which was a mistake.  My skin needs more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the product description it states that this amount should last &amp;#34;about three months.&amp;#34; Even were this product emollient enough, I don&#x27;t see how it could last that long; you need to be able to use enough to smooth over your face, even if only a very thin layer, and this one ounce is a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, it smells delicious.  There are better products for skin care out there that offer better value.</li>
    <li> nice seller~~! I bought it for my friend because i heard it&#x27;s really good for skin. hope she will love it</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works great on my face and under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation just creamy moisture that soaks into my skin and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in excellent condition. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of quality of production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came highly recommended, and &amp;#34;so far, so good&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Still in the process of giving this a shot. At first it seemed to be clogging my pores, but I kept with it and I think my skin has just gotten used to it because that seems to have improved. Also weather change has caused my skin to be dry lately, and this has been helping to combat it however I will still notice dry patches. Overall I really like it, and look forward to &amp;#34;loving it&amp;#34; soon!</li>
    <li> The cream feels nice, but it&#x27;s a little too light for my dry skin and I broke out after using it for a couple of weeks.  I&#x27;m very sensitive, so it might work better for those who are not.  Smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very nice, light moisturizer. Makes my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> This is not the moisturizer for me although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good and works well for others.  I bought because I head Jennifer Lopez mention that she uses the product and her skin is divine.  For me, the tingling sensation when applied plus the &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; smell didn&#x27;t make me want to use the product daily. I&#x27;m putting away for now but may come back to it in the future.</li>
    <li> Not sure it adds much to my cream regime!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells wonderful but causes my oily/ sensitive skin to break out a little. I think it&#x27;s just too heavy. If you have normal to dry skin I think this would work out well!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to tame redness.  While it didn&#x27;t help with that, I DID discover, most unexpectedly, that it helped prevent acne.  I have been using Dr. Haushka&#x27;s Rose Day Cream Light for about 7 years.  If I neglect to use it two days in a row, I begin to break out again, so I know it&#x27;s working.  I had been using prescription acne creams, which were extremely harsh.  I stopped using the prescriptions about a month before I discovered this, so I was pretty broken out.  Rather than using it as a moisturizer in the day, I apply it at night before bed under my regular, non-irritating lotion.  This cream isn&#x27;t terribly moisturizing and it does feel a bit greasy, so I prefer to use it at night.  I also prefer the Light version to the regular version.  The Light version is much less greasy, it works just as well for acne, and the product doesn&#x27;t go bad as quickly.  One tube typically lasts me about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Just a little costly.</li>
    <li> I used this for a few days but could not get myself to use it any longer - it is way too thick and oily.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s heavy for me but others may like it for a night cream.</li>
    <li> Very light, refreshing feeling.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product after reading an article citing what the gorgeous and famous female celebrities use as a moisturizer.  While my skin tends to be normal/dry, I didn&#x27;t know how this would react to it, so started with the light cream, vs. the regular.  It smells light soft roses and feels amazing on your skin.  It is absolutely not too heavy and makeup goes perfectly right on top! I just bought the regular cream because I think I can go with a slightly heavier version and still reap the benefits.</li>
    <li> While I did not realize I purchased the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version of this moisturizer, it was actually really great and left my skin feeling soft and moisturized....I am hooked on this product now!</li>
    <li> My Wife uses this every day and really likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e been using Hauschka Daily moisturizer for the last 49 yrs. Its the only&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer that leaves my skin  happy, young, softened and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;The Day cream light Rose. is excellent as well.&lt;br /&gt;TB</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is the perfect Day Cream for my skin type and it feels very soft on my skin. Mostly I like the natural ingredients used .</li>
    <li> like most of Hauschka&#x27;s products, this one feels wonderful on the skin and i adore the all-natural ingredients and rose scent,</li>
    <li> Makes your skin so,so smooth and soft. I wish it was a wee bit less money but you really do..........get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> The product is really wonderful it helps your skin look younger tighter and decreases wrinkles! Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> One of the best products on the market.</li>
    <li> This is a great product- leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day without feeling greasy.  It also smells like roses as a bonus.  I typically get very flaky skin on my chin in the winter, but I haven&#x27;t had much of a problem with this since starting this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this product, and this was the best price around!  It makes my skin look soft and my makeup goes on easier.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer plus the Rose day cream!  It&#x27;s expensive but if you buy it in Germany or Europe it&#x27;s a lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> works great, way cheaper than buying at Wholefoods.</li>
    <li> Good cream if you do not need a lot of moisture.  I love the smell and how it goes on but I need a bit more moisture.</li>
    <li> JLO secret weapon now mine!</li>
    <li> Enjoying this product tremendously.</li>
    <li> Honesty and in fairness is how I&#x27;m going to rate this product. It is pricey but I have paid more for other products. I chose the Day Cream Light because of the climate here in Hawaii. I anticipated the regular Day Cream was going to be a bit heavy. Thanks to other reviews this Day Cream Light had a nice texture and an especially wonderful fragrance. I did notice a bit of a skin break out when using this product. Deciding to pay closer attention, and use this product intermittently with others for now.</li>
    <li> I love it!  My skin looks better already.  It&#x27;s lightweight, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and makes my skin smoother.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the regular Hauschka rose cream, which was way too heavy for me. I have mostly dry, mildly sensitive skin and am 40 (for reference). By the middle of the day, my normally dry skin ended up oily and shiny, and I noticed a few new whiteheads on my face. But I loved the addictive rose scent and the way it made my skin super soft. I decided to try the light version. I am so happy with the results. It is readily absorbed by my skin, smells amazing, but it is truly much lighter and not quite as oily. I still use the regular rose cream as an eye cream only. The light version makes makeup much easier to apply and really gives me a nice glow. After 7 days of use, I have not had a break-out, either, another plus.  If the regular rose cream is too heavy for you but the moisturizing day lotion is too light, this might work for you.</li>
    <li> My skin absolutely CRAVES this lotion. EVERY TIME I try to switch to a less expensive lotion my skin reacts with a vengeance! It is gentle enough to use around my super sensitive eye area, too.</li>
    <li> Love Dr. Hauschka products. I use this every day as a base for my makeup.</li>
    <li> As a moisturizer, this cream was fantastic. However, I could not stand the very heavy rose scent. It was WAY too much for me. I used the whole tube, because it was so expensive, but after it was used up I switched to a different moisturizer that for me works just as well and smells a lot less strongly. If you can stand the smell, this is a great moisturizer for sure. It kept my skin soft, but never oily. I just could not deal with that smell on my face all day.</li>
    <li> I really like the light Day Rose cream because is not grease or heavy and keep my skin moist in this cold weather or when I am expose to heathers.</li>
    <li> Very mild smell &amp; viscosity. I actually enjoy this quite well</li>
    <li> Dr. Hauschka makes the most fabulous skin care products, and this one is no exception.  I use this lighter cream in the warmer months, and the regular Rose Day cream for the winter months.  Both smell divine, and form a wonderful undercoat to my makeup.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It is very light and smells great (i&#x27;m not much a rose scented fan, but this is nice). I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance so far, but I think I would by it again due to the other benefits.</li>
    <li> This was recommended on one of Kandee Johnson videos, so I tried it.  It is great, I like how it is not greasy it goes on great, and you can put your primer/makeup on soon after you apply this.</li>
    <li> Light and smooth - great daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very light feeling but moisturizes well. I have semi-oily-combinatino skin. It feels great on both the dry part and the oily part of my face. Love it.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought this when I thought I was buying the regular rose day cream. This light formula feels odd on my skin, almost filmy or like it makes it tight and matte. I don&#x27;t necessarily hate this version but I definitely bought the regular right away when I realized I&#x27;d made a mistake. This formula is nothing like the beautifully moisturizing, amazing original. With the regular Rose day cream, it feels like my skin just drinks it up, and although it felt too oily at first, it really absorbs into the skin and makes it plump, and smells amazing. Won&#x27;t repurchase the light, but definitely won&#x27;t ever be without the original!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive or sunburned skin.  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> No sunscreen from this natural brand. why call it day cream then? how to prevent skin cancer? And names Dr. what a sarcasm! but i do agree that the texture of this is lighter than the original formula for easier absorption</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it only in the winter months...keeps my face moist.</li>
    <li> I started using this as a replacement for the rose cream which was getting too heavy, and my skin was getting congested.  This stuff is amazing lots of moisture with out feeling heavy!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do as well as advertised, but who knows...maybe it&#x27;s just my skin type.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have very oily skin, and it works phenomenal for me</li>
    <li> Love it! Only wish it had SPF.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  My only hesitation for future purchase of this wonderful day cream is that it is a small quantity for an expensive price.  Love the lightness of it, the faint rose smell and the fact that my face feels moisturized all day.  The mild Rosecia (red complexion) on my cheeks seems to have lessened since I started using this daily.</li>
    <li> Dr. Hauschka products rock! I have very sensitive skin and live in the pacific northwest. The weather here can vary. Dr.Hauschka&#x27;s day cream fits all weather issues that my complication goes through.</li>
    <li> Found out about this gem after watching Bravo&#x27;s Watch What Happens and JLo raved about it, she has access to very expensive products but finds amazing results with this one. I knew I had to try it since she has amazing skin. Absolutely love this product!! My skin feels amazing, notice more even skin tone and redness is gone. What a great product!!</li>
    <li> Dr. Hauschka products rock and this is an incredible moisturizer.  It makes me winter-skin look wonderful with a super soft feel.  I LOVE this cream.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This cream is light and goes on smoothly.  I has a pleasing scent, and lasts all day. Applied best after the tober.</li>
    <li> Love everything Dr. Hauschka!  My 55 year-old face has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it! I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over 8 years. I keep coming back to it every time I get lured by newer stuff out there. Excellent for winters but a little greasy for summers. It is my absolute must have.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to get this product due to everything I heard people say about it. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days and I do like it very much so far. The smell is lovely!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of my skin after applying this cream. It smells so good too. The only negative is the price; such a small amount for the money.</li>
    <li> I buy these two at a time. Incredible cream that nourishes and balances the skin. All natural and homepathic and with this &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version without beeswax it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Smells incredible too!</li>
    <li> Finally found a cream that I am going to stick to for a long time. And I am sure about that !!!</li>
