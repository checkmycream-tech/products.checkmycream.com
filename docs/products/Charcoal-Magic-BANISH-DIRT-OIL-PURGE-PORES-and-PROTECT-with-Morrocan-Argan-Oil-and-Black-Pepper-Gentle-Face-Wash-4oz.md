      <li>but many of the ingredients are listed as certified organic.</li>

      <li>I love the fact that it is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Passport to Organics provided Charcoal Magic for evaluation and review.</li>
      <li>meaning most people don&#x27;t realize I have a pimple coming/going even if I&#x27;m not wearing make-up.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a sure fire winner.</li>
      <li>I love the way this cleanser makes my skin feel</li>
      <li>but I genuinely love this cleanser.</li>

      <li>Charcoal Magic cleanser, is gentle, effective and safe for ALL skin types, for usage twice a day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this face wash every day, twice a day, for more than a month now, and I&#x27;m positively blown-away by how amazing my skin feels after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a handful of charcoal cleansers but this one might be the most unique.</li>
      <li>perfect for healing many skin ailments and protects against premature aging...gentle cleansing...paraben free, sulfate free, phthalate free, no artificial frangrances, eco friendly, no animal testing, naturally</li>

      <li>So it&#x27;s great that only one wash is needed.</li>
      <li>It definitely works great in conjunction with my exfoliation mitt</li>
      <li>When Passport to Organics offered me a free sample, I felt that hope</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have been using this for a few months now and not even half done with the bottle. I&#x27;m noticing I don&#x27;t have any many black heads as before. But I also combine it after washing my face with straight argan oil.</li>
    <li> Charcoal Magic Facial Wash may not have the most attractive appearance, but it seems to be a good facial cleanser, that leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh.  Probably because it contains charcoal, the liquid has a dark grayish color.  While this color may not look very attractive, the lotion spreads smoothly, without any noticeable particles, and has a pleasantly sweet citrus scent.  It rinses off without too much effort, and although it contains various oils, including Argan and black pepper oil, Charcoal Magic does not leave an oily residue on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Charcoal Magic for evaluation.  It has a rather extensive list of ingredients, and while I don&#x27;t find it to be an amazingly effective product, it does a good job of cleansing, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed, and ready for the application of a moisturizer.  Because of the cost, this product is probably not for those who just have a casual interest in facial care.</li>
    <li> Our household has slowly migrated to natural, plant-based cleaning products and while it&#x27;s been tough on the wallet, the improvements have been remarkable. Consequently, I&#x27;ve tried many facial soaps and cleansers and while I can&#x27;t assess their marketing claims can definitely tell you about the results of testing for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charcoal Magic comes in a small dispenser but you don&#x27;t need very much to see it work. After 2 people using for 4 weeks, we still have over half the product remaining. For facial cleansing, the pepper adds almost a tea-tree sensation, and it&#x27;s highly effective both in areas with blackheads, like the nose or forehead, but doesn&#x27;t aggravate dry areas of skin. Over my testing phase, it substantially reduced the number of pimples and blackheads while also making the skin look fresher and more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never washed with charcoal before but the recipe here is worth trying if you have perpetually oily skin or suffer from skin marks and blackheads that are resistant to all the standard remedies. It only takes a few days to start noticing the improvements. This was a test product I received from the manufacturer but would have no hesitation in buying the next bottle.</li>
    <li> I never knew getting charcoal in my stocking would be so awesome!! I love this Gentle face wash. The smell is different. But i just love the way my face feels after using this. Such a great product. I highly recommend..</li>
    <li> I love this refreshing cleanser! I have been using Lush&#x27;s coalface to help dry up some of the oily patches on my skin, but I like this much better! It has a zingy, natural scent - like eucalyptus/ pepperminty that wakes me up in my morning shower, and it definitely took case of the oily patches on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the pump dispenser. It&#x27;s easy when my fingers are wet and slippery to get just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review but I genuinely love this cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t have that weird charcoal scent that the Lush one does and feels very enlivening on my skin.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time and money with this. 1. Go to the store( most likely Sprouts or wholefoods) 2. buy activated charcoal capsules. 3. Pop open a capsule and mix with a bit of water.( Make sure that you&#x27;re doing this with some gloves or put some paper on your counter so you don&#x27;t get. Charcoal dust everywhere) 4. Rub it all over your face except for eye area.  And WAH-LAH!!! A MORE EFFECTIVE DEEP PORE CLEANSE straight from the source. It pulls the impurities out. AND MUCH CHEAPER. Only do this once or twice a week! Works like magic!</li>
    <li> *Item Received Without Cost For Purposes of Evaluation and Review*&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with how the Charcoal Magic makes my skin feel. I used it with my Clarisonic and my skin has never felt so smooth and cool to the touch. It has a slight citrus scent which I found very refreshing. It&#x27;s a face wash, not a cream or lotion so of course, it has a thin consistency. The Moroccan Argan oil perfectly balances the drying effects of charcoal and there&#x27;s no note of greasiness to it at all.  You only need a small drop, there&#x27;s no need to pile it on.  Since one of the ingredients is White Tea, I liked leaving it on my face for a few minutes. White tea is an antioxidant and it was something my daughter&#x27;s dermatologist suggested she apply to her skin. It helps reduce stress and encourage collagen production. I really loved this wash and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend or buy in the future. It&#x27;s a sure fire winner.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cleanser makes my skin feel and I find the scent pleasant and calming.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a couple of weeks ago and have been using it almost every morning and night as a basic face wash, and I am loving it! My skin (which has been plagued with acne on and off since I was a teenager) is rapidly improving, with blemishes clearing up and the overall tone and texture noticeably getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced a similarly great result from Lush&#x27;s Coalface soap, however soap is so bad for skin in the longterm that I am delighted to have found an alternative with the same active charcoal, minus the highly alkaline soap element! The Argan oil seems to being doing wonders as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give an update in a month or so, crossing my fingers that it&#x27;s a good one!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products from my favorite skin care brand.  Charcoal magic feels soft on the skin while still being strong enough to rid the skin of the oily yuck that seems to accumulate during the day.</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review. Here is the verdict:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually expected this to be coarse considering the ingredients. Instead, it was very smooth. My wife and I BOTH gave it a try. I used it after shaving my head. It is refreshing. I can&#x27;t say I felt anything, and my wife said that she was on the fence. Perhaps more exposure will yield a more noticeable result. I will say that my skin and my wife&#x27;s does feel silky after using this.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My face feels so clean and fresh after using. I really feel like it is keeping the pores clear. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is supposed to \\&quot;CLEANSE, DETOX, and CLEAR skin with Charcoal, Argan, and Black Pepper!\\&quot;  And I see quite a few reviews from people who are very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But someday I&#x27;m going to be the only person in the Old Folks&#x27; Home with a great big stress zit in the middle of my forehead.  My roommate&#x27;s grandchildren and I will share skin care tips.  When I see something I&#x27;ve never tried before, I always hope that maybe THIS will be the thing that makes the difference.  When Passport to Organics offered me a free sample, I felt that hope again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that this face wash feels nice, has a very faint, pleasant odor, and did not harm my skin at all.  No drying, no burning, no peeling, no discomfort at all.  The color makes it easy to see, and when I use a [[ASIN:B00BSU7H5W brush]] to wash my face, it&#x27;s easy to see when the brush is clean of the charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is that there was no improvement, and certainly no clearing.  Since nothing I&#x27;ve tried ever makes a difference, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s really bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is so mild, I thought that the [[ASIN:B00JRUH6JW primer]] I&#x27;ve been using lately might be the problem.  I actually started washing my face twice in the evening, once to remove makeup and primer, and again with this to allow it to reach my skin without being blocked by a primer.  Still no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charcoal Magic seems to be a good face wash, and it did me no harm.  I wouldn&#x27;t kick it out of my bathroom, but I won&#x27;t be rushing to buy it again.  If other reviews are any indication, the problem is my skin, not the cleanser, so if your skin is not as stubborn as mine you might have better luck than me.</li>
    <li> skin became very dry and broke out like i did 15 yrs ago. feels horrible. not sure how legitimate any of these ingredients are. i typically use eminence organics and 100% pure , and never had any rxns to &#x27;natural&#x27; ingredients.  Also used origins charcoal mask, and worked very well. after a week of this, i went back to eminence only, and started improving. not sure i believe i was &#x27;purging&#x27; from this ,but  probably a rxn to something in here.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is wonderful! The first thing you notice when you pump it out is the smell of black pepper. I happen to love black pepper, so that&#x27;s a plus for me. And when you put it on your face, you feel the pepper! There&#x27;s a wonderful light tingle that stimulates the skin. I apply it with a Buf-Puf and scrub very gently. I don&#x27;t know exactly why (maybe the aloe? the Argan oil?), but I can&#x27;t think of another cleanser that leaves my skin so soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is easily irritated. My fallback cleanser has been Cetaphil, because it never strips my skin or leaves it dry. This is a new favorite, charcoal, black pepper and all, because it cleanses so well and leaves my skin so smooth and soothed, yet ever so slightly tingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A review sample was provided for honest evaluation.</li>
    <li> Not all cleansers are the same, although most of them do the job of cleansing. In the morning, we cleanse our face to remove any leftover facial products that we apply at night for a fresh clean start. Then in the evenings it is just a matter of proper hygiene to cleanse the dirt, debris from the daily pollution, and to remove any make-up that we may have applied. Generally, it is just something we all do automatically, without much thought like brushing and flossing our teeth. However, the Charcoal Magic for me, is a pleasurable experience rather than an automatic cleansing habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charcoal Magic by Passport to Organics, comes in a convenient pump container, the gray charcoal colored lotion is very smooth, with a nice refreshing light citrus scent. The gentle lather is not overpowering, I do not care for other cleansers that bubble up with so much lather that it is almost impossible to rinse off. The Charcoal Magic is smooth, rinses off easily, and Wow, it leaves my slightly dry and mature skin looking brighter, softer, and noticeably cleaner. I use a magnifying mirror with 3 strong suction cups attached to my bathroom mirror, and due to the magnification, this mirror speaks the hard truth. Therefore, I do know exactly what my skin looks like, and there is no doubt, my skin is cleaner, the skin pores are clean and minimized, and in addition, my skin does NOT feel as if all the oils have been stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charcoal Magic is pure with 100% natural ingredients, certified organic, using over 70% of premium organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charcoal helps to draw out toxins, dirt, oil, thereby providing clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black Pepper Oil has anti-oxidant properties and warms up skin with regenerating benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan Argan Oil has high levels of Vitamin E, possessing 80% of fatty acids, which is nourishing and acts as a healing agent for many skin conditions including acne, and contains other properties to protect against drying and the premature aging of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the other ingredients have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial properties with added beneficial organic vitamins, minerals, and essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charcoal Magic cleanser, is gentle, effective and safe for ALL skin types, for usage twice a day.

    <li> I have oily skin, and this has worked very well for me. It smells very pleasant (citrus-like), goes on smooth and rinses cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has helped with my oily complexion, and I&#x27;ve had no breakouts or any ill effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 100% organic, which is something that&#x27;s very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, remember. And this does not suds up like a soap - it goes on smooth and rinses smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Nice  Started using this product and my face feels smooth and clean&lt;br /&gt;A must purchase I also use other product as well check it out</li>
    <li> another great product , much like the Neem cleanser by this manufacturer</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me a clean feeling. The consistency is so funny I have to splash my face with it. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin. Kind of pointless. Sticking to my African black soap</li>
    <li> I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this cleanser. It has a light, pleasant smell, and leaves my skin feeling slightly tingly and clean without any residue left behind. After using it a little over a week I&#x27;m happy with the results, I see less pore clogging residue on my skin after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have sensitive skin that dries out very easily in winter, so I have to moisturize after I use it, but I must moisturize after I use any cleanser in winter. The ingredients haven&#x27;t dried my skin any more than other sensitive skin cleansers I&#x27;ve used, and honestly I like this one more than most I&#x27;ve paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the unbreakable bottle, the packaging is nice and I would purchase again. I would like it even more if there was a go along moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I work as a waitress in a diner and I can literally feel grease on my skin when I get home after a shift. At my restaurant the waitresses do all the dishes, so between the grease in the air and the steam facials from the dishwasher repeated sometimes up to twenty times a day, it can literally leave a film of grossness on your skin. I really do feel like this cleanser gets all that gunk off my face with one wash. Some cleansers I&#x27;ve used in the past I&#x27;ve had to wash my face twice. So it&#x27;s great that only one wash is needed. It saves on the product and ultimately saves you money too!</li>
    <li> I received this cleanser as a gift, and I really liked it a lot.  I&#x27;ve always been a fan of charcoal masks to manage my acne, so I was pleased to get the same benefit in a daily cleanser.  I have fairly sensitive skin and found the product to be gentle enough for me to use every day.</li>
    <li> My wife and our thirty-something daughter love this and I like it too. I like the black pepper scent and the fact that this face wash does a great job on my oily forehead and nose. I tried Charcoal Magic a few times over the course of a few days, and it kept my face oil free for many hours without drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has used a lot of Proactiv products for her skin, though she&#x27;s not currently using it as she prefers to use products with all natural ingredients, such as Passport to Organics Charcoal Magic. Before trying it, she studied the Passport to Organics site (passporttoorganics dot com), and came away impressed with what she learned the company and their products, and confident that this product would be safe for her to use. I then let her take the sample I received for review purposes home with her, and she&#x27;s been using it twice daily as recommended. It&#x27;s too soon to tell how this might help her fight acne, but she says the results look promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice pump bottle made of what appears to be good quality plastic, so it shouldn&#x27;t break if dropped. The pump works well and is apparently a very good quality pump, and a little Charcoal Magic can go a long way. You do have to occasionally shake the bottle when natural separation of ingredients occurs.</li>

    <li> This face wash is the color of charcoal and has an unusual fragrance dominated by black pepper with sweet citrusy notes.  The peppery smell lingers for a while and is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When lathered and applied to the face, it feels very silky, almost like a lotion, and it leaves the skin clean and taught, but soft and smooth rather than stripped and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is reassuring, with dozens of botanical liquids, extracts, oils, essential oils, and vitamins, many of them organic.  My skin is very sensitive, but this face wash is invigorating rather than irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passport to Organics provided Charcoal Magic for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Call me a sucker, but I&#x27;m totally on the charcoal bandwagon. It feels gentle on my face, seems to reduce blemishes, and has a smoky, modern scent. I&#x27;ve tried a handful of charcoal cleansers but this one might be the most unique. The liquid has a consistency that is more oily than I&#x27;m used to. It doesn&#x27;t bubble a lot, which makes it more gentle for the skin. The Black Pepper overpowers all other scents, but it&#x27;s surprisingly fresh. Your skin never feels tight or overdry after cleansing. The bottle is small and because of the lack of bubbles I find myself over-using the liquid. Fortunately a little bit does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like the cleanser. My only complaints are that I feel like it isn&#x27;t quite powerful enough for my blemish-prone skin. The oil-based ingredients don&#x27;t seem to be as cleansing for me as I would like. To remedy this, I mix a teeny dot of my usual facial cleanser. This gives the mixture just the right amount of bubbles to soap away dirt more effectively while still remaining very gentle. This method gives me a fresher feeling face and cleaner skin. For those of you with REALLY sensitive skin, however, you&#x27;ll probably want to use the formula exactly as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is fairly small for the retail price, in my opinion. Although there are some nice premium ingredients, I don&#x27;t feel like charcoal and black pepper are necessarily luxurious ingredients worthy of the price tag. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s an excellent face wash and I give it a hearty recommendation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample review.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser. Gives a slight tingly feeling. It&#x27;s very refreshing and is a great cleanser. I first got a free sample of it with another product and loved it so bought the bottle.</li>
    <li> Have only used this skin cleanser twice so far, but love how my skin feels after each use. I also love that you can smell the natural ingredients as you use it.</li>
    <li> This has been an amazing product.  Even after taking some meds for adult acne I was still breaking out.  Now I rarely get any breakout and even when a pimple start to peak its head if my skin has been particularly oily that day its gone by the next day.  Wow, really is like magic!</li>
    <li> Great cleanser. It&#x27;s hard to find a cleanser that cleans my skin well, without stripping it and/or making me break out. Various cleansers I&#x27;ve tried include: JASON, Murad, Mychelle, Dr. Perricone, Neutrogena, and others. I&#x27;ve had black heads, pimples, cystic acne for about 20 years, onset in college. I&#x27;ve tried treating it from the inside and the out, without prescription treatment. Food, supplements, diet, hydration, colon health, yeast, etc. Eight months ago, after 2 babies, hormones, and no time to be nice to my skin, I knew I needed a new approach (again).&lt;br /&gt;This is the first and only time my face has actually cleared up to a measurable degree. I could have taken pictures and people would have said, &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;  I haven&#x27;t received comments from anyone (except from my husband). But then again, now people look me in the eye, and not glancing at the spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;On other products, I would improve, but still have regular breakouts from stress or PMS. Or my skin would be &#x27;fine&#x27; for a little while, and then it would get bad again.&lt;br /&gt;My skin heritage: Italian, French, Am. Indian, Irish, Central Am. Indian, Swiss. My skin tends to be oily, not dry.&lt;br /&gt;For the past 6 months I&#x27;ve been using Kate Somerville and Charcoal Magic: one in AM, other in PM. After my initial 2 months of Kate Somerville cleanser during which my skin seemed to be purging (but still better than other cleansers) I thought I had found the answer, but it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;perfect&#x27;. With my skin beginning to calm down, I didn&#x27;t want to stress it with the Kate cleanser twice a day. I began to use the Charcoal Magic too. Now, except for rare occasions, my skin is pretty clear...meaning most people don&#x27;t realize I have a pimple coming/going even if I&#x27;m not wearing make-up. (I&#x27;ll always know where my trouble spots are though!)&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is thin, light feeling, silky smooth, interesting light scent - citrus? It doesn&#x27;t make suds, but it FEELS like soap, so I don&#x27;t need suds to know I&#x27;m washing my face. Once I rinse my face, my skin feels super soft and smooth (more than the Kate cleanser). It feels I have clean &#x27;plump&#x27; skin like a baby, instead of dry, tight, stripped skin. I put a moisturizer on because I know that I should, not because in 5 minutes my face will be so tight that my eyeballs are about to pop out.&lt;br /&gt;Other things I started 6 months ago include: using ultrasonic facial brush, EradiKate for break-out management (great stuff!), e-derma microderm abrasion scrub once a week, and occasionally a 20-minute mask, either Dead Sea mud or collagen mask to help repair past scarring, and a daily face lotion that isn&#x27;t a lotion at all - it&#x27;s a mix of oils with Sea Buckthorne oil from a &#x27;made-in-the-kitchen&#x27; company. I&#x27;ve had to completely quit using traditional face lotions; each and every one makes me break out. As do all wrinkle and peptide treatments.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very rare that I ever write reviews on anything, however  I found this product and others from this manufacturer to be worth the time. Charcoal Magic is a great cleanser!! It totally cleared up my skin better than any other product I&#x27;ve used..and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products over the course of several years.  I would recommend this to anyone and am very happy I came across this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with an exfoliating mitt, as my skin is very dry. It&#x27;s very difficult for me to say if this product works well alone, or if it should be used in combination with something else. My skin does look extremely smooth and feels softer than ever. Whether it&#x27;s from this product, or from the exfoliation mitt, or from the combination of both, I honestly don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would assume that the ingredients in this product would be very useful for exfoliation purposes and for smoothing out rough skin. The fine charcoal and black pepper ingredients no doubt supplement the success that I&#x27;m having with the exfoliation mitt, but to how much a degree, I can&#x27;t be sure. Since Moroccan Argan Oil has high levels of Vitamin E, as well as 80% fatty acids, it&#x27;s obviously good for your skin. The combination of other antioxidants and oils would certainly lead me to believe that this item would work well all by itself. The light citrus scent is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is a very nice and useful product. It definitely works great in conjunction with my exfoliation mitt and I have little doubt that it would work great if used alone.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser. It seems to really cleanse and leaves my skin soft, and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in pore size.  It works as well or better than a lot of the pricey products I&#x27;ve tried.  I love the fact that it is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that this will also help slow down the aging process!  All in all a great product, I received a sample in exchange for an honest review, but once this sample is gone, I will be ordering more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, but I don&#x27;t use it every day, possibly could be too drying to use every day, but when I do use it (about three times a week) it really does clear the pores, and does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.  A little runny, when applied to the fingers and hard to get on the face to stay there and scrub, but like I said I do like it, and would probably repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in my skin, but I feel good when I use it. I like that it is made of all organic materials.</li>
    <li> First off... WOW!  Finally, my skin is clearing up.  I&#x27;ve had a bad complexion since I was a teenager.  I&#x27;m now in my upper 40&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time for something that would clear up my face.  This is it.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and the transformation has been phenomenal.  Whiteheads, pimples, red spots are going away and my pores are shrinking.  I&#x27;ve used many products from a lot of vendors and this has been the only product that has worked for me.  If you have bad skin, I can honestly recommend this.  The only bad thing to mention is price, but for me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Being a guy, I&#x27;m terrible at judging cosmetic products. But I was giving a sample to review, so I just want to give a short perspective from a guy&#x27;s point of view.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so I am very limited to the types of face washes I can use, and through experience have only stuck with the sensitive face washes from Neutrogena, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear, St. Ives, etc.&lt;br /&gt;So I was a bit hesitant to try this, but the description stated several things that really intrigued me, such as the certified organic ingredients and Morrocan oil. So I went ahead and tried it, and so far it has not had any adverse effect or reactions on my skin. The black pepper also adds a good tingle during application. The smell is tangy and quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;So since I am doing fine using this having sensitive skin, I can honestly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser.  The dark grey charcoal face wash really cleanses and leaves my skin soft not dried out.  It works better than other cleansers I have tried from other brands.  I LOVE that it does not have chemicals and I feel like it leaves my skin in better condition. I love the soft tingling feeling when I put it on so I know it&#x27;s working and it helps keep my acne under control too.  I don&#x27;t break out that much but usually I have hormonal breakouts with sensitive skin. This charcoal keeps it under control.  I feel like this will not make my face age by striping away all the natural oils. Also, love the herbal smell  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I love natural products. The fact that this had pepper and aran oil piqued my interest. When offered a sample for review, I jumped on it as this is an awesome combination. Worked well.</li>
    <li> I love MAC&#x27;s lava scrub (super pricey and definitely only a splurge!) and Biore&#x27;s charcoal cleanser gets thumbs up because I love the smell. But neither of them cleans as well as this charcoal cleanser so if I had to pick just one to repurchase it would be this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes one pump to wash all the makeup off my face and neck. It cleans without abrasives (MAC) and it doesn&#x27;t  have a fake scent (Biore) and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and in need of moisture (BIore). It has a pleasant slight fragrance that must come from an essential oil like lemongrass, I need to read the ingredients more closely and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cleanser so much that I take it with me when I&#x27;m out of town overnight (several times a week). It never leaks in my bag (Biore can&#x27;t say the same)  I&#x27;ve let my friends use it when they see that it&#x27;s a charcoal cleanser and are curious. Our skin varies in type all across the spectrum and everyone says they love how their skin feels soft and clean.  I have very dry cheeks and oily t-zone and my face feels perfectly balanced after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this as a &#x27;luxury&amp;#34; gift for a friend. If you have natural product nuts in your family or friends they would love this! A repurchase for me.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this item to review for the manufacturer and was a bit nervous to give it a go. I have oily, acne-prone skin which I keep under control with a gentle cleanser,topical BHA and benzoyl peroxide. When something works, I don&#x27;t like to mess with it. So I used my daughter as the guinea pig. She&#x27;s 16 and loves trying new things. Her skin is dry, sensitive and usually clear. I advised her to start slow, using this only twice a week to see how it went before using it twice a day. It&#x27;s now a month and 1/2 later and she is using this every day and her dry patches have cleared up which is shocking considering the frigid weather we are having and she&#x27;s had no adverse reaction from any of the ingredients. The minor acne she had has pretty much cleared up so she&#x27;s thrilled. I&#x27;d recommend this if you have a similar skin type but you should start out slow to see how it works for you. I have used it several times at night in place of my gentle cleanser and it does leave my skin feeling very soft and it has not broken me out. If things change, I&#x27;ll update the review but for now it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash every day, twice a day, for more than a month now, and I&#x27;m positively blown-away by how amazing my skin feels after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a mixed skin type, parts of my face are very dry and other parts tend to get a bit oily, especially after a long day of wearing face primer, foundation, concealer and all the other stuff that&#x27;s supposed to make us ladies beautiful. In addition to that, I get some breakouts on my cheeks every now and then. Because of that, I am extremely picky when it comes to trying new products. I told myself I will only use this wash a couple of times to see how it feels on my face and then I&#x27;ll go back to my tea tree cleanser from Body Works. That did not happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love how gentle and soothing it feels on my face. It&#x27;s made with certified organic ingredients, 100% natural, and it makes your face feel amazing. It smells very refreshing, kind of citrusy and kind of minty. The smell is very subtle, too, but it makes you feel instantly energized and refreshed. The grainy particles are so fine, they do a fabulous job cleansing your skin and cleaning your pores without scratching at it and potentially damaging its surface (that happened to me with Argan Oil Intense Face Scrub from Eveline - it really was intense, alright!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels smooth and very clean after using the Charcoal Magic. It helps remove all the makeup residue my makeup removing wipes failed to pick up and it seems to also tighten my pores nicely. At the same time, it&#x27;s pretty nourishing and moisturizing. I love that it also contains some tea tree oil, avocado, aloe and argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive or normal skin type, but especially to those with mixed or oily skin types. I will definitely be stocking up on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for a month and I still have about half a bottle left. All you need is one-two pumps, so this 4oz bottle lasts quite a long time. Well worth the money for sure!ite a long time. Well worth the money for sure!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and I absolutely love it.  I only wash my face once a day, in the morning, and I believe it has improved the softness of my skin. My skin is very soft.  At 65 (or so my birth certificate says), I want good products on my skin, especially my face. I want wrinkles kept to an absolute minimum (or none, preferably).  This is a gentle face wash, without a lot of suds. (Who needs suds anyway?)  The first page write up says it has a citrus scent.  I say, no.  It has an absolutely enchanting scent that takes you away on a magic carpet.  I love this scent.  It is not an artificial perfumy scent either.  It is an exotic, natural scent.  The 4oz/120ml bottle may not sound like much but I have only used about one sixth of the bottle so far, because you only need a little bit.  (So, if you used it twice a day, you would probably use a bottle for about 3 months.)  That said, it doesn&#x27;t cost much and I think it is worth $10 a month or less.  The pump bottle is easy to use, you squirt out just a wee bit.  There are way to many ingredients for me to list here but many of the ingredients are listed as certified organic. Some of the ingredients are aloe, neem, avocado oil, tumeric oil, and several essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the front page: \\&quot;charcoal helps to draw out toxins, clear skin, banish dirt and oil. Black pepper has anti-oxidant properties.  Moroccan argan oil protects and nourishes the skin with high levels of vitamin E and 80% fatty acids.... perfect for healing many skin ailments and protects against premature aging...gentle cleansing...paraben free, sulfate free, phthalate free, no artificial frangrances, eco friendly, no animal testing, naturally effective.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A web site is provided, should you wish to contact the company.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t lather up on my face and it takes quite a bit for me to feel like it actually cleaning my face. It does the job I guess but not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s truly magic. I will purchase two more and have them on hand.. Five stars in my book!!</li>
    <li> Does a good job at cleaning my face and doesn&#x27;t leave it dry feeling. Like that it&#x27;s chemical free. Is on the pricey side though.&lt;br /&gt;Probably will not order again.</li>
    <li> Charcoal Magic is an interesting product, none like I&#x27;ve seen or used before. With black pepper too?  It&#x27;s a think liquid, somewhat grayish, which I assume is from the charcoal. The ingredient list starts with aloe vera and includes a wide array of organic oils and extracts from a number of plants including extracts, oil or essential oils of black pepper, black willow bark, tea tree, pink grapefruit, turmeric, sweet orange and many more. Instead of using Charcoal Magic like a \\&quot;gentle face wash\\&quot;, I initially used it more as a clarifying mask that instead of peeling I washed it off about 30 minutes later in the shower - I LOVE THE RESULTS.  By the next day the few minor blemishes I had cleared right up - just in time for the holidays!  In the future I&#x27;ll likely continue using Charcoal Magic as a mild facial mask in addition to the stated use as a gentle facial wash.  It is indeed gentle as a facial wash, instead of being irritated as some chemical based cleansers, my skin felt smooth and soothed.  The Charcoal Magic was supplied free of charge for reviewing purposes. I am quite pleased with the product overall and may consider buying a bottle in the future if the price is reasonable at the time I consider the merits of another bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality cleanser and is very mild.  I am in my thirties and get occasional break outs.  I normally use Cetaphil, and this charcoal magic feels similar to the gentleness of Cetaphil.  I felt my face was clean when using it, and I never broke out while using it.  It is very mild, and does not lather, but my face felt clean nonetheless.  I did feel I had to use a bit more compared to other face washes because it felt watery though.  I would give this a try, and will continue using it in the future.    Sample provided for review.</li>
