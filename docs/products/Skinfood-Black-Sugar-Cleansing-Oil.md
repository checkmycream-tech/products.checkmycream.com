      <li>Works great at removing waterproof makeup</li>
      <li>Cleansing oil isn&#x27;t that great for my skin, but the friend I bought it for absolutely loved it.  </li>
      <li>Feels and smells great :)  and is good for your skin...</li>
      <li>Most people seem to like it, but all I can smell is lemon floor cleaner!  </li>
      <li>This oil has a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>Smells good, rinses off easily with a foam wash.</li>
      <li>I love the smell too.</li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>Love the lemony smell.</li>
      <li>I am so in love with this cleansing</li>
      <li>while some people described it as lemonade it smelled more like lemon furniture polish to me.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it sometimes.</li>
      <li>A nice way to clean off the day, even though my skin tends to be on the oilier side it does not cause break outs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Shiseido Perfect Oil, a Shiseido cleansing oil that comes in a yellow bottle, and one from Happy Bath (Korean brand), and after only 2 uses of this Skin Food oil</li>
      <li>Overall a nice product that is pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good too, like a rather sweet lemon.</li>
      <li>well, I couldn&#x27;t get over the strong fragrance-</li>
      <li>But it has mineral oil in it, so I wont be buying it again to clean my face.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, leaves my skin feeling soft and clean and has a pleasant (albeit Lemon Pledge) scent.</li>
      <li>After washing off the oil my skin feels very fresh and super clean.</li>
      <li>However, I did not break out using this, I just want to switch over to more natural and chemical free cleansers since my skin is super sensitive.</li>
      <li>Will certainly buy again!</li>
      <li>Gentle on my sensitive skin, which is a huge bonus!</li>
      <li>The oil cuts through bb creams and such quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>I use this as the first part of my skincare routine at night.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s pretty</li>
      <li>packaging is the first thing that I noticed.</li>
      <li>It is really gentle!</li>
      <li>I expected more.</li>
      <li>Really perks me up.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use it in the morning because I don&#x27;t sleep in makeup, so I just skip to the cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Does not seem to be clogging my pore and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>To properly cleanse your skin, you should use the oil first then a foam cleanser.</li>
      <li>The oil rinses so clean and leaves no residue, and if it does get in your eyes, your vision doesn&#x27;t get nearly as cloudy or blurry as with other cleansers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I can already say that this one is by far the best!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>use one pump, which is enough to cover my whole face.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Me Herione Make mascara and use the included remover on my eyes, so I can&#x27;t really say how effective this is on crazy stubborn eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>And unlike the others I have used that washed off with water, this one would not come off my face no matter how much I tried to wash it off with various facial cleansers.</li>
      <li>Cleans my face well, gets makeup/sunscreen/general dirt off with minimal effort, and with a little cleanser it rinses off my face easily &amp; thoroughly.  </li>
      <li>I use heavy foundation and this cuts right through it.</li>
      <li>It smells like sweet lemons, just like the other products from the black sugar line.</li>
      <li>The smell is so strong that I feel like I&#x27;m rubbing a lot of really unnecessary chemicals on my face.  </li>
      <li>I put a little on a cotton ball and go to town, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to do my whole face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The smell is so strong that I feel like I&#x27;m rubbing a lot of really unnecessary chemicals on my face.  Why add all of that to a cleanser?  It also leaves a weird film which isn&#x27;t a huge deal because I use a foaming cleanser after the oil, but for those of you looking for a one step cleanser, this will probably not work well.  Doesn&#x27;t remove makeup as well as DHC.  Returned.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. I have to think the other reviews are fake. I have used oil cleansers in the past and NONE of them were like this. This felt like I was rubbing actual vegetable oil on my face. And unlike the others I have used that washed off with water, this one would not come off my face no matter how much I tried to wash it off with various facial cleansers. I finally had to take a towel and wipe it off. I don&#x27;t believe it would have washed off my face with anything but dish soap. Total waste of money. Awful.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Works great at removing waterproof makeup</li>
    <li> Excellent product. To properly cleanse your skin, you should use the oil first then a foam cleanser. I have already purchased another bottle of the cleansing oil</li>
    <li> Just started using a cleaning oil. Can&#x27;t say enough about how well this removed waterproof eye makeup and sunscreen. Very gentle, leaves my skin feeling soft and clean and has a pleasant (albeit Lemon Pledge) scent. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this cleansing oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is the first thing that I noticed. There is this clamp that goes under the nozzle to keep from accidental pumps. I think this is great if you&#x27;re traveling or when you have the cleansing oil sitting on the counter. You definitely don&#x27;t want to spill it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is well...oily. It&#x27;s oil. It smells pretty good too, like a rather sweet lemon. I found this a bit strange since this is a black sugar cleansing oil. Where did the lemon come from? I didn&#x27;t mind the smell though, it&#x27;s pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one pump, which is enough to cover my whole face. I then massage it into my skin, focusing a lot on the pores on and along my nose. The oil actually pulled the gunk out of my pores and removed my eye makeup without dragging or pulling. It is really gentle! After washing off the oil my skin feels very fresh and super clean. I can&#x27;t stop touching it sometimes.</li>
    <li> Cleans my face well, gets makeup/sunscreen/general dirt off with minimal effort, and with a little cleanser it rinses off my face easily &amp; thoroughly.  But the scent!  Most people seem to like it, but all I can smell is lemon floor cleaner!  I just can&#x27;t get over that, so I will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Great scent! Really perks me up. Gentle on my sensitive skin, which is a huge bonus! Does not seem to be clogging my pore and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> While it removed all my makeup well, I couldn&#x27;t get over the strong fragrance- while some people described it as lemonade it smelled more like lemon furniture polish to me. It also stung my eyes whenever I washed my face.</li>
    <li> This takes my makeup off so well. I use heavy foundation and this cuts right through it. I put a little on a cotton ball and go to town, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to do my whole face. Just know that if you use this, you need to use a foaming facewash soap after, or it will leave residue. That&#x27;s with any oil though</li>
    <li> You can never, ever go wrong with Skin Food. Cleansing oil isn&#x27;t that great for my skin, but the friend I bought it for absolutely loved it.  The seller is prompt, and they provide excellent costumer service!</li>
    <li> It gets rid of my eye makeup instantly! I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> Smells like lemon cream, lifts my makeup off wonderfully. Will certainly buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Shiseido Perfect Oil, a Shiseido cleansing oil that comes in a yellow bottle, and one from Happy Bath (Korean brand), and after only 2 uses of this Skin Food oil and I can already say that this one is by far the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes off all of my makeup, even my mascara! It smells like sweet lemons, just like the other products from the black sugar line. The oil rinses so clean and leaves no residue, and if it does get in your eyes, your vision doesn&#x27;t get nearly as cloudy or blurry as with other cleansers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try this</li>
    <li> Love the lemony smell. A little goes a long way. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells good, rinses off easily with a foam wash. I expected more.</li>
    <li> Great makeup remover. Oil but not leave the skin oily. Removes waterproof mascaras perfectly. I really love it.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great :)  and is good for your skin... A nice way to clean off the day, even though my skin tends to be on the oilier side it does not cause break outs. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This is great for removing makeup and just washing your face. But it has mineral oil in it, so I wont be buying it again to clean my face. I will buy it again to remove eye makeup. However, I did not break out using this, I just want to switch over to more natural and chemical free cleansers since my skin is super sensitive. But I recommend this product to remove eye makeup. It literally dissolves even waterproof mascara and gel eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I use this as the first part of my skincare routine at night.  I don&#x27;t really use it in the morning because I don&#x27;t sleep in makeup, so I just skip to the cleanser.  This oil has a nice scent.  Sort of like lemon zest without the tartness.  It comes with a pump, which is hygienic and convenient.  The oil cuts through bb creams and such quickly and easily.  I use Kiss Me Herione Make mascara and use the included remover on my eyes, so I can&#x27;t really say how effective this is on crazy stubborn eye makeup.  When you add a bit of water it emulsifies to a slightly milky color.  This rinses a lot cleaner than other oil based cleansers (ie: cold cream and such) that I&#x27;ve tried, leaving my skin nice and soft.  Overall a nice product that is pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-nice lemony scent&lt;br /&gt;-dissolves makeup easily&lt;br /&gt;-pump packaging&lt;br /&gt;-rinses off (though I still use a foaming cleanser afterwards anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-scented (for those who don&#x27;t like it)&lt;br /&gt;-does contain mineral oil</li>
