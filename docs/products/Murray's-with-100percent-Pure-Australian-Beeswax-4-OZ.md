<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have eczema on my hands and need to use skin sealers to make sure that chemicals, scents and even dust don&#x27;t get on my skin. Prescription skin sealers are unbelievably expensive so most people, myself included, use petroleum jelly instead. It works but it&#x27;s not very thick and can be slippery even if you only use a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found an almost empty jar of this in the back of the cabinet at my boyfriend&#x27;s house. It had been left by another *cough, cough* guest. But I was curious about it after reading the label. I opened it. It was at least a couple of years old but beeswax doesn&#x27;t expire and it still smelled good. After I washed my hands, I took a small amount and massaged it into my skin. I reasoned that beeswax would be an excellent skin sealer so I left it on to &amp;#34;test drive&amp;#34; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an hour, I had no itching, no redness and no other signs of irritation. My skin actually felt nice. Most sealers feel sticky or grainy. I&#x27;ve been using this for my eczema for a couple of years now and I love it. I told my Dermatologist about it and now he recommends it to his patients who would benefit from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A jar of this lasts me about eight months. I use it after washing my hands and after any serums or medications like steroid cream and it seals in the medication. Some things I&#x27;ve tried actually caused the medication to sit on top of it so it was pointless to use medication in the first place.  It&#x27;s the best skin sealer I&#x27;ve ever found. i can wear it when I drive and when I do household chores like folding clothes.  It&#x27;s not dry or stiff and has enough moisture in it to make it pliable. It&#x27;s not goopy like petroleum jelly.  It doesn&#x27;t show up on fabrics. I can shake hands and it&#x27;s undetectable.  I&#x27;m a massage therapist so I wash my hands at least twenty times a day, every day. Using this, especially in the winter, I feel that I have fewer breakouts on my hands and I haven&#x27;t missed any work because of my hands, since I started using it.I love it! I use it when I thread needles, as a lip balm and I put it on my feet after a pedicure. I used it on linen thread when I restrung my mala and it was fine. I&#x27;m sure I can think of several other ways to use it. Being able to find it at this price is just a bonus.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT IS GREAT, BEST I HAVE EVER USED BUT HOW I USE THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT IS &amp;#34;NONE OF YOUR BEESWAX&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> A must have for an gentlemen&#x27;s grooming</li>
    <li> Exactly what we needed.. Very high quality.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way. Keeps my scraggily beard tame. I use a boars head brush to apply and it works great! Not too greasy or sticky like other products. If you go light on the application you will hardly know it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> I wanted %100 pure beeswax to use in my shop as a lubricant for screws before driving them into cabinets and other hardwood projects I build.  By dipping the screw into the Beeswax first, this helps them go in smoothly by lubricating them and helps to seal them into the wood so they don&#x27;t come loose later! Thank  Amazon, very FAST as usual.  Keep up the good work!! Completely satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Ok I can honestly say that I have been using the same can of original formula murray&#x27;s since october last year, I just checked. And it is simply the best stuff I have ever used. There was a skit of the chapelle show and the prize was a lifetime supply of murray&#x27;s, and the funny part it was only one can. No seriously, one can will last you a very ling time. the hold is better then anything known to man... that said it is however hard to get it out of your hair, if say you wanted to cut your hair. So finally comes my way murray&#x27;s beeswax, stated on their website it is almost as strong. And I agree, yet somehow it feels softer in a way and washes out a lot easier. Here is what I do now, I will use the original one day then the next two days or so I will use the beeswax. And by then if I choose I can easily wash it out with some deep cleaning shampoo. I hardly want to wash this out of my hair, i really think it looks better a couple days without washing it out. The smell is not like the original, it is almost smells like nothing at all.. But there is a hint of vanilla maybe, it is kind of a sweet smell. I know people that swear by american crew the whole line, I will take the pepsi challenge with this and win I believe hands down. I found this near me... finally available in my area without ordering online for under 3$ I think it was only 2.60. Lol where all the other brands charge over 15-25$ Not to mention i use only a very small amount. I just skim some on one finger and rub into my hands till it is very clear and no bumps, and it has very good grip running it through your hair. If you want to spike it mohawk or whatever you want your hair to do, this gives you ultimate control. like I said before I have had an original formula for a year and now I am sure it will last twice as long now using this along with it. I do cut my own hair and I tend to keep it finger length on the top and wear it kind of messy so I dont have to really use a lot. but rain or shine this is agreat product... i was actually just in a heavy rain storm, got soaked running from my car. Grab a paper towel from the bathroom drag it across my head and my hair looked the same. no huge melting mess or running into my eyes like with gel or some other stuff that easily washes out... I&#x27;m just saying this can stand anything. hope this review helps someone else save a bunch of money, why spend 15$ when 2.60 sounds a lot better. go get yourself a couple subs or something with the change</li>
    <li> Excellent product for beard care - purchased for the beard in my life and it&#x27;s shiny, manageable, smells great and look awesome.  Many people have said it&#x27;s even majestic.  Lots of uses for beeswax but as for a lightweight conditioning beard wax - definitely a keeper.  Note - this does not maintain crazy styles for a beard or mustache apparently - if you&#x27;re a twirler, spiker, or whatever styles you can put on facial hair, this is not the product for you.  Keep it tamed and not unruly, conditioned, and shiny.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a Christmas present For Nieces. Just in case they wants Dreads Mon.&lt;br /&gt;This for the Blond</li>
    <li> The shipping and everything was great. Only 3 stars because I was expecting more beeswax than vasoline</li>
    <li> This product works better than anything i&#x27;ve tried over the years for the benefit of cracked skin and particularly relief from Eczema.  Fantastic.  Keep in the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mustache wax and I thought I&#x27;d try this but it is not what I expected.  It feels more greasy then waxy.  Now I&#x27;m no expert in this stuff, but I find it works better as a lip balm then a mustache wax, so that&#x27;s why I give it a 4.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff... From lip balm to hand cream to a survival fire kit in your bug out bag, rubb some cotton balls in it and light it up as a fire starter... Works great!!!</li>
    <li> very goopy but a nice sculpture tool.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my handlebar mustache. It was a bit greasy so I use it to keep my head hair in place instead.</li>
    <li> NEED IT TO BUILD MODLES WITH THREAD.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t put it on my hair before applying heat- that would literally fry my hair!  It&#x27;s really good as a glaze after staightening, especially if you have fine, fly-away hair that needs some weight.  A little goes a long way!  I have natural 4a/b hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for locs/ dreads.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly.  It was as described.  Good price.  Company seems to be on top of details.  I like the product and use it minimally on a weekly basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years. Had problems with gels trying to keep my hair in place, this was the only stuff that worked. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I was not careful when buying this product.  I read 100% pure beeswax on the label, but missed the \\&quot;with\\&quot; that comes before it in smaller type size. Unless enlarged, the \\&quot;with\\&quot; is very small to read.  The Amazon caption for this product also reads:  \\&quot;Murray&#x27;s Natural Beeswax\\&quot;  and that is misleading because it contains other ingredients.  I don&#x27;t know how much actual beeswax it contains - I would guess between a quarter and a third.  The remaining ingredient is petrolatum (petroleum jelly) if memory serves.  I bought it to make homemade zinc oxide diaper cream - and despite not being pure beeswax, the cream turned out ok.</li>
    <li> on time, right product thanks</li>
    <li> works great for fly-aways as I had read in a popular fashion magazine. It&#x27;s great for us health/natural nuts, and works better than shea butter. &lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Use it for my mustache... Works great.</li>
    <li> 😍 I ❤ this product. It arrived as scheduled which is always nice. The wax itself is great for maintaining my dread locks! I recommend this product to anyone with fresh dreads because it doesn&#x27;t smell, you don&#x27;t need much, and it holds great!</li>
    <li> found on amazon - husband has a wonderful beard with mustache and thought he would be SO handsome when using this to hold his mustache in &#x27;handlebars&#x27;  works well when i can get him to use !!!</li>
    <li> yeah its wax. i wasnt using it for my hair, i had other plans for it and it worked well. good price.</li>
    <li> Great product at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff thinking that I was getting 100% pure beeswax... the first ingredient is petrolatum. If that is the FIRST ingredient, how can it be PURE??? PURE GARBAGE! I will never buy ANYTHING from Murray&#x27;s and I will tell everyone I know not to as well.</li>
    <li> Ingredients are listed as:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Petrolatum, Select Australian Beeswax (Cera Alba), Fragrance (Parfum)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I was expecting relatively solid wax like a pomade. I had intended to use this as a beard wax.  Instead, This is more like a petroleum jelly with beeswax scent. Not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> worked on my dogs elbow to help with dry skin</li>
    <li> I hated it so much, I threw it away. I&#x27;m Sorry but this isn&#x27;t 100% beeswax its like 90% with petroleum, I didn&#x27;t realize it was for hair till I got it. And plus this shit isn&#x27;t even good for your hair because petroleum clogs your hair pores so yeah. But on the bright side it did have a semi pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want it for head hair, but for beard and mustache.  This stuff is more like hair mayonnaise than wax, so it won&#x27;t hold at all, but it will calm down a beard so there aren&#x27;t hairs going all over the place. And to put it in, you don&#x27;t have to make an immovable object out of the hair like you do with wax.  Best to use in combination with wax for a mustache I think.</li>
    <li> great wax,  my husband ordered it to use on his beard  it smells great and helps his beard stay in place but since he sweats alot it tends to start going off.  overall its a great wax and the packaging i was amazed super well taken care off</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly safely and well packaged. Have not used product yet as this is a back up to the jar im almost out of. Have never had a problem with this product and this is a repeat order of same. Recommend this product for your do it myself projects. I am making lip balm with this and teaching my grand daughter.</li>
    <li> the item&#x27;s description is misleading. the main ingredient is  petrolatum and not beeswax. if you&#x27;re looking for beeswax, look elsewhere</li>
    <li> Murray probably never intended its beeswax to be used as a healing &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s exactly what it has been for me.  I got the idea after a friend told me that his mother used a big wad of spider&#x27;s web to seal and heal a very deep gash in his hand.  I reasoned that if bug secretion could be magically healing in that situation, why not try bee&#x27;s secretion to treat the bad skin on my leg.  Voila!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product as a mustache wax to keep all the wild hairs in place. It&#x27;s simple to use, not heavy but gives the right amount of control. And, it smells fresh.</li>
    <li> Far too soft for moustaches.  And as others have pointed out, this stuff is more vaseline than beeswax, so it&#x27;s false advertising in my book.  May be good for dreads, but I wouldn&#x27;t know :)</li>
    <li> Ok,I haven&#x27;t used it yet so I&#x27;ll come back and update my review, BUT I was really annoyed at some people&#x27;s lack of common sense that I felt the need to make this review now...&lt;br /&gt;For the people saying they&#x27;re disappointed and bla bla bla because the label says made with 100% Australian beeswax... It says &amp;#34;WITH&amp;#34; that beeswax not exclusively just that. It just means that WHEN they made the product, the wax they used was 100% true but it doesn&#x27;t mean they didn&#x27;t add anything else to it.</li>
    <li> I use it to manage my beard, and it works excellently.</li>
    <li> If you want 100% beeswax, do not buy this product. When it arrived, I found that the 100% Austrailian beeswax was one of the items. The main ingredient is petrolatum, and I found the labeling deceitful. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is not 100% beeswax, which would probably be obvious to anyone who read the fine print but I did not.  Some of it is petroleum jelly. It also has added fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was on the look out for any product that would help with my &amp;#34;prickly&amp;#34; hairs that stick up all the time; I purchased numerous other products that were labeled as such for helping with this problem or &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; as well. At least 5 others did not meet my expectations in taming the prickly hairs; on an off chance I picked up Murray&#x27;s and surprising it was also the least expensive of all the ones I tried before. This stuff is like glue - I use a small amount and rub my hands together and you can feel friction heat when doing so. Once applied there is an immediate difference and one that stays throughout the entire day. I could not be more pleased with this product for its great performance and moderate cost.</li>
    <li> A great stiff wax for forming shorter hair, or just taming longer hair into a kinda greasy look(just being honest here).  I have bushy thick hair, and I really like this stuff for sticking it all into one manageable piece.  I wear a hat compressing it most of the day at work, after word take the hat off and push/rake your hair a bit and you have good look.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to see the little words on the label \\&quot;with\\&quot;. beeswax.  First ingredient is petrolium.  Yuk.  I did not want that.  Shame on me Dir not reading the reviews first.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS AFTER SEVERAL COATS OF WALNUT OIL ON SPOONS THAT I HAVE MADE WITH KOLROSING WHICH MAKES THEM SAFE FOR USE WITH FOOD.</li>
    <li> Murray&#x27;s Beeswax, a superb mustache wax.  This product provides excellent structure along with longevity and strength that will impress the masses!</li>
    <li> I use it for my edges as it holds my natural curls at bay nicely.</li>
    <li> Item was as described.  Well packaged.  I am using it to polish rocks picked up by the beach.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this as a cheap pomade alternative that would be more matte than Murray&#x27;s Original, but when I put it in my hair I found it to be just as greasy as the original Murray&#x27;s.  The smell is also odd; it smells like honey, and since it also looks like honey and has the consistency of honey, I had to get past the odd sensation that I was putting actual honey into my hair.  If you&#x27;re big into the greaser look and like your hair smelling like food, then this may be the product for you.  If not, stay away.</li>
    <li> needed straight beeswax for glass work this came in black which i was not expecting and is a hair product also unexpected will by the bar of wax next time</li>
    <li> I would give no stars to this product or this seller unless if I initially wanted a falsely advertised product. The label claims it has 100% Bees Wax yet don&#x27;t be fooled by the label. You&#x27;re better off buying a whole jar of petroleum jelly  because it mostly consist of just that- plus perfume for scent. Go to your local farmers market for beeswax or some other seller. I feel disappointed because I felt cheated and lied to :( But don&#x27;t worry about me I&#x27;ve returned this worthless product back :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to go in my home-made lotion, which I had intended to make in order to avoid fragrance, phthalates, parabens, etc. found in many store-bought lotions. Imagine my chagrin when I realized it was loaded with perfume!</li>
    <li> This is basically Vaseline with fragrance added. Bought to use as mustache wax but it didn&#x27;t hold and got everywhere. Skip it.</li>
    <li> if you note that it is actually mostly petroleum, then you won&#x27;t be disappointed thinking you are getting 100% beeswax. this product works great for cornrows or braids, smells pleasant, and lasts longer than other stuff we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This product reminds you of another well known PETROLEUM BASED pomade, Tres Flores (Three Flowers). I purchased this product thinking that I was going to get what the label states \\&quot;100% PURE AUSTRALIAN BEESWAX\\&quot;. This product, though, is PETROLEUM BASED (petroleum jelly) and has mixed in it the beeswax, so the label is a bit misleading. The product smells good enough to put in your hair, if that&#x27;s why you are buying it, but if you really wanted 100% Beeswax then this is not what you want to buy. \\&quot;amazon.com\\&quot; should list the ingredients to this product so that consumers know exactly what they are buying. I would use this product on my own head, but unfortunately I shave my head and therefore have no real use for it. I gave this product 4 stars for what it is intended for, not because I bought something I don&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> I tried them all &amp; None of the others hold better.  PERIOD.... Enough said.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be mislead.This is deceptive advertising at its worst. This is primarily Petrolatum Jelly, a by-product of the oil industry, which can suffocate pores, aggravate acne and even cause a rare form of pneumonia if inhaled according to HolisticDermatology.com.&lt;br /&gt;You can get 100% ORGANIC Hand Poured, Premium Quality, Cosmetic Grade, Triple Filtered Bees Wax for $4.80 on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend and his unruly beard lol. At first, he wasn&#x27;t a huge fan. He said it was a little too waxy and wanted something more like an oil to tame those wiry hairs. But now he uses it as like a finishing wax for his beard after her puts a little oil on. The wax helps it stay in place and the oil sort of conditions it and keeps hairs from curling and popping up weird.</li>
    <li> So disappointed that this isn&#x27;t actually 100% beeswax, had to buy from another vendor to get actual beeswax without extra crap added to it, will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> All natural product without a bunch of chemicals makes me feel more comfortable using it on my hair. I use a just a tiny bit in my curly hair and beard to give them a bit of structure and keep it all from getting too frizzy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have overly greasy or oily hair, as the primary ingredient is still petrolatum (this is a pomade, not just pure beeswax) but the beeswax keeps things from getting too greasy.</li>
    <li> Originally I was using pomade before I started using this. Just to say, this product is great! It stays in your hair for the whole day, and it actually shows layers more if you style it right!     Before I was buying around 10 dollars worth for about 2 ounces of pomade from Axe, I found this as a substitute. This is WAY cheaper, and has 3.5 ounces!    AND it works better than pomade, this product DEFINITELY is worth looking into :P    I also straighten my hair, and on humid days I found that this product keeps my hair in place very well and doesn&#x27;t POOF my hair back out :P</li>
    <li> great deal price was great and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have Asian hair, probably because I&#x27;m Asian...Anyhow, this is the best stuff out there...I researched high and low, after Radwax was discontinued and I bought all the stock available at a beauty supply shop.  Murray&#x27;s hold hair a little better than my previous stuff and I now will not fall into a deep depression over the fear of my hair looking like a worn-out toothbrush.</li>
    <li> it is exactly what i expected. doesnt smell bad which is what i was worried about bc im using it to make homeade chapstick it worked perfectly for that!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;with&amp;#34; in small print, &amp;#34;BEESWAX&amp;#34; in large print. Don&#x27;t even bother to try to deal with the supplier afterward.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Great for a fire starter.</li>
    <li> It is smooth, smells good and I used it to make lipbalm...even though my plan was to make it with pure beeswax which this is not...my fault for not reading the ingredients  Quote &amp;#34;WITH 100% Pure Australian Beeswax&amp;#34;....also petroleum (first ingredient) and fragrance:(</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way and it&#x27;s actually cheaper than making your own.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet but have heard great things about it.</li>
    <li> Only used it a couple times, so not qualified to review properly.</li>
    <li> Love it will order again.  Delivery was prompt and use this items every chance I need a tune up as they say.  Looking great</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the purchase</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Light, pliable, doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy, greasy, or stiff.</li>
    <li> This is great, pure beeswax. It&#x27;s the perfect texture and great for dreadlocks as well as other things such as chapstick etc. I would definitely recommend it just to have around!</li>
    <li> The wax has been working expertly, and I&#x27;m pleased with the light scent that accompanies it. It&#x27;s been doing very well for long days at work keeping my hair in is desired style. And it&#x27;s great, when you can say &amp;#34;no, it&#x27;s not gel. It&#x27;s 100% Austrian bees wax.&amp;#34; Most people thinks it&#x27;s rad, I do! (This is not a robot, just a happy customer.)</li>
    <li> Received on time and brand new as advertised, totally satisfied!</li>
    <li> Ideal for dread-heads to seal their locks, this stuff is also great to add texture to limp hair.  Great for use in winter, when the beating sun won&#x27;t un-do your &#x27;do!</li>
    <li> It is just what I expected without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone else,  good quality, great price !</li>
    <li> I love Murray&#x27;s Beeswax. Does wonders for all hair types. I will be purchasing from them again, very soon. Thank you. ;-)</li>
    <li> My son has chronic/severe eczema that bleeds and goes from under his arm to his waistline. I bought this because creams and gels were painful. After the 2nd application it cleared up totally</li>
    <li> I learned about using bees wax for massaging areas in a specific way from a physical therapist and found this really helpful.  It is the perfect texture when you are trying to get really deep into muscles and things without sliding over them too easily like you would with regular lotion.  I like this product so much but  found it did contain a scent that didn&#x27;t bother me if I used it on my legs but I had to be careful not get it too close to my nose or it would give me a slight headache.  Did not stain my clothes and stays smooth even after much rubbing.</li>
    <li> Top ingredient is petroleum jelly, something that isn&#x27;t clear from the product description. Not as stiff of a hold as I expected.</li>
    <li> I feel a bit sheepish giving this item a star-rating, because really I have just averaged out how it works for two very different purposes. I originally came across this when searching for &amp;#34;beard wax&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;mustache wax&amp;#34; because I now sport a goatee and handlebar. It does not work for this purpose -- it is just petroleum jelly with some beeswax in it. Putting this stuff on facial hair is not recommended, because all it does is A) Fail to hold the hair in place (it does not work as a &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34;), B) Make your hair obnoxiously shiny, C) Reek of petroleum. For this purpose it would get a one-star rating (someone may counter that it obviously was not intended for the purpose I had in mind and that hence my rating is unfair, but it does appear when searching for beard or mustache waxes, and as long as it is associated with these items, judging it by its search-result context seems reasonable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do get very dry hands and feet and sometimes to counter the dryness I will slather my hands and feet in petroleum jelly, place socks over them, and leave them overnight. For this purpose the Murrays beeswax-in-petroleum works just fine. I do not know enough about beeswax to determine if it has any added effect beyond the petroleum. If it does, all the better, if not, none the worse. For this purpose I would give the item a five-star rating. Obviously this stuff has many uses, and how you like or dislike it depends on how you intend to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But please, do not, not, not try to use it in your facial hair. You&#x27;ll just wind up shiny and greasy and smelly (for those who like happy endings, I ultimately settled for the Firehouse Mustache Wax).</li>
    <li> the smell takes some getting used to.  the waxy feeling of this product is very sticky.  you only need a little bit.  It will not hold your hair in place if you have longer hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! It took almost 2yrs for me to finish my first jar. Great product for people who want a natural and unscented styling. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Murray&#x27;s, just try it and you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use it. It has petroleum in it.</li>
    <li> Not good, strong smell!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two kind of beeswax, this one is not good. It smells strange and makes this feel non-natural even it is. So I have to through it away.</li>
    <li> A good produce.  Does what it is intended to do.</li>
    <li> This is not 100% bees wax just petroleum with some bees</li>
    <li> a dab of this on some rope threads will burn like a candle for almost an hour, need I say more?</li>
    <li> very stiff, good bead wax, smells great. A good buy for such a large quantity.</li>
    <li> Scent is a little overwhelming for my boys, but I love it!</li>
    <li> this product didn&#x27;t work with my lotion recipe. Made it too thick. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for homemade lotion. and it is stupid that amazon has a word minimum for product reviews.</li>
    <li> This beeswax is really good. It keeps your hair shiny while holding it firm which is perfect for dreadlocks.</li>
    <li> A little late review of my purchase, but I wanted to thank you for the Murray-s wax is great. Long live the rockabilly</li>
    <li> super good product for my hair!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff.  use it on everything &#x3D; equals life and shine.......great delivery and everything was good with transaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I use it to style my mustache and it works fantastically. Thumbs up! Thank you</li>
    <li> This product causes or exacerbates hair loss. Not recommended for people who want to keep their hair.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what my son needed to put onto the wooden sword that he bought at the Renessainse (sp?) Fair last summer.  Thank you so much for getting it to me so fast.  I greatly appreciate the convenience and quality.</li>
    <li> I have used this Bees wax to protect the cylinder from multiple firing on my, black powder, Colt 44. It seems excellent</li>
    <li> THIS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT I BOUGHT FOR MY BEARD, BOY WAS I MISTAKEN IT&#x27;S BASICALLY A STILL VASOLINE.</li>
    <li> Great and reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> This worked extremely well for my wilderness needs.</li>
    <li> Keeps things lightly together and in control without a heavy waxy look and feel that can flake up and not blend, like other beard and moustache waxes. I have a full beard and moustache and a little dab rubbed between my fingers and drawn over the surface of my beard tames the fly-aways the entire day and keeps my moustache out of my mouth. Then over my hair as a pomade. It might not work to hold a stubby mustache or goatee in place, but just perfect to keep a large beard buttoned down. Smells great and NOT like petroleum like another reviewer suggested. Do you think it would have this high a rating by reviewers if you were putting it on your face and it smelled like petroleum? Keeps your beard healthy and moisturized too, along with your cuticles if you rub some on them like I do.</li>
    <li> Not what it says.but I didn&#x27;t mind too much I used it for my brother dreadlocks.</li>
    <li> My hubby really likes it. It says it holds strong, has a pleasant smell, and he&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> It is petroleum jelly &amp;#34;WITH&amp;#34; bees wax. I know it&#x27;s my responsibility to read labels, but with that being said, deceptive marketing is obnoxious. The actual product has a gentle to medium hold and a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great.  I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any other was to compare with but like this item a lot.</li>
    <li> It works like it says and I don&#x27;t need much at all.  It smooths and holds down the areas I need it to and is not a problem to wash out.  At a guess a container will last me at least 2 years.</li>
    <li> I was hoping Murray&#x27;s Beeswax would be an alternative to the expensive beard-wax I&#x27;ve been buying. It is definitely not a viable alternative to proper beard-wax. I&#x27;ll explain below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is very sticky and very thick. When you scoop a bit out and rub it on your hands it does not melt and it does not thin out like beard wax. This is not a positive point as spreading the &#x27;wax&#x27; on leaves your beard covered in what is essentially petroleum jelly with a small amount of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, my beard was tamed with I put this stuff on and rubbed it in to my mustache and beard. The downside is that it makes your hair look greasy, smells terrible, and clogs pores. I will not be buying it again as a beard-wax substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;search out &amp;#34;murray&#x27;s dreadlocks&amp;#34; and you will see a review mentioning the 90/10 petroleum/wax mixture.</li>
    <li> Murray’s Beeswax gives tremendous hold and an adequate shine. There isn’t much of a shine, but what separates Murray’s Beeswax from pomade is that the beeswax gives my hair tremendous volume. The beeswax seems to enrich the thickness of your hair. Beeswax is a very healthy additive to your hair. The only downside is that this is beeswax so it is challenging to style because the beeswax is thick and dense. Beeswax also can be difficult to get to spread evenly in your hair because it is so thick. You might end of playing ‘whack-a-mole’ with parts of your hair sticking up as you comb other parts. Regardless the positives of beeswax in terms of providing hair health and overall look far outweigh the negatives.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised at this product. It turned out to be just as advertised,, very smooth and easily workable into my mustache and beard. It holds my beard/mustache very well, with a soft pliable feeling! I have no doubt that I will be a return customer! Give it a try, it really works, and you can&#x27;t beat the price or the excellent service and short time delivery! I am happy with the product!!!!</li>
    <li> As with other buyers, I had to return this because it&#x27;s not 100% pure australian beeswax. The label is very misleading. Petrolatum is the first ingredient, and there is perfume in it too. I didn&#x27;t scroll down to read what was in it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to twist my son hair although it takes a good washing to get out it work great for me my next choice will be the Murray&#x27;s Black Beeswax Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Very good for a greasy slick back rockabilly style. It smells amazing plus its really a bargain! Love it!</li>
    <li> very good hae used it quite a bit and seems ok</li>
    <li> Love this product.I have been using it for years.I use it to seal the ends of my&lt;br /&gt;Hair when I straighten it.It helps coat my ends to prevent heat damage.A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> a very nice natural beeswax!</li>
    <li> Best ever. Use for mustache. The subtle fragrance is addictive. Helps to heat with hair dryer and the put on and brush.</li>
    <li> Love Murrays Beeswax, but this was expensive compared to the price I would have paid going to the store.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Love it</li>
    <li> What does one say about the greatest hair care product ever? I went surfing during a tropical storm in Florida about ten years back and was in the water for a solid 10 hours off and on. When I got out my hair was fancy as all get out and some girls bought me dinner. If it wasn&#x27;t for Murray&#x27;s I would have bought my own dinner that night and been alone after a great day of surfing. That was ten years ago and to be honest my hair is constantly in style and conditioned to the max despite heat, sweat, humidity and activities...ahem. It is simply the best hair product for anyone looking to spike up, mess up or whatever their hair.</li>
    <li> Very good product!  Used to make several facial and foot creams.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Deceptive&amp;#34; advertising, it is not 100% beeswax, it&#x27;s made WITH 100% beeswax.  The first ingredient is petrolatum!  Don&#x27;t be deceived as I was.</li>
    <li> This is not 100 percent beeswax. Kinda irked by the label. Bc i always read the labels and with something stating its 100 percent I believe that to be true but not in this case.</li>
    <li> This beeswax is truly the best I have used. My hair looks great and even feels great. It really cleaned up my dreads. LOVE IT..</li>
    <li> The package is obviously designed  in a slightly deceptive way to make a potential buyer think, upon first glance, that it is made out of 100% beeswax. Unfortunately, it is mostly petroleum jelly (AKA vaseline). I wish I had looked more closely before opening. Works okay... if you like petroleum in your hair, on your skin, and clogging your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s organic body lotion for my hair when I want to give it shape or shine or weight. Sounds weird, I know, but it works great. Minimal ingredients, basically just plant oils with alcohol, water and xanthan gum. Works on my beard too.</li>
    <li> Works better than any hair styling product I&#x27;ve ever used, and as an added bonus this one little can lasts me forever I bought thBunningin the first week of first quarter of and I still have half a can left(it currently being the 1st week of my 3rd quarter)</li>
    <li> this stuff is great, i use this in place of gel for my hair and it holds and lasts, even holds pretty well through rigorous work outs</li>
    <li> Made of bees wax. The only item that old my hair properly and for a long time. smell just a bit (good).</li>
    <li> Was a little bit stiff for me</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who has been looking for it everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find it great price and he says it&#x27;s the only one that is not gummy and works for his hair.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little while now it works nice with my beard and it seems that it helps my skin also, we are having a cold winter in Wisconsin this year. We have had a number of days of weather temperature below zero this winter. Very nice product.</li>
