      <li>I was very pleased with the results though it took about a week to work for me.  </li>
      <li>Also loved that there are 2 packs included as well as some nice foot lotion for once you&#x27;re all done shedding.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It would have been just as effective to give my feet a good soak in warm water and use a loofah or pumice stone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very cool product -- loved watching the skin peel after a week.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is much more convenient and effective then getting pedicures.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My feet were less than perfect and this peeling mask made them look so nice!</li>
      <li>Love love love this product.</li>
      <li>Worked better than the Purederm brand</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Works as well as baby foot, and at a better price</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>When I was finally able to get my feed submerged in the peeling solution, I followed the soaking time to the minute and rinsed as directed.  </li>
      <li>OK</li>
      <li>and I was extremely happy with how fast it came.</li>
      <li>Gross but very effective!</li>
      <li>It is the best product I have used to peal off dead skin</li>
      <li>I decided to test these out in order to get free shipping on my order and</li>
      <li>After another 20 minutes there was significant peeling.</li>
      <li>My feet are nice and baby soft.</li>
      <li>It took almost a full week for them to finish peeling.</li>
      <li>Super relaxing.</li>
      <li>This took two applications to cause any sort of peeling, and the peeling was mild and lasted about three days.</li>
      <li>It takes a little longer to work than advertised (about 10 days) but it works beautifully.</li>
      <li>The 3rd night, after a good hot soak there was some peeling</li>
      <li>There is some kind of black magic voodoo in this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to find this product at a much lesser cost without losing any of the potency</li>
      <li>It was delivered super fast!</li>
      <li>applied babyfoot brand and start peeling right after and continuous...</li>
      <li>/&gt;FYI, regular nail polish gets ruined after this treatment so be sure to do this before your toes are polished.</li>
      <li>OMG that is funny.  </li>
      <li>I only wish it came with more in the pack and that there was something for hands.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of gross when your skin is peeling, but it gets your feet so soft!</li>
      <li>But took so long (more than 10 days) for everything to peel off in an unsightly way.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a competitive swimmer, so I&#x27;m constantly walking barefoot on hot, cement pool decks, standing around in chlorine, and wearing cheap flip flops.</li>
      <li>so after about 13 days of peeling, my feet are super soft.</li>
      <li>It takes a bit to start peeling (4-5 days) but it really works.</li>
      <li>Shiny foot worked just as well as baby foot at a much lower cost.</li>
      <li>The process of sitting with the boots was very comforting and relaxing</li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>You really need to fix that description.  </li>
      <li>In the end, I was left with beautifully smooth feet.</li>
      <li>There is no tenderness either just nice pink soft feet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recommended to several people who also received very fast shipment and who have expressed the same outcome and also are pleased.</li>
      <li>I gave the other to my mom and her feet peeled way more than mine.</li>
      <li>After 3-4 days you&#x27;ll start to peel, after 7-9 days you will see huge amounts of skin coming off, as long as you soak...</li>
      <li>Not worth the money, to me, although others had much more luck.</li>
      <li>So far the skin under seems nice and new and pink and soft!  </li>
      <li>I soaked my feet the night I got the package, and my feet just felt super dry for the whole week.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t waste your time and money buy baby-foot better</li>
      <li>It will take up to 10 days for the skin on your foot to shed, and if your feet are rough this could be a pretty exciting and/gross experience.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like I had bran new feet.</li>
      <li>Pro tip: soak your feet in hot water starting on day 2 or so and you&#x27;ll peel faster!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely come back for more later.</li>
      <li>Babyfoot is way better dont waste ur money on this!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much happening until day 10, I noticed the skin underneath my toes starting to peel.</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to put lotion on them and they were still soft.</li>
      <li>It kept my feel baby soft for 4 months.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt at all and the results were worth the kinda gross idea of my foot actually peeling!</li>
      <li>First, the included foot bags did not fit my feet very well at all.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised that these actually worked.</li>
      <li>The next night I soaked my feet in hot water for a half hour or so.</li>

<li> Soak 30 min before you do the peel; soak at least 30 min</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical and after about 10 days</li>
<li> Probably poor quality control as it seems to work for some and not for others.</li>
<li> /&gt;So sad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I soaked my feet the night I got the package, and my feet just felt super dry for the whole week. Until the 6 th day when I soaked them with super  hot water and they started peeling like crazy. They are currently peeling still, so I&#x27;ll update my review when it&#x27;s done. So far the skin under seems nice and new and pink and soft!  OK so after about 13 days of peeling, my feet are super soft. They feel like baby&#x27;s feet. I didn&#x27;t even have to put lotion on them and they were still soft. I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. At all. No peeling of anything whatsoever.  Probably poor quality control as it seems to work for some and not for others.</li>
    <li> Hardly did anything.  I had one day where my feet had a little dead skin peel off, but only when I exfoliated my feet.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Did not do what it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been just as effective to give my feet a good soak in warm water and use a loofah or pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;So sad. Wish it did work.</li>
    <li> My husband and I loved these while we were living in Korea. They are literally the best foot peels available. It will take up to 10 days for the skin on your foot to shed, and if your feet are rough this could be a pretty exciting and/gross experience. Your feet have stopped peeling they will look and feel amazing!</li>
    <li> I like that this pack comes with two so that I can do it again later. My feet were less than perfect and this peeling mask made them look so nice! It took about a week for my feet to start peeling. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all and the results were worth the kinda gross idea of my foot actually peeling! I will continue to purchase this and reccomend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I would give zero stars if I could. This did not work at all. I followed the instructions to the T, left the product on for 90 minutes, soaked my feet nightly and nothing happened. Absolutely nothing. I waited the two weeks. Still nothing. A month later... I am still waiting to see what happens. I would not not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Very easy to use. I was a little skeptical and after about 10 days I did start to notice my feet started peeling and after 2 weeks it&#x27;s like I had bran new feet. Definitely would recommend this product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> There is some kind of black magic voodoo in this. I used it as directed and was initially dissatisfied because i saw no results. Then 6 days later my feet peeled like a snake. I have a horrible scar on my foot that i have had since i was a child and the bottom of my foot is uneven. Some places have like 1 layer of skin. I was scared to use thus at first because i thought it would damage the thin skin but it seriously targeted only the thick dead scar tissue and dead skin it was crazy! CUSTOMER FOR LIFE</li>
    <li> This took two applications to cause any sort of peeling, and the peeling was mild and lasted about three days. Not worth the money, to me, although others had much more luck. Guess I got gorilla feet.</li>
    <li> It is the best product I have used to peal off dead skin I love it, I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and worked GREAT! Also loved that there are 2 packs included as well as some nice foot lotion for once you&#x27;re all done shedding. Worked better than the Purederm brand and I&#x27;ll definitely come back for more later.</li>
    <li> It takes a bit to start peeling (4-5 days) but it really works. It&#x27;s kind of gross when your skin is peeling, but it gets your feet so soft! Pro tip: soak your feet in hot water starting on day 2 or so and you&#x27;ll peel faster!</li>
    <li> Works 100% as promised. It kept my feel baby soft for 4 months. This is my second order. This is much more convenient and effective then getting pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, regular nail polish gets ruined after this treatment so be sure to do this before your toes are polished. I&#x27;m not sure if this ruins gel polish as well but I&#x27;m about to find out...</li>
    <li> Works just as well as Babyfoot for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> But took so long (more than 10 days) for everything to peel off in an unsightly way.  Would probably use during the winter when feet are covered up throughout the process.</li>
    <li> OMG that is funny.  You really need to fix that description.  I needed that laugh!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking you meant to say something like &#x27;Your feet and toes will peel after 3 to 5 days.&#x27; ?</li>
    <li> Works as well as baby foot, and at a better price</li>
    <li> my feet did not peel at all, even though I soaked them for 30 min for several days after the application,</li>
    <li> I have used quite a few Korean foot masks in the past with great success, Tonymoly Shiny  Foot was one of the worst, I had very little peeling.</li>
    <li> Shiny foot worked just as well as baby foot at a much lower cost. It was delivered super fast! 2 days and it was at my door. There is plenty of the liquid and it has a slight older. Nothing to awful and once you seal up the booties you can&#x27;t smell it. I soaked in the booties for an hour and 15 minutes then rinsed and washed my feet. The next night I soaked my feet in hot water for a half hour or so. Super relaxing. Soaked again the next night, still no peeling. The 3rd night, after a good hot soak there was some peeling so I warmed the water back up and soaked longer. After another 20 minutes there was significant peeling. I kept the nightly soaks up and was done peeling by the 6th or 7th day. My feet are so soft and pink on the bottom with no roughness. There is no tenderness either just nice pink soft feet. I&#x27;m thrilled to find this product at a much lesser cost without losing any of the potency and I was extremely happy with how fast it came. I&#x27;ve recommended to several people who also received very fast shipment and who have expressed the same outcome and also are pleased. Don&#x27;t spend money for the same solution.</li>
    <li> I love it and i well bay it again</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the results though it took about a week to work for me.  The process of sitting with the boots was very comforting and relaxing and I fell asleep.  The wait period for something to happen made me thing nothing was going to happen so you have to be patient.  This works great and I have recommended it to my parents.  This is especially good for men who want to do something about their feet but don&#x27;t want to go to a saloon or nail shop.  I only wish it came with more in the pack and that there was something for hands.  I have only used one of my two but I wouldn&#x27;t want to give out.  Love this.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your time and money buy baby-foot better i applied this two , yes two and nothing happened... applied babyfoot brand and start peeling right after and continuous...</li>
    <li> Babyfoot is way better dont waste ur money on this!</li>
    <li> I soaked my feet as directed for 2 hours. It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks now but I don&#x27;t see or feel any changes on my calloused feet.</li>
    <li> Greatest foot peel in existence! It takes a little longer to work than advertised (about 10 days) but it works beautifully. My feet are nice and baby soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a competitive swimmer, so I&#x27;m constantly walking barefoot on hot, cement pool decks, standing around in chlorine, and wearing cheap flip flops. My heels get extremely cracked and I know when it&#x27;s getting really bad when the roughish edges on my big toe begin to crack, too. I usually don&#x27;t have the time or memory to use heel creams, so I purchased this to see how well it&#x27;d work and how long the results would last. I followed the instructions and left the bags on my feet for a bit short of 2 hours. I didn&#x27;t see much happening until day 10, I noticed the skin underneath my toes starting to peel. By day 12, there were flakes of skin peeling off all over the bottom of my feet. It took almost a full week for them to finish peeling. In the end, I was left with beautifully smooth feet. The results lasted a solid 3 months and then I noticed the cracking in my heels returning. I used it again (this comes with 2 treatments) and had identical results.</li>
    <li> Works great!  In About 7-10 days everything peeled!  Gross but very effective!</li>
    <li> First, the included foot bags did not fit my feet very well at all.  When I was finally able to get my feed submerged in the peeling solution, I followed the soaking time to the minute and rinsed as directed.  I waited days and no change in my feet and no peeling at all to my feet.  I emailed the company and have not received a response from them.  I am so disappointed I really wanted this product to work but it did not.</li>
    <li> Very cool product -- loved watching the skin peel after a week.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that these actually worked. I have some calluses on my feet from years of cheerleading and running and since I&#x27;m a yoga teacher I hated it when someone would look at my feet. They weren&#x27;t bad but they could use a pedicure now and then. I decided to test these out in order to get free shipping on my order and wow. I followed the directions as said and within four weeks I was having some peeling going on. Thank goodness it was still boot weather so that no one saw them since you&#x27;re not supposed to peel of the skin that is flaking. However the peeling did vary. I gave the other to my mom and her feet peeled way more than mine.</li>
    <li> Soaking is the key with this stuff, just like Baby Feet. Soak 30 min before you do the peel; soak at least 30 min (a bath will work too, but not a shower) per day until your skin has peeled enough. After 3-4 days you&#x27;ll start to peel, after 7-9 days you will see huge amounts of skin coming off, as long as you soak...If you don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t complain.</li>
