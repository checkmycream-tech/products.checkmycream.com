### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a very happy customer .. and just about to buy a booster set of gels.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly.</li>
      <li>AND FOUND THE BEST BY DATE IS JANUARY 2014.  </li>
      <li>OH GREAT!  </li>
      <li>LOVE my Panda System!!!</li>
      <li>Great.  </li>
      <li>I read about the Pearl in a beauty magazine and was impressed by the ionic technology....always happy to try something new in my beauty routine!</li>
      <li>SUPER!!!</li>
      <li>It was a nice start though.</li>
      <li>And the tray comes in a nice plastic case that&#x27;s easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>oh one more word required...</li>
      <li>Glad to have backup when needed.</li>
      <li>This is better than using the strips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Tanda Pearl many times before but have never purchased from this vendor before.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use -- I just squeeze a pre-measured vial into the tray, top and bottom, and pop it in.  </li>
      <li>This system is great if you have sensitive teeth, like me.</li>
      <li>creststripes are as good and MUCH cheaper</li>
      <li>This product is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>Super!</li>
      <li>A light is activated and in five minutes goes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And the brilliant white is really better than the gentle - for me anyway.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clean, simple, painless, cost-effective way for me to keep my teeth looking great.</li>
      <li>this on really works ..in 5 days..bought refills..and you REQUIRE TOO MANY WORDS</li>
      <li>I was extremely pleased with the results I got - I absolutely LOVE the 5 minute treatment (SHORT!), no sensitivity and fantastic whitening results.</li>
      <li>The Tanda system really works better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I love beautiful white teeth - on me especially.</li>
      <li>This did not give me any discomfort, was easy to use and fast and didn&#x27;t give me any sensitivity or zingers.</li>
      <li>It is alittle pricey, but well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I am already on my second month of use and my teeth look better than ever.</li>
      <li>but I do believe this one worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>bought the Tanda system a few months ago and used it twice a day for ten days, which resulted in just beautiful results and no sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t again.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no mess, no slipping off teeth, no painful gums and is quick as can</li>
      <li>I used the product as directed and did notice a difference but expected more of a change for the price point.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t near worth the money...</li>
      <li>Also, the unit itself does not seem to be very well made.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>be.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would say this compares very well with the results I got at my dentist only at a fraction of the cost and with no pain.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This whitened my teeth a couple shades lighter but then wouldn&#x27;t whiten them any further. I wanted my teeth really really white but this product wouldn&#x27;t go all the way. It was a nice start though.</li>
    <li> this on really works ..in 5 days..bought refills..and you REQUIRE TOO MANY WORDS SO PROBABLY WILL NOT RATE  again...oh one more word required...I won&#x27;t print the 2 I am thinking of !!!!</li>
    <li> Great.  Glad to have backup when needed.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t near worth the money...creststripes are as good and MUCH cheaper</li>
    <li> This system is great if you have sensitive teeth, like me. I tend to get zingers when I use Crest Whitestrips and definitely can not handle the dentist prescribed whitening gel. This did not give me any discomfort, was easy to use and fast and didn&#x27;t give me any sensitivity or zingers. I used the product as directed and did notice a difference but expected more of a change for the price point.</li>
    <li> Returned item not what I expected even though it says KIT I did not realize I had to order other items to go with it</li>
    <li> The Tanda system really works better than anything else I have tried.  And the brilliant white is really better than the gentle - for me anyway.</li>
    <li> OH GREAT!  I purchased this on July 2, 2014.  Today, August 18, 2014 I decided to get it out and use it. AND FOUND THE BEST BY DATE IS JANUARY 2014.  How disappointing.  I&#x27;ve used Tanda Pearl many times before but have never purchased from this vendor before.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t again.  Shame on you for SELLING OUT-OF-DATE PRODUCTS.  I like to think I can trust Amazon, but this time I lost out. And NO I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use. There&#x27;s no mess, no slipping off teeth, no painful gums and is quick as can be.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I think this actually whitened my teeth noticeably. I don&#x27;t trust all the advertising for these kinds of products but I do believe this one worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> I needed refills for my Tanda whitning machine. Prices were cheaper here than any where else I looked. Average every other site was around $50</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on white strips that did nothing. I will only use this going forward. Super!</li>
    <li> As a coffee and red wine drinker I have quite a bit of experience with teeth whitening solutions from dentist trays to strips and even gum. I read about the Pearl in a beauty magazine and was impressed by the ionic technology....always happy to try something new in my beauty routine! I was extremely pleased with the results I got - I absolutely LOVE the 5 minute treatment (SHORT!), no sensitivity and fantastic whitening results. I am already on my second month of use and my teeth look better than ever. I would say this compares very well with the results I got at my dentist only at a fraction of the cost and with no pain. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> SUPER!!! LOVE my Panda System!!! YOU WONT REGRET TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM. My teeth are white, people tell me all the time &amp;#34;OMG your teeth looks so white&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This is better than using the strips. It is alittle pricey, but well worth the cost. Remember you need the device to go with this.</li>
    <li> I am still undecided over this product. It mat help white teeth, but refills are very expensive for what you get. Also, the unit itself does not seem to be very well made. Have just bought GlamWhite (not received yet) and will compare.</li>
    <li> I Followed The Instructions To Do All The Whitening In One Day. I Saw Very Little Change In The Color Of My Teeth.</li>
    <li> Call me a teeth fetishist .. I love beautiful white teeth - on me especially. I have terrible sensitivity, though, and every over-the-counter treatment I&#x27;ve tried has caused sensitivity and were quickly abandoned. I also was displeased with GoSmile. Even the stuff from my dentist a few years ago caused sensitivity and was messy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Tanda system a few months ago and used it twice a day for ten days, which resulted in just beautiful results and no sensitivity.  It&#x27;s easy to use -- I just squeeze a pre-measured vial into the tray, top and bottom, and pop it in.  A light is activated and in five minutes goes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the taste of the gel off-putting in the slightest and it&#x27;s not drippy or gross.  It&#x27;s a clean, simple, painless, cost-effective way for me to keep my teeth looking great. And the tray comes in a nice plastic case that&#x27;s easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a very happy customer .. and just about to buy a booster set of gels.</li>
