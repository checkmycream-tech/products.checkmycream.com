<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> broke after a couple use.</li>
    <li> Oh man this headband is beautiful it came on time and it came perfectly. It&#x27;s so cute just like the picture. I really do recommend this to everyone you will love it</li>
    <li> The design piece is simply glued to the headband and its not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I like this because it fits my big hair and head.  LOL  It stays put too.  I get more compliments on this than anything I own.</li>
    <li> Not much to be said, it&#x27;s probably just me and my lack of fashion ability. Something about it reminds me of scandalous sales from the back of a car...</li>
    <li> It is unfortunate it did not arrive on time for my graduation (one week ago) -- but that is my &#x27;buyer-error&#x27; for not planning ahead. However considering it was shipped internationally it arrived fairly quickly. So thank you for that.&lt;br /&gt;I must say how surprised I am that it is much lovelier than in the photo. The beading applique came curled from the packaging, but after rubber-banding it around thimble the curl has gone away. To my surprise, unlike many other headbands, this one does not cause that pinching pressure behind your ears after wearing it all day.</li>
    <li> I loved this in ended up giving this away as a gift. my coworker loved it and it looked great I her hair.</li>
    <li> I love this headband! I bought two, for me &amp; my girls! It is very pretty, nice detailed work. I&#x27;ll probably order a few more for my sister law and neice.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the winter (perhaps early in the month of December) and this review comes over half a year later: headband going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment took much longer than the anticipated two weeks, but just as I was going to contact someone about it, it arrived in the mail. A pea sized patch at the bottom center of the bead work was empty/missing beads, but not enough to stop me from wearing it. I receive compliments everywhere from men and women and children. It makes me feel special to wear it, and it goes with almost everything I put on, from casual to dressier to dinner outfits. I&#x27;m about to enter my mid 20s. I love this headband. My head is small, so elastic headbands don&#x27;t stay on and many other plastic headbands hurt by pinching my skull all day or they have the little teeth at the ends of the band that hurt behind my ears. This headband is the first one to both feel just great and stay on my head. One strange thing, however, was that I wore it through the airport in June 2013 and it set off the metal detector. I didn&#x27;t realize it had any metal in it, but perhaps the band is metal (wrapped in black ribbon). The band is thin and dark, which blends into my hair so much so that my boss asked where I found such a unique hair ornament (she thought it was a clip).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very inexpensive, so some unfortunate girl or woman probably made it and earned no liveable wage for doing the job, but the negative reviews were not enough to deter me from trusting the good ones. No beads have fallen off yet and I have worn it often and sometimes for days on end. The actual pattern lies pretty flat, so I have no problem pulling sweater hoods or layers over the product. The beads are strung with what looks to be strong elastic thread, the clear kind that you find at jewelry/craft stores, and it&#x27;s all attached on a solid piece of strong felt, which is held to the headband by a sewn-on tag that reads, \\&quot;Handmake.\\&quot; I love seed beads as it is, and the color theme ofthis headband makes it come together. It&#x27;s cute and sophisticated at the same time. I&#x27;m definitely going to order another one with my next Amazon purchase, maybe two, because it really makes me happy to wear it.</li>
    <li> Well made I wear it everyday and you can&#x27;t beat the price I bought it without seeing it, it is just  perfect ht goes with anything I wear thank you</li>
    <li> Arrived over a month later, and the beaded part completely fell off the headband as soon as I opened the package, as though it was poorly glued on</li>
    <li> Very attractive, the appearance is high quality and it seems sturdy.</li>
    <li> Started coming apart before too long. Guess I should have expected as much for the price.</li>
    <li> I liked it in the picture, but the wing is bigger than I thought and I am not a fan of it on me head.</li>
    <li> Looked great at the wedding I bought it for! Then it fell apart the next day :(</li>
    <li> I really like this hairband.  It looks lovely on my daughter.  Well make and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it. Its a hair clip not a headband. I wish they made right side and left side so that if you part to one side or the other, you can pick which one you like.</li>
    <li> It is so pretty that I got literally 4 compliments from work and school as the first day I wore it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute - doesn&#x27;t hurt my head - got complements.  I like the design and it&#x27;s fun to wear during the day or a night out.</li>
    <li> Beautiful but a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not one for headbands, I don&#x27;t like my head to feel restricted. this head band is a thin metal, with rubbery stoppers on the ends, it can be easily bent into shape if it feels too snug. it arrived in one piece, a little folded over but after wearing it for an hour it looks just like the photo. the colors are amazing and it could go with about anything. wish there were more designs like this cause I&#x27;d buy them all!</li>
    <li> I just got this head band the other day, it&#x27;s very very cute, the wing looks as though its hand beaded, its got a good weight to it, and it fits beautifully, it will be great to wear when I want to be fancy, not quite good for everyday use, but it&#x27;s still really great!</li>
    <li> bought two of them and gave one as a gift , just love this head band it goes well if your wearing geans or dress,</li>
    <li> Very pretty with a nice holding band, will dress up any outfit. It&#x27;s fairly light and by sitting on the side, it makes a nice, unexpected sparkle. Shipping takes a while but the price makes it worthwhile.</li>
    <li> very hard to tell by the picture alone but a wonderful surprise at how beautiful the beading is on this piece. looks great with my hair up or down. even my sister loves it and &amp;#34;borrows&amp;#34; it from me every chance she gets.</li>
    <li> I love this comfortable and classy headband! It adds a simple and elegant touch to an outfit, and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as described and is very pretty. It actually has better color when you get it. Shipping was a little slow but it arrived before the expected date.</li>
    <li> Received before expected and looks as described.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Looks great with the dress that I needed accessories for. Highly Reccomend for anyone.</li>
    <li> This headband is really cute! It actually looks better in person than it does on the pictures. I was surprised that for almost 2 bucks I had gotten a headband that was well made. The beads didn&#x27;t come off which to be honest I thought they would. Everything was perfect on that headband. I wear it from time to time and I always get compliments. It&#x27;s also very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t irritate the back of my ears like the other ones I have so that&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
    <li> Nice, but, I little bit uncomfortable behind the ears.</li>
    <li> I like this product. quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
    <li> I wear this head band three or more times a week.  It is beautiful.  And designed for comfort.  Thank you.  Quit shipping</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this style of headband.  My hair has been falling out due to some tumors I had removed in my throat.  It looks really pretty on and it takes away the attention I would have received on the neck scar.  I will definitely purchase a different design in this style.</li>
    <li> The beading is nice . Customer service is helpful and understanding.  The price is good.  It&#x27;s great to wear to work or church.</li>
    <li> Made for the size of a child&#x27;s head. That detail should be disclosed before selling.</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure if this headband would come out being sturdy or cheaply made since the price was so good. Considering it came from over seas, it showed up very fast. And, the quality is very nice. If I were to buy this in a store around here, Indiana, it would probably cost $15 or more. The beadwork is sewn in tightly and has very pretty coloring to it. The headband itself is stiffer and not cheap plastic. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a black covered thin head band with lovely decorative attachment. It is basically as it appears in photo. I don&#x27;t usually wear bands, but this fits well without being too tight because it is slender. The &#x27;phoenix wing&#x27; is well made and large yet coloring is subtle enough to make this a useful hair accessory that goes with a lot of different clothes. Can be worn casually or as dress up.</li>
    <li> It is so pretty!  And what a bargain it&#x27;s worth the gamble.  Mine arrived in really good condition.  It does take a really long time to ship from Hong Kong though, so I wouldn&#x27;t order it hoping for it to come any sooner than 4 weeks.  Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t crush my head much like most headbands.</li>
    <li> Got one wear off this before it fell apart!</li>
    <li> It does not look as pretty or as nice in person. However, it is still unique and was cheap. /</li>
    <li> This is a pretty headband.  It is large and, unless you are a bold girl, you may have a difficult time pulling it off for daily use.</li>
    <li> The beading started to unravel the day after it arrived. Never got a chance to really wear it. It&#x27;s sort of uncomfortable and the sides bend in from the packaging. I just use it when cleaning house to keep the hair out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> when i received the headband, it was very folded over. however the beading is very beautiful and stylish. i hope it will straighten out by the time i give it away as a gift! shipping was great</li>
    <li> Not my everyday wearing. It&#x27;s ok if you want to dress up for a Halloween around your neighborhood somewhere. Just make sure your neighbor don&#x27;t know who you are.</li>
    <li> Very pretty piece but it fell apart in the package before it was even delivered. Very poor quality. The bead work was nice but if you buy it be aware you&#x27;ll probably want to buy  tube of super glue to go with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my teenage niece, she thought it was really pretty.  There were not issues with it.</li>
    <li> This head band is not good but I guess I get what u pay for. Wish it would not fall apart so easy</li>
    <li> for young teen or adult straight from wrapper to head she loved it awesome could see i nailed it thank you</li>
    <li> Love it!! Beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself a couple years ago.  Liked it so much and get so many compliments, ordered another for myself and two more for my nieces.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and free shipping.  Only gave 4 stars because it does take about a month to receive.  Wanted to give along with other Christmas gifts but didn&#x27;t make it in time.</li>
    <li> Great for a dollar. Shut the front door. Its cute and doesn&#x27;t squeeze my brain. Super cute headband. Recommend buying</li>
    <li> I really liked this vintage Phoenix. I would purchase another on if it was made with silver beads. Very nice</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the price, but I think it would be best for a small or child&#x27;s head. I had a headache within moments of putting it on. I like it enough to buy a new headband and glue the wing to it.</li>
    <li> This is made of felt, fairly good construction.  The beads are pretty, a lot more gold/orange in appearance in person.  It&#x27;s just lame that the design is so far on one side of the head.  The other side looks naked.  This is something a girl would wear, not a woman. But it&#x27;s well priced so I don&#x27;t feel bad, and may still wear it.</li>
    <li> After waiting almost a month after ordering this to my surprise after opening the package the item is what is advertised. I won&#x27;t lie I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to try it on but it really does seem to look cuter on this model than up close. The colors follow as gold, purple, blue and hints of green. The colors are not overwhelming though and fit all together nicely. But on the downside it does seem that some the beads can fall off at any small pull. Which could be an easy fix if you can find the beads after they go missing. But otherwise the only other thing I noticed about this was in the picture it shows the wing at more of an angle and longer but the one I received seems to not curve as much. Yes, it being hand made it&#x27;s understandable it&#x27;s the only part that I am disappointed about.</li>
    <li> I love the design, but the decorative piece broke off after wearing it a few times.</li>
    <li> its a cute piece. when I received it needed some TLC. its all together just a fun piece looks good</li>
    <li> Beautiful item on line but arrived bent. The item doesn&#x27;t fit properly due to the condition of the band itself. This would have been a beautiful piece</li>
    <li> it as described, affordable, looks durable, will recommend to friends and family.  I had minor damage, but nothing too big..  lovely piece to wear!</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described. Beading is really nice, and it looks well made. My new favorite accessory! Shipping was within time frame promised, too.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted!  I was worried it wasn&#x27;t going to be as nice as the picture because it was so inexpensive, but the beading is nice and the headband is even wrapped in ribbon.  I feel I got a great buy.</li>
    <li> i mean its alright nothing worth you spending your money on SAVE YOUR MONEY to be honest IT LOOKS BETTER ON THE WEBSITE THEN IN PERSON.</li>
    <li> I like it it was more then what i expected thank you for the good services and i like to give 5 stares</li>
    <li> This product is very cheap. It fell apart as soon as I put it on my head</li>
    <li> I find this home made item to be made with a lot of good quality,&lt;br /&gt;and time put into it. I also received  a lot of&lt;br /&gt;compliments when wearing. I would purchase from this seller&lt;br /&gt;again, and would advise others to do so to !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,</li>
    <li> This headband is so cute. It fits nicely, and looks durable. &amp;#34;Handmade&amp;#34; written on the tag gives me a sense of comfort. Because of the color scheme of the headband, I have found it difficult to accessorize it with jewelry. But, that&#x27;s not the fault of the seller and my five stars still stand.</li>
    <li> I know it shows it in the picture, but this headband is large. It is a bit more colorful than it looks in the picture too. It is hand beaded, and the beadwork is nice. Also a very comfortable headband.</li>
    <li> i loved this headband exspecially for the price and it got to me quicker than expected. i am upset because it did unravel edventually but it was very cheap. it came to me in great condition as well</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s maintained it&#x27;s shape and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart. The beading was stitched on well. the headband is loose and doesn&#x27;t dig into my head. I do have a small head, however.</li>
    <li> This hairband was a gift for my niece. She was so happy when she got it, she wore it to school the very next day.</li>
    <li> This headband not only was inexpensive it is well made the band is wrapped in ribbon and the Angel claw has really beautiful beads pretty colors the wing is held together good and looks far better in person than in the picture was worth every cent</li>
    <li> It was really pretty and looks put together fairly well. Nice quality for how little I paid for the band.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty and as pictured but since it was in a flimsy package the felt sequin wing was somewhat bent and coming off of the band. All it needed was some glue and I had to reshape the wing but since it&#x27;s a wing it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be flat on my head. Overall you get what you pay for and I was happy with the price since I like metal headbands as they&#x27;re more sturdy. (The actual band is metal with a wrapped ribbon around it.</li>
    <li> The hairband looks exactly like the image posted, it&#x27;s very nice. it&#x27;s cheaply made, and fits small over my head but overall it was a good deal. Would I recommend? Yes</li>
    <li> I love the Phoenix design. The beading is great, but the fact that I had to alter to continue to wear it was expected, but disheartening, none the less. Many other reviewers claimed that the applique doesn&#x27;t stay on. It&#x27;s true. The applique is hot-glued on, which works for a little while, but not permanently. Hair products (Sprays, oils &amp; lotions) tend to weaken the glue &amp; cause it to come off. I ended up sewing a few points of the applique to the band, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since. It&#x27;s a beautiful piece, but only crafters or people who are willing to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; this should purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this, for the price it is an amazing piece , would definitely buy more  if there are other designs.</li>
    <li> Cuter in the pics here I think. Little small for my head but going to try to wear it again soon anyway - give it one more try after having stretched it some.</li>
    <li> Rare hair decoration while still being super attractive.  It&#x27;s very classy and can be worn on even the most formal occasion.</li>
    <li> This broke right after taking it out of the packaging. My daughter wanted another one so I ordered another and it arrived broken. Not worth the time or money.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this piece in the mail because it just looked so unique and pretty. However because of the glue used to apply the beaded wing to the head band, which I have to assume was either cheap or poorly applied, and the way it was folded into the small envelope for shipping, when I received it the beaded wing was all but falling off of the headband. Although the price was really great, I could not wear it when I received it. Very disappointed is really all I can say about this purchase.</li>
    <li> Just received my order of this product today. Although it looks slightly different from what is pictured I just love it! The colors and richer and deeper and will complete any of my outfits. The design, at least on my head, is a bit higher on the band so it looks just perfect! It does take a while for this product to reach you since it&#x27;s shipped from Hong Kong but it&#x27;s soo worth it! Would most definitely recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> this headband was forced into  a way too small envelope and the beading was crushed as well as missing lots of beads. very disappointed</li>
    <li> You cannot beat the price. It is beautiful in person. Came intact and as described! Love it. It shouldve bought more for gifts!</li>
    <li> The headband is a unique accessory to switch up my hair.  I just had a baby and was bored of just using hair clips.  It did come unglued from the headband, but I was able to glue it back on with no problem.  That is my only issue.  The hand made beading itself has stayed together and is beautiful.  It was worth a couple dollars and I get compliments on it often.</li>
    <li> I love this! Its really cute and can be worn with practically anything. Maybe my head is big, but it was too small initially and was pinching my head! After bending it a bit, its just fine.</li>
    <li> Ever since I received this, there hasn&#x27;t been a day in which I haven&#x27;t worn it. Although I still need to find jewelry to match this, the headband matches and adds to many of my outfits that I put on. It is splendid to wear in many occasions. I had some doubts on whether it would hold when I was buying it. Now, I don&#x27;t have any; it seems pretty sturdy and will continue to hold for a long time.</li>
    <li> This headband is cute, but it broke the first time I wore it. Very flimsy, wish I could wear it.</li>
    <li> This head band is just as indicated in the ad. As with most headbands, it stretches to your head size and the beads you just have to make sure lie flat on your head, not tucked under. Great look, and different!</li>
    <li> very pretty and unique hair headband, would look good morning or night and for girls or women to wear, great gift item</li>
    <li> the beads are NOT in the same place.  It is more like in the middle which make it look awful when you put it on.  I also had to iron the beads to make it look straight.</li>
    <li> I really like it for the price but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy anything like this again. I wore it a couple times, but it isn&#x27;t stiff enough to stay the right shape, curls up a bit.</li>
    <li> This was seriously my favorite hair accessory when I bought it, but it sadly fell apart with time, so I&#x27;m buying another!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute and comfy, looks great with curly hair, and goes with so many articles of clothing I own!</li>
    <li> no a fan too dark and not tight enough to really hold your hair down plus the ornament bended durin g shipping and has not straightened out,</li>
    <li> This Phoenix (or angel) wing headband is really pretty.  The band is comfortable and the wing is nicely done--not cheap looking at all.  The beads are small and very well placed.and the whole thing is elegant.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> very pretty and fits my big head without giving me a headache. I&#x27;ve had it on for 4 hours without complaint!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s handmade but you can&#x27;t tell that it is. It&#x27;s about the same size as it looks in the picture, I really do like it but I can never find anything to wear it with and I wore it in public maybe 4 times. It&#x27;s also a hair color thing, it looks better with darker hair(ever since I went blonde, I can&#x27;t use it) So if you don&#x27;t have dark hair, the gold will just set it off and it won&#x27;t look good.</li>
    <li> Save yourself from disappointment. It&#x27;s costs less than $2 because it&#x27;s just junk.  Plus waiting 6 weeks or more for it to arrive.  Just keep moving literally nothing worth seeing here.</li>
    <li> I love this headband. It is coated with soft fabric to make it very easily to wear. It is well made and the price made it a real steal.</li>
    <li> I like the look of the headband...only thing is, is that the wing for mines is upside down...I guess i&#x27;ll have to fix it and turn it around...but the beading is very pretty...this also took a long time for my tastes...however the price and how it looks makes it all worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I love the hair band and my niece will love it even more.  She will be visiting soon from Iowa and I will be suprising her with many of the items I have bought from Amazon.  So far I am very pleased.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Wore it once and the decorative part fell off. I don&#x27;t mind, but really? I don&#x27;t do much with my hair so there is no way it could have fallen off because of something I did.</li>
    <li> This item came broken and the top was unattached to the headband. I was very unhappy when I unpackaged this product.</li>
    <li> The Vintage Bling Phoenix Wing Angel Beads HairBand Hoop Claw makes a classy statement. Perfect for the most festive  event.</li>
    <li> I liked this headband a lot! The sequined area looks nicely made but the ribbon circling around the headband itself started unraveling the first time I wore it. Nothing a little glue didn&#x27;t fix but still...&lt;br /&gt;Fits a little snug but I have a big head.</li>
    <li> I bought this headband at the same time I bought another headband, which turned out to be a mistake. I was worried, since both headbands were from the same seller in Hong Kong, that this piece, like the other, would just fall apart. Happy it hasn&#x27;t! The actual band is very thin but it stays put nicely, and the beaded feather bit -- while glued on -- cups the skull in an almost 1920&#x27;s sort of way. I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments on it every single time I&#x27;ve worn it, and I&#x27;ve found it can be paired with a lot of different styles and other pieces.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on it every time I have warn it. It looks great with a nice( or messy) bun/ponytail. I usually wear it with a nice side braid in the front of my hair and this goes on the other side to balance the braid. It&#x27;s extremely cute and for the price, is a must have. Too a bit to get here (as it was coming from China), but again... for the price, not complaining. I would definitely recommend. Could be warn with Casual and formal wear.</li>
    <li> This came a bit twisted and crumpled I had to weigh it down with a book for a couple of days to get the decoration to work.</li>
    <li> Love the hair band. It looks great and it was cheap. It makes your hairstyle look so much more fancier.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful &amp; unique design!  Fast shipping.  Excellent seller.....A+/5*!!!</li>
    <li> Falls apart after a few uses, you will have to re-glue it together. If you dont mind that, it is beautiful and generates tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> Came on time all the way from China! No complaints! Fits my rather small but thick-haired head! I have black hair, and I think it adds a nice, dressy touch when I am trying to dress up for a party.</li>
    <li> Not for large heads like mine (lol), but since my hair is short I can still wear it. The beading is beautiful!</li>
    <li> this headband is super cute. i got it over 3 months ago and its still in perfect conditions and i wear it all the time</li>
    <li> Wow if I knew it would be this long almost a month to get this item I would never had brought it the shipping time is not good and I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering from this company again ...Not happy and the event I needed it for came and went and I still dont have the product that sucks</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for is all I can say about this hair ornament. Looks pretty in picture but is cheap packaged and product.</li>
    <li> Ordered this on a whim, because it was under two dollar with free shipping, so what did I have to lose?  Glad I did...beautiful and comfortable.  It took a long time to arrive, but that was already expected.  A good purchase.</li>
    <li> The design is lovely but the execution is terrible. The beads started coming apart the second I took the headband out of the packaging. The ribbon around the base was also coming a part. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting your time buying this product.</li>
    <li> I will not buy another one. It broke the same day I got it. The ribbon that covers it unraveled. You have to be extra careful putting it on.</li>
    <li> I like this so far. I haven&#x27;t worn it for very long, so I don&#x27;t know if the edges will hurt behind my ears, but I like the way it looks. The wing is really interesting.</li>
    <li> It is gorgeous!  The pic doesn&#x27;t do it justice.  Came just in time for summer so I can put my bangs back off of my face and enhances my look for the day.  I feel pretty even though I&#x27;m just in shorts and a tank top.</li>
    <li> very pretty and does not look cheap. Bead work is nice. A little darker than immage shown. Looks nice :</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute. I didn&#x27;t realize I was getting fabric. I thought it was going to be metal. Even so, still a cute piece. Headband could use to be a little longer.</li>
    <li> I have to say I don&#x27;t have a lot that matches this item. It is very cute. The fabric is soft. The beads are coming off after only wearing it one time. Still good for the price.</li>
    <li> Its ok ..But you can purchase something like this in a drugstore ..LOL</li>
    <li> Not that great. Dissapointed. Not so much sparkle. The band will not hold up, too thin. Will not tell friends.</li>
    <li> It is very pretty. I got so many compliments when I wore this headband. My daughter took it for herself.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful and cheap,  I like using it, makes you look more cute thank you very much, xoxo .</li>
    <li> This was nice. I thought it would have more color to it, but it was still well made.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This headband was beautiful!! The only problem was the packaging, which was poor, and the beadwork was bent in places, once I reshaped the headpiece, it fit fine and looked amazing!! Well worth the price!!</li>
    <li> this is a nice hair band. It looks really nice on the person that I got it for. She enjoys it.</li>
    <li> Love it. It really feels comfortable and looks great. The price was amazing. I would purchase any items like this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, and of o.k. quality considering the price.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> The only thing I received was the package with nothing in it.</li>
    <li> I bought a second hairband like  this because I wanted a back-up.  I get compliments on this almost every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> I had to wait for the right occasion, but for a cocktail party this headband was a hit. The band of course blends right into your hair, and the &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; looks like a beautiful, 1920s era barrette. I could never wear an actual barrette of this size since it would slide right out of my fine hair, so the elegant look of this piece was a great find for me.</li>
    <li> This item did not look like the picture when it arrived.  It was crowded into the mailer, causing it to be creased because it was made of felt-like material. I had expected something more substantial.</li>
    <li> The headband is super poor quality and cheaply constructed. The angle beads started pulling apart from the band the first day.</li>
    <li> I guess that you get what you pay for..the wings were unattached to the band. It took almost a month to arrive but i guess i was ok with that..</li>
    <li> This hairband is lovely and fits well. It arrived quickly and was well packaged. I look forward to wearing it &amp; recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered this headband.  It it one of my favorites. I get lots of complments when I wear this  headband.</li>
    <li> very cute headband.  The colors of the beads are very pretty. Add a little sparkle to your hair with this headband. The headband was comfortable, no pointing behind the ears, and it stays in place.</li>
    <li> A nice adornment any lady would like for her hair. Wasn&#x27;t kept waiting an excessive amount of time before it arrived, either.</li>
    <li> All of the products I have received from this company has come in a very timely manor. I was hesitant since they were coming from Overseas put the quality is gorgeous! I have gotten many compliments while wearing it!</li>
    <li> I received this hair band and the angel wing was bent and th beads fell off durig transit. I didn&#x27;t boher returning beause it would of cost me more than what i paid for it.....so I just tossed it out. Remember you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is really cute but it was missing a couple of beads and the applique came off of the headband immediately. I fixed it with some glue and it&#x27;s super cute. For the price I&#x27;m pretty pleased overall.</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM__A ND PRICED FINE....may reorder if I can find source  makes a nice gift all year round especially the price</li>
    <li> This head band is very pretty in person. The band itself is very sturdy metal and the decal(?) part is very big. So its a bold piece and I like it!</li>
    <li> Very nice headband and it is so cheap! Be gentle with it due to the beading, but overall looks great.</li>
    <li> The beaded feather-thing just peeled away from the headband to about halfway down after a day of wearing it.</li>
    <li> I love the band I&#x27;m a head band girl and this on is very, very pretty looks really nice</li>
    <li> bead work was falling off headband when I recieved not worth time or money to return.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is beautiful! But when I gave it to my wife on Christmas Eve, some of its little beads started to fall off. I was able to fix it with a couple dabs of super glue and all is well now. I have bought other products from this company and they have been AWESOME..just a tad disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a beaded headband with some 20s/30s style on a budget, look no further. This headpiece took a while to arrive since it is shipped from Hong Kong, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality when I opened the package. the headband itself is the same thin metal band covered in black ribbon used by similar pieces on Amazon, and the beaded part itself is about 3/4 the size of the &amp;#34;Alilang Artisan Made Brown Autumn Crystal Beaded Band Loud Hair Accessory Piece Headband&amp;#34; I also ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these two products is very similar. The beads all stayed on and the headband stayed in place for both me and a friend throughout a party. The headband pinched my head a bit giving me a headache, but that is a common problem I have with almost any headband (I wear glasses, which puts extra pressure on the band behind my ears.</li>
    <li> This headband is absolutely beautiful. It is not as well made as I hoped but it looks beautiful on, especially with your hair down. The beads are very delicate so I would advise to place it in a safe place. I have no complains. For the price it&#x27;s great. I will be ordering more of these.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product. I appreciate that I wore it for hours without discomfort. I received the item quickly in the mail which I was not expecting so that was a bonus too.</li>
    <li> The headband itself is pretty, something I could have probably purchased in my local dollar store. It arrived completely smashed into a tiny envelope all bent. The decoration came detached and I had to glue it back together.  Not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> This worked for awhile until the flower fell off. Very nice looking and versatile.</li>
    <li> Great price, awesome product, fast delivery. I have bought 4 en total. Everytime that someone sees me, they wanted it. So i give it to them And order more</li>
    <li> i really liked this headband and have decited to match my prom dress with it. the colors are rich and eye catching. have had no problems!</li>
    <li> This is so pretty! It is definitely worth the wait being shipped to you. The headband is a bit short though, so it would fit a child better than an adult, but with a few pins to keep it in place, it wouldn&#x27;t be too noticeable, either. Definitely worth trying to see if it would work for you.</li>
    <li> This this a very cute and stylish headband! It fits perfectly and can be worn with straight or curly hair; also cute with an updo. The beadwork is beautiful!</li>
    <li> Got this to wear to a New Year&#x27;s Eve party and it looked lovely! Just the right amount of jewel in my hair!!</li>
    <li> My headband arrived right on time. It looks great. The decorated piece falls nicely on the head. I would buy another in a different array of colors.</li>
    <li> Just like advertised!! Other people say it&#x27;s too small for their head, but it fits perfectly for me!</li>
    <li> The package appeared to have bent the design.</li>
    <li> This headband is perfect for my small head.  The beaded applique is holding up well.  The actual headband is wrapped in black ribbon and is glued down very well.  I wear glasses and the headband doesn&#x27;t interfere with the frames resting behind my ears.  All in all, good buy.</li>
    <li> This headband is very comfortable and pretty.  The workmanship is really nice, I&#x27;m impressed. Great buy for what little I paid for it  :)</li>
    <li> I AM GLAD TO HAVE FINALLY RECEIVED IT. GORGEOUS BEADWORK AND COMFORTABLE TO WEAR. WELL MADE AND VERY RICH LOOKING. ENJOY!</li>
    <li> This one is my favorite and it looks great</li>
    <li> Appliqué was not properly attached.  Nothing that a little hot glue couldn&#x27;t fix for the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> I love head bands, in fact I kind of have started a mini collection of sorts. This piece is so elegant and fun I was more than happy to add it to the collection!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! my only problem is that the beaded part came off, easy fix with some glue .</li>
    <li> pretty beading, fell right off the band right out of the package. something a little super glue cant fix but meanwhile i like to pretend im back in the 80s and wearing this on top of a big shoulder padded blazer with fringe hanging off as appliques. he he</li>
    <li> Had a lot of compliments on this one.</li>
    <li> I love the detail on this headband, it has beautiful beading and a lovely shape.  It came quickly considering the distance it had to travel to get to me in the USA.  My one complaint about the product is: while the quality of the decoration is great and beautiful, it is not attached very well to the felt that attaches to the headband.  I plan on doing some hand sewing on it to remedy this and otherwise am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my granddaughter. She was very pleased. I really like the beading and it stays on without being too tight.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!! The picture does not do this justice! It is so pretty, came quick and was packaged good. I can wear it easily with my curly hair and looks great with the colors. It is much prettier than it looks, and has a great construction. Will last for many outfits!!! It is a great buy, and well recommended.</li>
    <li> This is was delivered within the guaranteed timeframe. However, once it arrived I wore it one time before it fell apart. It was definitely priced well because it was cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Love this head band. I get complements all day long. It doesnt hurt my head, its super comfy. Good quality. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the headband !! Had to steam it but no problems when wearing it. You will get your momeys worth out of it</li>
    <li> WHEN I RECEIVED THIS ITEM I LAUGHED AND GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER FOR HER PLAYDOLL, THIS WAS A JOKE ON ME FOR WASTING MY MONEY</li>
    <li> it is not worth . it looked so cheap. I would never buy it again, never. For that amount I think you can buy a good hair band in walmart or target.</li>
    <li> This is almost as pretty as pictured. It does seem a little smaller than the picture but I really like it. I should have ordered more than one because my teenagers are fighting over who gets to wear it first. I would have given it a higher rating if the colors were a little better, but for the price it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Very pretty, can&#x27;t believe it only cost under $2!  I was expecting somethig much cheaper looking but it&#x27;s very pretty.  My 4 year old loves wearing it. It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s not too heavy but it&#x27;s not too light either</li>
    <li> The product was not quite what I expected,  but it is pretty. It will serve the.purpose for which I bought it.  It took a long time to arrive, but I will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Cute but ribbon on headband fell off within a minute of opening it</li>
    <li> I love this headband and got alot of compliments on it. I almost deducted a star due to the item taking almost a MONTH to arrive, but it was such a cheap price, so, you know...</li>
    <li> Received it on time. It is so beautiful. Matches my bracelet. Will stay good in my hair as it has grips.</li>
    <li> its cute but the beaded piece is too heavy for the band so i had to re glue to thicker band</li>
    <li> Vintage Bling Phoenix Wing Angel Beads HairBand Hoop Claw Handmade Headband is cool , i love it and people stop me and ask me where i got it!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. The design is pretty. I got lots of compliment for it. Wear it everyday now</li>
    <li> It actually takes a while to come in, but its handmade so you can definitly brag about that. I just dont like how the glue kinda peeks out of the seems. Other than that its very cute.</li>
    <li> Great headband for the price and showed up earlier then expected.  For the Low price I didn&#x27;t expect much but the headband has survived multiple wears and being thrown around in my over stuffed purse.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! And for under $2, how can you go wrong! It did take little while to get here but its worth it, so order in advance. I purchased it for a costume party and it came on time.</li>
    <li> Most head bands tend to hurt my head behind my ears but this one is different.  Its soft enough to mold to my head without pain and looks amazing</li>
    <li> i thought this was a cute gift i could give to my niece. unfortunately as soon as i opened the package, the wing had already fallen off of the headband. plus it took much longer than expected to be delivered. cheap junk.</li>
    <li> Although the embellishment is really gold, it is still very cute and fitting. I wish it came in more colors.</li>
    <li> I ordered (3) of these.  My order arrived quickly and well- packaged.&lt;br /&gt;The headbands are truly beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;They look nice on the head as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.  Great gift item.</li>
    <li> I received my bling hairband today and I immediately tried it on.  It is so stunning and well made.  I can&#x27;t wait to wear it to work tomorrow.  I never had a hairband so pretty.</li>
    <li> This was much better than expected.  At the same time I bought 4 from a US store and they were material, no stiffening inside and $9.99 each.  They were returned and looking for more from this place.</li>
    <li> I received my hair band by May 3rd. and am very pleased with it. It&#x27;s comfortable and looks lovely in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Candy in VA</li>
    <li> but now I have it and soooo happy!!!:) Everyone says it is cute!! It didn&#x27;t fit my head, I fixed it. now I can enjoy it!!</li>
    <li> very pretty need to make more in different shape looks very good.......I would buy again thanks so much&lt;br /&gt;very pretty&lt;br /&gt;people said how pretty this was&lt;br /&gt;color good&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> The headbands are beautiful and at a great price. They make excellent party favors. I had placed various orders with them and they had done a wonderful job until the last order I placed which didn&#x27;t arrive. They eventually replaced the items after several attempts.</li>
    <li> This is made of beautiful beads on black felt. It holds my hair back very well. And again the beads pick up the lights so well, I was sitting in the truck waiting for my husband the other day and a lady knocked on my window and said she had to know where to get one. I love getting compliments on the things I buy from Amazon. This will go with anything. I wear it with casual clothes and also wear it when I dress up.</li>
    <li> This is an attractive and unusual item.  I purchased it to save for Christmas gift giving.  The price was great with no extra shipping fees and fast service.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful and though I haven&#x27;t worn it yet I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  A good buy for sure.</li>
    <li> Cute piece for really great price. Has a vintage feel into it!</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this one for second time because i lost the first one and i really like it!!!:) is so nice!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really pretty! I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  It only cost around $2 bucks, worth it!</li>
    <li> Is not want it looks like in the picture. Made very cheaply. Color cheap cheap. In a nutshell no no.</li>
    <li> This headband was gorgeous in the photos and in the hair!!! Very awesome to have and give as a gift!!</li>
    <li> I love this headband. I bought one, and then got so many compliments and was so happy with the quality that I have just recently bought a second one. The quality is that of an item that costs much more. It does take a while to ship however, to keep that in mind!</li>
    <li> This hair band is very soft and comfortable. The fit is perfect. It is not too tight but stays in place. The beading is so pretty that just putting on this hair band dresses up any look.</li>
    <li> CUTE! But not EVEN close to the pic. I wore it once and then put it away, only for it to look misshapen after the fact. So yeah. I still have it and have yet to wear it again in these 2 years. Still cheap tho.</li>
    <li> beads had fallen off very poorly made</li>
    <li> Was cloth not sturdy. Came bent out of shape and looked cheap.</li>
    <li> What a great deal for a gorgeous headband.  My daughter loves it.  She loves very &amp;#34;roaring 20s&amp;#34; with it on.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful headband.  It arrived a little &amp;#34;rumpled,&amp;#34; but as soon as you put it on and position it, it looks lovely.  The beads all seem pretty secure so far.  The shipping does take a long time because of where it&#x27;s coming from, so don&#x27;t buy it for an event you have this month.  It&#x27;s worth the wait though, so buy it for your future outfits :)</li>
    <li> Received my hair accessories the day after writing my previous review. Love this product,  fitted perfectly over my hair as I do wear a full weave. I would definitely purchase more of the same hair accessories for the spring coming up. Great product, no joke, the style of this really does carries a vintage look with rustic vibrant colors.  Love, love, love my purchase. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to share.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this headband. For the price, I think it is cute and a lot of fun. Because it is called &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; I supposed I didn&#x27;t expect it to be made entirely from small beads-- but it isn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; or rhinestones or anything. Still cute and fun for an inexpensive accessory.</li>
    <li> very pretty, but I haven&#x27;t even worn it yet and I have to re-glue it first.  But for the price, it was good.</li>
    <li> This headband is not the strongest, but it is stylish as heck. It compliments my natural/kinky hairstyles very much. Great Buy!</li>
    <li> Good Price and was definitely worth the wait (Keep in mind that its coming from Hong Kong).  I wish they had more designs because I would buy more. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants dress up a casual outfit or wear for the night out.</li>
    <li> broke the first time i put it on</li>
    <li> angry, never reached my headband, my delivery was the 8th of September to 24 September, today is October 10 and nothing, do not buy things here no PROVIDED! not recommended scammers</li>
    <li> the headband is well designed and it does not fit the head tight,at the edges has a secure wrap so nothing presses against the back of the ears to hurt it.</li>
    <li> This headband is very cute but mine fell apart the first day I up it on. I plan to re glue it myself or maybe sew it so that never comes apart again.</li>
    <li> I liked the product very much nicer than the picture, also a wonderful price, responsiveness and style seller is very nice, certainly I will repeat purchase it will not be the last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deserves more than five stars</li>
    <li> It is different.  I enjoy the headband, it is like a cloth material so it doesnt pull out your hair.</li>
    <li> I like it but it&#x27;s not my favorite. I think it&#x27;s the pointyness of the wing at the top of the hairband that looks kinda weird at times.</li>
    <li> I loved it for the first 2 times I wore it, very pretty and surprisingly well made for the price! At least on the beaded part. It took a long time to get here and the ribbon that it is wrapped around the metal head band part unattatched and unwound itself. I have to fix it but I would do it again anyway!</li>
    <li> I wish I had purchased two of them. My girls take turns to wear it and it&#x27;s a beautiful hair accessory.</li>
    <li> It looks just as it looks in the picture. I would recommend it to all those ladies that love to accessorize.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like the quality, and the colors are different from the photo and they&#x27;re faded. I don&#x27;t know, it might be okay for a little kid, I wanted it for a fashion show as an accessory for one of my models. But no, didn&#x27;t work out. It said Vintage but it wasn&#x27;t vintage enough for me.</li>
    <li> I am SO GLAD I ordered this!  It is really pretty.  I have short hair and when I tried it on, I felt like a flapper.  The perfect hair accent!  If it came in more colors I would order them.  This is really lovely.</li>
    <li> I love the versatile of the colors but would not recommend it for just a casual wear.  It is very nice and elegant.</li>
    <li> This is the cutest hair band EVER!! :D I can&#x27;t believe it was so inexpensive because it&#x27;s well made with beautiful beads. It fits perfect and goes with everything. I love it!! :)</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful headpiece.  Glamorous.  The shipment was prompt and we were happy to get it.  I plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> the angel beads came off after using it wearing the head band two times. i was not happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought 5 and I wish I would have bought more. The headband is comfortable and the beads are secure.  The little label \\&quot;Hand made\\&quot; in the underside adds a nice touch. Even on a bad hair day, persons stop me to say how much they like the headband.</li>
    <li> I love these!  They seem well-made for the price.  The headband is fabric-covered, which keeps it from slipping out of place.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown/black hair and this hairband look great! I normally wear it with my hair down and get tons of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar fashions of hairband sell for 6 to 7 dollars at most stores so I thought this was a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The produced seemed nicely made and has held up nicely for several months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before ordering it, you should know that it is shipped directly from China so it takes awhile to arrive. However, mine arrived before the estimate arrive date, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened a package, the black ribbons taped around the hair band all became loose and fell apart.  It is not woth that I regret I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, lightweight, and adds just the right amount of pizzaz to an outfit, or head/hair wrap. I would recommend it to anyone, plus the price is great.</li>
    <li> It was unravelling when I removed it from the package,it looks elegant in the advertisement photo but it&#x27;s very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> beautiful headband and i have never worn the headband out yet and yet the black around the band is unwinding ! very disappointed but luckily i recieved two headbands instead of one</li>
    <li> works great, doesn&#x27;t give me a headache and came in onepiece</li>
    <li> Very pretty and economical enough to wear all the time.</li>
    <li> received it very quick and stylish, I like it and have many compliments.</li>
    <li> I love how it looks on but it is made from cheap material so I have ordered it twice now. The problem is not the beading but the sides of the headbands that the ribbon comes off but overall I recommend it</li>
    <li> This item is very gorgeous! The color in the photo does not give it justice. I love it and it dresses up any outfit in which I am wearing.</li>
    <li> it is beautiful and cheap.Its look good on my daughter so worth buying .it is great value in small price.</li>
    <li> Very pretty BUT it is very cheaply made, The pretty adornment fell off after wearing it two times... The band is very thin and the piece was  lightly glued on. I guess I could hot glue it back on? Oh Well</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as she loves headbands.  It arrived in perfect condition.  The pic doesn&#x27;t do it justice - its a beautiful, gold, purple wing - actually, the colors are more mosaic than just one color.  The light just dances off of the wing.  The headband doesn&#x27;t dig behind my ears so I know she will be comfortable in it.  It&#x27;s different and really pretty.  Will go with anything - any season too.  She will love to pull this out of her stocking on Christmas morning.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Fell apart as soon as I opened the package.</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> Came quite quickly. It was smushed at first, but was revived quite easily. It&#x27;s cute and for the price, quite worth it.</li>
    <li> Simply beautiful. As appears on site and very well made. I&#x27;m very pleased and the price was well worth it.  I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The order arrived fairly quickly. The headband is cute and the only negative is it did hurt my head a little, which is normal for me and headbands, unless they are elastic type or cloth. All in all its very nice. Will give to my sister in law.</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful headband I have ever owned. I have gotten so many compliments on it. However, the edge of the wing is not connected to the band itself and sometimes gets bent. Also, like most headbands, it can get uncomfortable to wear after a few hours.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly what is shown. It Looks great and many people ask where I got it from! I will be ordering more, especially for that price!</li>
    <li> Unraveled after first use.</li>
    <li> I love the detail on this headband, it is beautiful!  It came really quickly considering the distance it had to travel to get to me in the USA. If I had to make a complaint about the product it would be the it is not attached very well to the felt that is attached to the headband.</li>
    <li> The item I received isn&#x27;t as big or as bright as pictured. The wing is also oriented &#x27;upside down&#x27; from what is pictured, so don&#x27;t expect an exact match. That said, it&#x27;s still pretty and classy. It can be worn casually or formally. I like it and it&#x27;s worth the price. The headband is comfortable, too.</li>
    <li> This headband was more beautiful then what I had remembered seeing when I ordered the product. My daughter is going to absolutely love it as a gift for Christmas this year.</li>
    <li> This looks really pretty and stays on the metal band really well. for the price this is an amazing product. It goes with everything.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty but it came in an envelope so it was flattened. I&#x27;m going to try to unflatten it and hopefully wear it sometime soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty and the price was right. It came way sooner than I expected it, and I am very happy about that. It was packaged in an envelope and the felt part had been bent, but felt is a soft material and it did not crease permanently. I hope it lasts a long time. The beading is beautiful and I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My mother absolutely loves this. She has a big head and it doesn&#x27;t pinch her and stays put. It is quite elegant.</li>
    <li> This is not my style. It is a headband with a piece of fabric sewed to it. The fabric is beautiful but it looks like it just lays there on your head. Nothing like the picture. I can&#x27;t say that I would recommend this to anyone unless I wanted a good laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hate saying this but trying to be honest.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very cute hair band. Everybody makes compliments and it fits very nice for medium length wavy hair. I just love it!</li>
    <li> It looked a little crushed out of the package but once I put it on it looked great. It says &amp;#34;hand make&amp;#34; inside and no that&#x27;s not a typo haha. Arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> It arrived faster than all my other order but it was unable to track so when it actually got here I had no idea. Everything came in one piece but the design of the wing was folded and twisted. I have tried flattening it several times but it&#x27;s still in bad condition. Not sure if I&#x27;ll get the chance to wear it and not have it look awful.</li>
    <li> The picture makes it look big but in reality its small but just the right size for a hint of flare.. It took 3 weeks to be delivered but It is a good assessory for the price.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s an okay headband. Looks just like the picture but the beaded part was bent out of shape.</li>
    <li> I would have liked this to be a bit larger. But its ok. For the price, I guess you cant beat it.</li>
    <li> Very pretty but took forever to come and the design fell off after a few uses but it was ok</li>
    <li> for it being what it was...I got what I paid for. I was not expecting that. Perhaps in the future I shall read the description of said item. I feel as if I can not post a negative review..as the. Onsumer its our responsibility to ensure we are getting what we want..and what we paid for.</li>
    <li> Very cheap looking not as pretty as expected</li>
    <li> I love unique things, and so was surprised to see the tag on the underside, stating, &amp;#34;hand made.&amp;#34; I really don&#x27;t think you would find anything like this in the stores. This is beautiful, and I can&#x27;t imagine the number of hours it took to create this bead work. Keep in mind, because it&#x27;s hand made, it won&#x27;t look exactly like the picture, so I imagine no two are alike. The headband itself is the type you&#x27;d find in a craft store, but it&#x27;s been meticulously wrapped with a black ribbon, so it&#x27;s very comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t slip. I wore it around the house to get used to it, and thankfully, it doesn&#x27;t pinch into my head. I&#x27;ll be wearing it this weekend as an added touch to my new outfit.</li>
    <li> To start, I ordered this in mid-December, and my expected delivery date was in early January. However, I received my headband way earlier! I wore it on Christmas Eve, and I&#x27;m pretty sure everyone I spoke to pointed it out! It was a big hat, and it really goes with anything. If you can&#x27;t tell, the beads colors are gold, yellow, green, blue, and purple. I&#x27;m a tad disappointed that I&#x27;ve only worn it once, and it was already breaking off the band. It&#x27;s a little heavy, but with a little hot glue, I can fix it. Would I recommend it to a friend? I already have! I just recommend buying some glue as well.</li>
    <li> I FINALLY got this, and it looks like crap. Straight up crap. It&#x27;s way smaller than the picture shows, the design part is maybe three inches long, an inch wide. Do NOT buy this, it&#x27;s ugly and just crap. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t get this headband because of how inexpensive it was but it is really cute and looks like it cost a lot more than it did!</li>
    <li> It is a very pretty headband and has pretty beading. It looks so nice on. My granddaughter loves wearing it.</li>
    <li> It is super cute!  It&#x27;s not something that you would wear with a bunch of patterns or jewelry because it has so much going on that it will be the focus of the outfit</li>
    <li> my head band broke the same day i received. Very disappointing, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very pretty was the first words out our mouths when we opened the package. Worth the wait</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Cute. But the wing is smaller than I thought. Wish it was bigger :(&lt;br /&gt;The hairband doesn&#x27;t hurt over time.</li>
    <li> These headbands didn&#x27;t cost much, I purchased two and wearing them together makes for an attractive headpiece. The beading work is well done and it /they look good on ones head.</li>
    <li> This is a great time.  I got a lot of compliments.  Everyone should have a hair piece like this.  It is great!</li>
    <li> This head band is really cute and just the right amount of bling and sparkle!!  I love it!!  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> It looks beautiful.. got it as a gift for my coworker and everyone love it.  I would recommended.  the tips may be hard to adjust but once you get used it, you wont mind at all.</li>
    <li> I really like it!! Made very nicely!!! Is very comfortable and easy to wear. Light weight and fine looks as well as materials.</li>
    <li> It may not be the best made thing in the world, but it sure isn&#x27;t the worst.  And for the price, it&#x27;s amazing.  The beading is especially well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor point, the one I received is backwards from the photo.  As in the tip of the &#x27;wing&#x27; lands behind my ear rather than on the top of my head like the model.  I don&#x27;t care.  I actually didn&#x27;t notice till I looked at the picture just now.  All in all a great buy :)</li>
    <li> I did not expect this item to be so well made as I had read the previous reviews. But I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought as a  Christmas gift.  Wish I had bought 2 more the are cute unique headbands.  I gave it to my sons girlfriend she loved it so did my 2 girls. Vintage look. I will buy again</li>
    <li> Came within set time exactly like the picture shows. Fits well looks nice with everything can be worn for everyday or dressed up</li>
    <li> This headband is more neat than I thought! It&#x27;s fits into my hair nicely and is still subtle with my coral colored dress!</li>
    <li> I got this to dress up a pixie hairstyle.  It took a while to come in, but is very comfortable and attractive.  Fantastic value for the price.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first, but I love it. Every time I wear it, I get compliments. It kind of has a retro feel that I like.</li>
    <li> This is a good product if u are patient enough to wait for it to come in the mail. It took about a month for it to come. I like it but the decoration on top fell off after about four uses so keep some glue handy and it will last longer. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this all the time.  Love it.  Even though i have black hair it shows up quite well.  Hasn&#x27;t fallen apart or become frayed.</li>
    <li> When it arrived it was beautiful, but it broke after 2 wearings.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nicely made and looks really pretty, even nicer in person than in picture in my opinion.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I did not like this merchindice. It is not the not the size that u see when you&#x27;re looking at it before u order. Its to small. Didn&#x27;t like it at all. The shipping was great. That&#x27;s all I can say nice about this</li>
    <li> It is a very nice headpiece, nicely made, looks very pretty and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;It looks very much like on the pictures here- it is not small like some reviewers said. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very cute headband alot of ladies loved it. And since i have dark hair the headband blended and it looks like i just have a clip in!</li>
    <li> Not quite as I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased this product and i was not happy about it. It does not look like the pic. Super cheap and weird looking</li>
    <li> This product is great! The beads are a little darker than in the picture and the headband is a little bothersome but other than that the product is great!</li>
    <li> I just received it in the mail and I am in love with it. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap, it fits my head great. I wear it with my hair down or when it&#x27;s in a ponytail. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> this is my second headband in this style, this one has more blues, I love it, Very shic, Thanks Guys</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type that hates the idea of myself wearing a headband. Being that most people assume I&#x27;m younger than I really am I didn&#x27;t wanna make things worse. This headband is the best less than $2.00 purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. It looks exactly how it does in the pic and it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a kid.  A few cons: one little piece on the end of the detail tends to do its own little thing sometime. And the headband tends to be just a little snug. Other than that I love it and would buy more if it comes in different styles.</li>
    <li> Although it is very cheap, the quality is very good. It fits well, not like other hairbands that hurt above the ears or shaped for E.T.&amp;#34;s head. This is one is really good.</li>
    <li> Broke after one use. if you are armed with a hot glue gun, you can just reglu it. If not, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this headband! It seems to be made of good quality, and is sturdy. It does not pinch my head, which seems to be a problem. Great price for the product, and it came less than a week after I ordered it!</li>
    <li> Kept my eye on this one and read all the reviews before buying. Finally bought it and its really nice. Yes, does take almost 2wks to get here. Headband itself is comfortable and the Phoenix Wing is beaded kinda shiny purplish and actually nice. Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t have any loose or missing/broken beads on mine at all. It was folded over for shipping but the way it was folded was inward so it still lays on the head flat like the model. I would recommend this if you are thinking about it-especially if the price is so low. Free shipping is super nice since its from overseas. Hope that helps</li>
    <li> Bought this for someone else. They loved it.</li>
    <li> Cute headband and it arrived in 10 days.  Highly recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> Tiny. Had to give to friend&#x27;s 8yr old.</li>
    <li> i only wore the protect once i love the style and did get a compliment but the product did not last. i could have returned it don&#x27;t want to be bothered. i just wont order from them again.</li>
    <li> This arrived much quicker than I thought it would.  I am so happy I purchased this head band!  It looks very nice. I definitely recommend buying this!!!</li>
    <li> This looks better in person. It especially looks good when you curl your hair or wear a side ponytail. i love it</li>
    <li> great product would buy again love it just like the picture does not hurt to wear color nice also .</li>
    <li> Super cute! the quality is great for the price. You&#x27;re able to dress it up or down. def a great buy</li>
</ol>
