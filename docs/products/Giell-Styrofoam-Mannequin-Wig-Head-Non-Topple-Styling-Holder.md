    <li> This is a great item to place your Styrofoam head on for your wigs. Will not tip over. It fits perfectly. Item was shipped immediately and received it in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Ok. So this base was awesome for me to put my manikin heads on. SN: you will have to tape it down to a table to secure it.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for a styrofoam head, it fit well. Didn&#x27;t use cause the styrofoam got damage by trying to paint it with spray.</li>
    <li> Save your money. Get one that claps to a table. This has no option of holding on to anything so if the head is too heavy it will topple over</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the wig non-topple wig holder. I&#x27;m using it for craft shows to display headbands and bows that I make. It worked great.</li>

    <li> What a great idea.  My long wigs would topple the long neck wigs if you breathed on them!  Problem solved.</li>
    <li> So I deciced my hubby need a stand to put his baseball caps on. It sits in entry way and a beautifu chest with the mannequim wig head. Every one walks and takes a look at the caps on the wigg head and has a laugh.</li>
    <li> Stand does what it was designed to do. I have a long neck Styrofoam head that holds a hat constantly. Stays upright even when bumped.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put together.</li>
