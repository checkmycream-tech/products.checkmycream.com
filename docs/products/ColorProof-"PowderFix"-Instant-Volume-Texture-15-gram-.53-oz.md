    <li> Good product. Highly recommend this product for people with thin hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser tried this on me, and a little goes a long way to fuller hair. It smells fresh and good, and I was going to buy it at the salon, but it cost $27 there--this is a much better buy. You sprinkle a little at the roots, then gently rub it in. I have very dark hair, and the white powder completely disappears.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> Great for volume!!  Really can&#x27;t live without it now. Best on clean hair.  Use a comb to make a part to your scalp.  Tap your finger on the bottle to sprinkle the powder gently into each part you create. I start on the right side of the head and work my way to left (maybe around 6 parts total). Flip hair upside down and rub your fingertips at your scalp to move powder around.  You will get a tacky feel in your hair.  This is where the volume comes from. Will take a little practice to master. But great stuff!!! Finish with hairspray.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent seller.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time when I got my hair cut last year and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. it provides very good lift for people with fine, oily hair like myself...good alternative for people who can&#x27;t style their hair with thick, greasy gel. Will not hold your hair if it&#x27;s dirty or too heavy.</li>

    <li> Good product to add texture and helps fine hair from going limp.  You can run your fingers through the product to plump your hair more than once.  Smells like vanilla.</li>
