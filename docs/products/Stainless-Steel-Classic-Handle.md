      <li>This handle has a very good weight and feel.</li>
      <li>Both it and the head are beautifully finished.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent handle well-made, that&#x27;s nice wait to razor</li>
      <li>The handle is very nicely machined.</li>
      <li>Very nice handle.</li>
      <li>I was reluctant to put up the money for this handle, but the quality is excellent and I&#x27;m satisfied that I got what I paid for.</li>
      <li>this is a good choice.</li>
      <li>I use this to shave my beautiful bald head, and my smooth handled</li>
      <li>I placed my order on Monday of this week and received my handle today (Thursday) via USPS First Class - very impressed!  </li>
      <li>Love that it is made here in the USA!  </li>
      <li>An accident was waiting to happen with the original, beautifully chromed but slippery handle of my EJ DE89.  </li>
      <li>I own the Weber 3-piece razor with the bulldog handle.</li>
      <li>I bought the Weber polished head with classic handle, received it today, got an absolutely perfect shave with it tonight, and love it already.</li>
      <li>Maybe, but if you buy this and a cheap Merkur and just use the blade head portion of the Merkur with this superb handle, you&#x27;ll have a razor as nice as shavers costing far more.</li>
      <li>This is a high quality handles with excellent fit and finish.</li>
      <li>Outstanding.</li>
      <li>I bought the standard length and its perfect.</li>
      <li>I love this handle.  </li>
      <li>Perfect weight/length &amp; finishing...fits over 30 different safety razor heads in my collection with zero quality issues.</li>
      <li>Exceptionally well made and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Not too long either as some of the newer offerings around, but again: PERFECT in every way!</li>
      <li>The knurling looks fantastic and now I can hold the razor better.  </li>
      <li>The length is about perfect for my average sized hands.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s smooth handle.  </li>
      <li>As promised, it fit my 1960s</li>
      <li>The knurling is much more aggressive with a good bite that makes it easy to handle while wet and soapy.</li>
      <li>Experienced wet shavers know that you should let the weight of your double-edge safety razor do the job.  </li>
      <li>Simply and outstanding handle that makes any razor head better.</li>
      <li>but as one matures... gets older the fingers need a bit more length to control the DE razor, this handle fits the bill.</li>
      <li>I have large hands and this handle is quite a bit longer than the original handles and fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
      <li>Overall very satisfied.</li>
      <li>You get no slippage from the Weber Razor Long Handle along with good balance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it two years and use it almost daily, still looks new - very satisfied with my purchase and can recommend without hesitation.</li>
      <li>I have this handle married to a Muhle R41.</li>
      <li>Love the deep knurling on the handle.  </li>
      <li>This handle is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I have to say it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I suspect a standard length handle would provide better balance, so I&#x27;d recommend this longer handle only if you&#x27;ve got huge hands.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a little bit longer and it has some nice weight to it.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a heavy, solid, well balanced, and attractive handle for your razor</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>I really like except for</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I would recommend a longer handle with factory cut surface for a sure grip with wet fingers while shaving.</li>
      <li>It works very well for this purpose.  </li>
      <li>The knurling is deep and effective and never allows you to feel like you are not in total control of the razor at all time.</li>
      <li>The workmanship of this stainless handle is outstanding, even better than I expected and its heavy!</li>
      <li>Edwin did not feel steady.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This is a high performance ...high quality piece of steel.  </li>
      <li>Wow!!</li>
      <li>The stainless is slightly less shiny than the EJ handle, but it still is an adequate match.</li>
      <li>I actually like this longer handle a little more than the bulldog handle.</li>
      <li>For some reason only the Weber handles can be found currently at Amazon, but if you go to the Weber site you can buy the whole stainless steel razor for $70.00, and it ships through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Be careful about stripping the threads of the head piece when first attaching.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really long; not sure I really needed the extra length, but with its length and heft and knurling, I definitely have a better, safer feel for my DE razor.  </li>
      <li>No regrets.</li>
      <li>They are a fraction of the price of other similar stainless products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This handle is also long, I much prefer a long handle for shaving then the standard short handle.  </li>
      <li>With this machined from marine grade stainless, it should last a lifetime and still get passed down to the next generation.</li>

<li> Can&#x27;t tell yet how long the handle will retain its pristine finish.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a long handle too.</li>

<li> I purchased this handle to replace the knurled Edwin Jagger DE89 handle that just felt a little too short.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ll probably buy their other 2 handles at some point to use with some of my other razors.  </li>
<li> Threads are slightly loose, but they are SUPPOSED to be that way to prevent brass head posts from rubbing too hard on the internal handle threads and wearing down the razor head-post.</li>
<li> Snugs up tight with no wobble what-so-ever.</li>
<li> Could be a little longer, but just my preference.</li>
<li> Even the least expensive razor head turns into a shaving machine with the weight and control that his handle offers.</li>
<li> a bit expensive for just a handle?</li>
<li> You cannot go wrong with their products.</li>
<li> this bad boy features a knurled grip that&#x27;s made for a man ..not a boy.  </li>

    <li> An accident was waiting to happen with the original, beautifully chromed but slippery handle of my EJ DE89.  I have big hands, so I opted for this longer replacement handle.  It&#x27;s really long; not sure I really needed the extra length, but with its length and heft and knurling, I definitely have a better, safer feel for my DE razor.  I suspect a standard length handle would provide better balance, so I&#x27;d recommend this longer handle only if you&#x27;ve got huge hands.  Can&#x27;t tell yet how long the handle will retain its pristine finish.  Took off 1 star because the threads were not cleanly cut, so I had to carefully screw it down the first time.  Be careful about stripping the threads of the head piece when first attaching.</li>
    <li> Very nice handle. It fits the Edwin jagger 89 head.</li>
    <li> I purchased this handle to replace the knurled Edwin Jagger DE89 handle that just felt a little too short.  This handle is exactly what I was looking for.  The construction is solid and heavy.  The knurling is much more aggressive with a good bite that makes it easy to handle while wet and soapy. The length is about perfect for my average sized hands.  The stainless is slightly less shiny than the EJ handle, but it still is an adequate match. I was reluctant to put up the money for this handle, but the quality is excellent and I&#x27;m satisfied that I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality handles with excellent fit and finish. It&#x27;s a long handle too. As promised, it fit my 1960s Gillette Tech razor head perfectly.</li>
    <li> Simply and outstanding handle that makes any razor head better. The knurling is deep and effective and never allows you to feel like you are not in total control of the razor at all time.

    <li> This razor handle is the bomb! a bit expensive for just a handle? Maybe, but if you buy this and a cheap Merkur and just use the blade head portion of the Merkur with this superb handle, you&#x27;ll have a razor as nice as shavers costing far more.</li>

    <li> Wow!! The workmanship of this stainless handle is outstanding, even better than I expected and its heavy! Definitely will order another Weber handle!!</li>
    <li> Experienced wet shavers know that you should let the weight of your double-edge safety razor do the job.  With that said, the Weber handle is the Rolls Royce of shaver handles.  And, forget about having a pewney handle slip from your hand ...this bad boy features a knurled grip that&#x27;s made for a man ..not a boy.  This is a high performance ...high quality piece of steel.  No regrets.</li>
    <li> What can I say that has not already been said. It&#x27;s perfect in every way, quality construction, perfect length, grippy knurling and an excellent finish. I have this handle married to a Muhle R41. About the length, I realize a lot of people like a shorter bulldog handle but as one matures... gets older the fingers need a bit more length to control the DE razor, this handle fits the bill. Not too long either as some of the newer offerings around, but again: PERFECT in every way!</li>
    <li> I placed my order on Monday of this week and received my handle today (Thursday) via USPS First Class - very impressed!  Love the deep knurling on the handle.  Can&#x27;t wait to try on my EJ DE89L head tomorrow and see the difference it makes.  Love that it is made here in the USA!  Keep up the great work Weber!</li>
    <li> For some reason only the Weber handles can be found currently at Amazon, but if you go to the Weber site you can buy the whole stainless steel razor for $70.00, and it ships through Amazon. I bought the Weber polished head with classic handle, received it today, got an absolutely perfect shave with it tonight, and love it already. The handle is long, heavy, and deeply knurled. Both it and the head are beautifully finished.</li>
    <li> I used this handle to use with vintage Gillette razor heads.  It works very well for this purpose.  I have large hands and this handle is quite a bit longer than the original handles and fits comfortably in my hand.  It adds quite a bit of helf to the razor which I find desirable. The nurling is not very aggressive but the razor does not slip from my hands. The handle is very nicely machined.</li>
    <li> This handle has a very good weight and feel. Could be a little longer, but just my preference. Overall very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent handle well-made, that&#x27;s nice wait to razor would purchase another one</li>
    <li> Perfect weight/length &amp; finishing...fits over 30 different safety razor heads in my collection with zero quality issues. I&#x27;ve had it two years and use it almost daily, still looks new - very satisfied with my purchase and can recommend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Outstanding. I bought the standard length and its perfect. Knurling is excellent as well as the weight. Threads are slightly loose, but they are SUPPOSED to be that way to prevent brass head posts from rubbing too hard on the internal handle threads and wearing down the razor head-post. Snugs up tight with no wobble what-so-ever. Exceptionally well made and worth every penny. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Another heirloom shaving product from Weber. I own the Weber 3-piece razor with the bulldog handle. I now switch between the bulldog handle and this handle. It&#x27;s like having two different safety razors. I actually like this longer handle a little more than the bulldog handle.</li>
    <li> Weber is rock solid. You cannot go wrong with their products. They are a fraction of the price of other similar stainless products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that they no longer manufacture their polished heads to go with their handles. I deeply regret not buying a spare when they were around. Weber, please do another production run - check the shaving forums - they are in demand!</li>
    <li> I have a DE razor I really like except for it&#x27;s smooth handle.  I decided to get a nice handle for it and expected to pay at least $50 if not more until I heard about the Weber handles.  I have to say it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  I like that it&#x27;s a little bit longer and it has some nice weight to it.  The knurling looks fantastic and now I can hold the razor better.  I&#x27;ll probably buy their other 2 handles at some point to use with some of my other razors.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> A real good handle for a razor you like the head on but not the handle.</li>
    <li> I replaced the handle on my Edwin Jagger with this.  I love this handle.  It is deeply knurled giving you a very solid feeling in your hand.  I use this to shave my beautiful bald head, and my smooth handled Edwin did not feel steady.  This handle is also long, I much prefer a long handle for shaving then the standard short handle.  If you are looking for a heavy, solid, well balanced, and attractive handle for your razor this is a good choice.</li>
