### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works magnificently</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t stopped raving about the wonderful face and eye creams that Oil of Olay makes.</li>
      <li>but when I do and use the cream, I am really impressed at how good it works.</li>
      <li>This is a great eye cream.</li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s always been happy.</li>
      <li>* one wasn&#x27;t very effective either.  </li>
      <li>It is a very nice cream for under the eye.  </li>
      <li>Good reflective and brightening properties.</li>
      <li>Just wish it had organic good for you</li>
      <li>This product works surprisingly well for me.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Product received in a timely manner and packaged nicely.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s NOT a CC cream and to be honest</li>
      <li>this one in particular is very good!</li>
      <li>I love Olay products....</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything more than their original eye-brightening cream did --</li>
      <li>Was listed as the best for dark circles in an article I read</li>
      <li>Fine lines have disappeared..</li>
      <li>The micro-crystals reflect light, which helps brighten up the eyes.</li>
      <li>After trying, La Mer, Revive and most of the expensive eye creams I experienced remarkable moisturizing effects from this cream.</li>
      <li>It has lightened them significantly.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Okay really works.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy that I have had zero allergic reactions especially with my super sensitive skin, and of course the price is just right.</li>
      <li>very much worth the price.,</li>
      <li>This product makes the skin around your eyes stay moist and soft and it dimished the look of fine lines by being reflective.</li>
      <li>I am really amazed at what a difference it has made.</li>
      <li>Price was much lower online</li>
      <li>it glides on nicely but havent noticed much difference without it on :s</li>
      <li>For this one, I love applying it, a little goes a long way and my eyes crave the smooth silky texture of this cream.</li>
      <li>This is absorbed by your skin and it moisturizes as well as possibly actually lightening that area under the eye.</li>
      <li>Dark circles &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; to lighten because when light hits this product (around your eyes)</li>
      <li>the meantime, it&#x27;s a very emollient product, so you only need a tiny amount.</li>
      <li>They are all reasonably effective but this one with the CC cream made the dark circles and lines less noticeable than other products</li>
      <li>Due to creamy nature I use it around eye area just after shower so that the face is ready by the time I leave.</li>
      <li>I have always had dark circles and this is the first product I have found that has actually helped to make them lighter.</li>
      <li>I have large dark circles.</li>
      <li>It really helps to remove the dark circles under you or eyes as well and help with the wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost though...</li>

<li> Which isn&#x27;t a big deal since one isn&#x27;t more expensive than the other, I&#x27;m just not sure the CC cream makes the difference that Olay claims.</li>
<li> I put it on at night and the next morning, the dark circles have lightened.</li>
<li> So I would recommend this to anyone with dark circles, it definitely has helped me.</li>
<li> Had dry skin around my eyes and this cleared it up in a week!</li>
<li> I use a lot of Olay products and other eye creams.  </li>
<li> I hate heavy eye lighteners that go under your eye and only make lines show up more.</li>
<li> the bounces off and hence your eyes do not look dark.</li>
<li> Eliminated dark circle, and wrinkles around my eyes are less visible</li>
<li> Even though the jar is small, you only need a small amount.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a few months &amp; honestly I do not see enough of an improvement for the cost of this product.</li>
<li> I have been using now for a few weeks</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  </li>
<li> It was a noticeable change within a few days.</li>
<li> &amp; I do see a very slight improvement.</li>
<li> I also have always had really bad dark circles around my eyes and they&#x27;re almost completely gone.</li>
<li> I trust Oil of Olay, they&#x27;ve got decades of research behind them and they know what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sticky, tends to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; even after waiting for my base eye cream to dry, and it emphasizes creases.  </li>
<li> I no longer buy expensive department store brands because the Olay brand works for me.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product received in a timely manner and packaged nicely.  I use it on one eye, and use Olay Total Effects eye cream that&#x27;s NOT a CC cream and to be honest I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two.  Which isn&#x27;t a big deal since one isn&#x27;t more expensive than the other, I&#x27;m just not sure the CC cream makes the difference that Olay claims.</li>
    <li> Had dry skin around my eyes and this cleared it up in a week! I also have always had really bad dark circles around my eyes and they&#x27;re almost completely gone. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> After trying, La Mer, Revive and most of the expensive eye creams I experienced remarkable moisturizing effects from this cream. The luminizing cream makes under the eye look lighter and brighter also. I suggest all of my friends use this eye cream</li>
    <li> Okay really works.  I no longer buy expensive department store brands because the Olay brand works for me.  Fine lines have disappeared..</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. I love it! It really helps to remove the dark circles under you or eyes as well and help with the wrinkles. I suggest it to everyone who is looking for some sort of eye cream.</li>
    <li> Was listed as the best for dark circles in an article I read and I have noticed a lightening of the area around my eyes. Not the fastest but it does work</li>
    <li> Price was much lower online and it&#x27;s the spouses go to product.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice cream for under the eye.  It does not have a lot of sparkle in it and that was my only concern.  It goes well for night treatment or under concealer and makeup.  I notice a softness and silkiness to my under eyes.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Eliminated dark circle, and wrinkles around my eyes are less visible</li>
    <li> I have been using now for a few weeks &amp; I do see a very slight improvement. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost though...&lt;br /&gt;*Update- I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a few months &amp; honestly I do not see enough of an improvement for the cost of this product.*</li>
    <li> After years of using nothing but cosmetics sold at fancy malls and department stores, my esthetician friend turned me on to Oil of Olay. That was 5 years ago and I haven&#x27;t stopped raving about the wonderful face and eye creams that Oil of Olay makes. My mom was using it for years too and she&#x27;s always been happy. For this one, I love applying it, a little goes a long way and my eyes crave the smooth silky texture of this cream. I am so happy that I have had zero allergic reactions especially with my super sensitive skin, and of course the price is just right. I trust Oil of Olay, they&#x27;ve got decades of research behind them and they know what they&#x27;re doing. I have ordered 3 of these already.</li>
    <li> I have always had dark circles and this is the first product I have found that has actually helped to make them lighter. I am really amazed at what a difference it has made. I put it on at night and the next morning, the dark circles have lightened. I don&#x27;t work or go out a lot but when I do and use the cream, I am really impressed at how good it works. Even though the jar is small, you only need a small amount. So I would recommend this to anyone with dark circles, it definitely has helped me.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products....this one in particular is very good!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Olay products and other eye creams.  They are all reasonably effective but this one with the CC cream made the dark circles and lines less noticeable than other products</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream. I use it daily and nightly. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good reflective and brightening properties. Just wish it had organic good for you ingredients in it is all.</li>
    <li> Cream works well but can make you have raccoon eyes if you don&#x27;t cover it with foundation.</li>
    <li> This product works surprisingly well for me. I have large dark circles. It has lightened them significantly. It was a noticeable change within a few days. The container is small but it doesn&#x27;t take much. It&#x27;s not greasy. I use every morning and am hit or miss at night.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a month+  it glides on nicely but havent noticed much difference without it on :s</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything more than their original eye-brightening cream did -- and *that* one wasn&#x27;t very effective either.  It&#x27;s sticky, tends to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; even after waiting for my base eye cream to dry, and it emphasizes creases.  I&#x27;ll never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This product makes the skin around your eyes stay moist and soft and it dimished the look of fine lines by being reflective. Dark circles &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; to lighten because when light hits this product (around your eyes) the bounces off and hence your eyes do not look dark. I hate heavy eye lighteners that go under your eye and only make lines show up more. This is absorbed by your skin and it moisturizes as well as possibly actually lightening that area under the eye. I think it takes time but I do believe that area is getting lighter.</li>
    <li> Works well at brightening the eye area</li>
    <li> very much worth the price.,</li>
    <li> Love it! Works magnificently</li>
    <li> I like this. I am only giving it four stars as I have only used it for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that, like some other products, it might actually keep brightening my eye area even when I am not using it. We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, it&#x27;s a very emollient product, so you only need a tiny amount. The micro-crystals reflect light, which helps brighten up the eyes.</li>
    <li> Works as it says. Due to creamy nature I use it around eye area just after shower so that the face is ready by the time I leave. I also use it at night after face wash. using this last 3 weeks.</li>
