      <li>People will love it.g.</li>
      <li>People will love it.</li>
      <li>Solely because of the size it is perfect for long hair.  </li>
      <li>I loved the brush and so got this new identical one.</li>

      <li>It just looks and feels so cheap.</li>

      <li>I was just so glad that I could replace it with a new one from Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You can purchase this brush off Aveda&#x27;s website for $20 + about $5 for shipping unless you spend over a certain amount and get free shipping.</li>
      <li>This is a great brush, but I wish it was a little heavier when holding it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely time to replace it, but I am amazed by how well this brush lasts and the amazing job it does in detangling.</li>
      <li>It feels AMAZING to just brush your hair and it goes through my hair so smoothly, even when it is so messy.</li>
      <li>The Aveda brush that I purchased at a salon is MUCH higher quality than the one I purchased from this seller.</li>
      <li>The first time it fell apart, I thought maybe I had done something to it</li>
      <li>The bristle spikes are long and get right down to your scalp effectively brushing the hair instead of just going over the top of it.</li>
      <li>Very high quality - was exactly as described and arrived when promised.</li>
      <li>The crack then grows to where now there is a large hole in the brush.</li>

      <li>It is sturdy and very useful for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>This is an alltime classic brush.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a great brush for my wife&#x27;s long, thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I am in the process of looking for a new brand of brushes to use.</li>
      <li>it is remove ALL the hair first and mix liquid antibacterial soap, baking soda, and vinegar in a bowl of hot water (about 1 to 1.5\\&quot; of water) and let the brush soak bristles down for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
      <li>I can only use it if I hold it a certain way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy it directly from Aveda online or in store.</li>
      <li>will get her another Aveda paddle brush in a smaller version for her to carry with her, now that I know how much she likes this one.</li>
      <li>loves the way it massages her scalp and distributes the natural oils through her hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I should have replaced my old one sooner</li>
      <li>I got a new Aveda wooden paddle brush to replace my old one I&#x27;ve been using for over 10 years.</li>
      <li>I only had to purchase a new one because I lost my old one.</li>
      <li>I definitely would recommend purchasing directly from the Aveda store though, as it is cheaper there.</li>
      <li>Then when it is all rinsed off I squeeze the water out and let it dry upside down on a towel overnight and clean off the cleaning tool.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve owned, the first one was 10 years old and dried up to the point of losing its bristles.  </li>
      <li>Not long after owning it one of my kids lost it.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very long and reach right down to your scalp and massage it.</li>
      <li>The replacement seems a little different to me, but I still really like this brush!</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine, shoulder length hair</li>

    <li> I think this is Fake :)</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  This is the third one I have had.  They fit my hand well, are a great brush, and I won&#x27;t use any other.  I should have replaced my old one sooner and when I thought of ordering one on Amazon I did so immediately.  It arrived within a week, which was about 5 days earlier than predicted.  I&#x27;m tempted to order an extra.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome for drying damp hair to add body.  It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve owned, the first one was 10 years old and dried up to the point of losing its bristles.  Highly recommended.</li>

    <li> I love this brush. I have thin, fine, shoulder length hair but this brush works on any hair no matter the length, thickness etc. It is very well made with a heavy and sturdy handle/base and stiff but gentle bristles. The bristles are very long and reach right down to your scalp and massage it. It distributes oils throughout your hair to keep them from accumulating at your scalp and prevents frizz. It gets through tangles effortlessly and gets rid of bed head. It feels AMAZING to just brush your hair and it goes through my hair so smoothly, even when it is so messy. There is no pulling or tugging. This is the only brush I now use and like I said it works on all hair, it is the brush to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works with any hair, curly, thick, long, short doesn&#x27;t matter. The bristle spikes are long and get right down to your scalp effectively brushing the hair instead of just going over the top of it.

I travel with this brush and it still holds up great. This brush does not need to be babied or treated gently. It is a great, universal brush. I have used SO MANY brushes in my life time and I can rightfully say this is the best. I even prefer this to my Mason Pearson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I clean it is remove ALL the hair first and mix liquid antibacterial soap, baking soda, and vinegar in a bowl of hot water (about 1 to 1.5\\&quot; of water) and let the brush soak bristles down for about 20-30 minutes. Remove and rinse thoroughly and I scrub mine with the \\&quot;Denman Hair Brush Cleaner\\&quot; (available cheaply here on amazon) to get all the gunk off the base. Then when it is all rinsed off I squeeze the water out and let it dry upside down on a towel overnight and clean off the cleaning tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase this brush off Aveda&#x27;s website for $20 + about $5 for shipping unless you spend over a certain amount and get free shipping. Buy it there. Get it as gifts. People will love it.g. Buy it there. Get it as gifts. People will love it.</li>

    <li> Replacing my 30 y/o brush, this one (made in China)  seems like a really good quality, but way overpriced. Almost same brush (this one has wood handle) as the one it is replacing.  And the free gifts in w/ aren&#x27;t for a guy..  regifting to my mom..</li>
    <li> i bought one of these brushes twenty tears ago and finally had to break down and buy a new one this past christmas. I have always loved this product and it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> As always great service and product</li>
    <li> Boss lady said she needed to replace the brush she had been using for years. This is spot on like the one she had before.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, but I wish it was a little heavier when holding it. I already had one bristle thing come out, but it&#x27;s a good brush!</li>
    <li> Solely because of the size it is perfect for long hair.  It still works great for short hair and feels great on the scalp as it massages.</li>
    <li> I used to use Aveda brushes in the 80s and they were awesome. I have bought two recently with terrible results. The first time it fell apart, I thought maybe I had done something to it so I bought another one. Nope. They just suck. It starts with a crack in the part that holds the bristles. The crack then grows to where now there is a large hole in the brush. I can only use it if I hold it a certain way. I am in the process of looking for a new brand of brushes to use. What a rip off.</li>
    <li> I bought an Aveda paddle brush in a kcal salon after they used one to brush out my hair. It was amazing how easily that brush worked out my tangles. Not long after owning it one of my kids lost it. I had been looking at this one on line for month to replace it. I just received it in the mail and I am utterly disappointed :( it is not the same quality at all! It&#x27;s super light, and I almost wonder if it is even wood. One for the bristles is missing. The bristles are extremely cheap and snag/pull out hair badly. It just looks and feels so cheap. I feel extremely ripped off. I could have Horton a better brush at the dollar tree:( now I have nothing to brush my daughters extremely long thick hair with.</li>
    <li> Its cheaply made.  Not a really Aveda brush.</li>
    <li> nothing beats a paddle brush - Aveda&#x27;s is great! I don&#x27;t brush my hair often but when I do I use this brush</li>
    <li> I got a new Aveda wooden paddle brush to replace my old one I&#x27;ve been using for over 10 years. The bristles of the new brush are stiffer and sharper and uncomfortable when I brush my hair.</li>
    <li> I had this same brush for years until finally it started to fall apart. I had it for many many years though. I loved the brush and so got this new identical one. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality, great value.</li>
    <li> I owned this brush for years, but nothing lasts forever.  I was just so glad that I could replace it with a new one from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I received this brush as a Christmas gift six years ago and it is still the only brush I use. It&#x27;s definitely time to replace it, but I am amazed by how well this brush lasts and the amazing job it does in detangling. I would recommend this brush to anyone, especially those with long wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Very good brush!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a great brush for my wife&#x27;s long, thick hair.  This is it!&lt;br /&gt;She loves the way it massages her scalp and distributes the natural oils through her hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will get her another Aveda paddle brush in a smaller version for her to carry with her, now that I know how much she likes this one.</li>
    <li> This is an alltime classic brush.  It is sturdy and very useful for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one after 5 years of use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this brush. I only had to purchase a new one because I lost my old one. Will always be my go-to brush.</li>
    <li> Ok.. this 1 star rating is only because the price here on Amazon is double what I just paid in a hair salon and I just saw it in an Aveda store in the mall for $20 as well!! Why is it twice as much here? That&#x27;s crazy!! Anyway - it is a FANTASTIC brush I LOVE mine. I only wish they didn&#x27;t stop selling the round one and the styling one. Crazy!! I was told tonight at the mall that they might be bringing it out again soon! YAY!!</li>
    <li> Works well with my frizzy hair which resists styling and it helps get it straightened out.  My hair dresser turned me onto this product.</li>
    <li> I bought an Aveda paddle brush about 8 years ago and I still use it daily. The lacquer has completely worn off of the wood from it being used so much but it doesn&#x27;t affect the way it works. I have long hair and this is the most comfortable brush I own. My oldest daughter just requested her own Aveda paddle brush so she doesn&#x27;t need to come into my bathroom and steal mine anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever owned.  Seriously amazing.  I definitely would recommend purchasing directly from the Aveda store though, as it is cheaper there.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair brush for any length hair (I keep changing mine!). Soothing, doesn&#x27;t pull, good size for my hand/fingers, and very comfortable against a winter-sensitive scalp. Amazing in combination with a hair or scalp oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Aveda brush on my nightstand since 2006.  It makes my hair shine, refreshes and massages my scalp, and has outlasted any other beauty product I&#x27;ve ever owned.  After wearing down over the years, my puppy gave it its final coup de grace today and now I&#x27;m ordering a new one.  An identical one.</li>
    <li> Very high quality - was exactly as described and arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> Nicely aligned but a bit too light and not durable.. Used it for 9 months and it started to fall apart.</li>
