<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> At first I thought this may not be suitable for me, a 60+ male who rarely wears shoes, and as a result have soles under the feet very much like leather. when skin started breaking up during last fall and this spring, I ended up peeling some layers and learnt pretty soon it was not a good idea .. a very painful thing to do as well. After waiting for the outer layers of skin to grow back, I still had to deal with the itchiness, and rough edges on the sides of my heels ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is heaven-sent for me. it smoothed up pretty much every rough surface. I over did myself the first Time around, not knowing how much was too much! but 4 Days past it now, and everything returned to normal. Feet look much much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet are better than before -- in 3 more passes it will be completely normal, I think -- it may take a Month or so, because I will space the use of the device to say once in 2 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have said to use it on dry skin only, and I second that. I would add that it is advantageous to move it with the grain so that teh contact with skin is light and against the revolutions of the massager wheel</li>
    <li> I am pleases with this product.  It performs well and works as expected.</li>
    <li> Recently I have seen products like these becoming very popular, and I always wondered if they worked, and if there was any pain involved. I had the chance to try this one by Bella Naturals / Naturalico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ankles for some reason seem to get callused. Why, I&#x27;m not sure. Perhaps its from where my socks and shoes rub against my ankle? I&#x27;m not quite sure. For years I have used many different forms of callus removers. From egg shaped metal scrapers, to pumice stones, and everything in between. I always found that either the product wasn&#x27;t tough enough, or it was too tough and would hurt my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this in the mail, and immediately took it out for use. Very nicely designed, fits in the hand nicely, and it looks pretty! It was very straight forward and easy to use. So I went to work. I took before and after photos to share, so you too can see what first use looks like. I read the instructions and it suggested to only use on the skin for 2-3 seconds, so I did. I would do it in intervals to see my tolerance. I found that for me, 10 seconds did the job. In those 10 seconds my mind was blown! This gently took away the rough callus, and left my skin looking a lot better. There was no pain involved either. Again, mind blown! After use I put some aloe lotion on my ankles just to help with the redness and provide some moisture. Then applied my favorite moisturizer. Thats it! Done! It&#x27;s been a few days since I used this, and I would say that probably after 1 more round, my calluses will be 100% gone. Right now they are probably at the 90% gone, just after that 1 use. I have also used this on my heels and around my toes just to keep my feet looking pretty and summer sandal ready!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot for a product to knock my socks off, and this did just that. I would give this a 10 star rating if I could! I love it that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I have attached a photo with this review, the top photo taken minutes before use, with no pre treatment or anything. The bottom photo was minutes after using this. No after treatment or anything. Just my pure, raw results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.ything.

    <li> After one use of my new Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic pedicure remover, I can see the difference in the smoothness of my feet.  I am very impressed by this callus remover and I&#x27;m thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to go get a pedicure every time my feet start to look and feel rough.  I never really thought it would work this well but I wanted to give it a try as I got this at a reduced price to review.  I&#x27;ve called up all my BFF&#x27;s and female family members to tell them about it and I&#x27;m excited for my results.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean and I can&#x27;t think of one thing I don&#x27;t like about this callus remover.  It spins so fast, it truly does take just seconds to see results.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I love that it is rechargeable. It really has some power and lasts a long time on a single charge. I can use if for 15-20 mins on a single charge.</li>
    <li> Disclosure - free sample provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready to get your feet looking great for sandals?  I definitely am!  It has been so warm in Vegas, and I will be living in my sandals.  What do you use to get your feet looking their best for the Summer season?  My feet are so dry and need some serious pampering after the dry and cold Winter here.  Naturalico&#x27;s Pedi File is a great way to pamper your feet, so that they look their best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have dry feet, calluses, and dead skin that you want to remove easily?  Naturalico&#x27;s Pedicure File is a great way to do this without a ton of work.  This is a rechargeable file that easily removes calluses.  The file has two different settings for use.  You simply use the spinning file on the dry areas of your feet.  I was truly impressed with how quickly it removed the dead skin on my feet, but also how easy it was to use.  I love that this file can be used over and over again.  The Pedi File left my feet feeling so soft, but also looking great to wear my favorite sandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received a free sample to facilitate my review.  No monetary compensation was provided.  All opinions are completely my own.  My participation is voluntary.  I am disclosing in accordance with FTC 16 CFR Part 255.</li>
    <li> Makes removing callus&#x27; and rough skin so quick and easy. Comes with two heads, which is awesome. It has two speeds and a light to see where you are hitting. Leaves skin so assist and smooth. Apply lotion after as it does leave your skin looking filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my full review here: http://awesomemandi.blogspot.com/2015/05/naturalico-rechargeable-electronic.html</li>
    <li> Good product. However, I wished it were a little bit more powerful.</li>
    <li> Just ok. The purple rotator shaver needs to be replace too often. Needs to have a &amp;#34;catching&amp;#34; device...must do over a garbage can. Mess.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this very long and have only used it once so far, but overall it seems to do what I need it to.  It&#x27;s easy to use and hold on to and is not extremely noisy.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product. It really works exceptionally well. The callouses disappear almost effortless. Thank you so much for such a good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Not very powerful.  Runs out of battery quickly and has to be recharged.  Maybe it&#x27;s just that I have very calloused feet.  Not sure.</li>
    <li> I love it works great and pretty. .if that matters lol.</li>
    <li> Good power although the charge runs out in 20-30 minutes. But the job got done while keeping the machine pugged in.</li>
    <li> I am very Impressed with this foot file/callus remover it has 2 speeds and LED light that illuminates skin it&#x27;s also rechargeable so I don&#x27;t have to go out and buy batteries for it, the charger is included and it includes 2 extra grinding roller heads plus a cleaning brush. This callus remover works great it&#x27;s very easy to use and easy to clean as well. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants soft beautiful feet!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  Mom had a similar version, but I like this one much better! It’s cute, quiet, compact for travel, no batteries required. Love the light so you can see the skin coming off. Can’t go wrong for the price. Get it!</li>
    <li> Works on my walked on all day long feet.  I work as a mail carrier and walk all day long.  I need to use this weekly to keep feet callous free.</li>
    <li> This Naturalico Electronic Callus Remover is awesome!  Now that summer is almost here, I pay more attention to my feet.  I want them to look cute in flip flops and sandals.  This callus remover is so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long to run it across the dry skin and calluses on my feet.  It makes them smooth quickly.  It needs to be used on clean, dry feet then a lotion or cream should be used afterward to keep feet soft.  The callus remover arrived fully charged and came with a plug-in charger, an extra roller, and a cleaning brush.  I used it several times before I needed to re-charge it.  I love how this is rechargeable because I hate using products like this that require batteries because they drain them so fast.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who want to get their feet pretty.  Even though I received a discounted product for review purposes my opinions are not altered.</li>
    <li> It does the job, and it is rechargeable. Follow the instructions, and you will have no trouble.</li>
    <li> I bought this pedicure apparatus for my wife. I wondered if the battery would deliver the power she exerted when she filed her own calluses.&lt;br /&gt;No problem there.  She loves the dependability and precision she has at her disposal.&lt;br /&gt;MR</li>
    <li> OH, LOVIES!!!  AT LAST!  SOMETHING THAT WORKS....For less than the cost of one pedi.  As a pedi junkie, I&#x27;ve used the old pumice stone, the callous razor (oh, the damage I could do with that thing!), the egg-shaped metal &amp;#34;grater&amp;#34; and more recently a battery operated spinning grater.  Those gadgets required a lot of work in contorted positions, damaged my skin, quickly wore out and/or ate batteries so fast they just weren&#x27;t worth the bother.  I finally gave up and have been going to the salon.  I don&#x27;t mind polishing my nails but the callouses were no fun so I&#x27;d given up and have been going to the salon.  I&#x27;ve been super-busy and kept forgetting to make an appointment so  I decided to try one last time.  Naturalico Rechargeable ROCKS!!! It&#x27;s INSANELY FABULOUS!!  It arrived very quickly via standard shipping, when I opened the box, I couldn&#x27;t believe how delightfully pretty it is, I turned it on and it had ARRIVED CHARGED.....as if they knew that I&#x27;d want to try it right away.  It seems to be well-made in that it feels solid and all the pieces fit beautifully and securely.  The light is wonderful for using while watching TV or if you just don&#x27;t feel like having to have the whole room brightly lit. Best of all, IT WORKS LIKE A DREAM!!!!!  It took the callouses off the sides of my toes in a few minutes.  IN ONE STEP!  Other methods/tools always required the first step of shredding the skin off and then a second step of smoothing the ravaged skin with some type of sandpaper.  This thing is gentle and a million times faster than anything else.  It&#x27;s nice to know that I can just recharge it and it&#x27;ll be ready when I need a little touch up. Even for women who want to stick with their salon appointments, for the price, this thing will be a life-saver for those few days just prior to the next appointment or when life happens and you just can&#x27;t find the time to go in.  I&#x27;ve not received anything for this review.  It&#x27;s just a wonderful product I think almost everyone will use occasionally or to eliminate salon appointments.  One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> There are many devices like this one out on the market, making it difficult to choose between them all. If you are in the market for one, I would recommend you give this Naturalico unit a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with how this device worked for me. It removed dead skin and callous from under my feet in a gentle manner, leaving them nice and smooth. It&#x27;s a nice weight, fits nicely in the hand and is very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the rechargeable feature, as well as the led light for better viewing are great. Other nice features include easy to clean, portable and water-resistant.  The extra roller is a plus and unless you have very thick calloused feet, I would say these rollers would last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it as recommended and apply light pressure, the motor on this device will last and you can have smooth feet all year round for a fraction of what they charge you at a salon. I would totally recommend this unit for the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to facilitate this review. All opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
    <li> I like it! It does slough off the dead skin. I wish it worked just a bit harder. I didn&#x27;t find any danger at all in its rubbing too much skin off.</li>
    <li> My wife is enjoying the purchase and her feet are loving it. Very good product</li>
    <li> Holy Mackerel... I couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice.  It&#x27;s absolutely the best rechargeable electric pedi I could find.  I tried several and I found this one to work the best.  And, the price was extremely reasonable. I like the accent color and the floral pattern on the sides. My feet are soooo smooth.  So, much better and safer than the blades used in the past. I could not be happier with this pedi, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is so easy to use and does a great job. Very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> All I can regret is opening the box a week after. Ergonomic, the right size, very good product. I am just waiting for the replacements to be available in Amazon</li>
    <li> Honestly, I thought I would be permanently stuck with this stupid callous on the side of my food. I had tried pumice stone and had even taken a knife to the stupid thing and to no avail, but after 15 minutes with this lovely tool, my foot was once again comfortably able to fit inside my shoes without the annoying callous pressing into the rest of my foot. Would highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Not as strong as what I expected. Like someone else said...just use a dremel or sand paper. It&#x27;s not terrible, but not worth $35. In my opinion. I would say $20 tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read all the 5 star reviews you will notice that the majority of reviewers received the product for free or deeply discounted. Had they paid full price, they too may have rates it lower.</li>
    <li> This callus remover is absolutely amazing. I have another callus remover that runs on AA batteries and they suck lol. Literally have to sit in the bathroom for an hour just go get a little bit of dead skin off. The callus remover came in a box including; spare roller, a brush and a charger.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn’t look cheap and it works. Love the design, very simple and feminine and it’s chargeable so it will save you money on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The callus remover has a built in LED light which is to help you see those dead skin. There is a button which you can control how powerful (fast) the roller goes. I usually prefer the lowest power which is very strong.  I wet my feet before using the callus remover because soaking your feet for a few minutes will enable the device to remove dead skins faster. Saves me time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how good it is? Well, you can either take my words for it or not. It’s just much more powerful than the ones that run on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for the product. My review and opinion are 100% honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I love this rechargeable foot file. It really works to smooth away rough spots.</li>
    <li> Works great. I previously had another brand that would cut off when the least amount of pressure was applied. This one did not do that.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the new pedicure callous remover by Naturalico. The fact that it is rechargeable is a great feature. She is happy, so I am happy!</li>
    <li> I really like this callus remover.  I have very bad callus&#x27;s from years of dance classes and this is the first time my feet have been soft.  Even my husband was amazed!!  He even rubs my feet now!  lol....  I told my mother about it and she got one too!  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Not working!!!It came on twice!!! Won&#x27;t even charge!!! Just got it Thursday!!! Couldn&#x27;t even use it!! Waste of money!!! Returning ASAP!!!!</li>
    <li> Works really well. very safe. we use for longer than recommended and it works great!</li>
    <li> What can I say but that this Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic Pedicure Foot File and Callus Remover is AMAZING! Let me say this my feet are not really that bad but my heals are the trouble spots. When I received the Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic Pedicure Foot File and Callus Remover I tried it the next day. I wanted to let my heels really get flaky and see what this would do. It glided very easily across my feet and I could see the flakes just turn into powder and it didn&#x27;t take long to do do at all. I used it both vertically and horizontally and it worked great any way I used it. My heels were left so smooth and soft which was so important to me especially at night because I can&#x27;t sleep with crusty feet. I also tried in on my husband and his feet really need a miracle cure. The Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic Pedicure Foot File and Callus Remover blew me away with the results my husband got, be careful though because I scraped him a little and drew a little blood. I was a little rough but what I love is that the machine will stop if you are pressing to hard. If you suffer with deadly feet. you must pick this up. I love the whole packaging and the quality of the product and I think you will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this complimentary for my opinion.*</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, excellent results in a matter of minutes.  I have cracked and very callus heels and this made them smooth in one use.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I exfoliate my feet everyday in the shower. There nothing worse than disgusting dry or cracked feet. So, preventatively I believe this is/should be part of daily bathing. Now, this is also my first electric scrubber/exfoliating callus remover. I use one of those handheld ones that looks like a small wooden paddle with emery boards on both sides. What I like about this is that it makes getting into hard to reach spots (like between toes or near nails) easier. The board I use will not get in these spots - but this will. I also like that this is water resistant. I took it in the shower right away (came charged) and used it UNDER water. No problems. I like that there are two speeds, but felt they could be slightly more powerful because when pressed against the foot (say a large area where you are inclined to put more pressure), it stops rotating - like it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep spinning. Overall, I think this is a good product. I&#x27;d like a tiny bit more power, but overall I&#x27;m happy with it. With the extra replaceable head, I think I can even get my husband to use it - even if it is purple, glittery with flowers. Ha! It comes with a nice mesh bag, which everything even the charger fits into. Lastly, you&#x27;ll notice there&#x27;s a hole in the cap - which, I actually think this COULD work as a nail (or dog nails) sander/grinder. I received this as a sample, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Grinds away effortlessly at my crusty feet.</li>
    <li> works as expected it was a gift for my sister and she loves it</li>
    <li> have not had the product very long but from what I can tell it&#x27;s well made and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it&#x27;s the same price as the battery operated ones in the store but this one is rechargeable don&#x27;t know how long it holds a charge but how long does it take to get calluses off of your feet really?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much summer in New York, as soon as the weather goes higher than 50 it&#x27;s pretty much sandals weather.&lt;br /&gt;I love wearing sandals, I guess because growing up in Trinidad and the weather is always hot and I only wore sneakers when I went to school.&lt;br /&gt;This Naturalico Rechargable Callus remover is a lifesaver. There is a notification light that lights up at trouble spots and eliminates them. Can&#x27;t wait to buy refills.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to handle, the color is absolutely beautiful and I&#x27;m a Tardis Blue kind of girl, not pink at all. My heel is so smooth thanks to it. Even my fianc&amp;eacute; used it on his manly teeth and was shocked at how fast it smoothed out his callus, he&#x27;s not into grooming his feet lol.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason he loves using the callus remover,pink or not. It&#x27;s not noisy, it&#x27;s rechargable that&#x27;s always a plus, no worrying about buying batteries. We&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of days and my feet are summer sandal ready and my fianc&amp;eacute; as well.after I use it I wash it again then use my favorite feet lotion and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the occasion this is a great choice as a gift for anyone in your life, as I said my fianc&amp;eacute; likes it, so even the men. It also comes in the beautiful box, no need to gift wrap, just pop in in a gift bag, it&#x27;s the best.&lt;br /&gt;I received this for testing purposes, for my review.</li>
    <li> IT SEEMS TO BOG DOWN WHEN YOU TOUCH IT TO YOUR HEELS.  MAKE SURE YOU NOT APPLY ANY PRESSURE</li>
    <li> Update: I had a problem with my device not charging correctly so I contacted the vendor. They were super awesome and sent a new device immediately. I can&#x27;t live without this, I have really bad dry skin, my husband compared my feet to sandpaper. I use it almost everyday as I walk barefoot a lot in the house and on the beach and I wear wool socks which suck the moisture out of my feet. Combined with BettyK Newfeet Cream I have finally gotten rid of all the cracks in my heels after using the device for less than a year. Great customer service! Love this, only had a few days and already see an amazing improvement on my feet. Hopefully I can finally get the cracks in my heels to clear up.</li>
    <li> Summer time makes my feet so dry and sometimes even cracked when I wear my flip flops all the time. Oils and lotions are fine to help, but you need to remove the issue and keep it away. I tried out my pedicure tool on my worst callus first, one that has been there since I was a kid from an injury. The callus tends to build around there as it&#x27;s on the bottom of my foot and rubs on my flipflops. I washed my feet first and used it. It kind of tickled and rubbed a little, but worked great! Be careful not to leave it on too long in one spot or press too hard. It sort of acted like a pumice stone, but didn&#x27;t rip up my hands like one. After I got all the dead skin off, I used some coconut oil to keep the skin soft. I love that my feet don&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s summer, and I can stay looking nice in my sandals. I especially love that it&#x27;s rechargeable, I hate changing batteries all the time in devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. EVERYTHING IN MY REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND IN NO WAY INFLUENCED</li>
    <li> This is the one you want .  I&#x27;m a guy, this thing is pink, and I don&#x27;t care. This electronic pedicure gizmo is very powerful .My feet were big ugly clubs of dead callused skin. I was amazed at just how much skin came off of my feet. It was really quite disgusting. Bravo, Naturalico!</li>
    <li> Have been very pleased with this electronic pedicure product, but especially love that it is rechargeable.  I had purchased a battery operated (cheaper) version and really liked it, but got tired of replacing the batteries.  This rechargeable version is SO worth the price!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> One was for me, another for my daughter. I&#x27;ve used it twice and am satisfied with the results. Two large callouses are almost gone. I have considered other brands for months before purchasing this one. I think this one would be difficult to beat. I keep touching my feet to enjoy the soft, smooth skin compared to the hardened areas that were there for years. I even used scissors to cut them down, often with painful results lasting for days. I would recommend this brand to anyone. My daughter was very pleased with her one-time use. Works wonders. Hope it lasts for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well. Especially like the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
    <li> Was having issues with the skin tearing on my big toe and the balls of my feet. Used this about 4 times and just like magic my feet are good to go. No more sore feet. Even my husband (who thought it was a waste of money) gave it a try.</li>
    <li> This is a cute purple callus remover! I love the color and that it goes with my other &amp;#34;grooming items&amp;#34;. It matches my hello kitty items. It came precharged and ready to run right out of the box. Its powerful enough to remove the callus quickly and offers 2 speeds. Unlike other removers it includes a work light which offers the ability to see the callus better in bad lighting. In my house we don&#x27;t have ceiling lights so the light was super handy. We love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received one or more products for review purposes only. Despite the free item, my opinions remain 100% Honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Good prices and works great!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product.  Easy to use and absolutely works.  My heels look great and no dryness.  Perfect for the summer</li>
    <li> I have been using the product 3-4 times a week for 2 weeks now, and my calluses are nearly gone.  This product definitely works.  The only tricky thing is learning how to hold it without putting pressure on it, which stops the grinder from moving.  You don&#x27;t need to apply pressure.  I use it while is plugged in because with the batteries, it the grinder slows down.</li>
    <li> Works very well on rough skin on the feet.  Though it seems to slowly lose power as you have it on more than 5+ minutes.  Glad it&#x27;s rechargeable, otherwise you&#x27;ll probably use a lot of batteries.</li>
    <li> I love it! Both for my feet and for MY DOGS FEET!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two heads so you can have one for you and another for a loved one (even fur babies)&lt;br /&gt;It has two speeds and a light which helps illuminate the area for better visual ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a guard that leaves a small slit of the stone exposed jut a perfect size for filing down my dogs sharp nails and then I used it with out the guard to gently buff the rough spots in her pads that were so rough they were scratching me. Perfect tool for a paw-dicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price...thanks</li>
    <li> This is the BEST item I have ever purchased for my feet! Forget the Ped Egg this beats this by a mile! I could only use it on one foot after getting it last night because it wasn&#x27;t fully charged yet but let me just say that I have a new foot! I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and she has fallen in love with it. She loves the fact that it is rechargeable so that it is always ready to go. And l love how soft her feet are becoming. Great product! It does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> My usual pedi place even made a comment about how nice and smooth my feet are. Easy to use, delivery was on time, charged quickly etc...</li>
    <li> Anyone else tired of the nasty calluses on their feet? Ashamed of wearing sandals or going outside because you are bothered by the dryness? I was too. Until I came across Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic Callus Remover. Usually I have used the old standard callus removers that take so much time and feel like you are rubbing sandpaper on the bottom of your feet. No good eh. I usually get calluses like no other. I am always ashamed of wanting to go get a pedicure done at a salon because I don&#x27;t want them to look at me funny. You know we all get that way. Take the hassle out of the callus removing process with one simple step. This rechargeable electronic callus remover is so simple anyone can do it. I was pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this product. Usually I can never really remove those calluses. First impression of this product was the sleek package it comes in would be a great mother day gift! Its box is so adorable with a purple flower on it. I actually love the color purple. In fact the product is white &amp; purple with iridescent speckles of glitter on it. So cute! Ready for a pedi anyone?&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived actually sooner than expected. A couple days actually. It came double wrapped in a USPS bubble mailer. That is fantastic considering USPS isn&#x27;t careful with packages. I opened the package up and saw it was in a box. Then opened the box up. It came with everything needed to remove calluses.&lt;br /&gt;I really love the fact that this is rechargeable. No more buying extra batteries. Saves time &amp; money.&lt;br /&gt;Once I used the product I was SHOCKED how easily it removed my calluses. Without hurting! Usually other callus removers use blades to scrap off the dead skin BUT this new technology doesn&#x27;t. Its safer than ever! Don&#x27;t ever be worried you will cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;My mother saw this product and by unfortunate accident broke her ankle so she is excited to use this once her foot is healed. We got to make her feet look fabulous afterwards! I am excited I can finally remove my calluses without too much effort. I can finally feel happy again with my feet. None of us likes having dry feet do we? This product is so much more than I expected it to be. The price is rather affordable considering all it comes with. Its sleek design is perfect for a spa night with the girlfriends.&lt;br /&gt;Want to buy your mother a gift but have no idea what to buy her? This is a great idea! Your mother would love it! I know mine doested I can finally remove my calluses without too much effort. I can finally feel happy again with my feet. None of us likes having dry feet do we? This product is so much more than I expected it to be. The price is rather affordable considering all it comes with. Its sleek design is perfect for a spa night with the girlfriends.&lt;br /&gt;Want to buy your mother a gift but have no idea what to buy her? This is a great idea! Your mother would love it! I know mine does</li>
    <li> This has my feet looking summer ready! Even my fiance used it on a callous on his toe, and it worked beautifully. The light is great, you&#x27;ll be able to see exactly what your doing. I love that it is rechargeable because who wants to deal with batteries in 2015? The roller heads last a very long time and can definitely tackle the thickest skin!</li>
    <li> wrote one last few days</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;ll say it again...Wow! that&#x27;s how I feel about this product! I am beyond happy with this product,I have rough feet and am plagued with them cracking alot because of them being so dry.This electronic pedicure file is A-mazing! When I plugged this in and started it up I knew immediately that it was going to be a great product.So,I used this on my dry feet and it worked so good! It made my feet baby soft and my feet are never baby soft! It sanded all the rough patches off and left healthy smooth skin behind.Let me get to what comes in the package when you receive this product.You get the device with wall outlet cord attached plus 2 sanding heads, a little brush to clean off the device and of course an instruction booklet on how to use your device.I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! Go get one! You need this electronic pedicure filer in your life!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own.</li>
    <li> Love this product! No more need for pedicures unless it&#x27;s for a treat. Love me smooth and pretty feet!</li>
    <li> As soon as I used it, my feet were noticeably softer and they feel great! It&#x27;s super effective and very easy to clean as well</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s very gentle and quite effective.</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK! The charge indicator light did not come on when charging. I charged it as instructed, more than once. When I powered it on, it would run for a few seconds then die. When I touched it to skin, it died immediately. But even worse than that, I think this was a returned item and therefore possibly used by someone else.</li>
    <li> I walk barefoot all the time, even out on the concrete. So my feet were in really rough shape. This devise is absolutely amazing! I have used it just twice and my feet are as good as a professional manicure already! My only complaint is the battery life is short, but it is rechargeable and if you really needed to, it can be used plugged in. Excellent product for the price...it exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> This device is very easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt and barely tickles.  It is the perfect size to be able to grip in your palm securely.  It came with two heads and a travel bag which is very much appreciated.  I  walk around my house a lot with bare feet so my heals get dry.  This device is much better to use than a manual grater or pumice stone.</li>
    <li> does a really good job and while most men might not think of using this product, after trying it out i would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Starting out good...hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> As soon as I got this production, I had tried it on and it was pretty amazing. I can literally see how it can get rid of my calluses on my feet! You just have to make sure that you don&#x27;t press too hard or stay on the same spot for 3-5secs so you don&#x27;t have to hurt yourself from over scrubbing. The product comes with an extra roller, a string pouch, an electric charger (yep, no running out of batt) a little brush for cleaning, manual and the callus remover apparatus. It had a tiny light that helps you see the spot where you are working at. I just wish i&#x27;d knew about a callus remover earlier. My feet are very happy!!! Im so happy also to try this product for a discounTed price!!</li>
    <li> OK if I had written this review the first week or two of purchase, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. In the beginning, this machine is great. However, after just 6 weeks, the thing is dead. I tried to recharge it several times but the roller is struggling. It was good while it lasted but not worth $35. It should be described as disposable and sold at a much lower price.</li>
    <li> I was all excited when I received this in mail.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to charge it overnight and tried it the very next day.  Turned it on, ready to rock, drum roll please...the battery only lasted a good 10-15 seconds!  I was thinking I didn&#x27;t charge it long enough.  Charged it overnight one more time and tried it again the next day.  It better be good this time.  Heart was beating like I&#x27;ve just finished 200 sit-ups.  Turned it on, ready to rock, drum roll please...the battery only lasted 10-15 seconds!  Again?!  Really?  I then tried to see if that&#x27;s the battery or machine problem.  I plugged it in and used it.  No problem.  Contacted the seller the next day and I received the replacement not long after.  Good customer service.  One thing I want to tell the fellow buyers or potential buyers.  You have to charge it every time after use or you can only use it for less than couple of minutes the very next time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, would buy again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as I thought it would be, but it does the job really well. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, but the battery lasts quite a while without me having to recharge it. Great so far. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the purchase if you&#x27;re just doing some fine tuning.</li>
    <li> I bought  this rechargeable callus remover and like it.It beat going to see my doctor to remove it.</li>
    <li> I wish the roller head had been wider than what it is now. I have amope. It is better than this item.</li>
    <li> This is a great unit. I have used it a couple of times now and I have to say that I am very impressed! I moved to an extremely dry climate a year and a half ago and my heels turned to lava crust, -ya know...like velcro on the carpet. Embarrassing!  Not anymore, thanks to Bella. It works really well, is easy to use/hold, doesn&#x27;t take long to charge -I LOVE that it isn&#x27;t attached to a cord when you use it -I can sit outside and let that callus dust just blow away in the wind :)! With this and a decent foot lotion -my feet are back to normal. Yay. Thanks Bella!</li>
    <li> I really do love this Callus Remover to the point that I have told both my sister&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;My twin is a fanatic about her feet, and my younger sister could care less.  But I think I have them both talked into purchasing the callus remover.  I really love how easy it is to use and what a fantastic job it does.  I have always had problems with Calluses on the bottom of my feet and the inside of my big toe, not anymore, the Naturalico Electronic Pedicure has helped remove the calluses on my feet and big toe.  It&#x27;s great for me because my one ankle isn&#x27;t as flexible since I broke it years ago, and the Electronic Pedicure let&#x27;s me reach the bottom of my foot with ease. I love this Electronic Pedicure.  My feet  have never felt so soft, seriously.  I am truly amazed.!</li>
    <li> Total waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m really bummed as I had high hopes.  I can&#x27;t return it because I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> The item came by UPS and was packed real good. I used it after my shower and it  worked real good. I have very dry and callus feet so this helped. I would  suggest it to friends.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome pedicure tool!  Both my husband and I have used it, and it works really, really well!  No more rough heels or knees in our house.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and with seller.</li>
    <li> wonderful product. I like this electric Remover, the package is beautiful box, with a good shape condition. I just follow the direction, I charge first before i start cleaning my foot, wash with water and dry with towel everything is clean , after done charging so  i start doing my amazing  callus remover., works well with a good shape in my foot callus.. Im very happy and satisfied the electric remover is perfect and evertyhign is smooth and easy . I got this product  with a good price discount for product promotions in exchange of product reviews unbiased and honest one. I will recommend this product it is great and works perfect for me.</li>
    <li> My sister owns an electric callus remover, she told me how soft her feet has become, and she was so satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give it a try, especially that I am a mom of 4 kids, and I don&#x27;t have time to visit a beauty center.&lt;br /&gt;I received my electric callus on time. Shipping was fast, and the product arrived in a good shape.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited about trying it out, but I had to charge it first. It was completely charged in about 4 hours, the red light turned green when the charging process was complete.&lt;br /&gt;I turned it on and started using it as instructed in the manual. I saw dead skin removed in front of my eyes, and I was so happy with that. It was much easier that using a manual callus remover, and much more effective. My feet were very dry, but it only took two sessions to get soft feet! I believe the before and after photos below say it all!&lt;br /&gt;I am really satisfied by the results that I achieved using this device from Naturalico. And I would recommend it to my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this callus remover for free in exchange for an honest review, all opinions are my own and based on my own experience.</li>
    <li> Through the years I have tried many different ways to remove calluses and dry skin from my feet with limited success,  This Naturalico Electronic instrument is by far the best and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has to deal with this condition.  I am 100% satisfied........I love it!!</li>
    <li> Works great, love it.</li>
    <li> This is so nice. It looks very pretty, easy to use. I want to start wearing sandals but I have a lot of calluses. This is so easy to use, fits right in my hand and does a great job! I am very impressed. After one use, I can really tell a difference. Time to buy some nice summer sandals. I am recommending this to all my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I just love my Naturalico callus remover. I always have rough heels and it&#x27;s embarrassing to wear sandals because it it, but I bought this on Amazon and I absolutely love this product. My heels are so much smooth now. You wouldn&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
    <li> I love this! It saves so much time, and now I do not dread this part of my pedicure anymore, and it does a GREAT job.</li>
    <li> I was not sure how well this would do the job, but was pleasantly surprised at how smooth it has left my feet.  Since I was not sure how long to run it over my feet, I have just run it briefly a few times and have been very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have really bad callus on both of my feet.  It takes me for ever to sand them.  But not with this Electric Callus remover it just takes minutes.  It is a good envestment for me.</li>
    <li> The one i received from amazon doesn&#x27;t work very well. I would assume the charger is semi broken since the red light only appears for 15 seconds before it dims off. It also appears to be used, probably from a returned customer since it has no instruction and the roller appears to be used.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Grace, i would assume she is the CS for the manufacturer of this product and soon received a new one. The new one works well and really helps smooths your feet. For someone like me who has very little callus on my feet it only helps to remove some of the dead skins and make my skin smoother, it didn&#x27;t really remove a lot of the callus off maybe if the motor is stronger. However, i had my mom tried it, whom has really dry and thick callus feet and she said it isn&#x27;t as thick and dry anymore and also commented that her feet is a lot smoother now. Only main complaint is wish the motor is stronger so i can apply a bit more pressure to my foot to remove the dry skin more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though i received a bad one from amazon, I didn&#x27;t bother to return it for refund since i did get a new one in return and am pleased with it. If i did return it, another buyer will end up receiving the bad one i got and will be dissatisfied with the product. When that buyer returns it, it will create a repeat cycle. I just wish Amazon doesn&#x27;t resell the stuffs that is being returned and instead send it back to the seller to fix it, but eh, they probably don&#x27;t check it and as long as it works they will just resell it.</li>
    <li> Less power than I expected.</li>
    <li> It would not recharge the battery within a week after I received it.</li>
    <li> Smooths feet quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t as powerful as I expected, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I really like this piece of junk. If it were cheaper, I&#x27;d buy a few of them,, but it&#x27;s too expensive in my opinion,</li>
    <li> This item was a gift and the recipient is well pleased with the product, as it performs as advertised and does all that the seller said.  Feet so smooth you will be proud to show them off to your friends !</li>
    <li> great product...works just as advertised.  I would recommend this item to anyone.  My feet are so soft.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely thrilled and totally amazed by this great Pedicure Callus Remover. I saw awesome results with the very first use. When the product arrived I charged it overnight and then my husband volunteered to use it on my feet. This is so simple to use that I could of quickly and easily did it myself, but since he offered I wasn&#x27;t going to say &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;. Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we started off on the low setting. I wanted to see how it would feel. He ran it across the rough areas of my feet for a few seconds at a time just as directed. It actually tickled quite a bit. I found myself laughing a lot which made it fun. You could see the little particles being filed off. I highly recommend doing this over some newspaper or maybe in the bath tub so the dead skin can be collected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we got to my heels which is the worst part of my feet, he switched it to the high setting. It also tickled a bit but really filed down that super rough heel skin. I am so very impressed with this wonderful Pedicure Callus Remover. I use to use the &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; style pedicure products for filing my feet. Never again after trying this product. This is ten times easier and twenty times faster. My entire feet were done in just a couple minutes per foot. And the results were like a professional pedicure. I washed my feet before and after using the foot file and at the end applied some good lotion. My feet couldn&#x27;t be more soft and smooth than they are after using this fantastic product. It works well, it&#x27;s very easy, and super effective. I definitely recommend this. I would give it more than 5 stars if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to try for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.</li>
    <li> All for the price of ONE pedicure, the Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic Pedicure Foot File and Callus Remover works on my feet quickly to remove caluses. I cannot say enough about how much more effective this is to the other products that are on the market like a certain little egg, that works wonderfully the first time or two, but then just putters out and stops working when it becomes slightly dull. Overall, I am very happy with the Naturalico Pedicure Foot File and Callus Remover!&lt;br /&gt;-item received fro review purposes, no compensation received</li>
    <li> I hate feet all together, I hate having rough feet, I walk everyday pushing a stroller to pick up my 2 children from school, but my feet have been rough before then. It all started really since high school. I am 30 right now and at 16 I started my first job as a hostess. I was on my feet 12 hours a day it was horrific, My feet were always rough, had a lot of callus. My feet were wrinkly from the sweat, as I got older I had different jobs, walmart, wendy’s , also, I worked at a few dancing clubs which now I am not ashamed of due to the fact it helped me through college. There has been many times I walked to my jobs, school anywhere I had to go. I even took the bus system a lot to get where I had to go, then I had children, and the walking became more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always wanted to try a callus at home pedicure to see if it will help my feet,&lt;br /&gt; I felt that hopefully this would help my gross feet where I only wanted to wear sneakers, so, I was waiting to try this and cant wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came is a elegant closable box where you can put it back, it comes with the pedicure unit, the charger, 2 sanders for the machine. I was charged all ready to go, and my husband stopped me, and he asked what it was and I told him its to help my feet getting the callus’s off and make them smooth and not so rough so I will feel more comfortable in flip flops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the caring loving husband I have decided he was going to give me a foot pedicure. Let me tell you this is more than I ever expected I am in love. It made my feet so soft and smooth, the callus and lumps on my toes are almost gone after I been using this almost 3 weeks and my husband massages them every other day. I have to say this is my best friend.&lt;br /&gt;You can get your very own&lt;br /&gt;Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic Pedicure at Amazon.</li>
    <li> The rotating head on this is very strong, the buffing part of it is a low grit, taking less turns to get the dead skin off. The two speed setting is nice, but I usually just use it on the high setting to get the job done faster. I really like that this model lets you plug it into the wall to charge it instead of having to constantly change out the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:343e009dabaac5a2c2e2de60beb82c3b]] Cali Julz says...&lt;br /&gt;This Callus Remover couldn&#x27;t be easier to use. Make sure your feet are dry, then gently move it along your foot, stopping on those rough spots and calluses, but not too long, they recommend short bursts instead of steady pressure. The LED light really helps see trouble spots on the back of feet. After you&#x27;re done simply rinse feet with warm water and put on lotion or moisturizing foot cream. My feet felt softer and smoother after one session.&lt;br /&gt;I am so ready for sandal season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spirit of full disclosure, I was given the above mentioned product free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Really nice device! Love the speed and easy of it. The best thing about this is the fact it&#x27;s rechargeable and portable. Yes you can take this anywhere with you and yes it really works. It makes your feet feel really smooth and very easy to use. This would make a great gift for female or male and yes I would refer my friends and family to use. I received free to review and give my unbiased opinion of this product!👣</li>
    <li> Very weak motor. slows down dramatically when coming in contact with skin. I would not purchase this item again! Would not recommend either.</li>
    <li> The device doesn&#x27;t charge - the charge light stays red after all day charging.  Then lasts only a couple minutes before dying.  The roller speed and strength is also woeful.  A piece of junk we&#x27;ll return.</li>
    <li> Works ok; easy to use. Gentle skin remover. Used it about 10 times so far, no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others and have returned, this one actually seems to work on my feet</li>
    <li> Works wonders on dry heels :)</li>
    <li> You were great, seems to work fine.  Only regret, my fault, I ordered 2, 1  for my great aunt and she could not use her unit due to her diabetes.  Therefore I lost my shipping, but it was not your fault.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Makes the job a lot easier.  It is not meant to be used with hard pressure.  Light, slow strokes gets it done.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this as a part of the Amazon trader reviews. Overall, I was happy with the purchase and I did feel it did a good job removing my callus, eventually. I am so used to having to apply pressure for a manual callus removal that I wanted to do the same with this product, but it would cause the head to stop spinning or slow way down. Very little pressure is needed for it to work. I did feel that although I got a good result, it definitely took a while and I would have liked it to have a little more oompf behind it. Overall it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased when I was given the opportunity to review the Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic Pedicure Foot File and Callus Remover. One luxury I really enjoyed was getting pedicures on my feet. Not so much for the polished toes but because I noticed a difference in my skin and how my feet felt. Over time, I could tell when I was over due for a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With watching our expenses, pedicures were something I gave up for our budget. I do miss them. I was hopeful that the Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic Pedicure Foot File and Callus Remover would bring some of that special pampered feeling back to my feet. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally thought that the smooth feeling would come after using lotion on my feet, but I really don&#x27;t even need the lotion to feel the smooth skin. After I use the Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic Pedicure Foot File and Callus Remover my skin immediately feels smoother, and thankfully not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it is rechargeable so that I don&#x27;t need to replace batteries. Right out of the box, it did need about 16 hours of charge time before the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to suggest an improvement, I would like the spinning force to be a bit stronger. There are times that I apply the Naturalico Rechargeable Electronic Pedicure Foot File and Callus Remover to my foot and the spinning stops from additional pressure. I know this is a safety feature but I would like it to be able to apply a bit more force before it being too much for the device to handle. My work around for this problem is to use the device in a back and forth buffing motion and it seems to get after those pesky areas that need a bit more tough loving.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and she says it is more powerful than other units she have used. She just charged up the Bella unit and it&#x27;s ready to use. Best part no batteries ! Nice looking and easy to hold in her hand.  Thanks for sending the replacement heads for my wife to use. They are well made and so easy to pop on the unit.</li>
    <li> Used prodigiously, yet noticed no result. A great idea, but not made for serious callouses.</li>
    <li> This skin removing shaver has made my home a better place. It has truly changed my life and made the world I inhabit a better place. No, I don&#x27;t use the damn thing - my wife does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is my life better because of this? Because she is happy. Her heels are smooth and resemble those of a human being once more. Never again will the razor edged daggers that were the flesh of my wife&#x27;s feet slash a sheet through to snag on the mattress springs. Never will I need to flee before her cold feet in the dark of the night when she places them in the warm soft flesh of my lower back when we sleep in our bed. The fact that the school children at the local pool will stop bursting into tears when she removes her shoes and steps into the cool waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though - my wife is happy. Did I care what her heels looked like? Not in the slightest, but I DO care what she thinks of herself and this machine (on top of an impressive battery life and strength to trim hardened skin) made her happy about her feet in a way that I didn&#x27;t think was possible. If you are having a foot issue that calls for this sort of device - I think this product could make you very happy.</li>
    <li> my wife says it is a useless shaver, it does not have enough power to do what is advertised it will do.When you press it down it will stop.&lt;br /&gt;want to buy it back?</li>
    <li> The Naturalico Foot File while wireless actually has a wonderful motor that allows the file to spin with outstanding stability. No hangups if you press to hard and the safety guard keeps you from getting carried away. Personally I love to wear shoes that shoe off my feet, especially living in the Texas heat. Calluses are inevitable with that kind of constant use on my feet. Trying other manual file products I would find myself exhausted just trying to make a dent in minimal areas. So much work for such a disappointing result. The Naturalico however, you can see the dead skin fly. May sound gross but it gets the job done and way cheaper than a salon. The chromed purple is very elegant and sleek giving the entire tool a chic look and feel. The added light makes it much easier to see close up, especially if your in poor lighting. Overall I think this tool is a must have for those who like exposed feet. It even comes with an additional file head so there is no telling how long this tool will last before you need a replacement head. - See more at: http://www.frugalmomandwife.com/2015/06/naturalico-rechargeable-electronic.html</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works, without the possibility of going too deep.  It&#x27;s messy, so sit outside or in your shower.  I&#x27;ve been enjoying my smooth heels all day.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING.. my feet are baby soft!</li>
    <li> Works just like it claims!</li>
    <li> good product but short recharge battery life</li>
    <li> So far so good!!! :-)</li>
    <li> Nice product.  It serves it&#x27;s purpose.  Nice that there are replacement heads.  Product came in very good packaging.  wish that it could be use, in shower</li>
    <li> Very effective and gentle.  I like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible tool!  It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!  It does away with calluses in just a few seconds!  It was such a pleasure to be able to throw away all those other tools I had bought to get rid of my calluses and dead skin!  If you are tired of wasting money on products  that don&#x27;t deliver, this is for you!!!</li>
    <li> I like that it recharges, but wish the head was flexible to reach an awkwardly located callus.</li>
    <li> Works Great! After several uses my feet are smooth. Very easy to use. Charge last for several uses.</li>
    <li> this really does the job. I would have given it 5 stars but I have to charge it after every use.</li>
