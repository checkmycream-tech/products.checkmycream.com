      <li>My feet look normal again. :)</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re dry it&#x27;ll feel like mixing sand with oily lotion and it doesn&#x27;t spread as good</li>
      <li>But this one is just right.  </li>
      <li>Love the texture and especially the peppermint smell.</li>
      <li>It is a very different foot scrub, but I love it.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t know it went for more than ten dollars.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s just something to be aware of.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs and lotions because for some reason my legs are super rough; I&#x27;ve even tried to use the ped-egg on the them, yeah,</li>
      <li>Very minty smell</li>
      <li>I found in very relaxing.</li>

      <li>highly recommend this scrub.</li>
      <li>I use it on all dry or rough spots, including elbows, and it&#x27;s effective at exfoliating.</li>

      <li>Makes my feet soft and it wakes me up in the morning!</li>
      <li>Now my skin is incredibly soft and I find my self caressing it in disbelief!</li>
      <li>I use it in conjunction with be natural callus remover.</li>
      <li>I noticed that my feet were becoming rough and dry.</li>
      <li>You will notice a difference with just one use, especially if you have super dry skin.</li>
      <li>It worked like a miracle on my super dry and rough legs and the rest of my body.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, works well on feet, but it&#x27;s sloppy to use and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>And I really love that it doesn&#x27;t contain any heavy oils that makes the shower floor slick.</li>

    <li> Smells great and husband really feels pampered.</li>
    <li> I got this scrub as a gift and I didn&#x27;t know it went for more than ten dollars. It worked like a miracle on my super dry and rough legs and the rest of my body. I used it on my upper arms and it removed the little dried up pimple-like bumps. I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs and lotions because for some reason my legs are super rough; I&#x27;ve even tried to use the ped-egg on the them, yeah, it was that bad and only made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is specifically for use on your feet but in my opinion it works much better on other parts of the body except for your face; it gave me a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this scrub. You will notice a difference with just one use, especially if you have super dry skin. Now my skin is incredibly soft and I find my self caressing it in disbelief!</li>
    <li> Love the feel, the effects and scent.  This is tops for maintenance.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I am deployed to Afghanistan, and the water here dries everything out -- hair, skin, eyeballs, you name it. The ladies in my unit get together for mani/pedi days (hey, we keep inviting the guys, they just don&#x27;t wanna!), so I ordered this product a couple of weeks ago. We had mani/pedi time this morning, and this product was a huge hit! Great stuff. It smells fabulous and leaves skin smooth (I even used some on my hands ... I&#x27;m a nurse, I wash hands a lot and they&#x27;re a mess!). My feet look normal again. :)</li>
    <li> This works awesome!  Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this pumice. It is difficult to find a foot scrub that has enough pumice in it.  They are either too oily or too thick.  But this one is just right.  I love the scent, and the tingly feel on my feet.  And I really love that it doesn&#x27;t contain any heavy oils that makes the shower floor slick.</li>
    <li> Strong peppermint odor. Texture is only slightly grainy. Beware... the bottom of the tub gets slippery as this product is being rinsed off.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is often more effective than a pumice stone. The scent is pleasing, relaxing; the peppermint gives a tingle to your skin, making the whole process of removing dead skin and calluses​ into a massage.</li>
    <li> smells awesome in the shower very strong peppermint smell adding it with the pedi foot buffer to get a better effect on my feet.</li>
    <li> Live this lotion keeps my feet soft and isn&#x27;t greasy!</li>
    <li> Love the texture and especially the peppermint smell. Feels great. It is a very different foot scrub, but I love it.</li>
    <li> Feet feel great after this scrub. Don&#x27;t expect miracles in a one time use... this does not substitute a pedi but maintains that relaxing-clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I bought this online on the body shop website. I have never used anything on my feet until last year I noticed that my feet were becoming rough and dry. I have tried many foot scrubs and now I found the one I liked. I admit that I liked this scrub better than all the others I have tried. It is a foaming scrub which I liked a lot. It is a bit expensive at the body shop store. So next time I will be buying it on Amazon. The only problem I faced is the packaging that is why I gave it four star. I liked tube packaging better than this one. I highly recommend it for dry rough feet.</li>
    <li> This scrub went above and beyond my expecations. My feet have never been smoother.</li>
    <li> The container was a little bit smaller than I expected, it fits on my hand, (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;1). The scrub is AMAZING! Very minty smell but it&#x27;s not overpowering. I found in very relaxing. I found it&#x27;s best used with either damp hands or damp feet. If you&#x27;re in the shower with your feet wet you won&#x27;t get the super grainy experience. If you&#x27;re dry it&#x27;ll feel like mixing sand with oily lotion and it doesn&#x27;t spread as good, it&#x27;s just something to be aware of. I was very fond of the base of the scrub, it&#x27;s squishy to the the touch yet not so squishy so it&#x27;s easy to work with. It even helped reduce some swelling because of the mint.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the Body Shop Peppermint Foot products and will continue to order them. They make my feet feel wonderful and soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and have ordered it a number of times. I need a bucket economy size! I use it on all dry or rough spots, including elbows, and it&#x27;s effective at exfoliating. But it also is incredibly refreshing. Smells so wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is the best foot scrub I have found.  The scent is very nice, the pumice is just right (not too coarse, not too fine) and I like that it suds a bit.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, works well on feet, but it&#x27;s sloppy to use and doesn&#x27;t last long. Some of every bit I scooped out to use ended up on the bathtub floor and not on my feet, no matter how careful I tried to be. I found these negatives outweighed the positives overall.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot scrub I have ever used.It is refreshing and the pumice is gentle but effective! I won&#x27;t use any others now.</li>
    <li> The lotion is oily and provides little to no cooling affect.  Teh smell is terrible.  A poor purchasing decision on my part and a mistake I won&#x27;t make again.</li>
    <li> I LIVE THIS STUFF. Makes my feet soft and it wakes me up in the morning! :) I love the strong peppermint smell</li>
    <li> Good stuff, maybe a bit over priced.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hands too, for roughness</li>
    <li> I love the smell of peppermint and I love the cool feeling it leaves your feet. It definately has to be used with a pumice stone but it&#x27;s still a really good product and I definately will be buying again. I use it in conjunction with be natural callus remover.</li>
