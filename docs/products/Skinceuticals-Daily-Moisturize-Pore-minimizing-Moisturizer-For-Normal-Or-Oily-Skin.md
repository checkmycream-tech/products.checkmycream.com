      <li>I liked about it:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>

      <li>Product is very light.</li>

      <li>i love this lotion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this cream. The skin just soaks up the cream and leaves the skin feeling real soft.</li>
    <li> In recent years, my skin has gone from very oily to combination. I am in my 30&#x27;s and I struggle with dry patches of skin, but need to use blotting paper by mid-day to keep my oily skin at bay. I have used Murad, Decleor, Pevonia (which broke me out into tiny pimples/clogged pores!), and recently tried Skinceuticals and cannot be happier. I use Skinceuticals face wash, followed by Murad Radiance Serum, followed by this moisturizer, and my face has cleared up. I would say this lotion might not be good for heavy winters as it is pretty light. However, it has helped reduce my pore size and is nice and whipped. I have recently ordered the Skinceuticals Renew Overnight-Normal/Dry Skin Moisturizer and C Plus AHA Serum to bolster my Skinceuticals regime, and I am expecting great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is on the high side, but I am not against spending money on taking good care of my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer before putting on make-up everyday.  It is light weight, non greasy, and absorbs quickly.  Perfect moisurizer</li>
    <li> This moisturizer really cleared the rash I had on my forehead.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I think it works best with the skinceutical sunblock.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and this is the only product I can use and your price was less than all the others. [[ASIN:B001CJCFBK Skinceuticals  Daily Moisturize Pore-minimizing Moisturizer For Normal Or Oily Skin, 2-Ounce Jar]]</li>
    <li> It is expensive, but works for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was not blown away by this moisturizer but it has its good points. 1 is not greasy feeling, it lasts a long time, does not break me out, and has a nice consistency. Negatives it if you have really dry skin this will not help much, very costly, and don&#x27;t like the jar package. Otherwise will use what I have left and probably switch to a less expensive option.</li>
    <li> Totally my fault, I normally order the daily moister which I love!!! I did not realize there was a difference. The normal one is awesome!! This one, emollience smells like an over the counter and has a different texture.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this line of skin care.  i have only used it for 6 weeks and can see results.  I is just slightly more expensive than the major brands, but since it works, it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Skinceauticals is the best.  I love this moisterizer - it doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy - you only need a little - it goes a long way... my skin has never been better - love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for five years and I love it. But, I use it at night. Finding a very light night time cream was difficult, so this was recommended by my skin specialist. It only takes a bit on the finger tips, dot sparingly and blend over face immediately after washing off makeup. During the day I use a spf 30 sunscreen under my makeup. This replaces the need for a daytime moisturizer. My sunscreen is also a SkinCeuticals&#x27; product.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I used it a couple years ago, and my skin loved it.  I use Age Management Systems&#x27; Herbal Glycolic Wash with it.  Switched to drug store brands to save money, and then the one good one I found was discontinued.  After I tried a new moisturizer, i had had enough.  Decided to spend the money to get the good stuff.  Was very happy to find this moisturizer here for 25% less than anywhere else, and with Amazon Prime I paid no shipping.  After just a few days using this moisturizer and the face wash mentioned above, my skin already looks SO much better!  Definitely worth the money, and a great deal from Amazon :D</li>
    <li> Love it! Very light, gets easily absorbed, highly moisturizing without leaving skin oily. Perfect for combination skin! I break out much less since I&#x27;ve been using it and my skin feels so soft!</li>
    <li> I have always used skinceuticals products and been very happy. But I started using this 2 months ago and it has caused me to break out severely! I am very unhappy with this product</li>
    <li> I have tried other types of moisturizers from Skinceuticals. I haven&#x27;t had trouble with any of them yet.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Pore-minimzing one and like it so far.</li>
    <li> i love this lotion. it is very light weight, absorbs quickly and feels very natural on skin. i haven&#x27;t noticed pore minimizing effect but as a moisturizer it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much of this product. Covers your face with a small amount and blends well. Love it</li>
    <li> i wanted to love this - but it feels super oily when it goes on. It does dry quickly which is its saving grace. Overall i&#x27;m still looking for a replacement for the Dr. Dennis Gross Age Erase Moisture mega-10 plus that is being phased out of existance.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use any other skincare line. It&#x27;s the best I have ever found!</li>
    <li> Best day cream out there</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer. Works really well except after a few hrs use it gets a little sticky. Otherwise very good product.</li>
    <li> This is my second tub of this moisturizer. It&#x27;s a really great consistency and feels kind of whipped and light and looks almost opalescent. It absorbs into my skin quickly and keeps my skin soft. One star off for the tub packaging.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, outbreak prone skin, which is a trick at mid 40s. This is the only moisturizer I have found that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It has a light texture and no discernible fragrance. It does also have a slight exfoliating effect which can cause some very slight tingling occasionally. This which works well for me as other AHAs or BHAs don&#x27;t work for my sensitive skin. I love it and the price through Amazon is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> i have been using skinceuticals for a few years now,  and every time i try to save a little money and go back to a less expensive brand (olay, l&#x27;oreal...) i can feel and see the difference.  i feel anything skinceuticals is worth the price. instead of wasting time swaying back and forth, just try it once and see if there is a difference to you.</li>
    <li> Terrible broke out w this product and the nite time cream</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is so nice on my skin!  It is very silky and it just feels delicious!!  I have a ranch in south Texas and after being out on the ranch, working in the sun, this stuff makes my face feel sooo much better!!</li>
    <li> the best face lotion!  light yet so moisturizing!  It does last for a long time even though the jar is small.  I have been using it for years and have had great results with clear smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for a couple of years &amp; like it very much. The item was delivered on time, but I was disappointed that the lid was cracked with broken pieces in the box. Didn&#x27;t get in the product so not a big deal.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was not for me. Male in my 20&#x27;s. I have large pores and began using the Cleansing Gel, Toner, and used this as my moisturizer. After using skinceuticals Toner I would use this moisturizer hoping to shrink my larger pores. It was extremely greasy which is not great when your trying to reduce pore size. It also caused my skin to react strangely. It felt like my skin was going through an acid peel. I quickly washed it off and went a couple days without using this moisturizer and did research to see if there was any chemical reactions I may have been combining wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not seeing anything out of the ordinary I tried using it again and, still greasy, it burned my face. Not sure if it was a bad batch since the safety seal was in tact. Would not buy again or see how it does what is advertised when consistency of product differs.</li>
    <li> I feel it was a good deal and I like the convenience of it coming straight to my house.</li>
    <li> A great price for this super light moisturizer! Thank you for the fast shipment also!</li>
    <li> Have been using the Daily Moisture for a few weeks now. Love the texture: whipped, soft, non-greasy and the way it takes care of my skin. I use it both as a day cream and before going to bed. Can&#x27;t comment on the pore size as that wasn&#x27;t an issue but the product works well for normal to oily skin</li>
    <li> Perfect product at a great value.  So glad I found this, I was paying a fortune in the salon. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It is OK daily moisturizer nothing so much special of it other than the price tag. Quite honestly, you can feel really good using either Olay or Neutrogena daily moisturizer with SPF benefits and can notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over a year and it does what it says.  My skin has improved greatly compared to other brands--no redness, goes on smoothly, and use it day and night.  Our daughter is using it now too.  The package was well wrapped and delivery was received in a few days.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat acne-prone skin. For a while, I kept it under control with bc pills. But I went off bc a few months ago while I was using a different moisturizer called Doctorcos (which I love!) almost a year ago. I was pleasantly surprised that my acne stayed under control. But recently, I ran out of the Doctorcos moisturizer and decided to try a different moisturizer because it&#x27;s hard to find and it was going to take 15-20 days to arrive if I ordered from the amazon marketplace and I couldn&#x27;t wait that long (bad planning). So I picked Skinceuticals based on the reviews and the possibility that it might help with pore size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems I had with it:&lt;br /&gt;(1) It leaves my skin feeling and looking pretty greasy within half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;(2) It stings pretty significantly! Is it supposed to - maybe to be effective for tightening up those pores?! I don&#x27;t even have particularly sensitive skin so I was pretty concerned about this.&lt;br /&gt;(3) I broke out - it wasn&#x27;t severe but I suddenly went from having maybe 0-2 blemishes at any given time to 8-10 blemishes on my noise, cheeks, and jawline.&lt;br /&gt;(4) It leaves a slightly opaque white sheen if you don&#x27;t massage it in really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about it:&lt;br /&gt;(1) I like the light, slightly whipped texture (although not as light as my previous moisturizers, Doctorcos and Complex15)&lt;br /&gt;(2) I think my pores actually looked a bit better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I decided to order the Doctorcos and it finally arrived after two weeks so I&#x27;m just going to put this Skinceuticals aside for now. I&#x27;ll miss the effect it had on my pores but it&#x27;s not worth the breakouts and the greasiness. If you&#x27;re not acne-prone, this might be better suited for you than it was for me.</li>
    <li> A friend who sells skin care products told me this is the best brand to buy without wasting your money on pricey products that claim to give you great skin, so I have been using Skinceuticals daily moisture lotion for about 5 months now and can&#x27;t say I notice a big difference in my skin?  I like that it is light (not heavy) and absorbs nicely.  I have combination skin, but more on the dry side. That fact that this goes on nicely and is affordable is why I&#x27;m still using it until I find a better product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for three months. The cool feeling on application is a pleasurable experience. Skin just drinks in the creamy texture; whereas, other moisturizers feel like they just sit on the surface of the skin. Please, do try this moisturizer. You&#x27;ll like it. I promise.</li>
    <li> I previously used the Skincueticals regular Daily Moisturizer.  I liked it, but wanted to try this.  Love this! Was slightly cheaper than the regualr, and I&#x27;ve had better results with this. I also use [[ASIN:B001CJFEJA Skinceuticals  Renew Overnight Dry Skin-refining Moisturizer For Normal Or Dry Skin, 2-Ounce Jar]] at night!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years and still love it.  i love that it doesn&#x27;t make my combination skin feel greasy but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry either.  i do get some really dry patches (dermatitis) but i just put a double dose of this cream on those and they are good.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this, here is her feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. It didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout which is great since I have combination, acne prone skin, but it also didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized. I actually started using Mary Kay&#x27;s moisturizer for oily skin and it works so much better than this. I felt Skinceuticals should have been much higher in quality than Mary Kay and should give me better results since it seems more high tech and obviously way more expensive, but, that wasn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Mary Kay isn&#x27;t for you, I recommend Ole Henriksen&#x27;s Sheer Transformation. They make quality products and this particular one is oil-free and has a ton of amazing ingredients. I&#x27;ll be going back to this once Mary Kay runs out. :  )</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product I have tried many occasionally get blackheads using this with cleanser has been wonderful my skin never looked better</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I love it. I recommend to others with sensitive skin.  It also smells good.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Quenches and softens skin. Be careful who you buy from. Real product sold at medical practices.</li>
    <li> This was by far the worse product I ever used on my face! I gave it a chance for 2 weeks. My face became red and almost looks burned! It was so sore i didn&#x27;t know what to use to relieve the pain. I ended up using VaniCream- cream not the lotion- I do use retina at nite and my skin is oily during the day  -but sensitive.  I do use the clarisonsic at nite  I&#x27;ve never used moisturizer- before.&lt;br /&gt;I never noticed  any difference in pore size- I wonder if that&#x27;s a gimic.&lt;br /&gt;At one point I got the Hydrating B12 Gel and used w the daily moisturizer- it was even worse! My face itched and became even more red!&lt;br /&gt;This line of expensive productnis Not for me!- beware- if your face shows any sign of sensitivity- I&#x27;d stay away from this product line. I use the Atopalm line now and I am very happy w the price and the effects on my skin!!</li>
    <li> Even if you have dry skin, I live in NC, and it never gets really cold. I use this for my everyday moisturizer year round, even though I am 55, and do not have oily skin. Many low oil creams feel funny, but this feels like a rich cream. Flawless under make up.</li>
    <li> Very light weight, and goes on smooth</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 years.  It does well with sensitive skin, dry skin.  Works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I tried everything on the market and nothing worked until I tried this.  My pores are smaller and my face looked a lot better.  Since the first use you notice.  A great product... and I will keep ordering it .</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer. Glad I found it, I think I&#x27;m going to try more products of Skinceuticals.</li>
    <li> Has really helped clear up my skin.  My dermatologist recommended.</li>
    <li> Great! Love this item. shipping was fast. awesome face cream!</li>
    <li> It does moisturize however skin feels greasy after 5 hours. it does not minimze pores at all.I do use other skinceutical products and love them but this product disappoints.</li>
    <li> been using it for about 2weeks, and noticed it is very light.  My skin does appear to be balanced but did not notice any changes to my pores.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer weather u r oily or combination skin.  Just another great product from skinceuticals again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is light and still moisturizing. I don&#x27;t think it has made my acne prone skin worse, and it does not lead to excessive oiliness like some other lotions. It is pricey but a little goes on a long way since it is so light weight.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and my skin appears smoother. I use day and night after cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful creme to put on after washing your face at night. It does help my skin look and feel softer. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Stung and burned my skin, not usually sensitive to skin care products, but had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Go to moisturizer. It absorbs quickly, and is not oily at all.</li>
    <li> Refreshing feel.  Light weight and not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a light moisturizer perfect under makeup.  For those of us over 40, you will need something more for nighttime.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like it. very thin and I don&#x27;t see the pore minimizing at all,not worth the money at all .</li>
    <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have very oily skin and have struggled to find the middle ground product that won&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave it feeling waxy. This product is perfect! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and haven&#x27;t had any issues with dry skin or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t noticed anything huge with the pore minimizing aspect of the product, but I wasn&#x27;t necessarily interested in the product for that sole reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, 5/5.</li>
    <li> I am 30 and have adult onset cystic acne do my skin gets really oily and my pores huge. I have been using other products to make my pores smaller including a clairsonic, but this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found to help with that. A little goes a long way. It leaves my skin with a soft dewey feel that is great under makeup (or not!) pores look smaller, skin feels soft. Goes on smooth and blends well. Not greasy at all. I bought it first in stores and then later on amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper. The product was the same.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Light not greasy. This is great in the winter when my skin gets super dry. I stopped using as it&#x27;s gotten hotter and more humid out though.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this product for a few weeks now. It is getting close to summer and the weather is getting hotter in the South.  I need a product that would stop my face from getting shiny.  I would say that the shine still seems to come through.  I was hoping it was more matifying but that was not the case.  I am not sure I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product but I love it so far! It keeps my skin feeling clean and pimple free</li>
    <li> Not sure if this moisturizer is an authentic Skinceuticals product.  The packaging looked identical to what I&#x27;ve had before, but I don&#x27;t know how Amazon can sell it for $20.00 less than the Official Skinceuticals web site.  The product seems to be okay (not greasy) and no adverse reaction to it........there is, however, no noticeable decrease in appearance of pore size.  I give it 3 stars - nothing sensational, but then what can you expect out of a jar for 63 year old skin!</li>
    <li> light weight little goes a long way..</li>
    <li> All great stuff ! Sent right away.</li>
    <li> Grest oroduct at nice price.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer, it&#x27;s silky, and something that was highly recommended, and I&#x27;m so happy I could find it through you!</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Never makes my skin look shiny and goes on really well under makeup. Has never caused me to break out. Love it.</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals Daily Moisturizer is the perfect moisture cream.  A nice light moisture cream that sinks into your skin.  Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. I love this moisture cream.</li>
    <li> Although this product is for normal to oily skin, it works great on my normal skin.  I do NOT have oily or dry skin.  I love the way it goes on and feels.  Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and works well under makeup or alone.  I would have given this product 5 stars if it had at least SPF 15 sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> Product us great. Price is cheaper through amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this cream it&#x27;s non greasy and glides on smooth works well under make up and helps make my skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> works okay but check out the list of ingredients&lt;br /&gt;will not buy again&lt;br /&gt;better to buy natural products, thought this brand would have better results</li>
    <li> 40-something Caucasian male. Used daily until gone. Not moisturizing enough &amp; didn&#x27;t minimize pores. Eventually added argan oil in order to stay moisturized.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Its so worth every penny. The feel of it on your skin is like no other. Definitely makes a difference with good cream. It lasts forever because all you need is a drop each day. Less it better! No grease, nice and smooth. Leaves a nice finish. Soaks in well. Reduces pore size for the majority of the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all and I mean ALL&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to this by my Doctors Staff&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a bit more pricey BUT worth it.&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re looking to improve your skin, control and stop breakouts&lt;br /&gt; This is one of the best, works fast too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the kit that has this lotion, the toner and the&lt;br /&gt;serum to control the breakouts!  it&#x27;s combined&lt;br /&gt;ingredients packs a powerful helpful product, you&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t feel like you wasted your money or time.&lt;br /&gt;Happier clearer skin..</li>
    <li> I never write product reviews. Ever. However, this product is so exceptional I decided to take the time. I am 28 and have had problem hormonal skin for several years, I&#x27;ve tried thousands of products, skinceuticals are pricey but I cannot say that the effects aren&#x27;t worth it. The moisturizer is light and your skin drinks it up on contact. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of moisturizers over the years,  but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is light and non-greasy,  but leaves your skin extra soft and glowy.  You also don&#x27;t need to use a lot,  just a little bit goes a long way,  so a  2 oz. jar should last  a long time.  Try it....you&#x27;ll be glad you did....I know I&#x27;m glad I did!!!</li>
    <li> Great price for a fabulous moisturizer. I have oily skin and it does the job without making my skin look and feel greasy. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is perfect for my combination skin!  You only need a small amount and it is just enough for my dry patches without leaving my skin shiny or oily.  I plan to order this again when mine runs out!</li>
    <li> I had very persistent acne, then underwent acutane treatment that reduced the production of oil in my skin, but it also did some weird things to my skin. Some areas are oily, some dry, so I can&#x27;t find the cream that would work for me. This one does. In addition, after you apply it, it give&#x27;s the skin a \\&quot;pearly\\&quot; glow. The only thing that I think it doesn&#x27;t do, is minimize the pores. They look the same before and after application, even few hours later. That is the only reason I did not give this moisturizer 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very light, smooth, silky and does minimize the look of pores. I have oily skin and I like it a lot.  You don&#x27;t have to use very much of it so the bottle should last a long time.</li>
    <li> i love the product alot.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that gets easily irritated by most moisturizers and creams, plus I am also very sensitive to strong fragrances. My medicine cabinet is full of only partially-used expensive department store designer creams or creams  sold only by dermatologists&#x27; offices that have either ended up making my skin break out, or become red and flaky. So, I was incredibly pleased by the Skinceuticals Daily Moisturizer. It has a light texture, and a very subtle fragrance. It goes on smooth, and it makes my skin look more soft and bright. The texture of my skin has more resiliency and plumpness.  I have been using this moiturizer daily for about two months now, which I&#x27;ve read is about the time it takes to notice any positive difference in your complexion when using a new facial product. I definitely notice the difference. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this moisturizer! I have oily, acne prone skin and this product does not cause breakouts or clogged pores! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Bought this moisturize pore-minimizing moisturizer expecting great results, but it seems that perhaps the poor minimizing compound caused my skin to break out. It&#x27;s cool and refreshing, but didn&#x27;t work on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m almost 50 &amp; look 30 ish. Not oily or clogging. Light &amp; easy wearing. In winter use slightly heavier Skinceutucal emollient. 5 years I paid spa prices. Much better online prices.</li>
    <li> Been using about a year. I have combo skin and this helps prevent intense clogged pores. Still have some clogging but way better!</li>
    <li> All Skin Ceuticals products are awesome . This product is just a bit too watery for me I would order the emollience daily moisturizer  the next time. My skin is dry and needs a bit heavier product. This product would be fine for younger skin .</li>
    <li> I do have somewhat sensitive skin but this is made my face violently red and burn! I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any product- if you have sensitive skin but are set on getting this, do a patch test!</li>
    <li> Love skin ceuticals!! Best product on the market for skin and to&lt;br /&gt;prevent damage. I have seen lots if differences in my skin and how my make up goes on.</li>
    <li> Great lightweight moisturizer, non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I love most Skin Ceuticals products. If you have severe dry skin, this won&#x27;t do it for you. I find that this product is a little &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; or watery. It&#x27;s not greasy though, and for my daily needs, it works ok for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I can apply this and my sunscreen, and my makeup goes on perfect over it. So if you are looking for something &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s great. Knocked off a star for not being the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; moisturizer. It also states that it minimizes pores...just an FYI, nothing can make pores smaller. Pores are part of genetics. You can make them appear smaller, but there&#x27;s nothing that will actually &amp;#34;make them smaller&amp;#34;. I noticed nothing on that end, but didn&#x27;t expect to.</li>
    <li> Made my skin (way more) oily even though it&#x27;s made for people with oily skin. Also noticed white heads appearing after a few uses. I know it was because of this product because I tried it/took a break more than once and got the same results</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like putting caviar on your face!! Doesn&#x27;t get any better!!! Great for sensitive and oily skins! Received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I need moisture in my skin and I bought this to moisturize, minimize pores, and because other skinceutical products dont break me out. This product doesnt break me out, minimizes my pores on my nose, and my skin feels as soft as when I was a child. I couldnt ask for more.</li>
    <li> Nice every day moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or gloppy.  Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy or oily.  Feels smooth and light.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described. Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product by recommendation but I am skeptical if this is a bootleg or not.  How can you tell?  Skin feels better, yes.  Let me finish the jar then I&#x27;ll give a full review.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is perfect for oily skin prone to breakouts. I was always worried about using moisturizer with my skin type, but this moisturizer has never caused a breakout. Product is very light. I use the product at least twice a day!</li>
    <li> I have used this as a night cream for five years, because it is so light and I use Ultimate UV Defense as a daily skin cream. I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s and my skin is better than it was five years ago.</li>
    <li> I like Skinceuticals moisturizer cause it&#x27;s not greasy. Rub it in and it almost disappears immeadiately. I also like Skinceuticals cleansers.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer to me and gave me a sample. I really liked the sample and decided to purchase the real thing. I really wanted to love this moisturizer..... but it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.. It is gentle on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy or sticky, and is ok to use under makeup. I have acne prone skin battling adult acne. It didn&#x27;t make me break out, but it didn&#x27;t give me enough moisture either. I have combination skin and use benzoyl peroxide as a spot treatment, which dries out my skin. I was hoping that this moisturizer would have made the difference, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this moisturizer would work best for normal skin only. It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
    <li> This cream is lightweight and gives the skin a nice glow. It absorbs into the skin without an oily finish providing the right amount of moisture.</li>
    <li> This is a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love their cleansers.  So I decided to try this, but my skin was very itchy.  I noticed it contains parabens, and I think I&#x27;m allergic to that ingredient.</li>
    <li> I been buying this moisturizer for a while now I like it only thing I don&#x27;t like is that if i start sweating it looks like I&#x27;m sweating white haha so I put it before bed also makes red acne scars look whiter .</li>
    <li> Best cream to use, I use it evenings or daytime, absorbs nice, there is  no smells and has a low/no shine.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for daily use to help your complexion.</li>
    <li> In the winter, I have normal skin, in the summer I have oily skin.  This moisturizer handles both.  I&#x27;ve tried a ton of moisturizers for oily skin and they are not as dry or invisible as this one.  At first I tried only applying at night, because EVERY other moisturizer that says it’s drying, absorbs well, or is for oily skin etc. still makes my complexion moist if you know what I mean.  This one however keeps me hydrated and smooth without the moist, oily, dampness, both day and night.  I still error on the side of night time only application vs. both daytime and night time because it&#x27;s made a difference in my skin with just the single daily application (dryness shows age and this nips the dryness that even oily skin can can have, in the bud).  With cold or wind, I certainly use it twice a day and am happy with how my makeup sits over it.  Regarding the pore minimizing aspect, I think it does a little, don&#x27;t expect miracles though.  With continued use I&#x27;ve discovered smoother, softer skin, maybe tighter pores per-se, a great canvas for makup no dout, or just a good nights sleep.</li>
    <li> It makes the wifes skin feel good and we all know a happy wife is a happy life!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! A very light moisturizer that&#x27;s perfect for oily skin. Helps shrink pores too</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer especially when I my skin is dry. I sleep in my makeup and I awake and scrub it out with my Skinceuticals Simply Clean. And my face gets dry. But I just slather this on and it instantly heals. I would not recommend using this under your make up. It makes my skin greasy if I do that. And don&#x27;t put too much on. You will sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great moisturizer for over night for sure.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product from other retail outlets at a higher cost.  I was not sure if the quality would be the same as the ones I have bought from Salons, but it was!  The moisturizer lasts a long time since you only need to use a small amount.  I will certainly purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Daughter has uber-sensitive skin, breaks out at the drop of a hat, fights acne still and she is nearly 20.  This moisturizer actually goes on and does not cause her to break out.  It fights the cycle of applying the drying/cleansing products which produces dry, flaky skin.  This moisturizer helps to balance out her issues with that.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be good for oily skin, but it feels so heavy and made my skin greasy. Not a fan at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks now since i recieved it. I really like it better than any other mousturizer I used before. It has reduced my pore size and that big pore size is something I have struggled with all my life. It doesn&#x27;t reduced it completely ofcourse, I am sure that impossible, but they do look smaller which is great! My skin tends to become dry and this mousturzier keeps it nicely hydrated so when I put make up on it looks very nice and smooth. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for my combo skin. Never greasy- just soaks right in. My new fave moisturizer for day and night.</li>
</ol>
