<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This wig surpassed my expectations.  After doing some trimming which was my personal preference I found the wig to be way worth the money!  I have even ordered another one as I received lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast &amp; price was great! I only gave 3 stars however, because wig in picture was much longer than the wig I received. Also the wig color I received, was black &amp; not dark brown (as advertised). I already own a black one that I purchased years ago, so I wanted a dark brown one. Other than that &amp; the length being a few inches shorter- it STILL is a nice wig. It&#x27;s very soft, no tangles &amp; seems to be easily styled. Was not mashed up or tangled, when it came out of box either. So, for the price &amp; quick shipping- I would recommend this wig... IF you don&#x27;t mind it in black or a bit shorter than pictured. Hope this helps! :)</li>
    <li> Let me first start of by saying why I bought this. My hair is very thin, and just doesn&#x27;t like to grow fast at all. Takes forever to grow after I got it cut back in August of last year. Its barely to my shoulders now. I&#x27;ve tried so many kinds of shampoo&#x27;s and hopes that it would help but nothing helps my hair. So, I decided to look for a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I found this beautiful looking wig and ordered it! It came in today, and my reaction after setting it on was.. \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot; It is BEAUTIFUL! It may be pretty dark but I still fell in love with it instantly. It&#x27;s so full, so elegant I am never stepping outside without it. I ordered another one and that should be here tomorrow, so I can&#x27;t wait to see how that one looks too! I am SO happy I bought this, best money spent so far!! And for the price that is just even more amazing to get such a wonderful wig for cheap. All those expensive ones don&#x27;t even compare to this! Thank you to the seller, and I will SO be ordering from them again in the future. &amp;lt;3 ^.^</li>
    <li> When i first looked t this wig, i was skeptical. I thought \\&quot;there&#x27;s NO WAY the wig&#x27;s going to look like that.\\&quot; but it did! A bunch of my friends are frequent wig buyers and they all agree it was great quality! It looks so real! I&#x27;ll definitely buy from these people again!</li>
    <li> This seemed like a great wig and I recommend anyoneit to anyone. whether you are dressing up for halloween or just want to wear something nice.</li>
    <li> This wig is great. It is a little darker then I thought but still a good color. At points it gets a little more itchy then I have ever had but all in all a great wig and looks great. I have wore it 5 times so far and it is still holding up strong.</li>
    <li> it was long and full... going to wear it til it falls apart... then get another one... good wig for such a cheap price!</li>
    <li> The top of the wig is thick and shiny, but then it dramatically reduces in volume at the point where the hair drops past the wig cap. So it&#x27;s like they put a whole bunch of hair on the top of the wig, and then thinner wavy strands come out. The thin curls/waves are stuck together and distinctly separate so it doesn&#x27;t look real. I brushed it but it still looks much too thin, like extensions are needed to fill in the gaps. It sheds and gets tangled or frizzy easily.. The color of the wig is described as dark brown but it appears pure black in pictures and in person, although in the sun it has a slight red/brown tint. The wig is very long and goes to the end of my back, and being so thin that also makes it look fake. So I don&#x27;t think I would wear this out in public. You get what you pay for though, and I will wear this one just for fun at home sometimes. I did like that you can style the bangs however you want and that part still looks natural, unlike some wigs which have a set style and you can&#x27;t move the bangs or part.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig,it came in the color it said it was. To maintain the curls I recommend putting some rollers when not in use,the hair will curl right back up. I am satisfied with the purchase, and most likely will purchase from them again.  :)</li>
    <li> Size is for a smaller head and pieces of hair fall out all the time.But other than that, it does not look like a wig and it is soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> So the wig isn&#x27;t the same as the picture in fact, it&#x27;s better. I cannot believe this twenty dollar wig looks so good!  The only issue I have with it, the cap is small, or I have a big head haha. It fits very snug on me without the adjustable tabs inside. it&#x27;s a versatile wig so you can wear it many ways. I am beyong impressed, it doesn&#x27;t have that synthetic shine. I recommend to all!</li>
    <li> I just got my wig. I&#x27;ve ordered a few costume wigs in the past. This is very nice for the price. It is made of a synthetic material and is obviously not real hair, but it is still soft and isn&#x27;t heavy and wiry like some wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig came in a package with a cardboard support that kept it from being crushed. It came a little frizzy, but a gentle brushing fixed the frizz and make the curls look a little more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the wig. It&#x27;s a very pretty color and it&#x27;s long and versatile enough to wear down, tie back, or braid. The only problem I have is that the cap is small on my head. I didn&#x27;t even have to use the adjustment straps. Other than that, I really enjoy this. Best wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased at this price.</li>
    <li> Since this was the first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. After reading a few reviews of this product, I was confused about the range of opinions. Some people said that the wig cap was too small. Others said that they absolutely loved the wig. I also read that some people thought it was too long while others thought it was shorter than in the picture. Still, I ordered the wig and hoped for the best. I placed the order on September 20 and was expecting the package to arrive between October 17- November 4, but it came on October 5. I opened the package to find that the wig wasn&#x27;t tangled at all! There were some hairs that were out of place, but it only took a few seconds to gently comb through the wig with my fingers. The hair didn&#x27;t fall out, which leaves me to suspect that it will last for a while. The length was exactly what I was looking for- not too long that it gets in my way and not too short. The hair itself is shiny, but not to the point where it looks fake. The only problem I have with the wig is the bangs. The picture shows that the bangs sweep to the side, which my wig does, except that there&#x27;s a little strand that sweeps to the opposite side. It&#x27;s not that big a deal, and after a little adjusting and combing, I&#x27;m sure the strand will lay flat. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll sweep to the same side as the rest of the bangs, so I&#x27;ll just leave it like that. The waves are really pretty and look like I used a curling iron. This is a pro because I hate waking up an hour early just to curl my thick hair. The wig wasn&#x27;t too thin, but I finger combed it just to separate some curls. I was apprehensive that combing it would ruin the look. However, it probably looks even better than before! I&#x27;m not sure why some wigs aren&#x27;t the same as the picture, but I am definitely glad I decided to purchase this product. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I am very happy with what I received in the mail. I would definitely recommend this wig to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. The colour is so natural looking and the length is about the same as the photo. The only thing that was an issue was  the bangs, they are a bit awkward and you have to do a bit of working with them. It came very nicely packaged and also came with a wig net. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This wig is very shiny.  Good wig to wear at night or with baseball cap.  Not bad for the money.</li>
    <li> I Received my wig today and I love it!!! The hair is very soft and nice looking. You can&#x27;t bet the price. If you were to purchase this hair at your local hair store you would pay way more for this type of hair and length. The hair color is lighter than what I expected but it works. It also arrive earlier than what I expected. I would definitely order from you guys again thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> I got home and saw the packaged and only realized it was the wig...I wasn&#x27;t expecting it until Jan but it arrived just in time for Christmas.  One small issue is that the wig doesn&#x27;t come with a comb in the front or back for security, other than that it fits well and looks the part.</li>
    <li> In the pic it is black and when I got it it was brown. Really? Yes and there is way more cerls in the wig than there is in this pic</li>
    <li> I got it quickly and just had to try it on, took me a bit to get it perfect. And someone did note that it was a wig, then again they did see me minutes before with super short hair, but it fit like a glove, rather a hat on a head, I ADORE it. I felt automatically matched and pretty in it. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more from these guys!! I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> this wig did not fit my head and it tangled quick not worth the money at all people thanks anyway</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful multi-functional, everyday wig!!!!! I love it. Got it before the estimated time and i like the wig cap you get with it, very nice quality.</li>
    <li> I basically got a crimson red wig...&lt;br /&gt;Tangles easily, though that can be fixed with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;Much curlier than I expected, though again the real problem I&#x27;m having is that the picture didn&#x27;t match the product.  I wanted a dark brown wig, and I got a bright red one.</li>
    <li> this was my go to wig for when my Aloepica flared up! it is so natrual looking and i loved the side part. The soft curls staid in tact even after brushing and the wig has lasted me years!. Very easy to untangle and low mantianence.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was a bit uncertain about buying this. The model picture looks good, but the pictures uploaded by Amazon users were not. That is not to say they looked bad or anything, but the photos either didn&#x27;t clearly show the wig in use or they were worn in a different way than the model. Because of all the differences from the uploaded pictures, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this wig would look like the model&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say it looks almost exactly like the one in the model&#x27;s picture. I was shocked at how beautiful and natural it looked for such a cheap wig! I have had no shedding problems and it fit me perfectly. The reason I mainly bought this wig was to see how I would look with longer hair, as I have short hair and have never managed to let it grow out past my the middle of my neck. I was curious if I would look better with longer hair, and if my real hair can grow out looking like this, well, I will DEFINITELY grow it out longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a really fun wig, and it looks natural. It looks even better when you wear a hat or beanie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged great and the shipping was very fast. I have not had any shedding or tangling problems yet, and I&#x27;m so impressed with this that I will definitely be buying more wigs from this seller in the future. I didn&#x27;t think it would be this fun but it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will upload photos whenever I get the chance.</li>
    <li> The wig feels and looks real, long and has some waves/curls. The bangs, I still can&#x27;t figure out how to comb to make them look like the picture. Also, I think because of the long shipping time ( the wig in the package) it does not have a round head shape. It looks like you have big bumps on your head.</li>
    <li> Husband liked the change of color on me. ( I&#x27;m natural blonde)</li>
    <li> I just received it yesterday...this wig is very shiny, does not look like real hair because it is just simply too shiny. It is pretty long and I guess you can cut the length if you want. I guess it can be worn at a costume party, not for everyday use unless you want everyone to notice that it is a fake wig. It is a cheap wig after all so I guess you get what you pay for. I will not be using it at all.</li>
    <li> The wig was so soft and it looked very realistic. I love the wig so much! It is one of the best wigs I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> It wasnt brown at all it was straight black otherwise it was a nice wig just the wrong color by alot.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that it fit and the color was not shiny. i read the other reviews after i ordered. so i read someone saying that the wig was to shiny. my was just perfect wore and couldn&#x27;t tell the difference from my own hair.  happy with the product and the price was easy on the wallet. ^_^</li>
    <li> The wig was extremely wiggy, shiny, and knotty. A lot of the knottin went away after I cut to wig to better suit me, however the wig also gets very raggedy at the ends (which happened even before I cut it). You can hide that though if you put it into a cute low side bun, however this does weigh the wig down and cause it to slip in that dirrection. The wig didn&#x27;t fit on my head and slid off a lot, I was constantly haveing to put it back in place , not even bobby pins helped.&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that someone can pull this wig off though, people with naturally thick brown hair, the color just didn&#x27;t look Right on me, and the straitness and shininess was a dead giveaway. ( not that I was trying to fool people, it just didn&#x27;t look nice)</li>
    <li> This is a horrible wig. It isn&#x27;t this style or color as the picture. DON&#x27;T GET THIS</li>
    <li> I needed a wig for the school musical.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone was surprised that it only costed $11!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money, and looks natural and pretty!&lt;br /&gt;No one knew that it was a wig until I told them.</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending me a great wig.... I&#x27;m really enjoying with hair styles. Thank you very much looking forward to future purchases</li>
    <li> the quality is okay. it looks different in person then on the picture. I&#x27;m surprised that it looks as good as it does though. but i wouldnt&#x27; wear it unless it was for a costume</li>
    <li> :] this wig is amazing. It is thick and full of hair, the top not so much,&lt;br /&gt;it is a darker color than in the picture that amazon has, but i in fact like&lt;br /&gt;this color alot better. i did straighten and comb the curls out(on lowest&lt;br /&gt;heat). it did not become a mess while doing that. The wig looks real in person.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great wig for this price range.</li>
    <li> like this wig for the price but make sure you have a a pocket brush THIS YOU WILL NEED! Thank goodness the curls go right back tho after all the brushing and it didnt fall apart like I was thinking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this wig. The wig advertised and the wig I received are pretty much the same which is great since buying wigs online is always such a gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good things:&lt;br /&gt;1. The colour on my wig is the same as in the picture, if anything it&#x27;s just slightly darker depending on the lighting.&lt;br /&gt;2. The hair itself is very soft and looks real. I compared it to a relative who has similar natural hair and it looks entirely identical.&lt;br /&gt;3. Relating to the above, the wig hardly sheds which is quite amazing considering many wigs that feel this soft oftentimes will shed like crazy, this one doesn&#x27;t have that issue.&lt;br /&gt;4: The length is the same as in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;5. The netting is well-made and overall not visible. It is a bit tighter than other wigs I own but it fits well and it feels sturdy like it won&#x27;t fall off easily.&lt;br /&gt;6. The wig shipped way faster than I expected to. I get wigs from this country often and I&#x27;ve never received them on standard shipping as fast as this one. I purchased it on March 11th and received it March 27th. It came packaged safely with a free wig cap and cutely drawn instructions on how to put the cap on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I have with this wig is that it&#x27;s difficult to move the bangs around a lot because one wrong strand could make the netting on the forehead visible. Whenever I try to side-sweep the bangs the netting shows up easily and it&#x27;s difficult to cover it which concerns me when it comes to casually wearing the wig and moving around in it. The bangs come really long so you can adjust it to your needs though so I may just need to do a little more tampering around to get them right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. I purchased this wig with the intention of wearing it out frequently and it really feels like I can do that with this. The wig looks adorable with a hairband or beanie.</li>
    <li> Feels real, and a nice color. If only I head a smaller head it would look perfect. It&#x27;s a bit too long for my taste too</li>
    <li> This is the first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. Out of the packaging it was soft like the other reviewers mention. It&#x27;s very long - it went to the bottom of my back before I cut it. Now it&#x27;s just beneath my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m african american, so hair this shiny and smooth is very obviously fake on someone like me (:P) but for someone with naturally straight, shiny hair, this would be a very believable wig. I wish I&#x27;d have bought a black one, but that&#x27;s my own fault. I&#x27;ve tried dying it with archival ink markers and it&#x27;s still in progress, but it&#x27;s holding up pretty well despite my terrible treatment. It doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, and I don&#x27;t find the fit to be too small. (This may be because I have nearly no hair underneath.) Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great wig for the price. I would definitely buy from Cool2Day again.</li>
    <li> This wig was all around bad! As pervious reviewers noted its small. The color is lighter than advertised and its so shiny its obviously fake. Fine for costume but not everyday use.</li>
    <li> This is probably the first wig I have bought that was exactly like the picture. It doesn&#x27;t look good on me, but the price is great. I might trim it about 4 inches but I&#x27;m definitely keeping it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Flo Halloween costume. With some modifications on the bangs and length, it was perfect! Also a great price!</li>
    <li> The wig is really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;looks realistic&lt;br /&gt;is thick enough to look real.&lt;br /&gt;you just have to make sure you part it perfectly or it looks like a cone head.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Not see through up top which is sometimes expected with cheap wigs, but it&#x27;s thick enough to cover well. Bit of shine like wigs have, but not horribly noticeable. Better for smaller heads, mines rather small. Bangs can be styled as needed, they are side swept but shorter. Overall was happy with the quality for such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Less than 1 star...You get what you pay for. The color is not as described, it&#x27;s a reddish color, instead of a dark brown. Straight in the trash... Looks real wiggy. DO NOT ORDER!!! EVER!!!</li>
    <li> A long wavy wig! Its wonderful! My package even came with a free gift of socks and a wig cap!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing wig for the price.  I&#x27;ve gotten other wigs that are 5 times as expensive but aren&#x27;t 5 times as quality.  This wig is comfortable and is not a cheap Halloween wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that if you wear it often enough it will tangle up in the back.  But still a great value</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for my daughter since she lost her hair due to her treatment. I received the wig much earlier than expected. I ordered the wig on May 9th and have received it on the 30th. I was expecting to receive it mid-June. Also, it was free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged in a plastic bag and inside it contained a \\&quot;ziploc\\&quot;-style bag with a free wig cap. The wig I received was not of a chocolate brown, but more of a dark auburn. Since I had read the reviews before my purchase, I was happy with the color when I saw it in person. The style isn&#x27;t exactly like the photo, but seeing other customers photos I knew what I was purchasing. The style is lovely regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig was a bit frizzy when taken out of the packaging, but once I brushed it through it was lovely. The wig was a bit big on my daughter, but we adjusted the straps. Still the top part of the hair looked a bit \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; with some areas of the wig lace sticking out, but my daughter pinned back some of the hair and it looked very pretty. The wig is very long and it comes down a bit passed her back. The wig is a bit shiny, but in natural light no one seemed to realize it was a wig. In artificial light, the wig seems a big more like a wig, but no one really pays that close attention. The texture of the hair feels a bit like doll hair which may explain why it tangles a bit (brushing it and using some hair serum should do the trick), but for less than $10 and free shipping it is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To lessen the shine, using some baby powder may help. Also, washing it once in cold water with mild shampoo should make it look more realistic. When my daughter wears a hat/flower halo/headband, the hair looks real!</li>
    <li> i have two complaints- it was really small, and barely fits my head. an also it was already coming apart when i received it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig because my hair&#x27;s been getting super thin lately. I&#x27;m only 20 so I wanted to play with some cute and fun styles before I had to get serious about it. This one caught my eye because it was pretty, had a decent rating, and was also cheap, so I went for it. I got it only 4 days after I ordered it, so that was good. I was really excited to open it, so as soon as I brought it in I threw it on and was pleasantly surprised to see how nice it was. For being synthetic, the hair is really soft, and I didn&#x27;t notice any of that \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot; shine I had read about on other sites. When you first take it out of the package, the hair is split up into really distinct curls, which I thought made it look almost greasy or something, so I combed it out and that made the curls a little fuller while still keeping their shape. The bangs are a little long, but I have a smallish forehead so that could be my own problem. The cap is open wefted in the back and sides, and it has one of those skin dot things where the hair swirls out, but the hair is so packed together right there you can&#x27;t really see it anyway. There are also adjustable straps in the back. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have the courage to wear this out in public just yet, but for the price this really is a beautiful product. I wish my real hair looked like this.</li>
    <li> The wig is definitely worth it&#x27;s price. When it first got here I was a little unhappy because it shed a lot, was frizzy, and seemed thin. But I took it outside and combed it out and the frizz went down, it looks much fuller and much more natural, and it sheds very little now. I wore it out and I don&#x27;t think anyone noticed it was a wig. It is a bit shiney but it really isn&#x27;t that bad. It has a very natural look to it and it didnt itch at all. For such a low price this is a really great wig. also many people have commented saying that their wig came in black, mine did not, it is definitely a very similar color to the pictures shown, it is a semi-dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst thing about it:&lt;br /&gt;It is still very thin, a lot thinner than the picture makes it appear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing:&lt;br /&gt;It looks very natural, it is a very pretty color and has a nice wave to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great wig and I would definitely order from this company again</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t for me. It was a nice wig, but it looked very obviously wiggy and was very shiny. It was also easy to tangle so make sure you have a wig comb or brush. The color turned out to be a bit more of a auburny-brown, so that + the shininess didn&#x27;t look right or natural on me, but I&#x27;m sure it would look nice on someone else. This was also my first wig. I&#x27;d buy another wig, but next time one of a darker color and of a higher quality. I eventually threw it out because I stopped wearing it. It was a pretty nice length though.</li>
    <li> Edit: o6/o3/13; I still enjoy the wig, and it is kind of thin, but for what I paid for - it&#x27;s met more than just by expectations. I enjoy the wig still and haven&#x27;t found a cosplay to use it for, but I think the wig&#x27;s still great. I&#x27;ve washed it as well, and the waves were still there. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how much I like the wig still! In fact, despite the shininess, it&#x27;s slowly working its way up to one of my favorite &#x27;natural&#x27; wigs. ( Though I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m a bit irked that it&#x27;s up for sale cheaper now ;D )&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;I placed the order on Saturday I believe, and with Amazon Prime - it arrived the next Monday! Lucky me for having Amazon Prime ;) Back to the review, the wig is gorgeous. I&#x27;m always cautious about buying Amazon wigs and wigs in general, so I do the usual &#x27;stalk through every review&#x27; thing, and in the end the goods outweighed the bads, so I decided to give the wig a try. I wanted a light brown wig, but the others from the seller were kind of iffy on the review side - some turned out lighter or darker, etc, so I settled for this dark brown wavy wig instead. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. It was nicely packaged, and the wig didn&#x27;t come horribly tangled like a few of my other wigs. The seller also included a free wig cap and a pair of sky blue ankle length socks! How nice of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to try the wig on, and wow - it&#x27;s the softest wig I&#x27;ve ever bought. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t look like real hair, but it&#x27;s synthetic hair - it /isn&#x27;t/ real hair to begin with. Following some suggestions I&#x27;ve read up on, I patted a bit of the wig with baby powder, so the shiny effect was toned down a bit - therefore making it look more &#x27;real&#x27; so to say. I brushed the wig with my wig brush, starting from bottom up because god knows awful things happen if you don&#x27;t brush it well. ( I speak from experience. ) And unlike my other curly wig - brushing through it didn&#x27;t take the waves away! I was so thrilled. It is rather long, but having length is better than it being too short, right? The bangs fell a little under my nose, and the wig itself was about mid stomach for me. Needless to say, I love it! It&#x27;s probably the softness of the wig speaking, but I think it&#x27;s fabulous. Only time will tell! I definitely recommend it. I&#x27;m a bit worried about &#x27;shedding&#x27; since the wig&#x27;s not too full and voluptuous, but only one little major chunk has fallen out so far, and that&#x27;s because I accidentally tugged at the wig. Anyways, I can&#x27;t wait to parade around with this new wig! For the price that it cost ($9.39) - I think it&#x27;s a killer deal!</li>
    <li> Better than your average costume wig. It doesn&#x27;t have much volume but lots of length. Its super soft and everyone always thinks its my real hair</li>
    <li> My daughter used this as a cosplay wig for Belle.  We gently tied back the hair and added a bow.  As long as you can keep the wig in a box between uses and are careful, it will last a while, but obviously these wigs don&#x27;t stand up well to brushing, so you need to be careful not to tossle or tangle.</li>
    <li> this wig works well for my Lara Croft and Ellie Langford costumes. very versatile. its a little snug, but thats okay with me. pretty color. soft, and not too shiny. it was also a little long, but that was easily fixed with a trim.</li>
    <li> I got my wig today and i was impressed. First of all i opened the box and was surprised to find TWO free gifts! A wig cap and an adorable pair of pink and white ankle socks. AWWWWWWWWWWWW... thanks guys!!! :)  The \\&quot;hair\\&quot; was so soft and the colour was a beautiful reddish brown. My ONLY issue , which may not be problem for most... was that is was way longer than i expected. It reaches my butt and given that my natural hair is only bra strap length, makes it look fake. But i can always get it cut by a stylis...t But other than that, its great. The bangs... WOW... i LOVE the bangs! Its rare to see wigs at this price with such great bangs. This was my first wig purchase and it wont be my last. Im looking forward to wearing it out. It looks great on me! Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Very nice feel and very full.</li>
    <li> Looks a bit red.. but besides that, a good wig. Not too soft though like my other wigs.</li>
    <li> The wig showed up promptly, and in easily the best packaging I&#x27;ve ever received a wig in-- most wigs show up wrapped in folders, this wig arrived in a secure container, and even had a little cardboard brace around it inside of the plastic bag to keep it from crushing it. The wig itself is fantastic-- perfect for what I need it for. It&#x27;s a good quality wig, not too shiny, but not too matte. The netting does show a tiny bit when you part the hair a certain way, but that&#x27;s to be expected when you change the part from how it was designed. I got this wig to style for a friend&#x27;s cosplay for a birthday gift, and I almost wish I could keep it for myself as it is! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been so very pleased with a wig.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. I got my haircut Wed before thanksgiving, they cut it way too short. I ordered the wig Thanksgiving day in hopes that it would be at my house by the time I came home Saturday from holiday at my parents. It was! I put it on and it was great, the bangs needed to be trimmed and it was a little longer than the hair I had before. It wasn&#x27;t dark brown it was a medium brown that has a bit of a reddish tint in the light, but it matches my hair, so I&#x27;m thrilled hopefully no one will notice its a wig when I return to work on Monday. :)</li>
    <li> however be warned the bangs are very very very long....even pushed off to the side the bangs were down to my check bones! ultimatley i love it but i did have to cut the bangs</li>
    <li> This wig is just beautiful. I was really surprised at the great quality of the wig. The company I purchased from is by far an A+++ company as well. I will be buying from them again in the near future. I suggest this item to anyone looking to try wigs out and being a little unsure of which to buy. Well worth the money and I am so happy with the product!</li>
    <li> People can tell that you have a wig on. Doesn&#x27;t look natural like the advertised picture. Also, the hair fall off easily and tangle easily. I wouldn&#x27;t get this again.</li>
    <li> It came in an understandable time and packaged very well. As soon as I opened it I tried it on. After some adjustments it looked and felt pretty good. It even came with a black wig cap which I didn&#x27;t even know I came with so bonus! Maybe I didn&#x27;t read carefully enough but whatever. I&#x27;m satisfied! My only problem with it is that in the front their are some very short hairs that people might think are your real hair peeking out but isn&#x27;t really. You can position the Longer strands of hair to make it less noticeable or tuck them under. I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to experiment with it too much so for all I know you might be able to remove them without damaging the wig but again not sure. Overall im pleased with it and would recommend. :) XX</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Fit was pretty snug (unless you plan on headbanging your way through a party it would stay pretty nicely)&lt;br /&gt;-Length&#x3D;can cut to desired length&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Too shiny~could only pass for real hair if you were going for the super oily look...joking&lt;br /&gt;-It would be a lot better if it were shorter yet fuller rather than long and pretty thin.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing.  Frankly, I couldn&#x27;t believe how high quality it was for the price.  The hair is thick, stays on with minimal pins, and styles decently.</li>
    <li> This wig was a fabulous purchase, although it doesn&#x27;t quite look like the picture shown (it is the same color, but it was much much curlier than the photo) it is very good quality and looks very natural when worn! It had a weird corn-husk smell to it, but it wasn&#x27;t offputting. overall a good purchase.</li>
    <li> it was a good wig for the price, but it is hard to make it do much beyond what the style already is.  Not a bad buy, good price.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a good quality wig for such a low price.  I also wasn&#x27;t expecting professional shipping, and a gifted wig cap &amp; cute pink socks either. After I brushed the wig out the texture and look could be mistaken for real hair... wait, is it? I can&#x27;t remember, but for the price I doubt it. Anyway it&#x27;s really lovely, and the shipping was prompt &amp; free. I received it in three days. I will be buying others in the future.</li>
    <li> i love this wig its a great wig its fun to wear and when they send it they send a free wig cap with your wig i love the bangs of the wig they look so real everybody didn&#x27;t even know it was a wig till i told them. i like how it has the natural skin top thing on top of it. the wig gets tangled easily that&#x27;s why if you buy this wig you should get a wire wig brush and also get a stand but its easy to brush and care for i think its very long but you can wear it up i hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Thin, hair falls out unusable even for the costume I needed it for. I  would have returned it but it would havve cost me more than the whole thing was worth. Moral; You get what you pay for and don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> It is really good. The bangs were longer than i thought, but all in all if you are looking for something to wear when you feel like a change this is the wig.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a cosplay and was really surprised with the great quality. It&#x27;s super long and easy to style.</li>
    <li> Okay,I received my wig today. This is what I love about the wig. The color and the curls are pretty! Hair is very long, to my butt. It is very soft. Bangs are perfect length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I dislike about it and the reason why I take off a star. The hair fall off easily. I only run my fingers through it, and hair already come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And another reason why I take off another star. The wig get tangled easily. After running my fingers through it, the bottom half are already tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, This wig is gorgeous but not for daily use. This wig will not work for someone that don&#x27;t have hair, like me.</li>
    <li> this wig is absolutely gorgeous.  people can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s fake. i took off one start because like other reviews state, it tangles easily.</li>
    <li> This is my first wig, so I was a bit nervous to pick one up for under $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nervousness was for nothing. I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with the quality of this wig! It&#x27;s about the thickness of my natural hair if it was grown out, and this is not your typical cheap shiny fake hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller also included a free wig cap and a super awesome cute pair of purple anklet socks. :D They also included a piece of paper explaining how to make a return if necessary, but it wasn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get a wig brush. You must brush it delicately, but I&#x27;m assuming you treat most wigs that way.</li>
    <li> This wig was much longer than I anticipated, but it is great quality and fun to wear, so long as you don&#x27;t touch it too much.</li>
    <li> Alright, I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much when it comes to buying a $12 wig on Amazon. Based on the numerous customer images that have been provided, I gave it a shot. They all looked pretty darn good, how bad could it be? This looks NOTHING like the customer images that everyone has uploaded.  I supposed this is the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; version of this wig.&lt;br /&gt;The current product image reflects what I received, however when I purchased it, it still had the old images. I feel a bit deceived, but again, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much here so I&#x27;m not exactly angry or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool2day shipped out the wig in the promised time frame, well before Amazon&#x27;s estimate. It was packed in a plastic bag, a bit of tissue paper and a hairnet. A free wig cap was included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is a complete mess, and was pretty tangled already right out of the bag. Its also very shiny and very fake looking. Thankfully, I plan on using this as part of a Halloween costume and was going to Frankenstein the hell out of it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fairly fast shipping from China.&lt;br /&gt;Product image accurately reflect what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very fake looking, shiny, costume quality wig that tangles easily.&lt;br /&gt;Previous versions of this wig look nothing like what is currently offered. Do not based your decision to purchase this based on past reviews and images. It is no longer the same wig!</li>
    <li> love the color and the length very awsome and came before my event im going to</li>
    <li> The wig is made out of quality material, looks almost like real hair. I would highly recommend buying this item for any costume.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t fit, doesn&#x27;t adjust, and doesn&#x27;t look as good as it shows. I even bought a separate wig cap for it. Couldn&#x27;t figure it out. I say don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> This wig has a mesh top, which is a little different from what I&#x27;m used to, but closely mimics human hair. I&#x27;m not having a problem with fibers coming out. It&#x27;s a reddish dark brown rather than a pure dark brown, but is very beautiful.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of this wig but I was really surprised. It&#x27;s kind of shiny but it&#x27;s nice and thick and it isn&#x27;t anything a little baby powder won&#x27;t fix. It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture but I don&#x27;t care about that at all, and wigs don&#x27;t ever look like the picture because they fluff and style them for marketing purposes. The bangs do what they are supposed to without having to do major battle with it, my hair doesn&#x27;t show through, the netting doesn&#x27;t show through, and I look pretty good in it. It&#x27;s flattering and attractive. It isnt of the highest quality but come on its less than ten dollars. It&#x27;s a bit coarse but I am not really looking to have anybody grope it anyway. My boyfriend loves it. The shipping is fast as its now included in amazon prime add on shipping. I&#x27;ll buy another one when this one wears out. I like it quite a bit. For every day purposes I&#x27;d say this is a win. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and it&#x27;s in the ugly in between stages. This is gonna help me out for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for 3 different events where I was going in drag/cross-dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;+ The dark brown wig I received was actually a bit reddish, like a dark auburn which I loved because it matches with my natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;+ Looks real, at least the bottom half&lt;br /&gt;+ Came with wig cap&lt;br /&gt;+ Fit well and snug once fixed&lt;br /&gt;+ Was able braid hair to change it up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;+ Great as a trial wig or for short-term&lt;br /&gt;+ Shipped fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- Too long in the back for my liking&lt;br /&gt;- If you have a smaller head or face like myself, the hair may look too big on top. Tip: Use bobby pins to pull some back.&lt;br /&gt;- Cannot be styled, aside from managing to braid it once and a bobby pin here or there / Difficult to manage&lt;br /&gt;- If you don&#x27;t leave it as is or don&#x27;t place it on a mannequin head, it is bound to get knotty and a bit messy. Again, difficult to manage.&lt;br /&gt;-- Top half of hair was way too shiny&lt;br /&gt;- Could be because of my hair underneath or improper fastening but there seemed to be a bump in the back at least the first two nights I wore it.&lt;br /&gt;- Started to shift, slowly come off after about 12ish hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase, not only because I needed a wig in a short amount of time but also as a trial wig. Now I know what I&#x27;m looking for when making any more hair purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: To make the wig appear more realistic, move the wig back to where your natural hairline would start. Plus, if the color of your hair beneath the wig matches, you may want to pull some of it out to blend it in.</li>
    <li> It was so soft I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair!  I mean wig lol&lt;br /&gt;However, it was a bit too shiny. So I bought me a can of dry shampoo and a bottle of baby powder .&lt;br /&gt;Dried shampoo made the hair frizzy so I don&#x27;t recommend to use it. Though, baby powder worked well:)&lt;br /&gt;Only con was it shed like crazy. Every time I touched my hair some piece of the hair came off.</li>
    <li> If I could give this a zero I defiantly would I put the wig on and after only about 15-20 mins it knotted up and l am so disappointed why I thought was going to last at least a few weeks ended up only lasting not even an hour the worst wig I have ever purchased!!!!</li>
    <li> I am not a wig expert by any means but this wig is beautiful! Looks and feels like real hair. My hair color is very close to the color of this wig. I honestly cant tell where the wig ends and my real hair begins.</li>
    <li> Seriously, (super fast shipping!) and it&#x27;s really cute. the only problem is that it sheds a bit, but I&#x27;m still super happy with it!! thank you fantastic wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit/Update:&lt;br /&gt;It actually sticks to my head a bit too much, so I&#x27;m going to lower it a bit. makes my head look really big? maybe just me.</li>
    <li> The bangs are a little long and the length is a bit overwhelming for my small frame, but a quick trip to a stylist will fix that right up! Looks natural, not too shiny, the curls are gorgeous. I LOVE!</li>
    <li> It was a beautiful wig, lovely color, thick and very realistic looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was that it is very, very frizzy and gets tangled easily. Other than that, I recommend this to anyone&lt;br /&gt;looking for a nice wig.</li>
    <li> Wrong color but liked it!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re head is small- teenager or young adult this wig would be fun for Halloween...</li>
    <li> ...I would be filthy rich. Every time I go out in this wig, I get a compliment for having beautiful hair. Even my boyfriend loves it and says it looks like the real deal! It&#x27;s soft and beautiful, a decent amount of hair, and a flattering color. It&#x27;s long, so it&#x27;s a bit harder to manage, but please, it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give 5 stars for the wonderful quality and shipping. I received this only ten days after I ordered it when I was expecting it in mid-February.. it looks so real and is very soft. The flow is beautiful and easy to maintain. I take one star for how easily tangled it is, even when carefully put away and put on. I take another star because there are no bangs whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This wig is actually a really great quality and looks exactly like the pictures. My wig is definitely as long as the product picture. Love it!</li>
    <li> I feel this product is for costume use only the price is great it looks ok but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it as a actual wig to wear out in public Unless you&#x27;re having a really really bad hair day It feels soft just not like most wigs I&#x27;m used to  but it&#x27;s okay I would order from this company again  just expecting something a little different but like I said I&#x27;m not upset because the price is great and I understand it comes from overseas so the shipping takes a little bit long but all in all I&#x27;m neutral I&#x27;m satisfied! Actually may work better for someone else For the price give it a try!</li>
