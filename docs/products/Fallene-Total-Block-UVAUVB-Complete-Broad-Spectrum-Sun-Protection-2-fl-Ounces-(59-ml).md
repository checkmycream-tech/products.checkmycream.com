      <li>The color out of the box was a great match for my skin.  </li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>I love this product!!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>Bought this for my wife and she loves it, she was able to match it perfectly to her skin tone.</li>
      <li>It was easy to blend the color to achieve a perfect match to my skintone.</li>
      <li>I have loved this product in the past!&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>Mom has always LOVED the coverage and look it has provided for her face, neck and arms.</li>
      <li>This stuff might do a good job of blocking the sun</li>
      <li>I loved this product until I looked at the listed ingredients .</li>
      <li>It was a really good blend</li>
      <li>Good coverage</li>
      <li>The block particles are also not as finely ground as I&#x27;m used to, so it doesn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
      <li>It makes my face look good and covers the spots I need more help with!  </li>
      <li>but I love that it&#x27;s customizable and the coverage is great.</li>
      <li>I have a very healthy skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really liked it for a good sunblock with tint.</li>
      <li>the fact that you can tailor it to your exact skin color is awesome.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and I love this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!</li>
      <li>So, I use PCA Phaze 13 which works wonders to reduce the discoloration and texture of the affected skin, then I put this product on, and don&#x27;t have to put make up on top of it!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is fabulous and a great price.</li>
      <li>AND my skin looks amazing, no break outs or anything.  </li>
      <li>While the sunblock aspect of this product is excellent and we are usually able to tint fairly close to her skin color, it REALLY needs to become waterproof.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you that how effective it is for preventing burns just yet.</li>
      <li>So in the warm months, just my serums + Fallene--nothing else.</li>
      <li>Had to adjust the color just a tad, but it was easy and successful in matching skin tone.</li>
      <li>I do set it with powder, there are no claims to water-resistance or long-wearing; it feels silky smooth and the color is virtually perfect for me, right out of the bottle!  </li>
      <li>However, we are planning trip to Europe this summer, so the need for a effective sunscreen is important, and I plan on taking this with me for my face, hand, and chest area.(plus a good solar umbrella)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really easy!</li>
      <li>This sunblock worked okay on not too hot or humid days, in fact I even got a compliment by a woman that told me I had a beautiful complexion and</li>
      <li>I believe that this is a very good product that does not cause my face or chest to break out, is not difficult to apply, and blends into my skin easily.</li>
      <li>Also you can&#x27;t just apply it on the go because you will have makeup all over your hand, you have to be able to wash your hands after.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and will continue to use for the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>Using the moisturizer helps it to spread easier and more evenly.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE that is DOES NOT break me out.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many sunblocks.  </li>
      <li>This is one of those low-key, under-the-radar products in a ho-hum package sold mostly thru doctor&#x27;s offices.</li>
      <li>The Amazon subscribe and save helps you save more.</li>
      <li>Of course, this burns and creates even more tears.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to blend well.</li>
      <li>I purchased this as I do most Amazon products--based on the reviews.</li>
      <li>I buy the tinted and have never had to add color to it, as it comes with tint already in it, but there is more if you need to darken.</li>
      <li>It works wayyy better than those high-end, pricy foundation.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;What happened to my healthy behaved</li>
      <li>but, when I travel to where it&#x27;s more humid</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Simply love this product, never am without.</li>
      <li>I have melasma on my top lip from hormonal issues.</li>
      <li>I love the sun so not being able to go out into it</li>
      <li>Will definately be getting more.</li>
      <li>this stuff is amazing--so gentle, provides great coverage, you dont wind up looking like you have sunscreen on.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this because I have lupus and the sun is my enemy, so even with sun block I totally stay out of it.  This has zinc and titanium and is great for sensitive skins.  It also comes with two tubes, one dark and one light, to shade the sun screen to match your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my makeup for years as suggested by my Dermatologist. I buy the tinted and have never had to add color to it, as it comes with tint already in it, but there is more if you need to darken. I never have to worry about causing anymore damage to the skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recently was diagnosed with Melasma and this is literally the only thing that helps me prevent it from darkening! It is great! I wish I would have discovered this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it great for Melasma but it is also a great cover up. You can match your face exactly how you need; although a little goes a long ways! Just an FYI!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have extremely oily skin and this does not make my face oily or smell like sunscreen all day. In fact it works much better than most moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never be buying another moisturizer or face sunscreen again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI- for people looking at this for Melasma it really does work for prevention and even to listen your condition over time. Just make sure when your in the sun for a long period it should be applied hourly.</li>
    <li> Good coverage but feels a little thick going on.  Leaves my skin feeling dry. Also purchased the face and tinted face.  Like them both.</li>
    <li> I ordered and used the \\&quot;clear\\&quot; Total Block last summer and while it worked fine, it did lend a somewhat pale affect to the face.  I had read all the rave reviews on Amazon about this product, and I must say it lives up to the hype.  I do set it with powder, there are no claims to water-resistance or long-wearing; it feels silky smooth and the color is virtually perfect for me, right out of the bottle!  The color as-is seems to be a light honey after shaking well; there are two bottles of pigment to lighten or darken to your preference, and instructions are included.  I haven&#x27;t added any of the color yet; could see myself adding a drop of darkening as the summer progresses.  It offers full-coverage, but somehow does not draw attention to my over-40 lines, and I don&#x27;t usually need to wear concealer, the coverage is that good.  I tan easily all over, but get the ugliest dark blotches on my jawline and upper lip if I don&#x27;t keep heavy duty SPF on all the time.  Even the texture is leathery, whereas my unaffected skin is smooth.  So, I use PCA Phaze 13 which works wonders to reduce the discoloration and texture of the affected skin, then I put this product on, and don&#x27;t have to put make up on top of it!  In Texas, where it is 100+ degrees already, I need as few layers as possible.</li>
    <li> Excellent Service and Product</li>
    <li> This product offers great sun protection and can be used easily under makeup. It does not leave your skin shiny or have a greasy feeling.  The tinted color can be changed to match your skin tone.  This does rub off on clothes though, so apply on face and neck after you are dressed.  I would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t come off on clothes.</li>
    <li> A friend turned me onto this product and overall, I like it. Only four stars because my face feels dry after application, and the price is high. The Amazon subscribe and save helps you save more. It&#x27;s worth the money if you want a sunblock/skin concealer/foundation in one.  It comes with a darker pigment, so you can match up your coloring. It&#x27;s the only product of it&#x27;s type, which is why it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunblock ever. I have tried many sunblocks.  I have dark spots on my skin from growing up in Florida and now living in California.  I have tried everthing to get rid of the brown spots and finally I have found a product to fade the brown spots and a sunblock that acutally blocks the sun and prevents them from coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant even with all the reviews but decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did.  The color is perfect and the the fact that they give you the ability to mix it to make it lighter and darker is so amazing.  I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this block AND my skin looks amazing, no break outs or anything.  I signed up for automatic shipments, I will never try anything else.  VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER!</li>
    <li> I loved this product until I looked at the listed ingredients . It contains oxbenzone , which is a very toxic ingredient . So until this ingredient is removed I won&#x27;t go near it .</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s tinted so if you use too much, it&#x27;ll look like cake on your face.  It blends wells if your skin tone if you use it lightly.  I like it and will try the untinted version next.</li>
    <li> The zinc molecules are too large to absorb into your skin leaving the skin with a \\&quot; chalk \\&quot; like look.  Will without a doubt block the harmful UVA / UVB rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re into protection 100 % this is for you. If you&#x27;re vain.......don&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I had use Total block 65 and now 60. Total Block 65 is a great but 60 is even better. It give a light cover up. Since not many of us have even skin tone. This product provide great result and yet doesn&#x27;t have the unnatural look. I love it and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage, I use it as make-up.  It does not come off in the heat and does not cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> After having numerous skin cancers I am very protective of my skin. I bought this product to use as a make up base for my mineral foundation, but have found that can be used alone once the tint is adjusted. I don&#x27;t go out in the sun unless it&#x27;s to get in the car or shopping, so I can&#x27;t tell you that how effective it is for preventing burns just yet. However, we are planning trip to Europe this summer, so the need for a effective sunscreen is important, and I plan on taking this with me for my face, hand, and chest area.(plus a good solar umbrella) I believe that this is a very good product that does not cause my face or chest to break out, is not difficult to apply, and blends into my skin easily. I have gotten compliments on my complexion while wearing it. It did take a little trial and error to get the color adjusted using the enclosed tint packets, but I am happy with the results, and would recommend this product to those who want a safe sunscreen with natural protective ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. At least ten, since I had a face peel.  It has good coverage and really prevents pigment spots.  My only complaint is that the last two bottles were so thick, I had a difficult time adding a few drops of the &amp;#34;lightener&amp;#34;.  It wouldn&#x27;t shake to mix it.  I used a chopstick to stir it. I will continue to use it because I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable. I usually add a few drops of water to thin it so it will mix.</li>
    <li> Once you master the mixture of color and blend in with moisturizer, this product blends in well and is like having a foundation on.  Just a dab goes along way. Too much and you get a pasty look.</li>
    <li> I use Bare Minerals foundation. Let this dry for a few minutes 1st before you apply mineral foundation. This sunscreen is fabulous and a great price. I LOVE that is DOES NOT break me out. Most products, especially most sunscreens irritate my skin but this is the best. Have been using this for a few months everyday (even on cloudy days).Love the tinted the best.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Thought this would be like the 60spf block I had been using (titanium &amp; zinc oxides), but turns out this one also has multiple chemical sunscreens including benzones :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not apply well - it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and looks very mask-like. My old block is water-soluble so it&#x27;s easier to blend into my skin, but this sone feels silicone-y or something, almost plastic-y. I put more of the darkening additive, but it still looks really mask-y, just darker. The block particles are also not as finely ground as I&#x27;m used to, so it doesn&#x27;t look very good. Really disappointing. Was going to try some of the other high-spf block products offered on amazon but they all appear to be made by the same company.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my daughter&#x27;s port wine stain both to protect it from the sun and as a cover-up.  While the sunblock aspect of this product is excellent and we are usually able to tint fairly close to her skin color, it REALLY needs to become waterproof. It tends to wear off fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> This product covers well and has SUNBLOCK. It makes my face look good and covers the spots I need more help with!  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with container, I have arthritis in my hand and it&#x27;s tough to squeeze.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage of blemishes. Feels and looks like foundation but with added SPF protection. Best product I&#x27;ve found that protects skin and looks/feels good.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen a lot. It works as makeup and as skin protection in one and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I really like Fallene&#x27;s other products but this one is a bit chalky for me becasue I have to lighten it so much. I will continue to use the other full spectrum tinted product, however.   I prefer the tubes!  Bring the tubes back!</li>
    <li> This product works well as a makeup and a sunscreen.  It&#x27;s a little thick but it covers really well.  It&#x27;s the best combination of makeup and sunscreen I have found.</li>
    <li> This is one of those low-key, under-the-radar products in a ho-hum package sold mostly thru doctor&#x27;s offices. It reminds me of my Asian BB creams or Kevyn Aucoin&#x27;s Sensual Skin Enhancer -- a thick, dense, full-bodied texture but just a thin layer is needed b/c it&#x27;s LOADED with pigment--- It comes in a beigey neutral shade that is very similar to BB creams, and then two mini tubes of adjustable color to make it lighter or darker (custom matching to your skintone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest thing is that you don&#x27;t need to layer on foundation afterwards, building up layers of cakey product. I just put on my antioxidant serums, then Fallene. That&#x27;s it. I wore it in extreme heat, exposed to the blazing sun for 5+hours, and it protected me all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My HG is normally Elta UV Physical, which i still love, but it&#x27;s too sheer for the heat of summer, and I had to add my BE or other foundation for more coverage &#x3D;&#x3D; cakey layers. So in the warm months, just my serums + Fallene--nothing else. It&#x27;s soooo covering, makes my skin look flawless and porcelain, and i feel so protected that i just had to rave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How&#x27;d I hear of this cult product? I met two prominent NYC socialites at an event here in manhattan and their equally prominent derms/plastic surgeons told them to use Fallene Total Block 60 Tint to wear instead of foundation. These women can afford anything and do whatever they can to maintain appearances. So when they told me that Fallene is all the rage in their \\&quot;circle\\&quot;, i had to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the box doesn&#x27;t list ingredients in proper order (like Elta, *sigh*) but the website gives all the info on the combo of physical + chemical blockers and Z-Cote, patented boosters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a doctor-recommended high level SS with physical and chemical blockers AND something that acts as foundation/concealer (seriously covers blemishes and everything) -- this is it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I have melasma on my top lip from hormonal issues. I love the sun so not being able to go out into it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I would use other products that said they had 50 SPF and were made of clear zinc but my melasma would still darken and get worse after going outside. This product completely covers my melasma like a shield. I use it every morning under my makeup and you can&#x27;t even tell I have it on. It is an actually physical block, not a clear layer, which is why it works. It also comes with a tube of white to lighten the original shade or a darken color to darken it so it works for everyone. I seriously could not survive the summer without this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have discoid lupus and I am not supposed to be out in the sun without protection, when I get a break out from the lupus it is always on my face and since I started using this product I have not had any break outs from discoid lupis on my face.  It is great sun protection and a great cover up, makes my face look flawless and I think it even minimizes my wrinkles!</li>
    <li> For years I have had many a vacation ruined because I break out in hives with very little exposure to the sun.   After my dermatologist recommended this product I tried it. Two vacations later . . . Not a single hive or sunburn.  Well worth the price.   Actually goes pretty far also.</li>
    <li> A little too thick and dry for my liking but everyone is different. This company used to have a product that was silky and creamy...maybe I just ordered the wrong one from their line.</li>
    <li> I am an Esthetician and I wear makeup and I love this product! It is not oily at all. It can be a little thick looking if you don&#x27;t \\&quot;play\\&quot; with it a little. At home where it&#x27;s dry I add a moisurizer underneath but, when I travel to where it&#x27;s more humid I wear it alone and might even mix a couple of drops of water with it on my fingers to thin it out. I have bought this for friends and am reccommending it all the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have cutaneous lupus on my face and it is recommended by the Lupus Foundation.  It has kept the sun off my face but I have just used it for casual sun not being out in the sun all day.     It was a little hard to mix the color right and I&#x27;m not sure I have it exactly where I want it but since I use powder on top of it it does balance out.  I wish it was a little thicker for better coverage of my lupus scars.  It is the thickness of regular sunscreen.  I also wish it was waterproof and didn&#x27;t wipe off so easily.    So far it hasn&#x27;t caused my face to breakout so that is good.  I make sure I take it off at night and don&#x27;t sleep in it or I think it would cause breakouts.    It is the only good option if you need to keep the sun totally off your face and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it in the winter and will switch to a different sunscreen under my regular make-up for then.  This has to do with the cost and the fact that it looks a little greasy by the end of my workday.</li>
    <li> Living in Florida with the humidity this just ran down my face, made my eyes sting and stained my clothes.  This has good ingredients, but is not 100 % physical unscreen.  It&#x27;s so hard to find a sunscreen that won&#x27;t sting your eyes and won&#x27;t make your face break out.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for two reasons, one I have lupus and cannot be in the sun and two I have melisma from my adrenal gland being sluggish. While I always am in the shade, wear a hat, etc etc I break out with everything.  So I really just wanted something I could put above my lip for the melisma and the rest of my body I am good with using other sunscreen.  I cannot use this product all over my face, or I should say I am not willing to try it, as my face is very sensitive to everything in past I have tried to use. I use bare minerals foundation powder with spf 15.  So I didn&#x27;t even have to add any colors. I am fair skinned, dark hair. It was a really good blend but I did feel it could have hidden that melisma look a little better but I may have to fool around with the color. I added one drop of dark to a very small part of product and it was too dark.  It did feel heavy and it did show every wrinkle and I have none above my lip. So I tried putting Aveeno moisturizer spf 35 on top and it looked better when I did this. I am not sure if putting a moisturizer under it will help and I fear that putting something under it may not give you that full protection. I figure putting it over wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal.  I then let it dry for about 10 minutes and put a light part of bare mineral over and it will need to be a light brush over it otherwise it may look too orange.  All in all, I believe this will be a good product !</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing--so gentle, provides great coverage, you dont wind up looking like you have sunscreen on.  the fact that you can tailor it to your exact skin color is awesome.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a complete sunblock that would offer protection for my pregnancy melasma. This formulation offers great coverage and protection. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is an must have to my daily routine. Provides SPF coverage and foundation all in one. Love it!</li>
    <li> This gave me more than I expected.  The sun block comes with two tints to aid in matching skin tone.  As such, it&#x27;s actually perfect to use as a makeup foundation with the added bonus of total sun protection.  I usually set it with powder if I&#x27;m using it as a make up. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this item a lot! It stays on all day and has great coverage. It doesn&#x27;t cake and if used with a makeup brush , you can get a flawless look.  Just make sure to blend well.</li>
    <li> Quality is not as good as  years ago  when I purchased&lt;br /&gt;the same product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen comes with tint bottles so that it matches your skin tone, which is great for re-applying at the pool and not having a mirror to make it perfect looking. However, this stuff is HEAVY and GREASY. It feels like it never dries. It does make it feel like it stays put in sweat and water, which provides great protection, but its not comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> I received a similar product since you were not able to get my regular order.  I just opened this substituted product and shocked to see the color that came out of the container.  It was black!!!  I tried to lighten the color with accompanied color control but could not come up with the right color.  My other product I had been getting was in perfect skin color.  Not the grayish black like this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used total block for years, at least 4. I&#x27;ve really liked it for a good sunblock with tint. However this one I bought won&#x27;t mix no matter how much I shake it and use it as if it&#x27;s really old.  It&#x27;s all separated and gross (watery when I pour it out). I have to really rub it in my hands before applying. I&#x27;m going to back to the other seller I bought from to get a new bottle.</li>
    <li> Best sun block that you can buy!  I have been using Total Block for over 10 years and love this sun block.  I don&#x27;t need to wear make up because this acts as a foundation.  I can be in the sun for 8+ hours and never get any sun.  Which at my age is great!  I have people ask me after a 10 hour hike - how come your face doesn&#x27;t have any sun and I am burned.  Love this product and will continue to use for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I have melasma and try to keep my face from getting sun.  I needed something to protect my face on my trip to Israel since we would be touring and spending a lot of time outside, and wearing hats is not my thing.  I love this product.  It has completely replaced my foundation.  It works great as a sunblock and as a foundation since it&#x27;s tinted.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product from different sources for my mother who has used the Fallene Total Block consistently for the last 5 years.  Mom has always LOVED the coverage and look it has provided for her face, neck and arms. This time she had me order 10 bottles because as she explained, &amp;#34;at 85 years of age, she needs all of the help she can get!&amp;#34;  However, she did not open any of the bottles until she needed to use today and the product was very thick and almost dried to the point she could barely get any out of the bottle to use. The product she has received in the past is very creamy and pours out of the bottle easily.  She shook all of the remaining bottles and it felt like a rock was inside.  All of the bottles are obviously old product.  Unfortunately, I attempted to return and the 30 day return policy had just expired.  My advice to anyone buying this, SHAKE THE BOTTLES FOR AN EASY FLOW OF LIQUID IF IT IS THICK ALMOST LIKE CHUNKS OF MATERIAL SHAKING INSIDE, RETURN IMMEDIATELY BEFORE PRODUCT RETURN RUNS OUT.</li>
    <li> Fresh batch.  Bought last stock from Coolibar and the mixture was sticky and gooky.  This batch from amazon is fresh.  What a joy!</li>
    <li> Really good, I little bit thick.</li>
    <li> This product is like a liquid foundation and gives pretty heavy coverage so if you are use to that you will love this right out of the box.  I wear a lightweight powder foundation so this took a bit of tweaking to get the right consistency for me, and I can&#x27;t find a powder foundation with this high of a SPF and even the ones I can find don&#x27;t have great color selection.  The color out of the box was a great match for my skin.  I have oily skin and always use oil free products when possible, so the first time I applied directly on my skin and it was a bit too dry or thick for me even with my oily skin.  The second time I mixed a clear oil-free sunscreen with this tinted one and that was the perfect combination for me I think it made the product seem lighter.  High SPF tinted foundation or powder foundation are impossible to find so I am hopeful this will do the trick on the days I really need the extra protection.  I want to get the waterproof block and try mixing that with this one to see what that might be like.  I have tried other tinted sunblocks but this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, looks great and comes with two extra tubes of coloring to lighten or darken the sunscreen.  There is no reason to be chalky white with this screen.  A tinted total block, it does the work and enhances the skin as well.  While it is not a make up, this summer I have easily worn this instead of foundation and nobody seems to know the difference.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over 15 years. Use it every day. Great coverage/protection and you can tint to your desired shade.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin.  the tones were too dark for me.</li>
    <li> It works well but my husband has trouble with it rubbing off on his clothes.  I prefer Fallene Cotz Plus SPF 58 Water Resistant UVB/UVA .  Total Block is pretty thick whereas the Cotz Plus is lighter and goes on easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product! I love that it does double duty as both sunscreen and foundation. It was easy to blend the color to achieve a perfect match to my skintone. It provides just the right amount of natural coverage and protects my skin from the sun. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products over the years, but my melasma still seemed to darken every summer. This is the only product that has held the dark pigment at bay. Four months later, I&#x27;m still using the same bottle. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase when I run out. There are two drawbacks, but I&#x27;m willing to overlook them because this sunblock does its job so well. First, this product burns my eyes. I have allergies, and it seems to run into my eyes when they water. Of course, this burns and creates even more tears. Second, this sunblock is not waterproof. If you swim, sweat, get caught in the rain, or cry, it will wash off immediately.</li>
    <li> I have horribly oily skin and need a sunscreen/sunblock that does not get shiny after awhile. I like the fact this was tinted, so I did not have to wear makeup, although the original color was a little too light for me. There is a small container of colorant to darken it and/or personalize your color.  This sunblock worked okay on not too hot or humid days, in fact I even got a compliment by a woman that told me I had a beautiful complexion and my skin just glowed when I was wearing the Fallene Sunblock (she did not know I was wearing sunblock at the time).  Although,another time on a hot, humid summer day the sunblock melted and looked horrible in several hours accentuating my big pores. AND.. a couple of times when I looked in a mirror in a public washroom and saw my face with the Fallene on it I looked washed out and ghostly, plus it was kind of thick looking and just settled in my pores.  So, for me it was just okay half the time.</li>
    <li> I am subject to basal cell skin cancer.  I have used Fallene Total Block for years and loved it.  When I received the latest order of it, everything about it was new and different.  At first I thought they made a mistake but after reading the instructions, I thought it was probably the same product with new packaging.  The problem came  when I tried to shake the mixture vigorously but  couldn&#x27;t tell if the mixture  was getting properly mixed.  I took off the cap.  The mixture was so thick, I couldn&#x27;t imagine anything blending if I wanted to change the color.  I don&#x27;t know what to do with it.  At this point, I&#x27;m trying to stretch out the previous order as long as possible.  The makers of this product should recall the old saying &amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.&amp;#34;  I am disappointed in this new version.</li>
    <li> This sunblock is like woman&#x27;s make-up --  I bought this at the suggestion of my doctor and did not realize it was make-up like --  The instructions indicate to add some drops from  a tube supplied with the product if it is too dark, but I am not prepared to start mixing ingredients --  I will use my wife&#x27;s sunblock ( Olay )  that is formulated as I expected from the tube</li>
    <li> Love this product! You can tint it to whatever shade matches your complexion and it&#x27;s really easy! Really Awesome product!</li>
    <li> It is really like using makeup with sun protection. I didn&#x27;t care for the way it blended. I really like the clear one better.</li>
    <li> I do a good bit of gardening and this product is actually keeping my chest from getting a not-so-pretty \\&quot;farmer&#x27;s tan.\\&quot;  Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried has worked as well and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch!    The even more exciting news ... for me! ... is that it is an incredible foundation!!!  My skin looks smooth and it evens out any \\&quot;discolorations\\&quot; (A nice way of saying age spots and rosacea).  Wow!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product because It doubles as makeup.  You can mix the color to match your skin and it does a great job of protecting your skin from the suns rays.</li>
    <li> It is wonderfull product. Beside being sun protector you can use it as make up.  And look well.  It is a mater to practice</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Can make any color I need and don&#x27;t need to use foundation! Will definitely order this item again!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I use it everyday as make up on top of my moisturizer!! The texture is tick, which provides good coverage and protection, and has 60% sun screen!! The other thing I like is the minerals sunscreen in it!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Use over regular sunscreen for long days in the sun and/or water.  Have even used it for coverup.  Sent it to my daughter when was in Afghanistan for intense sun.  Use it on my husbands bald spot when snorkeling.</li>
    <li> My family has used Fallene products over 50 years, starting when a gas oven exploded in my mother&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;I have used sunblock over 10 years. Only one time did it arrive dried out and unable to use. I tried total block this time because of the good reviews and they were out of the regular sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unused the entire tube of lightening tint. It is still too dark and is so thick it is a paste.&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t even shake out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to contact fallene. They have no customer service contact info on the tube.&lt;br /&gt;No tel or web info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had skin cancer on my face and am on a trip working inmNYC. The sun is very bright.&lt;br /&gt;When their sunblock is fresh it is the best.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is my second experience with what seems to be old product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not inexpensive. unfortunately I will have to go today to look for a replacement for fallene.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to do while I work in an unfamiliar city.</li>
    <li> great product. It covers most of the defects on my facial skin. I have very, very sensitive and thin skin and it causes no problem, very gentle product. It&#x27;s worked for everything it claimed for. I used this over 10 years now. will continue indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I use this every day in the Midwest and plan to continue using it through fall and winter. It doubles as sun protection and makeup. The customized tinting is sometimes tricky to match to my skin tone but I love that it&#x27;s customizable and the coverage is great. I struggle with acne and have been using this in my makeup bag as a product recommended by an esthetician and so far so good- my breakouts are healing and this provides great coverage in the meantime. It really evens out the skin tone well, blends well and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.</li>
    <li> This sunblock provides great physical sun protection.  It is good for people who have normal or combination to oily skin.  It feels a little heavy on your face but not as gross or greasy as regular sunblock or sunscreen.  It actually provides decent coverage and evens out your skin tone quite nicely.  The concept of being able to adjust the color of the foundation is pretty cool.  I wish cosmetic companies would provide regular foundations with this concept.  The color is pretty neutral, neither warm nor cool toned.  I could see, however, that on darker skin tones it could possibly be a little ashy due to the mineral sunblock content.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Total Block while I was using bleaching creme to rid my fair skin face of dark spots caused by the sun.  Once the spots were gone, I continued to use this product as my foundation b/c of it&#x27;s incredible coverage yet it&#x27;s so light.  It has SPF 60 and can be color matched to your skin - any time of year b/c of the self-tinting packages it comes with. When I was pregnant I used this product to avoid getting dark spots of pregnancy from sun exposure. I adore this product and highly recommend it to anyone who wants SPF and incredible coverage. (Amazon has the best price on the web - trust me, i&#x27;ve searched!)</li>
    <li> Excelent productor; solar protection and also acting as a veryt effective fundation. The adjusting of color is great and allows a very good match to my skin. Since I have began to use this product I observed an improvement with no more pimples.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with medium-dark skin.  This sunscreen really helped with the hypo pigmentation (light patches) on my face. It&#x27;s exacerbated by sun exposure, so it&#x27;s important that I use a total sun block containing something like zinc oxide. The problem with blockers like zinc oxide is it leaves a weird white sheen on my face making me appear Zombie-ish. This product is great as it comes with a little tube of pigment to make it darker. If you mess up there&#x27;s another tube to lighten it. I had to use the whole tube to get it to an acceptable color but it still left me a little pale in the face. It&#x27;s also somewhat dry and hard to apply evenly. I&#x27;ve figured out how to make it look more natural; I first apply a moisturizer like Cetaphil. Then use just a small amount at a time because it dries quickly. Using the moisturizer helps it to spread easier and more evenly.  It&#x27;s not at all water proof so not really suited for swimming.  Good product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over eight years, the tinted sunblock.  I have loved this product in the past!&lt;br /&gt;On this order, I purchased two bottles and both were defective.  In one bottle, the product was so thick that it was a hard consistency and I could not get it out of the bottle.  The second bottle, it was extremely thick and would barely pour.  Both bottles, the base color was extremely dark, almost black, which it should have been a tannish color.  When I tried to add the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; color to adjust the color, it would not mix at all.  The color and consistency was streaky.  I shook the bottle vigorously over a hundred times when I first opened the bottle after I got it, hoping it would blend, and a few minutes before each use.  This did not correct the problem.  This order was definitely defective.</li>
    <li> I found I could not use this product, it leaves a chalky look. It probably works for a very fair person but for all other skins, it is looks too fake</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation I have ever used.  It is easy to apply, completely covers and evens the skin tone, and stays on all day without clumping up.  Like the other reviewers, I appreciate that it dries matte.  I tried it because I have lupus and live at a high altitude, so I need extra UV protection.  So far so good.  The ability to lighten and darken the tone is great, although I do wish there were a way to add cooler/pink tones, since it is a tad yellowish.  That being said, I get lots of compliments about my skin when I wear this and, hey, I feel pretty!</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with my Fallene Total Block</li>
    <li> More like makeup than sunscreen :( This stuff might do a good job of blocking the sun but I wouldn&#x27;t really know because I&#x27;m not going to use it.  It&#x27;s really gross and embarrassing if you sweat when you have this on, as you look like you&#x27;re just sweating off makeup.  Also you can&#x27;t just apply it on the go because you will have makeup all over your hand, you have to be able to wash your hands after.  I have used other tinted facial sunscreens before that I did not have these problems with, I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money to try this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as I do most Amazon products--based on the reviews. Unfortunately this product was too thick to spread on my face, even when I moisturized first, mixed moisturizer with the product, applied to a wet face,added water, nothing would evenly distribute the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; on my face, rendering it useless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fallene Total Block SPF 60 tinted for 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use. Just follow the instruction and mix the white sunscreen that comes with the product until it matches your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;- It does what it claims. No color, no sunburn after a tennis game under sizzling sun at NOON in SOUTH FLORIDA. A-mazing!&lt;br /&gt;- Looks natural. I use it as foundation after moisturizer. My skin \\&quot;absorbs\\&quot; it fairly quickly, unlike some other foundations kinda \\&quot;float\\&quot; on my skin. It gives a very natural look and an illusion that I don&#x27;t wear any make up. This product brightens my skin instantly and gives me an energetic look. (I&#x27;m Asian so my skin is a bit yellow and looks a bit tired). Again this product does the effect and still looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;- It stays!! whole day!! Even after a tennis game in hot humid south Florida! It works wayyy better than those high-end, pricy foundation. (i.e. Channel, Shiseido)&lt;br /&gt;- Economic. Just a few drops and it covers whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Dry. This product is dry and it&#x27;s hard to apply it onto my skin, even though I use moisturizer before it. I don&#x27;t want to mix it with the moisturizer because that will decrease SPF.&lt;br /&gt;- Causes acnes. It&#x27;s a huge problem. In the end I abandoned this product because of it. Shame. I have a very healthy skin and I never had any acne problem in my entire life, not even in puberty. I noticed some acnes appeared on my skin after starting using this product. I didn&#x27;t mind at the beginning (I thought it must be because of sweat as I started playing tennis. And the acnes were just little ones and just one or two at a time). Until several months later, I realized I have this acne problem for months! They just keep coming and coming, here and there. To the point that I really fed up! \\&quot;What happened to my healthy behaved skin!?\\&quot; I started examine all my skin products and I found out Total Block was the only new thing. I stopped using it and the acnes were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like this product except it causes acnes. I am an outdoor activities lover and I love this product as a great sunscreen, stays all day, and looks very natural. (As it will look very weird to wear make up when hiking in mountains and rural sites, but hey, i still wanna look good on the pictures!) Now I kinda use it on and off cuz it always brings me acnes. It&#x27;s a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can anyone please let me know if you have the same problem? I saw other reviews said it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts but it seems more of the reviewers used the clear one. I really like this product but don&#x27;t know what to do with the acnes. I used makeup remover to clean it but that did not help. Anyone knows how to tackle? Otherwise I&#x27;ll have to look for other products..</li>
    <li> Once I get the color mixed right, I use it as my daily make up.  I have to use a lot of the dark color to get a medium beige.  I apply it with a brush and it works fine. I have to use a total block on my face, Because I am prone to basal cells On my face, And my doctor recommended this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage. Great product!</li>
    <li> great for blocking harmful sun rays, as well providing a physical barrier against the elements. Works better as a fondation than all the other ones Ive ever tried. Simply love this product, never am without. More affordable then any foundation near its calliber would be!</li>
    <li> I knew that I had to reapply sunscreen every 2 hours. But I had some sun&#x27;s spots already that I needed it to conceal. Reapplying sunscreen was removing my make up and that was not good. So, I came across this product that solved all my problems.&lt;br /&gt;The tinted variety came already beige in color that you can adjust by adding a few drops at the time of either dark or lighter tint. Remember to shake well not only the sunscreen bottle but also the tint adjuster containers.&lt;br /&gt;It mached perfectly my latin tone in a few minutes. It&#x27;s not greasy and I can re- appply without a problem. I would really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Hi product users, want to know will this suit a browny skin(Indian origin) and is this for Men?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks in advance!!!</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this make-up. I just wish I had found this sooner. The color match kit included is really easy to do and if you darkened it too much it&#x27;s fixable by using a few drops of the lightener (you&#x27;re not doomed). The coverage was just right to me. It&#x27;s thick enough to cover irregular splotches on my skin without prepping with concealer. But it&#x27;s not so thick you feel like you&#x27;re putting lard on your face. Tip- wait the full 5 minutes before you put  on other make-up. Otherwise it&#x27;ll get messy and the make-up just needs a few minutes to dry prior to blush, powder or what have you.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it, she was able to match it perfectly to her skin tone. The product comes with 2 additional bottles so you can make clearer or darker and get just the right tone. My wife always complained of other products been too oily or just melting away under the sun. With this one here skin is absolutely dry. Will definately be getting more.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good total block.  I still got freckles with this block even when using it diligently.  It is kind of runny but very sticky..  If it spills on anything it is hard to get off.</li>
    <li> I chose the tinted rather than the clear in this product to see if I could get away without putting on my foundation.  It is thick but I find if I use a good moisturizer under it that it smooths on pretty well.  It is a very concealing sunscreen.  I was afraid it might look like I was wearing a mask or had a mannequin&#x27;s complexion, but feedback is that it looks no different than my other make up.  Controls my shiny oily face far longer during the day than makeup.  Had to adjust the color just a tad, but it was easy and successful in matching skin tone.</li>
    <li> I used to wear a high spf under my makeup everyday.  Now... I use this tinted sunscreen and no foundation required.  Sometimes I top it with a light dusting of mineral powder.&lt;br /&gt;It really protects....I even wear it when running and it stays on!  I have sensitive skin.. no issues.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favourite finds.</li>
