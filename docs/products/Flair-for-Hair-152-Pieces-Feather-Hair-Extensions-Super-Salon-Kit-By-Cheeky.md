<li> All three have different lengths of hair, from short to long.</li>
<li> Although she isn&#x27;t allowed to wear them at school, but they seemed to last a long time in her hair.</li>
<li> I have to go through the tedious process of returning the WHOLE kit to get one that includes my beads, when it would be much easier for all parties involved</li>
<li> The feathers were bent and many of them were broken or had clumps missing from their midsections.</li>
<li> Some of the feathers were only half feathers and they were super stiff a negative.</li>
<li> For the price it was as expected.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s missing the beads that are promised to come with the kit.</li>
<li> if I was just sent my missing beads....</li>
<li> Not happy about that.</li>
<li> Unfortunately there were no directions on the package</li>

    <li> This has everything you need in it a huge plus. Some of the feathers were only half feathers and they were super stiff a negative. Overall a good product and I would order from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I thought it was a pretty nice set!! As soon as you watch a video on how to do it its a piece of cake. :) theres really nothing negative about this set!it was delivered within four days and truly great!</li>
    <li> This product was very useful for my sister&#x27;s sleep overs with our cousin. They had a ton of fun!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas. BEWARE--there are NO DIRECTIONS in package. There is, however a really easy and simply video on the company&#x27;s website. That being said, I have done 3 sets of extensions (my 2 daughters&#x27; and a friend&#x27;s). All three have different lengths of hair, from short to long. This is insanely easy to do!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must buy for parents of girls who want the extensions (which come in tons of colors, styles, and lengths). Much cheaper and easier than taking them to someone to get it done! Love, love, love this!!!</li>
    <li> i would happily give five stars as delivery was super prompt except I opened the box and it&#x27;s missing the beads that are promised to come with the kit.

    <li> She loved it. Although she isn&#x27;t allowed to wear them at school, but they seemed to last a long time in her hair. Tools were easy to install feather (according to my sister). Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a better deal on a feather hair extension kit. I haven&#x27;t done them before so I wanted something that included all the tools. It comes with a good amount of beads and extensions to play around with, though some of the feathers are a little too unnatural looking for my personal taste, it&#x27;s a lot of fun/easy to use and worth the money.</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
    <li> I am so bummed!  I just got this in the mail but the beads it says is included is not here!  Hmmm....  Not happy about that.</li>
    <li> I was super excited about this kit but when it arrived I realized that this is aimed at kids. The feathers were bent and many of them were broken or had clumps missing from their midsections. Would be a good idea for kids, but for the price I would just suggest going to a craft store and buying the feathers separately.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my niece.  I haven&#x27;t seen her use them, but she says she loves them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage niece. She likes them. For the price it was as expected. I&#x27;d order again.</li>
    <li> it  was  a gift  and she loves it . she  always  wanted  one  like  this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would reccomend this  to</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I got them for my 10 year olds birthday party and was amazed by how many feathers there were and all of them in great condition. Unfortunately there were no directions on the package but if you go to their website there is a short video that shows exactly how to do it. The girls and I had a blast and so easy to do. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I bought for my niece&#x27;s birthday party all items were a big hit and very easy to add to hair stayed in for about 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Used for my daughters 9th birthday party on all the girls. Its was so easy and the feathers lasted for weeks in their hair. Now we just change them out for fun to match different outfits.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on the girls at my daughter&#x27;s birthday party.  They loved it.  And I would definitely buy it again if the need existed.  However, there were NO INSTRUCTIONS and the website indicated in the box didn&#x27;t have any instructions on it.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVED this.</li>
