      <li>This stuff works great, a bit messy as it sprays on, but you need to try it!</li>

      <li>I highly recommend!</li>

<li> This is the only deodorant that eliminates completely the odor of my feet, i have tried everything snd this works like a champ.</li>
<li> Its a little wet when you first put your shoes on</li>
<li> Used it all winter long last year.</li>
<li> I had never heard of it until I started searching the internet for foot odor remedies other than your basic Odor Eaters or Dr. Scholl&#x27;s (which by the way either don&#x27;t work or mask the odor with another funky smell).</li>
<li> I always spray after I wash and dry my feet.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, its become an all natural headache due to the constant clogging.  </li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t mind getting your MacGyver on every single day just to get a few sprays then this may be the product for you.  </li>
<li> A few of the other reviewers mentioned they had a problem with the nozzle getting clogged....</li>
<li> I agree with the previous poster.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle.</li>
<li> No special prepping or processes, just spray on after you&#x27;ve dried off after your shower...</li>
<li> I use this to spray inside my little kids shoes and it works well!</li>
<li> not sure what that&#x27;s about because I haven&#x27;t had the slightest problem with mine</li>
<li> How hard it is to put a filter at the bottom of the tube to prevent the salt grains from coming up the tubing and blocking the sprayer.&lt;br</li>
<li> can&#x27;t get much easier to take care of an annoying issue.</li>
<li> The smell got worse!</li>
<li> After that nothing.&lt;br /&gt;The spray it self is lousy.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it uses salt that was clogging the sprayer by day 2.  </li>
<li> The product itself may or may not work...will never know due to the terrible packaging.</li>
<li> /&gt;Needless to say it is disappointing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t decide if this really works or not. Convenient, and no white powder. Used it all winter long last year.</li>
    <li> Have been spraying my son&#x27;s feet and shoes per instructions.  Seems to be working so far.  We have noticed odor improvement.  Nice to have in mind that the chemicals are not harmful.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous poster. This is basically salt water and it does not work! I rarely wear shoes as I live in California. I spray this 5-6 times between the toes, under my feet, and on my toe nails. I always spray after I wash and dry my feet. I also washed my sandals. The smell got worse! Save your money!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing for anyone who&#x27;s feet sweat a little more then they would like them too. If I am going sockless in sandals or heels then I spray it directly on my feet before slipping my shoes on. If I am wearing socks or tights then I spray it directly into my shoes. Its a little wet when you first put your shoes on but it really keeps them smelling fresher longer. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, a bit messy as it sprays on, but you need to try it!</li>
    <li> very good, for those who have sensitive skin and allergic to chemicals, I produce almost any product allergy, even so-called hypoallergenic, any product I produce allergy, but with this I have done very well,</li>
    <li> Seems to be working thus far. I like that it is a sparay rather than a roll-on. It really is unscented - you can&#x27;t smell a thing when you spray it.</li>
    <li> Did not help at all. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The product works for about 4 hours. After that nothing.&lt;br /&gt;The spray it self is lousy. Does not spray a lot. Need to clear out stem and nozzle often</li>
    <li> I use this to spray inside my little kids shoes and it works well! Keeps them from getting smelly too fast. Happy to find something natural that won&#x27;t harm my children.</li>
    <li> One the first day of use I sprayed on my feet after getting out of the shower and drying off.  I also sprayed in my leather dress shoes for work.  After a full day, my girlfriend indicated that there was slight improvement.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to work immediately, especially with my older shoes, so I wanted to give it an honest shot before righting the review.  Unfortunately, it uses salt that was clogging the sprayer by day 2.  I got unclogged but then had the same issue on day 3, day 4 and now its sitting on a shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product because of the price point and it was all natural.  Unfortunately, its become an all natural headache due to the constant clogging.  How hard it is to put a filter at the bottom of the tube to prevent the salt grains from coming up the tubing and blocking the sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say it is disappointing.  If you don&#x27;t mind getting your MacGyver on every single day just to get a few sprays then this may be the product for you.  The product itself may or may not work...will never know due to the terrible packaging.</li>
    <li> I find that powders and commercial sprays make me congested.  Crystal is different. It is a fantastic foot deodorant and works great on shoes.  It does tend to dry out my feet, however it is worth it because it works.  It is unscented, and I like that</li>
    <li> I have been using this over two years.  It is a must have along with the Crystal underarm.  Very thankful for a great product!!  Love that it is unscented!!</li>
    <li> Really surprised that this super simple product works so well.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days and notice a difference already.  No special prepping or processes, just spray on after you&#x27;ve dried off after your shower...can&#x27;t get much easier to take care of an annoying issue.</li>
    <li> My husband gets really, really smelly feet in the summer.  Even in sandals.  This product has solved that problem.  Yesterday I noticed a distinct odor when he took off his sandals, and found out he had run out of the spray.  Am re-ordering with a spare bottle so that doesn&#x27;t happen again.  Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent for this cheap price</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that eliminates completely the odor of my feet, i have tried everything snd this works like a champ. I aldo use the armoit deodorant.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is WHERE HAS THIS PRODUCT BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?! I had never heard of it until I started searching the internet for foot odor remedies other than your basic Odor Eaters or Dr. Scholl&#x27;s (which by the way either don&#x27;t work or mask the odor with another funky smell). After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I cannot say enough about this spray! I just spray my feet a few times after I shower and no matter how much my feet sweat during the day I can take my shoes off and there is NO ODOR. I started spraying the insides of my shoes (since some of them are older and stink from continuous wear) and this product helps keep the stench away! I immediately spray the insides of any new pair of shoes and guaranteed they won&#x27;t even have the chance to smell! A few of the other reviewers mentioned they had a problem with the nozzle getting clogged....not sure what that&#x27;s about because I haven&#x27;t had the slightest problem with mine and I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle. If you have embarrassing foot odor and long to be able to take off your shoes (or even keep them on) without your feet reeking then THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU! I will continue to buy and use.</li>
