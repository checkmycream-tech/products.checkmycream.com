      <li>&#x3D;D</li>
      <li>I love it!!!</li>
      <li>I felt so gorgeous that night!</li>
      <li>This one is so great.</li>
      <li>works great, makes lips look plumper and prettier.</li>
      <li>The effectiveness is short-term, but it is still a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The advanced one id the best.</li>
      <li>I love this product to death!</li>
      <li>Sun Diego is kind of a pearly pinky peach.</li>
      <li>it goes on to make a nice gloss..</li>
      <li>I even got a compliment on how nice my bottom lip is 2 days ago.</li>
      <li>This lip plumper is so freaking amazing, when I lost my advanced formula on Friday, I bought 2 to replace mine and have 1 as a backup.  </li>
      <li>Mostly picking them up at the drugstore or buying whatever they have on sale at TJ Maxx.</li>
      <li>I never would have paid more than $15 for a lip</li>
      <li>Thanks for this great product.</li>
      <li>I love my Lip Fusion Advanced XL but this is the Runner UP.</li>
      <li>My lips are all the more luscious when using the Advanced XL before bed and City Lips during the day with a splash of color....</li>
      <li>Hands down, the best lip plumper</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if my lips are plumper from the collagen or from mild inflammation!</li>
      <li>the lip plumper DID do was completely smooth the wrinkles from my lips and make them look fuller and poutier.</li>
      <li>I recently ordered this product and was impressed with how fast I received it.  </li>
      <li>A friend of mine, who has been using this lip plumper for several months, shared her wonderful results with me, and I was determined to have my lips look as soft and full as her lips always look everytime</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product, I already have great lips, but this definitely got rid of lines and made them look younger!</li>
      <li>feels good on dry lips and under lipstick.</li>
      <li>The first time I wore this, I got complimented TWICE!</li>
      <li>Either way, my mouth looks more balanced (my upper lips aren&#x27;t full).</li>
      <li>If i use this in the long run i know my lips will stay nice and plump.</li>
      <li>I asked one of them if I could borrow her lip gloss because the color was really pretty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for one month and absolutely love the way my lips feel while wearing it underneath my regular lipgloss or lipstick.  </li>
      <li>That one is my second favorite.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different plumpers, and I keep my lips moisturized all the time</li>
      <li>Very soft, very pretty</li>
      <li>, however, this is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that has a really noticeable effect for plumping your lips.  </li>
      <li>It certainly does what it is supposed to</li>
      <li>I really do like this product.</li>
      <li>My lips are even starting to remain wrinkle free for some time after the product wears off.</li>
      <li>I guess I was expecting too much.  </li>
      <li>So yes, I&#x27;m sold and I would highly recommend City Lips!</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized it was a lip plumper at first, because normally the lip plumpers</li>
      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for a lip gloss.</li>
      <li>Well, I really didn&#x27;t want to see</li>
      <li>, I was going out with some friends one night and when we were getting ready</li>
      <li>i had high hopes.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for the last five years and even though I am almost 63, my lips are soft and full.  </li>
      <li>Normally when my gloss or plumper wears off it leaves my lips drier than even.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;After that experience, I bought the clear gloss for everyday wear, and I love it.</li>
      <li>Worth the money, lasts a long time</li>
      <li>But i know city lips has long term benefits so its worth the money.</li>
      <li>Makes a pretty clear lip gloss plumps and makes lips super soft tube is not messy Ive only been using this a week cant wait to see its long term benefits</li>
      <li>I would either get a colored gloss for the day and a clear for bedtime or just get the clear.</li>
      <li>I also noticed that when the City Lips wore off, my lips remained soft.</li>
      <li>I bought this from City Lips directly.  </li>
      <li>I cannot tell any difference in my lips so far.  </li>
      <li>They are not overly thin but it would be nice if they were a tad fuller.</li>
      <li>but the only drawback is that your lipstick comes off easily as it does not dry on your lips but keeps them moist so you may need to reapply your lipstick a few times during the day.</li>

<li> The drawback is they&#x27;re expensive.  </li>
<li> i found this product disappointing.  </li>
<li> This is the worst</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different plumbers and City has earned it&#x27;s spot as my \\&quot;go to\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t use it often enough to get the permanent results but it lasts all day after one use and that&#x27;s enough for me! A+</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product and was impressed with how fast I received it.  It certainly does what it is supposed to but the only drawback is that your lipstick comes off easily as it does not dry on your lips but keeps them moist so you may need to reapply your lipstick a few times during the day.</li>
    <li> For the price, I would not recommend this product.  I cannot tell any difference in my lips so far.  I guess I was expecting too much.  It may work differently on each person.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one month and absolutely love the way my lips feel while wearing it underneath my regular lipgloss or lipstick.  A friend of mine, who has been using this lip plumper for several months, shared her wonderful results with me, and I was determined to have my lips look as soft and full as her lips always look everytime I see her.  Thanks for this great product.</li>
    <li> This is the worst co I&#x27;ve ever had to deal with .I placed one order and was sent an e-mail stating I had placed 2 orders..I sent 5 e-mails and never received a reply.I sent a correction within 2hrs after they sent me the e-mail with the error.5days and I&#x27;ve gotten no replay .It only took them about 3hrs to take the money from my account and I&#x27;m still waiting for my money to be returned to my bank&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramona Bryant</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best lip plumper I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I have tried so many different plumpers, and I keep my lips moisturized all the time, however, this is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that has a really noticeable effect for plumping your lips.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I wore this, I got complimented TWICE! So yes, I&#x27;m sold and I would highly recommend City Lips!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for you.  I don&#x27;t know how it helps anybody .  I have put it on in the morning and night and look in the mirror and my lips are the same as they were before I bought this product.</li>
    <li> i found this product disappointing.  it doesn&#x27;t plump my lips and it makes it difficult to use my lip liner.  sorry.  i had high hopes.</li>
    <li> I decided to give it another try. The effectiveness is short-term, but it is still a good moisturizer. Hence, a 3-star.</li>
    <li> Makes a pretty clear lip gloss plumps and makes lips super soft tube is not messy Ive only been using this a week cant wait to see its long term benefits</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of lip plumpers. Mostly picking them up at the drugstore or buying whatever they have on sale at TJ Maxx. I never would have paid more than $15 for a lip plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I was going out with some friends one night and when we were getting ready I asked one of them if I could borrow her lip gloss because the color was really pretty. She let me borrow her City Lips, (it was a colored one, but I don&#x27;t remember the shade.) I hadn&#x27;t realized it was a lip plumper at first, because normally the lip plumpers I try irritate my lips when I put them on. they also leave a red ring around my lips and this one didn&#x27;t do anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the lip plumper DID do was completely smooth the wrinkles from my lips and make them look fuller and poutier. I felt so gorgeous that night! I also noticed that when the City Lips wore off, my lips remained soft. Normally when my gloss or plumper wears off it leaves my lips drier than even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that experience, I bought the clear gloss for everyday wear, and I love it. My lips are even starting to remain wrinkle free for some time after the product wears off. The only drawback is that it can be difficult to get all of the product out of the tube.</li>
    <li> I love my Lip Fusion Advanced XL but this is the Runner UP. Its thick, IT WORKS and and it lasts.... My lips are all the more luscious when using the Advanced XL before bed and City Lips during the day with a splash of color....</li>
    <li> Used it religiously 2-3 times a day. The results were about the same I could get from a lip balm. There was no plumping of the lips. A lot of money for no results.</li>
    <li> works great, makes lips look plumper and prettier. feels good on dry lips and under lipstick. Worth the money, lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I bought the Dark Spot Remover &amp; used it for 4 months with absolutely no results! I paid for snake oil. They have a 60 return/refund policy. This was an expensive lesson. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Also you can&#x27;t post without giving it a star, so consider MINUS all stars!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product, I already have great lips, but this definitely got rid of lines and made them look younger!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and it really works.  Just put some on before bed and all the next day your lips will be fuller.</li>
    <li> I bought this from City Lips directly.  This lip plumper is so freaking amazing, when I lost my advanced formula on Friday, I bought 2 to replace mine and have 1 as a backup.  The drawback is they&#x27;re expensive.  $35.00 for a lip gloss is a hard pill to swallow; but seriously, my lips became plump and they stay plump.  I love this product to death! I hope I never grow immune to its effects.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waster your money.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything it says it will.  I&#x27;d rather buy Clinique&#x27;s lipgloss and take my chances.</li>
    <li> This one is so great.Ive been using twice a day for a week and even after i take it off my lips are plumper.The other city original plumper sucks in my opinion.The advanced one id the best.Plus it lasts on your lips for awhile.The lines are gone and i look pouty.If i use this in the long run i know my lips will stay nice and plump.I even got a compliment on how nice my bottom lip is 2 days ago.If you cannot afford this as it is pricey i recommend the Too faced lip injection.That one is my second favorite.But i know city lips has long term benefits so its worth the money. &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Big let down. Does not deliver intended effects. Leaves sticky lips with no plump. I would not buy again. Not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> it goes on to make a nice gloss..not sure it does anything though.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone. expensive if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I bought the Sun Diego lip plumper hoping to give my lips a little extra fullness. They are not overly thin but it would be nice if they were a tad fuller. As an immediate lip plumper I would have to give this gloss two stars. I saw no difference whatsoever. As a lip gloss it&#x27;s about a four. So I averaged it out to a three! Sun Diego is kind of a pearly pinky peach. Very soft, very pretty but I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for a lip gloss. I can&#x27;t rate the City Lips as a long term plumper because I didn&#x27;t apply it per their instructions. They recommend applying the lip gloss twice a day, every day. Once in the daytime and once before going to bed. Well, I really didn&#x27;t want to see Sun Diego Lip Gloss all over my pillow so I only applied it once a day. If I were seriously trying to use this as a limp plumper I would either get a colored gloss for the day and a clear for bedtime or just get the clear.</li>
    <li> Truly the best product for lips...period!  Whether you have chapped lips, doing makeup, or going to bed...I always have this product on.  The peptides in this product generate the collagen in your lips, that make them fuller!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last five years and even though I am almost 63, my lips are soft and full.  I attribute it to City Cosmetics plumper</li>
    <li> I really do like this product. I don&#x27;t know if my lips are plumper from the collagen or from mild inflammation! Either way, my mouth looks more balanced (my upper lips aren&#x27;t full). The drawbacks are: it&#x27;s gooey, you need something over it or your lips stick together; it&#x27;s expensive; you have to reapply frequently and arrange drink breaks accordingly. I will likely buy it again.</li>
