    <li> Great price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> great grey coverage and pretty color</li>
    <li> I love Naturtint. I&#x27;ve tried several colors and they are all long lasting, easy to apply and best of all no harmful chemicals.  Buying here by the case saves me a lot of money compared to buying a box at a time at the store.</li>
    <li> This product has no odor, the color is true and permanent.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, Amazon sells this hair color for HALF the price where I first found it in a high end retail  store!</li>
    <li> My hair color came out really nice and my hair is softer than usual.  I like that there is no bad smell, and that they include both shampoo and conditioner in the pack.  The gloves included are bigger than what I&#x27;ve had in other products which is nice, seems like the other ones were always on the small side.  The directions recommend you comb the color through which I did, and that worked out well, even color.  Did cover my grey.  I will but again for sure.</li>
    <li> My wife is satisfied with using this product from many years ago , as it is not necessary that you use hair color regularly .</li>

    <li> Better for you, no ammonia so you don&#x27;t stink up the house. Works well, looks natural, not over colored and covers grays.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Covers the gray.  I keep it on a little longer.  Only because I have thick hair.  The color lasts me for two months.  Also, the price is half of what I paid in the store.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and undamaged</li>
    <li> Excellent product and timely shipping.</li>
    <li> It was much more cost effective to purchase a pack of six. Due to allergies I bring my own product to my stylist. I don&#x27;t have to worry about my shade being out of stock and having to order more when I keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, I have been using it for 10 years. I get a lot of complements on the color and shine of my hair.</li>
    <li> Better than the professional color I have paid high dollar for.  Can do it at home on my time. Don&#x27;t have to schedule an appointment and go somewhere.  It is very gentle.  I started using this color with Wen hair products and what an improvement.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Lasts at least as long as a salon color and leaves my hair in good condition.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but when I did the skin sensitivity test, it left a light-colored patch on my arm after only a few minutes!  The insert does say that it can (rarely) cause skin depigmentation, which can be temporary or permanent.  Mine turned out to be temporary, thankfully, but after this test I wasn&#x27;t about to take a second chance on it. YIKES.  Don&#x27;t neglect that test--EVERY time you color.</li>
    <li> the package arrived withing a couple of days.  i haven&#x27;t used it yet but i&#x27;ve used their other colors so i&#x27;m sure this will be just as good.</li>
    <li> Made scalp a little itchy which surprised me as it is all natural.  Garnier Olia works best for my scalp.</li>
    <li> I used probably 10 boxes so far and I like it.  It covers grey roots quite well.  Every since I started using it, my hair is colored very evenly.  It is very forgiving.</li>

    <li> really good product covers gray well.</li>
    <li> This is more cheaper. very good hair color. I love it..</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair color without all of the usual toxins.  It colors and covers grey just as good as the other brands.  I tried it for a while, then went on to some high end, high cost brands thinking they would actually be better. But I have come back to Naturtint. I love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair color, it is not tested on animals! My hair lightens to a blonder shade at the ends so this looks natural. I am often complemented on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
    <li> I love Naturtint and use 7N for my base color and 9N for highlights.  It smells natural and safe and nothing like the usual hair dyes and bleaches.  I feel so much safe using this natural product and it works just as well as all the others.</li>
    <li> Great product! The color is beautiful, pretty close to the box but a little lighter with just a touch of a red/gold tint. My hair is super soft and shiny. No smell, no burning sensation when applied. Gloves are large for a change which is really nice. Best hair color I have ever used</li>
    <li> I found it to be non toxic and easy to use. Use gloves to apply and a brush to spread into the roots</li>
