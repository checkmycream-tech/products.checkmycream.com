<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hate hate hate the new lid. Why did they change this???</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for dry hands for over 20 yrs.  It is the only thing that works.  It is the Best hand cream on the market.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hand creme which I&#x27;ve been using for several years.</li>
    <li> Its a wonderful cream even for lips!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as a moisturizer, I just use it to help heal scars after I just scraped myself or scratched myself on something which happens a lot because I am skateboarder but I&#x27;m also clumsy at times. It helps my skin heal fast and also helps fade scars.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue afterwards.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Works well on my cracked dry hands even in the winter dryness.  Keep in my work desk drawer and night stand, always within reach.</li>
    <li> Was recommended this hand cream for it&#x27;s awesome powers of requiring very little, staying applied throughout the day, and even kind of still being there after some hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with reviews on Amazon that this is great and works well!</li>
    <li> I never ever liked using hand creams, as I feel like I dipped my hands in a bag of chips, and did not wash afterwards. The oily sensation hand creams give made me not use any hand cream, even when my hands were bleeding of cold weather caused cracks. What I did was putting a cream for 5 minutes, and washing my hands right after that.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how, but I tried this cream once. In less than 5 minutes -not exaggerating- they were much better. And the cream was completely infused and gone, so I did not had to wash my hands.&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, who hates hand creams, but have to do something, try this one.&lt;br /&gt;What I do is, I put a bit on top of my hands, and spread the cream with my index finger. So no cream in palms :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip is, what a dermatologist told me, and really works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Stay away from liquid and foam soaps. Use bars , of course except in public restrooms :)&lt;br /&gt;2. Do not use colored soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quoting from doctor &amp;#34; Never use liquid soaps, do not use colored soaps. If you can afford, use Dove, if not use plain white soap with no color and no fragrance&amp;#34;. You might want to keep in mind ;)</li>
    <li> I wash my hands anywhere from 10 - 100 times a day because I work in a microbiology lab. This is the only lotion that has saved my hands from being destroyed. I like that the package came with multiple tubes so I can keep one in my bag, one at my desk, and one at my bedside table.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream. Doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, and you can use it on other parts of your body---base what the bottle says.</li>
    <li> The best hand cream for both men and women.  I learned about this hand cream years ago,  when a manager where I worked told me about it.  All the night-shift employees handled newspapers, and the newspapers draw moisture out of &#x27;working hands&#x27;, along with the cold, harsh  temperatures in winter.  The guys all had cracked hands, and were using &#x27;other big brands&#x27; to no avail.  So, everyone there now buys this hand cream, and I have used it for over 15 years.  It is the best ... skip the rest!  :)</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream works wonders on dry cuticles and very dry skin. Keep one tube on my night stand, another at my work desk and the 3rd in my purse.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for many years . I love it !</li>
    <li> This hand cream is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve been using it for ten years, at least.  Unlike other lotions which feel like they are just evaporating on your skin, it&#x27;s waxy, like Vaseline but without its dehydrating effects.  I use it on all my dry bits: feet, elbows, knees. When I give myself a pedicure it&#x27;s an essential part of the routine.  I put a thick layer on my hands and feet and let it sit for several minutes.  Smooth as a baby.</li>
    <li> You will not find a better product!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years as it has been the best hand cream I have found. Both my wife and I use it regularly. Keeps my fingers from drying out in winter.</li>
    <li> The best hand cream for winter problems, especially helpful in healing cracked and dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is SUPERB. Every Winter, my thumbs and pointer fingers crack, peel and get terribly ugly and sore. This is the ONLY cream, lotion, balm, whatever that has healed (and soothed) my aching digits. It has also helped with my dry cuticles! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34;. Snake Lotion it&#x27;s NOT. I only wish it came in bigger sizes and was a little less expensive. However/slash, comma ... it is worth every single cent!</li>
    <li> Good as it always for me. I have really dry hand skin and paper cut every where...&lt;br /&gt;This helps a lot to take away the dryness but no gross feeling left.</li>
    <li> I am outside 365 days a year, and this product saves my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It actually heals dry skin, and crucially, does not have weird / irritating perfume / aroma. I buy this in bulk now and keep one at work, one in my backpack, and one at home. A really great product!</li>
    <li> Great item, recommended by my dermatologist, thanks.</li>
    <li> This lotion is so great for the winter season especially.  It works wonders. The price was great as well.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream. It keeps skin moist.</li>
    <li> This hand cream actually aids in the healing of dry, injured hands!  I have never found any to compare. I have found a Meijer brand ultra-healing skin therapy lotion with aloe that is good, too - but the Neutrogena cream is still tops in my estimation.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this product from this specific seller, but I have bought it quite a few times from the drugstore and I love it! It&#x27;s fragrance free and very moisturizing without being greasy. A little goes a long way and you can use it pretty much anywhere...I like to use it on my hands, but my favorite place to use it is on my lips...it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Everything as expected and in great conditions! Definitely worth 5 stars and i&#x27;d buy again from them for sure!</li>
    <li> I only use this hand cream at night because it is very greasy but it does work really great.  If you don&#x27;t like greasy lotion than this one is not for you, but it really does help my hands a lot.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very special. If you get cracked skin due to dryness, it heals the cracks almost instantly. It is the only thing that helps with my husband&#x27;s hands, which tend to get deep, bleeding crevices due to over zealous washing. Thanks to this lotion, his hands look normal again.</li>
    <li> Keeps my dry winter hands soft and healthy! Does not leave your hands exceptionally oily or greasy so an application at bed time does the trick. Throughout the day does not hurt either.</li>
    <li> My dermatologists recommended this hand lotion. Does help for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it so I got it for her...again. I will buy her more in the future when this suply runs out.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without this product. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it is great. Not greasy, no smell just perfect</li>
    <li> This is the most remarkable hand cream if you have really dry skin. Some might find it too thick and greasy, but I think it is perfect for severely dry skin. It even stays on through hand washing.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. A little goes a long way and you can use this so many ways. I put it on my hands and my lips!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hand cream- it makes my hands (and feet) feel very smooth after I put it on.  I do it at night to make sure I moisturize my skin after a day of washing, cleaning, walking etc...  I loved this and will for sure buy it again after I run out.</li>
    <li> I suffer from severe dry hands. Carmex is my # 1 hand cream and this is my # 2. Has vasaline as well as lotion in it for better protection. Non greasy.</li>
    <li> On time and as listed.  Very easy and efficient...thanks!</li>
    <li> Best hand cream I have ever used. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the only hand cream I&#x27;ve found that really actively heals dry skin.  It&#x27;s saved me a lot of pain since I found it, and I keep extra on hand in case I run out.  Be careful putting it on your face though, it&#x27;s pretty thick stuff.  I get best results from putting it on the affected area right before bed, and just let it do it&#x27;s thing all night without getting washed off.</li>
    <li> Just a little dab will do ya!!! My dry skin was much, much better in just a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This item was pricey, but well worth every penny. First of all, this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very, very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it&#x27;s naturally soft condition. I found that it is best used at nighttime. I&#x27;ve tried using it with nighttime gloves, and that works well too. I just prefer to rub it on my hands and go to bed. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves so you don&#x27;t chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries. I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this takes longer to absorb, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this as a daily lotion you might leave by the soap dish by the bathroom next to the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily, and because it&#x27;s so concentrated, that&#x27;s all I need to maintain smoother skin. It&#x27;s no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague. For every diaper change, sneeze, runny nose and shared food, I am washing my hands A LOT! This product works as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works wonders on cracked elbows, heels and is soothing for skin conditions like Eczema.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years. I first started using it when my first husband did concrete work and his hands were cracking and bleeding. He heard about it in a Paul Harvey segment. I&#x27;m so thankful he did and we gave it a try! My hands are in water and chemicals a lot and they get terribly dry and my cuticles really give me fits. This is all I&#x27;ve ever found that helps them heal.</li>
    <li> wonderful for dry hands...absorbs into skin and leaves no greasy feeling at all</li>
    <li> This is THE best hand cream.  It was recommend by my dermatologist and has worked miracles for me!</li>
    <li> I had itchy hands/fingers for about a year ( especially during winter time). I would literally itch until my hands bled, so I went to a dermatologist to see what I can do to stop the itching. He recommended this product and gave me samples. He said the causes might be due to washing my hands a lot and causes dryness.  I bought the full sized product on Amazon and I am so happy I did!!! After a few weeks my itching stopped. I seriously recommend this product who has itchy hands.</li>
    <li> This product is strategically located in my bedroom, bathroom, family room and car so that it is available instantly when needed.</li>
    <li> Too thick and greasy.</li>
    <li> the most effective hand cream or lotion around. I have used it for many years. it not only softens dry rough or callissed hands, but heals them. it also takes away pain from chapped skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for over 20 years now and won&#x27;t use anything else for night time.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for daytime use as it is heavy and can be greasy but if you have dry, rough, cracked hands and fingers this is the stuff for you.  You only need a little bit to cover your hands well and when you wake up in the morning your hands will be nice and soft and it&#x27;s great for your cuticles as well.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Hand Cream Fragrance Free is very good for my hands and I have been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used and the price is better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  It absorbs well and helps protect and heal my husbands hardworking hands...even in winter.  We now buy multiple tubes at a time to make sure we don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> this is some of the best hand cream I have used.</li>
    <li> This stuff will not only moisturize your hands and other skin but it can actually be used to heal small cuts, abrasions, brush burns etc.  I had a lingering cut that would not heal because it was on a finger that I constantly had to use every day.  I put it on and it healed the cut almost over night.  Brilliant stuff.</li>
    <li> The cream is scentless and does the job. It leaves a thin film sometimes, when your hands are still wet from washing. Skin is soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and rather severe eczema that only tacrolimnus helps. On my last vacation, I forgot my tacrolimnus at home and had an eczema flare on my flight, so in desperation, I took this out of my bag and put this on my flaky, dry patches and they disappeared -- and my extremely sensitive skin wasn&#x27;t even irritated; in fact, it felt so much better than it did after my regular moisturiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m moisturising my face with this too. Use this hand cream.</li>
    <li> I ordered a fragrance free one but it&#x27;s not!!</li>
    <li> BEST hand cream EVER!</li>
    <li> I like this product because of the amount of glycerin it has. It seals in moisture without being oily and blocking my pores. I use after a light moisturizer as a sealer. No zits. Also works great for chapped hands and feet but again I like to use a light lotion first and then seal with this heavier cream. A little bit goes a long way. No fragrance. No alcohol to dry your skin out. Great product that I&#x27;ve been using for years. It doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen so you will need to use another product for that.</li>
    <li> good and cheap. protect my hands very well!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer! I dislike the sticky and/or slimy feeling that a lot of moisturizers leave on my hands. This cream does not do that. Also, it really works!</li>
    <li> Been using this for many years and it&#x27;s still one of the best things out there for my hands.  I like that it&#x27;s fragrance free and that it keeps my hands smooth.  It&#x27;s just a winner in my book, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of other hand creams.</li>
    <li> Most of the stuff I tried in years past was ineffective in our typical Michigan winters.  Not so here!  Works very well for me.  Would definitely recommend this for the dry midwest weather seasons.  Had previously tried the scented version, and while the aroma is very nice, it is terribly strong... to the point of being annoying to me.  Very happy to have found this variety!</li>
    <li> My hands got very dry during this winter, this product is the perfect one to make your skin feel relief. It only need to be apply once per day and last for the whole day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I have had dry bleeding hands every winter since I can remember.  My hands get dry from the weather, and I wash my hands a lot.  My knuckles start to crack and bleed as it gets worse.  This is the only stuff I trust to repair my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What works for me is to liberally coat my hands and then put socks over them when I go to bed.  I&#x27;m sure you could buy some gloves, but who cares.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena Hand Cream for years. When I do a lot of work in the garden and my hands get chapped or rough I use a small amount at bed time.  It is not greasy, yet heavy enough to stay on.  It works.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste any by thinking you need a ton to make your hands feel better.  This has sort of an ointment like feel to it when you first put it on, but then it absorbs quickly and makes your skin feel so much better than the dry flaky-ness it had before.  Using it more often it is even more effective.  I have already purchased this item multiple times, and will continue to do so.  I have one by the bed, in the car and in my purse.</li>
    <li> Great Product not being carried by my local any longer so I had to order it here.  Very Happy</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended and I could not find in stores.  Works great</li>
    <li> My son constantly had red cheeks due to teething and the cold winter air.  I tried using regular lotion, Vasoline, Aquaphor, you name it.  Then I read somewhere that this works, and I tried it.  Within days his cheeks were back to normal, and have stayed normal ever since.  He&#x27;s now going on 16 months (this was last winter, when he was 5-8 months) and any sign of dryness I pull this out.  Wish I would have known about it from the beginning.  My mother used it on her hands when I was a kid.  Best stuff ever.</li>
    <li> The ONLY hand cream that works for me and I have tried quite a few.</li>
    <li> We were so happy to be able to find the Hand Cream.&lt;br /&gt;All of our  local stores carried Norwegian Formula for the face, not hands.&lt;br /&gt;We have used this cream for years and it our favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clair Fassett</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously fantastic. Heals up my ultra chapped hands with daily use. Wife and i swear by it.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for me. My skin is really really sensitive (i am atopic) and this is the only cream I can really use without irritation.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of hand cream, but I keep coming back to this one. Goes on very nicely, and while it may seem at first that it is a little greasy...it DOES absorb VERY quickly, leaving your hands softer and smoother than anything I have ever tried before!  Will buy...again and again and again, because this is a great bargain!  Send fast too!</li>
    <li> I have always loved this hand cream.  It&#x27;s thick and feels a little oily at first, but that goes away quickly and it starts working.  You will notice a difference immediately.  I have dry hands and feet, and I have never found anything better.</li>
    <li> Love the hand cream!  Product arrives as advertised; love free shipping with $35+; cost is same or lower than what I can buy locally</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic with perpetually dry skin, and I hate feeling greasy.  A bit of this every night gets me through the winter without major dryness and cracks.</li>
    <li> Just a tiny bit keeps my hands very comfortable throughout the year - even in dry mountain air with harder water.</li>
    <li> A little dab is all you need. By far the best for cracked skin in the winter.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream I have ever used.  I have very sensitive/allergy-prone skin that is also very dry.  Most lotions are either too thin or irritate my skin.  I also wash my hands or use hand sanitizer A LOT throughout the day, since I work in a medical office.  Once again, Neutrogena comes through with another great product.  Absolutely no scent to this, and I have not had any reactions to it (which also makes it safe to use around patients with allergies).  I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hands are!  I only have to apply this 2-3 times a day, and the softness lasts through many hand washings.  Also, they&#x27;re serious about &amp;#34;a little goes a long way.&amp;#34;  Less than a pencil-eraser-size amount is sufficient to do both hands.</li>
    <li> This hand cream works really well in cold, dry weather and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most hand creams so I was surprised to find one that didn&#x27;t make my hands itch.  In fact, this is the softest my hands have been in years.  This is this a great product!!</li>
    <li> Great price for product I regularly use</li>
    <li> Bought on my Doctor&#x27;s recommendation as I have several areas on my hands subject to irritation. I do like&lt;br /&gt;to use this more than other brands because it almost immediately seems unnoticable for any oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;A tiny amount seems to do the job. I do a variety of home repairs including paint and concrete work and&lt;br /&gt;want protection but a good grip is essential. With this I am doing OK with occasional use. ( I forget to use&lt;br /&gt;after washing my hands and sometimes at the start of day)</li>
    <li> Use it for fingertips that dry out and crack, particularly in dry weather. Solves the problem when I rub in a little of the Neutrogena Hand Cream when I get up and go to sleep. Had used Lotil before with equally good results, however the Neutrogena is much easier to find both locally and on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by a pharmacist years ago....I still use it every night. I&#x27;m a dog groomer and my hands are in harsh shampoos and water all day long. I only wish it came in a larger tube.</li>
    <li> I have very dry spots on my hands, especially around joints.  In addition to prescribed medication, a dermatologist suggested I use this daily, just a dab on the dry spots.  Its a temporary fix but works fine.</li>
    <li> I thought 2 oz would be too small but they are perfect, similar to a small school milk carton size.</li>
    <li> This is an ongoing purchase,  I have been using this product for years, very effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;mI always useing. It&#x27;s much better.</li>
    <li> Best cream for hands, feet and face.</li>
    <li> the best hand cream I&#x27; ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;m a guy and I work with my hands and they get dry.  This stuff has no scent and it works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  I like it much better than watery lotions.  This stuff is thick and helps immediately.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but Amazon after I ran out of it this winter.</li>
    <li> I work as a veterinary technician (16 years) and am now in nursing school. Over the years I have tried hundreds of products to keep my hands moisturized since I wash them so often.  My hands tend to get very dry, over the knuckles especially, and will crack. After doing some internet research on nursing sites this was the one product that came up frequently. They aren&#x27;t kidding, a little goes a long way, which is great for the price. I got three bottles for 11 dollars! Great deal in my opinion. So far it is living up to the recommendations. It is not greasy at all, absorbs quickly (even though when you spread it initially it is white, dont panic about that) and sticks around through several hand washings before I need to reapply. GREAT product.</li>
    <li> My husband and kids get such dry skin all year round. This is truly the only thing we have found that works well.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough!! I am in nursing school and this cream SAVES my poor hands from all the alcohol hand rub.</li>
    <li> Great feel for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> My favorite hand cream.  Non-greasy.</li>
    <li> Best ever. I have really dry hands (I&#x27;m always washing them) and I have tons of hang nails. The hang nails and dryness disappeared once I started using this hand cream. I do want to note that this is fragranced. Next time I will go for the un-fragranced version so that it won&#x27;t interfere with my perfume. :-)</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it for her dry hands.  I tried it and immediately realized that it works like a charm.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> My hands have always been very dry and in the winter my fingertips tend to crack open.  This is literally the ONLY hand cream that has ever worked and I have tried hundreds over the years.  I only use this at bedtime and even with chronic hand washing throughout the course of the day, and with doing dishes, laundry etc., my hands are still smooth and soft, it&#x27;s unbelievable!  It&#x27;s greasy for about the first 30 seconds after being applied and then it&#x27;s just soft and smooth, no grease.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a hand moisturizer by nature, but after my hands became dry and itchy I had to reach for something. My wife handed me this diminutive package, and I placed a drop upon my palms. A small drop is all you need and any sense of oiliness is gone in a minute or less. What you&#x27;re left with are moisturized hands that don&#x27;t smell like flowers that were bred in nuclear waste. The stuff works, it is cheap, and it made my wife feel smug. What more could one want?</li>
    <li> I love these! I love the 3 pack to keep one bedside, purse and in kitchen. I&#x27;ll wash my jand leave then a little damp then apply this cream.  It is very very thick.  I have bad eczema on my hands and my dermatologist told me to get this specific brand.  Using topical steroid for a bad break out spot every once in awhile with this cream has given me excellent control.  It even lasts after a few hand washings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for few years already. It helps to moisturize my skin since I got eczema. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This hand cream is just amazing! The things it does to your hands is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I work as a receptionist and I deal with papers all day and so my hands dry out very quickly, this hand cream helped me out so much with the dryness, I was amazed. It also stays on for very long, makes your hands look healthy. It might be fragrance free, but I gotta say it smells nice... Its also safe to put on your face, works better then facial products for dryness!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!! :) *recommended to anyone!!*</li>
    <li> Fab--always like this because it really works, lasts, but it is absorbed very quickly and is not greasy.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and am happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream, hands down! Love this stuff. Rich and creamy but it actually absorbs without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Great price and it&#x27;s always worked very well for my dry hands.  I work outside a lot so I use it almost every day.  Mike</li>
    <li> My hands get so try with all the paperwork I handle in the office and they get worse in the winter.  This product really helps.</li>
    <li> My thumbs are always cracked at the corners from washing my hands so much at work. I think the soap used in medical fields are super stronger than regular soap. So my thumbs for some strange reasons are always cracking and it hurts. This hand cream is like magic. I use it almost every time I wash my hands or when I remember. The cracks are healed and no more pain. wahoo.... theres no scent which is perfect. It does feel like petroleum jelly but it absorbs into your skin faster and its not as greasy. I also use these on my feet too. This product seems to be the only one that works with healing dry skin on hands and feet</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time today and it&#x27;s very moisturizing...  I like that it came in 3 pairs so I can keep one in  my purse, bathroom and dressing room...  Time will tell and I&#x27;ll update after I use it for a while...</li>
    <li> Helps even the driest hands. Does leave a greasy feeling like petroleum jelly, but a wipe after it has been rubbed in thoroughly works perfect.</li>
    <li> Here in Colorado where the humidity hits the high teens on a wet day this is welcome relief. I have tried corn huskers lotion and just about every lotion the grocery store sells to no avail. This stuff is somewhere between axle grease and solidified wax in viscosity. It goes on with some work to move it around and takes a small amount, about the size of a pea for the back of each hand. I apply at bedtime and am very happy to say no more cracks and bleeding. It does leave a bit of a greasy feeling but I am thrilled with the results.</li>
    <li> This is the only hand lotion I&#x27;ll use for my paper-thin skin in the winter. I keep one at my desk at work, one in my car, one in my bedside table, and one in my purse. This might seem like overkill but finally, my hands are not dry!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product - just can&#x27;t find it in local retail stores anymore.  Even doctors recommend it for cracked, split winter skin.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this lotion and I have not been disappointed.  It absorbs quickly and has wonderful results. I have used on other dry spots and the results are noticed overnight.</li>
    <li> I never get sick. I wash my hands all the time; or I use hand sanitizer when soap and water aren&#x27;t nearby. So for the price of never getting a cold or flu, I have dry hands. This product is the only one I&#x27;ve found that really WORKS! Read the front of the tube...&amp;#34;just a dab heals dry skin&amp;#34;...really, just a dab and the dryness is gone and the effect lasts through several hand washings. Be consistent and you won&#x27;t need to keep reapplying. An absolutely amazing/wonderful product! Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> The only hand lotion I use - very happy to find a larger pack of it. I keep it in every room in the house and in my desk drawer and purse.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist for my winter dry skin and eczema, this stuff really works. A tiny dab goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be too put off by the high price. One little tube lasts me a few months.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermotologist for dry, cracking hands. Best hand cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Just fine, no problems at all, will buy from again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for years and recommend it often.  I have very dry skin and live in Southern Arizona, a double whammy in skin care.  I use this cream once daily, at bedtime, to really give it time to work its magic on these 63 year old hands.  Bedtime works best for another reason--This cream is very rich and needs a little time to be totally absorbed, something most of us don&#x27;t have during our busy days.  If used, just once a day, you&#x27;ll find that your hands remain soft and supple all day long without any reapplication.  So spurge a little and treat yourself to this terrific hand cream.  (Their foot cream is wonderful too!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for many years, and I love it!  It is not greasy at all, and you only have to use a dab.  It lasts a long time.  Best of all, I believe it has kept my hands looking unusually nice!</li>
    <li> This is a tried and true product, which I stash in each of my handbags during the winter season.  A little goes a looong way, and once it is rubbed into the skin (after the initial white, filmy stage) my skin stays moisturized even after one hand washing.  This is very important to me since I am constantly washing my hands during the day as a healthcare provider.  Also, being fragrance free I won&#x27;t offend any of my patients with the odor.</li>
    <li> We live in a very dry area and this stuff works great to keep our hands from drying out and cracking.  Nice that it has no fragrance.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in individual boxes in a set of three. It&#x27;s a great product, but&lt;br /&gt;expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged!</li>
    <li> I do like this for my very dry hands and cuticles. You only need a very small amount though or it takes too long to be absorbed into skin, and not leave your fingerprints greasy. For example on your iPhone etc!</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for my feet</li>
    <li> At first, it feels too sticky and thick, but once you get used to it, you won&#x27;t use any more of those drippy hand and/or foot lotions. I prefer the unscented.</li>
    <li> Have been using this amazing stuff since I was a kid, and my mom used it before that. Nothing else works like this formulation and taking the fragrance out just made it better for so many more people. It goes on thick, but after you massage it into your hands or feet or wherever, it seems to disappear. Simple ingredients that work and a great value in today&#x27;s market.  This time, I used the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp on my sad little crunchy heels and then slathered this good stuff on. My feet are just peachy.  Thanks Neutrogena for another great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I am just so in love. I normally have normal skin until summer or winter. My skin gets so dry and it is not attractive. I use literally a dab of this stuff and my dry skin is no longer dry or flaky. I really just adore this product. It takes forever to go through a bottle which is awesome. I love that I don&#x27;t have to pile it on in order for it to work. The bottom of feet tend to get dry as well and I put a bit more on them and put socks on and relax, it is awesome. My husband is super picky when it comes to lotions because he thinks most are too girly. He keeps one of these in his truck and one in his work bag. So, that tells you something. He really likes this stuff because it is not girly smelling or anything. I purchased the fragrance free ones but even the original does not have a bad smell, I actually like the smell, its is subtle and pleasant. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever found to help with dryness and eczema.</li>
    <li> This product is so soothing and fits for over dry hands.I recommend this product for anyone that wants a soothing hand.It is fragrance free.I like this product very well.Thank you Neutrogena</li>
    <li> This is hands down the BEST hand cream/gel you can buy. Hands down!! I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years after trying everything possible. Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you Eucerin is better because the stuff may moisturize your hands but is terribly greasy. Eew. This stuff, however, is not at all and soaks right into your skin. I&#x27;ve had major issues and my fingertips would crack and my knuckles would get super dry and crack as well, especially in the winter. It was very painful. After using this stuff religiously, i no longer have had problems. You need to use it after every time you wash your hands, if you&#x27;ve had or have similar issues. It&#x27;s also great on your heels too if they get really dry. I cannot recommend this product enough.</li>
    <li> all time fav hand cream</li>
    <li> Just a dab works perfectly, my hands and nails always look great from this lotion.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for me. It was complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and product exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream ever. Thick so you only need a little. Fragrance free. Definitely helps my chapped winter hands from frequent hand washing!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this cream would help to heal the dry, cracked skin on my hands.  But I took a chance and I&#x27;m so happy I did!  Within 3 days of using this product, I noticed significant improvements in the feel of my skin.  I&#x27;ve found the best time to moisturize is within 10 minutes of showering.  This keeps the skin nice and moist.  And now I&#x27;m hooked on this cream!  Great seller, too (J&amp;H Health Care).  I bought a 3-pack of this cream and they were perfectly packaged.</li>
    <li> One of the very best hand creams out there. It is a heavier cream, so I use at night before I go to bed so that it has the night to absorb. I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands (kids, art work, cleaning, gardening), although there are times I need some (lighter) hand cream during the day, I absolutely notice if I do not use this at night.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff and can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
    <li> THE best hand cream.... well, hand and feet cream. So thick so it&#x27;s not for everyone but it works very well and you only need the smallest pea size amount. I prefer unsented.</li>
    <li> The hands stay a bit slimy, but is good for feet.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes very well!</li>
    <li> Doctor told me to get- it works, good item</li>
    <li> Best hand cream, hands down!</li>
    <li> Great for cracked and dry hands!</li>
    <li> great,non greasy moisturizing- I would like to see a flip top rather than a screw off/on cap-I think that would make the whole application process easier</li>
    <li> Seems to be mostly petroleum jelly with all the greasy pitfalls, but it does keep your hands from drying out and cracking.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream ever!  Cured my eczema.</li>
    <li> I stopped buying this for a few years because they changed the formula and started putting a huge amount of fragrance in it.  I recently found the unscented and it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a lotion guy but this stuff really seems to work when my hands get too dry from the weather or heat</li>
    <li> Great for your hands but I don&#x27;t use it as an all over body cream.  For me, it is too thick for that</li>
    <li> Really effective product.  My hands feel so moisturized after I use this, and it only takes 15 minutes to completely soak in.  Even before it&#x27;s soaked in, it&#x27;s not particularly greasy like most moisturizers are.</li>
    <li> I want to love this hand cream.  I really, really do.  It works exceptionally well, and even a small amount is more than enough to rehydrate dry, tired skin.  However, there are harmful parabens in the formula and, as someone who strives to keep nasty chemicals out of my body and off my skin, I don&#x27;t really feel comfortable using this on a consistent basis.  If non-greasy absorption and plum, supple skin is appealing to you--AND you don&#x27;t mind putting things on your largest organ (skin) that can cause you physiological harm in the long-term, this is the hand cream for you.  Otherwise, I think I&#x27;ll probably stick to coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Was and continues to be the BEST for rough, dry, cracked hands!</li>
    <li> Completely non-greasy, yet extremely effective. You can feel your hands get smoother after a single application.</li>
    <li> one of the best for dry and cracked fingertips</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff at Walmart when i need some, very good stuff. Extremely concentrated formula so you don&#x27;t have to rub your hands together forever until it absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Past winters prior to 2014 my hands would literally crack open from the dryness and cold waters from faucets. My hands would look like they were fried on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this stuff now my hands are so soft grazing a piece of paper gives me paper cuts, proof that it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its best to apply this after you&#x27;ve washed and lightly dried your hands.</li>
    <li> I work in healthcare and get really bad eczema on my hands between winter and frequent hand washing. I&#x27;ve tried everything, including prescription steroid creams. A patient of mine recommended this and I was skeptical, but after the second time I used it my hands were healed!</li>
