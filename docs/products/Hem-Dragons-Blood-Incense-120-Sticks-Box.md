<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nothing But Burning Wood Smell. You Can buy better incense at Publix or your local flea market. This stuff is total crap, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Like the use of incense and this works well and stays lit.  Would recommend to anyone.  I also ordered other scents and they are all great.</li>
    <li> simply put, HEM sucks. i have tried 8 different incense flavors. get your pocket knife out and start to whittle the sticks--too large for incense burners or so small they are splintered ends. they burn and then break in two half way down. the smell is nothing to get excited about. poor craftsmanship to say the least. Walmart has better quality incense than HEM!!</li>
    <li> Not that I&#x27;m an expert at incense but this stuff smells like garbage burning...Outright nasty and foul...    Of course everyones taste is different but I don&#x27;t see how anyone could find this particular incense appealing in any way...</li>
    <li> These burn quick but boy are the powerful and smell great! Oh and the fact I get a whole case for almost the same price I can buy a single little box... well the savings are huge!</li>
    <li> box was a bit damaged</li>
    <li> These incense have a strong smell to them. That smell is to there benefit cause I love it! If you have not gotten a smell of this scent I strongly suggest you go to a store and have a sniff before purchasing them in these quantities. Incense have a variety of different smells and you will not like all of them. The Packaging is slightly frustrating due to the bag not having a notch to rip it open but it is easy enough to rip or cut with scissors. If you like Dragons blood don&#x27;t feel bad about buying this.</li>
    <li> For this product you get A LOT for a very low price the dragons blood is my personal favorite and the sent is amazing will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Fabulous aroma and top quality!  Great deal</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. Like the blue much better. Not even close actually.....</li>
    <li> good incense , however found these at a local store for less $</li>
    <li> SMELLS NOTHING LIKE DRAGONS BLOOD AT ALL</li>
    <li> The HEM Dragons Blood did not disappoint!  I enjoy dragon&#x27;s blood, it is deep and meditative, soothing and peaceful.  If you have not smelled dragon&#x27;s blood before, it&#x27;s along the lines of Myrrh and frankincense. It&#x27;s a resin scent that might remind you a little of Catholic mass.</li>
    <li> Nice smell.Little smaller than others but best I&#x27;ve tried so far[albeit limited sample size].</li>
    <li> I have purchased Dragons Blood Incense many times before but never from Amazon; not only was I surprised at the quanity you get for the price but the freshness is amazing.  If I did not know I would hav sworn that I had just picked them up from the the manufactor.  Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this scent, its one of my favorite I usually have a supply of. It is a strong scent and some say it &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; to things.... which I found to be true, it lasts for several hours before dissipating after the stick is done smoldering. It seems people who have enjoyed dragons blood have added it to their favorites, just as I have :) I&#x27;m happy to not have to buy this again for a loonngg time. Great deal.</li>
    <li> This product and seller are great as advertised best dragons blood incense I have used. Will buy again. Great for meditation, and or yoga.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on Amazon instead of the cone Dragon&#x27;s blood incense I normally buy. The sticks have a full scent (you don&#x27;t have to burn them to enjoy it) and when burned they last a long time. The scent lingers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like powerful incense this will be perfect for you but it may be a bit overpowering to some. I really like it, but not for an everyday scent.</li>
    <li> I immediately opened the package to light one up. My house is fragrant and peaceful. Love this stuff! Warning: Heavy billows of smoke will intoxicate. Don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t told. Update 02/07/2014:♥ Use if you like very sultry, smoldering fragrances. This is real incense very strong and true for incense lovers. Definitely restocking this baby!</li>
    <li> Dragons Blood is a unique scent and I have yet to find anyone that doesn&#x27;t immediately fall in love with it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites by HEM in cone, but the sticks show a lack of quality control, with no consistency when it comes to the width of the sticks used or the coating of the sticks themselves.  In terms of the latter, sections of the incense stick can become so thin in places as to suppress and interrupt the stick&#x27;s burning.  While I recognize HEM&#x27;s products reside at the low-end in terms of pricing, other bargain stick incense, both from India and locally-made in Canada and the US, offer better quality of manufacture for the same price, as well as burn longer.  Additionally, HEM&#x27;s stick incense is comparably messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt I&#x27;ll buy HEM sticks in future; will stay with their cones.</li>
    <li> Large amount of sticks.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> Hem makes the best Incense sticks. Dragons Blood is one of my favorite. Its scents the room, but it doesn&#x27;t smell burnt. And they are very consistent with their smells.</li>
    <li> HEM certainly delivers the goods. I&#x27;ve burned the actual dragon&#x27;s blood resin a few times, and this incense is pretty much a perfected version of that smell. It&#x27;s almost a mixture of cedar and frankincense. It will make your house feel so inviting and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just burn it far away from smoke detectors, because it is smoooooooky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of hesitant ordering incense off the internet, but I&#x27;m actually very pleased. It seems very fresh, so don&#x27;t hesitate to order from Amazon - it&#x27;s certainly cheaper than buying it in a store!</li>
    <li> Always loved this scent  good sized box burns quicker than I&#x27;d like but still worth it I&#x27;m defiantly going to buy again</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Leaves a pleasant light aroma out in the garage where I smoke.</li>
    <li> smells amaaaazing unfortunatley it bothers my mothers allergys</li>
    <li> Burns evenly and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Dragon Blood incense is my favorite.  I will buy this scent as long as they make it.  I love it.  I have tried many different incense flavors and always keep coming back to the Dragon&#x27;s Blood.  It is simply a wonderful, lovely, calming scent.</li>
    <li> did NOT get what i paid for!!! ordered 120 STICKS and got 20 CONES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stick and cone incense are VERY different, not to mention i paid for 120 and got 20!!!!! i dont even have a cone burner, so i have to use an ashtray. VERY disappointed and will NOT be ordering from this seller EVER again.</li>
    <li> This scent is delicious; a combination of woods and ancient oils. Not too sweet or cloying. With a mystery scent that you can&#x27;t pin down, very refreshing.  And no charcoal smell! You can see the quality and freshness of this incense; when you light the stick; you can see the oil. That&#x27;s the way I like my incense.</li>
    <li> HEM incense is a delight, and the 120 sticks allow me to enjoy them for an extended period. Great for meditation and relaxation. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent. But it has grown on me. It is strong, and will definitely scent a room. Good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Strong and heavy but not the scent I wanted.  Gonesh&#x27;s Dragon&#x27;s Blood incense is much better.  I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more and get the &#x27;right&#x27; stuff.</li>
    <li> Better than the Dragons Blood Blue but needs to be a little more concentrated base. Some burned stick odor.</li>
    <li> This has been my absolute favorite incense for years. It smells so good and is so relaxing. Once you smell it you will be hooked.</li>
    <li> great price and great product! this is my absolute favorite incense and has been for years! and with this price it will continue to be!</li>
    <li> I can finally burn incense in my house; not overwhelming and no &#x27;wood fire burned&#x27; smell afterwards.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy that it&#x27;s not like, chemically like other kinds of incense. Myself and my housemates love it. The only reason I&#x27;d buy another brand is for variety, really.</li>
    <li> Cheap perfumey smell.  My dogs and I had to evacuate.  Not for people who are used to normal, good quality incense.</li>
    <li> Would only burn for 1 minute before I had to re-light.  Very annoying but it does have a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Bought an 8 gram box at a local shop to try to out as I heard rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s charcoal based and had chunks missing in places on the sticks. It burned black and does not smell like dragons blood. It smells like cologne and Pepsi. A sort of sweetish scent. It&#x27;s not unpleasant but no where near like dragons blood resin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unique and I will buy it again its just not dragons blood.</li>
    <li> love the smell, will be getting more</li>
    <li> This is such a good deal for this type of incense compared to my local store ($1.00 for 8 sticks)!  If you like Dragon&#x27;s Blood, then this is the deal for you!  I&#x27;m very impressed by all of the sticks I&#x27;ve bought from HEM!</li>
    <li> Like how this incense smokes darkly in the beginning. Delivered on time @ good price &amp; will buy again.</li>
    <li> Best inscence ever! I use to only burn nag champa until I found this a few years ago!!! Dragons blood is my #1 choice now!!</li>
    <li> Very nice incense fragrance, one of my favorite fragrances. Very fast shipping and received as stated. Will purchase from seller again.</li>
    <li> I like the pricing for the amount you get.  It smells OK, but I prefer a more concentrated aroma.  I also, prefer a little less smoke, and smoke smell.</li>
    <li> I resent being required to write an effusive review to satisfy someone&#x27;s ego, and having a word requirement. I&#x27;ve given it 5 stars, I&#x27;ve summarized good feelings in a headline, and that should be sufficient. This is my standard response. If I didn&#x27;t like it, or only gave 1 star, then you can require an essay.</li>
    <li> The package of incense is well made and burns for a long time.  The aroma is pure and not overwhelming.  I love keeping a few burning most of the day!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product was a great buy. It&#x27;s very informative and educational. Makes a great gift this holiday season! Amazon has never let me down with any purchase! I highly recommend this product. Thank you Amazon for having such a wide selection the chose from.</li>
    <li> NICE ITEM. LIKED THE PACKAGING.  IT IS A LITTLE STRONG FOR MY WIFE SO I USE IT WHEN SHE IS NOT AROUND</li>
    <li> I enjoy HEM incense products.  they are easy to light, they burn completely out and are very fragrant.  I hear dragon&#x27;s blood is a protective product in the pagan community.  I don&#x27;t know how true it is, but I enjoy the scent of this incense.  some may be put off from it&#x27; strong perfume scent, but I enjoy it.  highly recommended either for meditation or keeping the demons at bay....</li>
    <li> Great smell and a great price. Comes in packs of 20 in 6 individual boxes inside one box in case you wanna give them out or something. Smells just like normal dragon&#x27;s blood. Takes me back to some good years.</li>
    <li> Very nice mood scent with a good price to match. I would recommend this product for anyone that likes to burn incense.</li>
    <li> Great product and smells good!</li>
    <li> Not really my &amp;#34;cup of tea&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Every sweet smell. A bit overpowering for most of my family members but I think it fine. Long lasting and a very clean burn. I think I found my new favorite incense.</li>
    <li> This is a nice smell and constructed well with great packaging to protect the sticks. I like this a little better than the Blue Blood.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why its asking me about the sticks, when I never ordered them? I bought some cones and they were fine.</li>
    <li> A lot of people may associate incense with trying to hide certain odors, but we love burning incense because the smell permeates through several rooms.  It&#x27;s cheaper and longer lasting than candles, but makes a terrific mess!  We put up with the mess of falling ashes - have tried several different burners and still end up with ashes everywhere - but we will clean it up because the smell is so wonderful.  Dragons Blood (which I am told is a tree on a different continent than North America where we live) has the best scent of all the incense scents we&#x27;ve tried.  We also love Rose, Frankincense and Myrrh, and Cinnamon.  This particular brand has been the best we&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Great calming traditional meditation smell that my husband can also enjoy (not too floral)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like dragons blood</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this scent is, but it is certainly NOT Dragon&#x27;s Blood. Do not purchase. That is all.</li>
    <li> My favorite favorite incense! I was going to a little smoke shop downtown to get this but I keep running out to quickly and when I saw this box of 120 for so cheap I had to buy it. I do like the better quality sticks from the store, but when burning the HEM ones the scent fills the room just as well and I find the smell quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like true Dragon&#x27;s Blood... And doesn&#x27;t stay lit.... Have to keep lighting it....:(</li>
    <li> Good scent. I love the HEM brand.</li>
    <li> bought these and shared with a friend he wants more because he uses them more then I do use them</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t exactly smell how i expected.</li>
    <li> Labeled &amp;#34;Sticks&amp;#34; but the item was clearly Cones. Cones smelt Great! But I returned them with a full refund and purchased locally.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and I only buy Hex sticks. Best brand money can buy. The scent stays around even after the incense is burned out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used dragon&#x27;s blood before from other brands, as well as the actual resin. I absolutely adore the scent. I used to get my dragon&#x27;s blood incense sticks from a place that handmade them to order but they recently changed their scent/oil and it smells much more feminine and sweet than I like. Since I know I like dragon&#x27;s blood and I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about HEM, I decided to spring for a big box up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box arrived clearly having been opened and re-taped up. The sticks inside smell absolutely nothing like dragon&#x27;s blood to me. They also look greenish-blue in color, not brown, tan or red, which is certainly not a dragon&#x27;s blood color. I&#x27;m wondering if maybe they sent me some dragon&#x27;s blood BLUE but in a Red box? I&#x27;ve heard that HEM&#x27;s dragon&#x27;s blood Blue smells more light and airy than the Red box kind. I might have to buy some just to compare..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite not being pleased with the scent from the get go, I burned one anyway just to try and see if there was ANY dragon&#x27;s blood-esque undertone. I can say that the smell itself is a similar TYPE of scent in that almost cologne-y way, but I feel like if I walked into a room an someone had this going I wouldn&#x27;t go \\&quot;oo, dragon&#x27;s blood!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what happened here but as a dragon&#x27;s blood lover, I&#x27;m not the happiest with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL OF THAT SAID: The incense itself is good quality. It burns evenly, doesn&#x27;t smell putrid, and it&#x27;s powerful but I wouldn&#x27;t say overwhelming (it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my cat who can be iffy about scented things sometimes). I would definitely try other products from HEM in the future even if I am not thrilled with this particular scent. The smell isn&#x27;t bad either, it&#x27;s just not what I expected. Admittedly, I was originally going to rate this product lower but I can&#x27;t do that purely based on the fact I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent of what&#x27;s an otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it was a good deal. I ordered several scents and they all smell fine. It&#x27;s a lot of incense sticks for the money but they burn very dark.  Like, I bought some other stuff off of here and the smoke is very clean, the smoke from these sticks is black.  The kind that leaves ash and soot on stuff...  It&#x27;s almost like burning plastic type smoke?  I think this would be a good purchase for a store that wants to sell incense. It&#x27;s packaged for resale.</li>
    <li> The Dragon&#x27;s Blood scent is okay, it is not my favorite, but it&#x27;s not bad or offensive.  Would not purchase again only because there are so many other scents out there I enjoy more... but I also know that scent is personal and everyone has their own taste!</li>
    <li> Not a big fan, there is a burning dung odor to this particular brand that I haven&#x27;t noticed in others. Hard to use as any sort of meditation incense when you are disturbed by the burning smell of animal waste.</li>
    <li> these are great they burn slow and have a very woodsey pleasent aroma. I love the packaging, they come wrapped in a sealed plastic bag which is inside a card board tube and these tubes come in the master box. These help keep them fresh a long time until you are ready to use one.I will reorder these.</li>
    <li> If I could drink it, eat it or inject it, I would.  To me, this is the very best scent ever in an incense.  Probably shouldn&#x27;t say that, because it will get hard to locate once the word gets out.</li>
    <li> I like a strong scent and clean burning incense.  This meets all requirements.  Have tried other brands but Hem is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> As usual with all the incense I&#x27;ve ordered, a lot of the sticks came to small to where it didn&#x27;t stay in the hole, I have three different incensed holders and none of them will hold the tiny width without using another stick to keep it in the hole....</li>
    <li> Dragons blood has been used in purification rituals for thousands of years and all sorts of incense burning religions.  Cannot be used for harm which I like.  I burn when I feel like I am having a bad day.</li>
    <li> Dragons Blood is a resin incense, it is soothing, calming, pleasant and lightly scented. It burns clean and evenly, not smokey as I have found with other brands. It has a faint similarity to Myrrh and Frankincense, reminds me of church incense used in ceremonies. I have happily purchased many HEM incense products and have never been disappointed. Would buy Dragons Blood again!</li>
    <li> Good Incense by HEM. Burns clean and smells natural not chemical or fake</li>
    <li> It is a very good value for the money. The fragrance is very nice. I can not wait to try the Blue Dragons Blood incense. It is enough to last a long time. The sticks are very good quality.</li>
    <li> I enjoy incense and have bought many different forms. This is really good and is the best brand I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> The product is prepared in great packaging for resale there are 6 smaller packages inside the box. The smell is wonderful and true to its name, a must have.</li>
    <li> First time i tried this scent and just loved it as i do all Hem Incense, they make a quality product and will for sure order this again, also love the Lavender and The Moon great scents also !!!</li>
    <li> Bought this because it is cheaper than Satya&#x27;s Dragon Blood incense and immediately regretted my decision. It smells awful. Possibly the worst smelling incense I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> never tried this brand before but reviews were very good.&lt;br /&gt;I now know why. I love this stuff. will order again and also try other scents.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite smell but it&#x27;s not horrible. Out of all of my sticks though that I ordered this one box seems to have sticks that are difficult to keep lit since sometimes it burns out before it actually starts going down causing me to light it again. Also the actual sticks are kind of weirdly shaped sometimes, some of them being thicker on the bottom or top and vise versa.</li>
    <li> ok sent my husband loves it</li>
    <li> will order again good buy</li>
    <li> I find it difficult to find this particular scent locally so was quite glad to find it here. Price was great and this amount will last me a while.</li>
    <li> We love dragon&#x27;s blood incense and these boxes have a ton of sticks in them, and is WELL worth the price. Most of the smaller boxes contained within cost about the same price we paid for this huge box in head shops or hippie stores. Definitely suggest getting it here instead of in store. It&#x27;s worth the weight and the quality is superb. they smell amazing, and we&#x27;ve got plenty to last us quite some time.</li>
    <li> Same as I buy in the flea market but much cheaper. Good quality and lasts a long time. Also it doesn&#x27;t dry out if you close the bags. been using it for a long time on the same box</li>
    <li> Super great smell.  We use it in the basement all the time.</li>
    <li> These smell good when you light them on fire.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I needed and has never let me down</li>
    <li> I purchased this box of incense as I love the aroma it creates in your room, was very pleased with the product and it arrived before the date shown. These are boxed individually inside the larger box, which makes it very handy for storage as well. I gave this product five stars as I was very pleased with the product as well as the packaging and the short time it took to be delivered to me as I was out of this brand completely and was having a hard time locating more as it sells so quickly in my area. I look forward to purchasing more products from this company.</li>
    <li> I love the smell but some stick when i burned it .some part look like cotton. just the cotton part smell different.</li>
    <li> I recieved the product in a timely manner and they seem to be decent quality, but the scent was not what I expected. Now I have a lot of inscents I am not likely to burn.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT smell like dragons blood. bad smell. like burnt chemicals. want my money back.</li>
    <li> SMELLS AWESOME! Enough said... Also, it reminds me of sweet smelling wood that&#x27;s burning. I would recommend this scent of incense to ANYONE!</li>
    <li> The blue box is a bit less sweet smelling. I suggest that one. Overall, the price is right for great quality.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best dragons blood incense I have tried.  Very long burning and a true scent.  I will be buying these again!  If you like dragon&#x27;s blood then you will like these.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will repurchase</li>
    <li> Long lasting, softly earthy scent</li>
    <li> Shoot!!  I posted that this was a really, really nice scent on the wrong picture ... the Incense Holder that I got with this was a tad short and I wish it were a little wider, but this odor/incense is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I like the smell as it does smell like a natural herb.</li>
    <li> a stronger scent more earthy but still good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buy in this for 3 years. It reminds me of being in a temple set in the medieval times. Its very earthy with a hint of mossy stone &amp; wood.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty great for the price - you get 120 sticks for the price of 80. My only qualm with it is that the scent is a lot smokier and huskier than average scent of Dragon&#x27;s Blood. The actual scent of Dragon&#x27;s Blood is sorta like an undercurrent for lack of a better word. But you definitely get what you pay for so that&#x27;s kind of to be expected:) All in all this is a really nice product.</li>
    <li> This smells VERY close to the blue dragon&#x27;s blood, just not quite as nice.  It also does not seem to linger as long either.  Overall it is a very nice incense to burn occasionally.</li>
    <li> Big stick long burn time cheap enough. great product. be ready for a powerful scent that clears you up. and it definitely clears all other &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; out of the room</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased when the product arrived the day after I purchased it. Upon smelling the box, I was excited to discover that I enjoyed the unique scent coming from it. I immediately put it into my new burner(which is AMAZING, I highly recommend it):[[ASIN:B000VY9PS8 Skeleton Incense Burner Holder - Style 37078]] and lit &#x27;er up. To my horror, a thick burning smoke type scent filled the room. I moved it to the living room thinking my room was too small- but now my entire house smells like it was recently on fire. These are definitely going in the trash or on the net for cheap. Maybe you&#x27;ll like it, but my family and I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This scent is ok but I got really tired of it after awhile. It definitely has more of a woodsy scent.</li>
    <li> Could be better, I have bought this incense at local shops and love the way that smells. This incense is slightly off the mark. A little smokier, a little sweeter. Not bad, not weak, no funk or rot smell.  It did seem to crumble a bit when coming out of the bag. All and all worth the $. If the cost was any higher, I&#x27;d be giving it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This incense is fabulous! Smells wonderfully delicious, and the aroma lingers for over 24 hours from one stick!  The box contains a generous amount, too, far better than you could buy in a local store. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good scent, really cheap when bought in bulk. I used to always stick with &amp;#34;hand-rolled&amp;#34; charcoal sticks because they were always cheaper, but it comes at a cost. Like most HEM sticks and similar, the sticks are different shapes and sometimes are too thin or wide to properly fit in the holder. Likewise, sometimes the sticks come split or with pieces of charcoal missing to the point where you have to relight them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent itself is fairly earthy. I&#x27;m guessing quite a bit of sandalwood but with some added spice. They&#x27;re good if you&#x27;re trying to avoid the perfumey incense (think spiced apple, cotton candy, fruit and all the other terribly fake scents) as well as the traditional Nag Champa-esque scents. These are pretty smoky as well, which is why I&#x27;ve been transitioning to Gonesh (their dragon&#x27;s blood is one of my favorites) and similar brands. Overall, if you want a cheap incense that still smells good, I&#x27;d recommend these. But there are better brands out there.</li>
    <li> awwwessssommme stuff.</li>
    <li> I love these incense sticks! My girlfriend hates the smell as it reminds her of being drug to the Buddhist temple as a kid, but I think it&#x27;s great. There are better incense brands out there, but at this price point (~$5 at time of purchase) they are fantastic.</li>
    <li> For the price they are ok. The scent is very pleasant however the quality is poor. About 1/3 of the incense sticks are either missing chunks along the stick of the stick hardly has any incense on it. I can say the ones that were missing chunks, were packaged that way since there were no pieces of incense in the package they were in. Guessing the one that packaged them needed to get ride of the bad with the good so not to have any loss.</li>
    <li> All HEM incense is of great quality, in my honest opinion. FOR EXAMPLE:If you order say a PINE TREE scent...it will smell like Pine tree,lol. It is that good.</li>
    <li> Very nice...I usually buy Nag, but this is very very nice.</li>
    <li> I definitely view this product as just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. The scent wasn&#x27;t quite what I wanted, and the sticks themselves are a little smaller and thinner than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. There is a strange greasy residue that you can see burning off when initially lighting the stick. For the price, however, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> not what i expected from something called dragons blood.  not traditional at all.</li>
    <li> Wow man I came home from vacation and like the incense look beat up by an angry gorilla.  Like man if you care, you treat my incenses like you care for cool breeze on a hot day.  Karma is not good, wake up man and see the sun for the moon and you will understand that you can never escape your crimes of pretending to be a machine when you are really a person!  I look at myself in the ice and see my breath and I forgive you.  Can you forgive yourself from the shame, man?</li>
    <li> Smell is strong, but constant and not overpowering. Smokes cleanly and lasts about 30-45 minutes. The scent lingers through an entire day if the windows are shut. One of my favorite brands.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product!</li>
    <li> Not the dragonz blood I was hoping for</li>
    <li> I like it.  If you don&#x27;t then you don&#x27;t but I found this to be a decent aromatic dragons blood.. a somewhat sweet note in there but it&#x27;s subtle and so definitely a quality scent.  Great deal on incense.</li>
    <li> These incents have a pleasant woodsy scent, and are incredibly cheap considering the unit volume. I would recommend this product to a friend, or anyone searching for a cheap fragrance solution for their living space.</li>
    <li> Love this and was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Not a big incense person anymore! But love this smell! Can even smell it in the box, not being burned.</li>
    <li> Its a little too strong for me</li>
    <li> I love the HEM brand of incense and Dragon&#x27;s Blood smells really good. Not too strong and a good scent for a male. This is the best deal for your money</li>
    <li> Smell great and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> This is a good incense at a decent price. I would recommend this incense too anyone who wants a new aroma around one&#x27;s area.</li>
    <li> Smells more like musk than dragon&#x27;s blood. Close enough though you can&#x27;t really tell once it starts burning.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time this is one of favorite from Hem incense.</li>
    <li> This incense has a strong spicy scent with a little bit of a bite to it.  It&#x27;s really nice.  And for this price you get a huge box of sticks.  Really a great buy.</li>
    <li> This type of incense is the only scent that calms my nephew down.  I love it.  It arrived promptly without any trouble.</li>
    <li> Horrible like all HEM products I received in this order. Burns every orifice and your skin. Smells like burning glue or a meth lab. Linger is very, very strong.</li>
    <li> The Dragons Blood incense was a great deal. The scent is not too strong, but fills the room with a relaxing sweet scent.</li>
    <li> Snickering in delight, I just love the smell of dragon&#x27;s blood...&lt;br /&gt;It rocks, and gets rituals done that need to be done !</li>
    <li> a first for me using this product...love it!  the scent is something i have to get used to, a little strong, but it&#x27;s name says it all.  i have to figure out the best way to use this incense as i learn magik and rootwork.  :-)</li>
    <li> I like the smell of these and they do not make me sneeze and they burn for some time. good price.</li>
    <li> Great seller!  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> i will buy more from u they came fast and safe. no damage to them. how ever i know this not your fault. but my mailman tried stealing  them from me till he was caught by my landlord.</li>
    <li> This incense smells amazing. Burns evenly. I&#x27;ve had some bad experiences with incense before, but none of them have occurred with this particular incense. I recommend buying a lot of this particular brand and scent of incense.</li>
    <li> Incredible aroma!  Long lasting scent remains after the stick is burnt.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite incense. Smells so good!</li>
    <li> This is not anywhere close to &amp;#34;Dragons Blood&amp;#34;. This smells like complete crap, I honestly couldn&#x27;t even stand the small of it without lighting it.  This was a complete wast to me. Im just glad it was as cheep as it was. I honestly have no clue how this has as many good reviews as it does..</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this is so that my room would smell better, and it worked. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the incense is a little strong compared to others.</li>
    <li> Best thing to deter bugs when outside.&lt;br /&gt;Smells divine too. Shipped quickly, arrived in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price either. Highly recommend for outdoors.</li>
    <li> Smells good has a strong smell but not overbarring would buy again</li>
    <li> These are heady, deep, lovely, mystical, and wonderful.  Try them!  I think they&#x27;re my favorite.  A very good supply for the price!  Recommend</li>
    <li> Dragons Blood - 120 Sticks Box - HEM Incense  .  BEAUTIFULLY PACKAGED. Wonderful scent, not over-powering,&lt;br /&gt;sets the mood without taking over...  ya know what I mean?  Like the stars say above: &amp;#34;I Love It!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Hem</li>
    <li> I never realized I would get so many boxes when I ordered this (6 total).  I bought this in January (I think), and I&#x27;m still using these sticks!  Very easy to light, and has a good smell to it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a more authentic smell, this isn&#x27;t for you.  If you&#x27;re playing a Fantasy board game, and you want to make that feel more authentic when your wizard rolls a six on an orc (I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t personally play those types of games), then this is the stuff for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I was able to help.</li>
    <li> This brand is good quality Dragons Blood.  I have paid a fortune over years for Dragons Blood and actually prefer this brand over them all.  It is clean and pure . ty !</li>
    <li> so i bought a whole bunch of different dragons blood incense off of amazon here.... even some that was a dollar a stick and this one is my favorite. i collect incense and this one is in the top 5 smells for me right now. it looks like it is very cheap and package was the same style of some of the worst incense i have ever had so i was a little worried when it showed up, but as soon as i opened it and burnt a stick s*** went 5 stars bro. trust. and it&#x27;s 8 bux!!!1</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like dragons blood. The blue version is a little closer but not by much. The search continues...</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> This is a bitter-smelling abomination. Save your money and just set a tin-full of hair on fire. Yes, burning hair would be better.</li>
    <li> I love the little hexagon tubes they come in, in the larger box. I really enjoy the scent of these; not my favorite dragons blood scent but definitely one of the top. The scent stays in the room well, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the incense burning. Some of the wood sticks are a little thin, or split but its not generally a problem.</li>
    <li> Dragon&#x27;s Blood is one of my favorite incense. I bought this thinking it would be as nice as another brand I purchase. The scent does not linger very long and that is a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> Was not disappointed in this incense. Another great scent from HEM.</li>
    <li> Its great I just wish it was more potent while and after burning</li>
    <li> Not a strong smell. Weak but does linger.  I burn incense everyday - many times - and this just barely makes the grade.  I will continue to search for a stronger product.  Doesn&#x27;t mask anything.</li>
    <li> I finally branched out a bit from Satya Sai Baba, which I generally love, and skeptically decided to try this Dragon&#x27;s Blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite different, and I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it at first. It is strong, pointed, and has a centered, yet energetic \\&quot;feel\\&quot;. There is a sweet quality, and a burnt quality -- but not at all unpleasant. It was unusual to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still is unusual to me. But I like it. I find myself almost craving the scent of it sometimes, but I&#x27;m not sure why. It has a distinctive personality, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It burns somewhat faster than the Satya brand, but not as fast as other brands I have tried. I do very much recommend this - it is worth a try most certainly. I plan on keeping it around. It is not my favorite. But strangely, there seem to be times when only Dragon&#x27;s Blood will do, though. ;)</li>
    <li> I have loved Dragon&#x27;s Blood scented incense since I was a little girl. I was glad to find it available to purchase from this seller. Now, whenever I&#x27;m feeling nostalgic, I can burn some. It smells exactly like I remember.</li>
    <li> We really like this incense. We always used White Sage scent, just want a change, so pick this. The scent not sweet smelling or fu fu smelling like a few other we had tried.&lt;br /&gt;The incense stick was packed tight per stick, not thin here and thick there like some other brand.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this as add on item so pricing is affordable too!</li>
    <li> Repeat Buyer. Nice Smell for Commercial Incense. Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not that fond of the smell. I&#x27;ve smelled better incenses than this, although it&#x27;s a great deal for the amount.</li>
    <li> This is a very sweet, pungent incense that certainly fits in most incense holders.  Occasionally, I found one of the sticks may be larger than the standard hole size for my incense holder, but I have not run into a single issue with the incense itself.  Ultimately, you get a lot of sticks of really good smelling Dragon&#x27;s Blood for a very decent price.  I liked the packaging aswell, as it prevented sticks from getting crushed or destroyed in shipping or storage.  I have continually used this incense and have found it performs better than I expected.</li>
    <li> This dragons blood incense is strong and lasts over half an hour. Its not the dragons blood scent I&#x27;m used to but maybe this is authentic and that other stuff was cheap? Either way its not an unpleasant scent just not what i was expecting. That&#x27;s the problem buying online.</li>
    <li> My fiance loved this as a gift. The smell is fantastic! I definitely was proud to buy this as a gift for him.</li>
    <li> They are okay, just burn too fast. The smell is like a men&#x27;s cologne. I can deal with the smell, but I&#x27;m not lighting these things up everyday. Shipping was fast. I am okay with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I think I enjoy this even more than the &#x27;Dragon&#x27;s Blood Blue&#x27;! I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like &#x27;Dragon&#x27;s Blood&#x27; at all, but it seems I was wrong! I must&#x27;ve formed my opinion after getting the crap they call &#x27;dragon&#x27;s blood&#x27; at &#x27;Wally World&#x27;! That was a HUGE mistake! HEM completely changed my mind about how it SHOULD smell! If I was able to give it 9 stars, I would! It seems I like the &#x27;musky&#x27;, or &#x27;resin&#x27; type scents, more than I originally thought I would! I&#x27;ve found the same result with &#x27;Myrrh&#x27;, &#x27;Frankincense&#x27; and &#x27;Frankincense &amp; Myrrh&#x27; as well. They are ALL going to get a re-order, as well as glowing recommendations from me, from now on!</li>
    <li> I like HEM products because they are cheap and smell ok. If you prefer higher quality incense this is not it. The Dragons Blood smells good and will scent large rooms well.</li>
    <li> I expected it to not be the greatest for the price. It is an okay imitation of true dragons blood. If you burn lots of incense.</li>
    <li> not a fan, not a real scent..more smokey stick ..like a match with a lil oil on it to me</li>
    <li> So-So scent, pretty mild and not much scent</li>
    <li> Lovely scent !  Travels through whole house</li>
    <li> Dragon&#x27;s blood is one of my favorite incense smells. These didn&#x27;t smell at all like what I&#x27;ve had before, and the sticks were flimsy and breaking apart. Barely stayed lit because they were missing chunks of incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND I HOPE EVERYONE NOTICES THAT ALL REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT THAT ARE NOT 5 STAR HAVE BEEN DOWN VOTED MULTIPLE TIMES TO GET THEM OFF THE FRONT PAGE!!</li>
    <li> nice sent, and great deal. inconsistent sticks but very good over all</li>
    <li> The reason I did not like this product is that there is too much very black smoke when lighting it. I know this is an incense but I had never experience the black smoke when trying to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
    <li> Not only is dragons blood a very mild incense compared to many others, but these HEM sticks burn for a long time (usually 45-50 minutes) per stick. I love the packaging of these, you get that box, but inside are 6 smaller packets which each contain 20 sticks. Allowing each set to be as fresh as possible. I highly recommend the sticks over the cones as well. I will be buying this product again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Dragon&#x27;s blood is by far my favorite incense scent available. I had ran out and since I burn incense frequently, I thought I could stop having to purchase it so often by buying a large box. Never having purchased this brand before, I assumed it would be acceptable after reading several reviews and seeing the overall star rating; however, if you are accustomed to the Dragon&#x27;s Blood scent, do not buy this brand. It smells more like soap than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it smell good? Sure. But does it smell like Dragon&#x27;s Blood? No, not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed! And now i have 120 sticks to burn, haha. :/</li>
    <li> This is my favorite incense! I always have some on hand &amp; usually burn it everyday. Everyone should try it!</li>
    <li> They are lovely and you get so many for the money. I love that all 120 are not in the same bag but separated into little boxes, sealed up so they maintain their beautiful scent. The Dragons blood smell is a delightful sweet earthy smell.</li>
    <li> This has a nice scent and quantity. Good value for the price. Recommend this product to others. 6 individual packages within the 1 large package</li>
    <li> We love the scent of Nag Champa, and wanted to change things up a little, so we tried this one out...  The verdict is in: We do NOT like it! It is so strong, that I can only burn this one if we are leaving the house. The scent is nice.. but it becomes so overpowering pretty quick, so you need to put it out, or leave.</li>
    <li> inexpensive and fresh. nice lasting aroma</li>
    <li> What can I say. My favorite! I have purchased this twice already. I simply cannot get enough of this aroma. Dragons blood scent helps me find myself in the mist of confusion. I really love the product.</li>
    <li> if your looking for a subtle smell this is the one I recommend this to all insence burners outhere .</li>
    <li> Long lasting burn, plenty in the box!  Great price for such great quality and quantity.  I love these incense and will continue to purchase them! 5/5 Perfect!</li>
    <li> this incense smells discusting, like cigars. they should advertise it for men only!! :(&lt;br /&gt;Good amount for the money tho and now I know why.</li>
    <li> not great, cheap, and smells cheap.</li>
    <li> After reading the HEM incense reviews I&#x27;ve tried a box myself. In short, most reviewers have brought valid points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Billowing black smoke when lighted (need to keep my hand above to catch the soot)&lt;br /&gt;- Produces dusty grey ash instead of chars&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes stops burning&lt;br /&gt;- Less sweet, more &#x27;muscular&#x27; Dragons Blood scent&lt;br /&gt;- Indian bang for the buck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this more natural scent, but there&#x27;s better out there. Skip the Indian incense brands and try those from Thailand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice now and I&#x27;m quite happy with the quaility. Burns evenly, I&#x27;ll buy again and again.</li>
    <li> These smell nice. I have to admit that I like the nag-champa gold better. But for the price, these will do nicely</li>
    <li> I bought this before and like it so much that I ordered this again and will again in the future.</li>
    <li> Dragon&#x27;s Blood is my absolutely favorite incense scent. It&#x27;s spicy, woody, dark, and very intense without seeming overpowering. HEM does a great job of making a product that burns well, with little mess (aside from the usual you get with stick incense).</li>
    <li> good product and very nice packing</li>
    <li> Hem is a consistent brand. A very strong scent not for the weak of heart. Excellent for filling large rooms are small houses.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent, and a great deal for the amount of incense sticks you get.</li>
    <li> The scent itself is great but the sticks cause a LOT of smoke, so within a few minutes the smell gets overwhelming (not to mention the room really smoky!) and I need to remove the incense to another room!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used HEM Incense before so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s typical for their sticks to be that intense.., but I think from now on I&#x27;ll rather stick with my Nag Champa by Satya Sai Baba. It&#x27;s a shame really as I love the scent, just not the intensity!!!</li>
    <li> This peoduct burns great. Never had to relight. It also smelled just fine, I woiuld buy again and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> the smell gives me a high buzz feel.. like i am drug..  very strong . smell like pot or something. like that.. i don&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> There are incense and then this is HEM Incense !!!! Thank you!!! Great price, great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing aroma and slow burning!!</li>
    <li> My favorite incense. :)</li>
    <li> This incense has a very powerful scent but not overpowering.  It&#x27;s by far my favorite incense and will continue to order.  The only downside to this is the sticks are not uniform in size and sometimes i have to trim the end down a little to get it to fit into my holder. Another great dragons blood to try is [[ASIN:B001B64ILE Dragon&#x27;s Blood Gonesh Incense Stick]]</li>
    <li> Ok.  Not  a fan of the smell though</li>
    <li> This has been the best product to change my luck. It does, however take perfect faith to change your luck.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, Hem&#x27;s Dragon&#x27;s Blood is one of the most alluring of all incense. I use incense all day long, and I begin and end each day by burning this particular one. Wonderful! A pure delight!</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected the smell is not strong and does not last long. It does smell nice but not really dragon blood smell.</li>
    <li> They are cheaply made and break apart. out of 100 only about 8 broke apart. They do not, in my opinion, smell like Dragons Blood though. The sticks were cheap as well, I guess, in this case you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the dragons blood I&#x27;ve gotten anywhere else. It&#x27;s not &#x27;bad&#x27; just not what I expected and I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
    <li> I grew up with Dragon&#x27;s Blood incense and have always loved the smell. I was running low, so I ordered these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently discovered that most of the Dragon&#x27;s blood incense I used in the past (and loved so much) is quite a bit spicier than regular/pure/real dragon&#x27;s blood. These have that sweeter scent (closer to the oil extract) and the shafts are unevenly cut and warped. Also, holding the sticks leaves dark smudges everywhere. Not a bad deal, but not a great one and not the burned incense I am used to being called &amp;#34;dragon&#x27;s blood.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I finally received the rest of the incense.</li>
    <li> HOLY $***SNACKS this incense is sooooo good! It&#x27;s a very dark, seductive, masculine scent. I burn through these like hotcakes and often wonder how I go through them so fast. So good you&#x27;ll want to burn them all the time. Very long lasting burn time. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> While I sage regularly, the smell can be overwhelming and unpleasant.  Using the dragon&#x27;s blood incense while saging leaves a much better scent.  Using the incense alone, even better.  Well packaged, excellent condition and superb scent.</li>
    <li> not bad/ smells good burns good for the most part/ outta the 6 boxes probley had 6 or 7 that wouldnt stay lit but i have found that to be normal with any incense/ very manly smell/</li>
    <li> I love the scent and I will be using it frequently.</li>
    <li> i love burning all kinds of incense but this was not one of my favorites at all.  i got to burn only one stick and threw out the rest... it is a personal preference and i did not care for it at all.  make sure you know what this specific brand smells like before ordering it.</li>
    <li> This is the best dragons blood incense I have ever came across. The other brands I have tried either was way to floral or to earthy, this brand to me has the perfect balance. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> not the best dragons blood i&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great quality for a great price. Delivery took a little less time than specified.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered as described.  The packaging is good.  The sticks burn a bit quickly, but not too bad.  I would order again.  I would recommend this product.</li>
