      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>I will say that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it used to after a while.</li>
      <li>Smells good same day but does not last.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo after finding out I&#x27;m pregnant and reading about how toxic shampoo is.</li>
      <li>I wanted something that was not tested on animals, was not harmful to the planet, would help keep the color in my hair longer, and would clean my hair in the first place.</li>
      <li>Not only does this product protect my hair color, it also gives it a nice scent to it that lasts.</li>

      <li>A little does a lot, and it keeps my scalp in good shape.</li>
      <li>Love it, will totally buy again once I use up this first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

      <li>I recently switched to sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, and this is the second I have tried.  </li>
      <li>However, it also doesn&#x27;t feel completely stripped of</li>
      <li>Toxic or not I just figured being natural couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>i started using natural and organice health and beauty products.</li>
      <li>Finally arrived, anxious to use it, daughter loved it we can get other nature&#x27;s gate shampoos but not this one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos in the past but they were not color safe, and as I dye my blonde hair black, it fades really easy.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this only for fine hair, limp, dry etc....</li>

    <li> good shampoo, i have thin hair that was breaking off. since using this shampoo i have very little breakage,</li>
    <li> So far so good, need more time</li>
    <li> Shampoo is fine, but the scent is way too strong/perfumy for me.</li>
    <li> Left my hair dry. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to no one</li>
    <li> The do a Nice touch with youy hair</li>
    <li> I have brought Natures Gate Shampoo before and the loved the fragrance. The Chamomile doesn&#x27;t smell nice to me, the shampoo itself is nice. Lathers nice and apparently is doing a good job protecting my hair color.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! My hair looks so healthy ! I use a lot of Nature&#x27;s Gate products ! I highly recommend the shampoo!</li>
    <li> I put the title in quotes because this is my first time using a color protecting shampoo and this is so far my favorite. Not only does this product protect my hair color, it also gives it a nice scent to it that lasts. I just recently colored my hair after a year and I wanted to prolong the hair color so I decided to give it a go with this one because, well, it&#x27;s cheap and apparently the top ten best color protecting shampoos out there, so why not? I use this shampoo with Pantene&#x27;s Color Protecting Shine Conditioner and I have not noticed my hair fading from its color from the day I colored it. Love it, will totally buy again once I use up this first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;But on the other hand, this shampoo does not lather into a thick bubbly shampoo like other shampoos - maybe it&#x27;s just the way it&#x27;s suppose to be because it&#x27;s a coloring shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of ingredients like other shampoos. I don&#x27;t know, but that&#x27;s just a little minor I will have to deal with.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, and this is the second I have tried.  It is my &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34; for sure.  The smell is flowery, but doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my allergic nose.  I find that using this shampoo and conditioner together eliminates the frizz I used to deal with (so I no longer have to use other anti frizz products etc.)  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo - have been using it for years but it&#x27;s hard to find locally.  Does not leave a film on my hair.</li>
    <li> i discovered this brand of products in the grocery store. they are wonderful. i started using natural and organice health and beauty products. i highly recommend this brand. they smell great.</li>
    <li> I want less toxic personal products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do not wash my hair every day. The styling is a chore.  I dont want funky smelling hair the next day or the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a leave in gel that solves the smelly problem.You guessed it. It has the bad stuff in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have purchased 5 safer shampoos that don&#x27;t get the job done. I have bought bergomot and lavendar and lemon and aloe and added to shampoo.  It is expensive little bottles and not much better. Smells good same day but does not last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some young genius will get rich when they come up with a safer shampoo us gals like.</li>
    <li> I used to buy fancy over-priced shampoo, then switched to an at-home baking soda mix before trying Nature&#x27;s Gate. I wanted something that was not tested on animals, was not harmful to the planet, would help keep the color in my hair longer, and would clean my hair in the first place. This does all those things. I will say that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it used to after a while. However, it also doesn&#x27;t feel completely stripped of it&#x27;s natural oils right after washing it. It&#x27;s a very gentle soap for your hair. I like the chamomile scent because it&#x27;s not overpowering, it&#x27;s very mild. It&#x27;s not fruity or girly in any way, so my husband has started using it as well. We also use the chamomile conditioner and love it. It leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling clean. Doesn&#x27;t over-dry. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be washing out my color treatment. Nice smell, great value.</li>
    <li> i bought this based on the reviews.  Wow, all i can say is it really doesn&#x27;t deserve one star.  I have oily hair, thick, with a lot of body, i keep it colored.  I wash my hair every other day due to the amount of maintenance for this hairstyle (long sharp angled bob).  I washed my hair with this and there literally was no lather at all.  So, i washed it again, still again really no lather.  My hair felt dirty still...so on the 3rd time, i did get some lather but it leaves my hair feeling unclean.  I bought two bottles of this, thinking it must be great.  yuck, in the trash it goes.  If you have oily hair, DO NOT use this product.  I would recommend this only for fine hair, limp, dry etc....it&#x27;s not for someone like me.</li>
    <li> Smells floral. Cruelty free. Wholesome ingredients. Leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, and both my wife and I have been using it for years. I have short hair, she has long- it does well with both, though she uses conditioner on hers. A little does a lot, and it keeps my scalp in good shape. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product cleans very well. It does not leave any residue on your hair. I definitely need to follow with a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after finding out I&#x27;m pregnant and reading about how toxic shampoo is. Toxic or not I just figured being natural couldn&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos in the past but they were not color safe, and as I dye my blonde hair black, it fades really easy. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t fade my color! My hair looks silky and healthy! I love the smell! It&#x27;s a great shampoo!</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this shampoo would be very gentle.  Instead, my hair felt stripped of moisture after using it.  I like that it isn&#x27;t tested on animals, and contains organic ingredients.  I have very short, pixie-cut hair, with highlighted sections that are growing out.  I will keep this shampoo on hand and retry it when I have more of my natural hair and less processed length.</li>
    <li> Finally arrived, anxious to use it, daughter loved it we can get other nature&#x27;s gate shampoos but not this one.</li>
    <li> It does what it says, no build up or yucky feeling.</li>
