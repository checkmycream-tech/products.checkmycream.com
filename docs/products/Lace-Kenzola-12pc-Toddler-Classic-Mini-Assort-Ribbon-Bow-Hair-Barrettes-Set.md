      <li>Great product and Excellent Customer Service!</li>
      <li>these are great.</li>
      <li>They work great.</li>
      <li>They are great quality.</li>
      <li>These work great</li>
      <li>Love!  </li>
      <li>Bought them for my niece and they match many of her clothes!</li>
      <li>They are the perfect size, perfect colors, they have little teeth to grip the hair, fully coated in ribbon.  </li>
      <li>What is so amazing about a set of barrettes that could make me break my silence?  </li>
      <li>love it, love it.</li>
      <li>I purchased from ABLE PROVIDER.</li>
      <li>I love these bows.</li>
      <li>These were colorful and a good value for the price.  </li>
      <li>it perfect size for a baby, wish they have white color also.</li>
      <li>These bows are adorable in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>THEY MAKE SURE</li>
      <li>Super cute quality bows!</li>
      <li>Baby has fine hair and stays put...until she pulls it out :)</li>
      <li>Great quality and love the various colors.</li>
      <li>Great for fine/thin hair on baby, these actually stay in the hair.</li>
      <li>(They stay in better and are more gentle on baby hair.)  </li>
      <li>Bought these bows and i was so excited to get them in the mail.</li>
      <li>Would have made it much safer and better to put them on a squirmy baby.</li>
      <li>I actually glued on my own ribbon to the metal parts so it wouldn&#x27;t tear up her hair and these work fine now.</li>
      <li>Many bows are too big on my daughter (or in her fine baby hair).</li>
      <li>For an older girl, I think just fine, but not for a toddler.  </li>
      <li>When you open them to take them out just make sure</li>
      <li>YOU ARE SATISFIED OR GIVE YOUR MONEY BACK!</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about them is that they have &amp;#34;grips&amp;#34; I guess you&#x27;d call them to help them stay in the hair better</li>
      <li>Wish that a white bow was included since that&#x27;d be the most versatile.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>My daughter is now over two and even though she has grown a 2 inch does look funny on her head.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re pretty forceful, also.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get them wet; they rust VERY easily.  </li>
      <li>These are darling, and stay in place very well.</li>
      <li>Very  misleading.</li>
      <li>These clips look cute, but the metal under the fabric is sharp with edges like teeth.  </li>
      <li>So much better than the carters ones because they have a little grip but are still gentle for baby hair.  </li>
      <li>which would be good for your baby if she has thin hair</li>
      <li>This is the first review I have ever left on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>These would work better in the hair of an older child or toddler with thick hair.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a little cheaply made, but they work and are darling.  </li>
      <li>These work much better than any I have purchased, but without pulling out her hair if she grips it too hard.</li>
      <li>so there&#x27;s no metal on the baby&#x27;s head, but the tiny bit of grip from the alligator tooth sides really holds the hair in place and doesn&#x27;t let the bow flop out.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s 11 months old and wouldn&#x27;t wear headbands anymore but always pulled them off.</li>
      <li>for my 3 month old.</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t hurt my 1 year old.</li>
      <li>While the bows are adorable, they are not as pictured; instead of having the flat clip back, they are slightly rounded, coming to a point.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that my daughter has fine hair</li>
      <li>I was looking for clips with a little grip to stay in my little girl&#x27;s fine hair.  </li>
      <li>One half of the metal clip is covered with ribbon, but the other half is metal which feels kind of sharp.  </li>

<li> There is no &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; material in order to hold fine hair, but the clip itself seems to have small &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;, though I am not convinced this will not tear out my little lady&#x27;s hair when she&#x27;s done playing with them.</li>
<li> I tried to reorder the same bows, but the ones that came from the same listing here on Amazon are now 2 inches long.</li>

<li> My daughter sucked on one for a few minutes, and a few days later, rust spots.</li>
<li> Hard for me to open up.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m too afraid to use these until she&#x27;s older.  </li>
<li> Disappointed with the colors dark red two yellow dosn&#x27;t match the picture there are no light purble ifeel bad about this order</li>
<li> There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with the quality.</li>
<li> Unable to use.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Item is as described by seller. The metal part of the clip is covered completely by the ribbon and poses no risk to my little one.</li>
    <li> Great hair clips! They actually stay in my girls head, despite if the running around!</li>
    <li> love it, love it. it perfect size for a baby, wish they have white color also. well made</li>
    <li> Great for babies that have tender scalps!!</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever left on Amazon.  What is so amazing about a set of barrettes that could make me break my silence?  They are the perfect size, perfect colors, they have little teeth to grip the hair, fully coated in ribbon.  Just perfect.</li>
    <li> No fabric on the backs. Unable to use.</li>
    <li> Great quality and love the various colors.</li>
    <li> I wish the backs were wrapped in the ribbon. Would have made it much safer and better to put them on a squirmy baby.</li>
    <li> Ribbon does not cover the metal on the back as shown in product photos.</li>
    <li> these are great. they don&#x27;t hurt my 1 year old. They stay on well.</li>
    <li> Super cute quality bows! Bought them for my niece and they match many of her clothes!</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the colors dark red two yellow dosn&#x27;t match the picture there are no light purble ifeel bad about this order</li>
    <li> These are perfect. Many bows are too big on my daughter (or in her fine baby hair). These are darling, and stay in place very well. Love!  Sadly, I came on here today to update my review from more than a year ago. I tried to reorder the same bows, but the ones that came from the same listing here on Amazon are now 2 inches long. My daughter is now over two and even though she has grown a 2 inch does look funny on her head. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These were colorful and a good value for the price.  My only complaint is that my daughter has fine hair and I prefer barrettes where the clip part is covered in ribbon. (They stay in better and are more gentle on baby hair.)  One half of the metal clip is covered with ribbon, but the other half is metal which feels kind of sharp.  I actually glued on my own ribbon to the metal parts so it wouldn&#x27;t tear up her hair and these work fine now. These would work better in the hair of an older child or toddler with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Simple but the range of colors fits just about every outfit</li>
    <li> Wish that a white bow was included since that&#x27;d be the most versatile.  They&#x27;re a little cheaply made, but they work and are darling.  Don&#x27;t get them wet; they rust VERY easily.  My daughter sucked on one for a few minutes, and a few days later, rust spots.</li>
    <li> I love these bows. So much better than the carters ones because they have a little grip but are still gentle for baby hair.

    <li> They work great. Baby has fine hair and stays put...until she pulls it out :)</li>
    <li> These clips look cute, but the metal under the fabric is sharp with edges like teeth.  For an older girl, I think just fine, but not for a toddler.  I&#x27;m too afraid to use these until she&#x27;s older.  They&#x27;re pretty forceful, also.  Hard for me to open up.</li>
    <li> These bows are adorable in my daughter&#x27;s hair. There&#x27;s several different colors to match all her outfits. She&#x27;s 11 months old and wouldn&#x27;t wear headbands anymore but always pulled them off. She doesn&#x27;t do that with these bows. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about them is that they have &amp;#34;grips&amp;#34; I guess you&#x27;d call them to help them stay in the hair better which would be good for your baby if she has thin hair but you&#x27;ve just got to be careful when you take them out. When you open them to take them out just make sure all there hair is off the clipy part of the bow so it won&#x27;t snag or rip there hair.</li>
    <li> These work great but I need to get another set so she can have a clip on each side of her face</li>
    <li> She loves them! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product and Excellent Customer Service! THEY MAKE SURE YOU ARE SATISFIED OR GIVE YOUR MONEY BACK!</li>
    <li> I purchased from ABLE PROVIDER. While the bows are adorable, they are not as pictured; instead of having the flat clip back, they are slightly rounded, coming to a point.

    <li> Clip not covered with ribbon as seen in the pictures.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with the quality. They are great quality. I just wanted them to be a tiny bit bigger.</li>
    <li> Great for fine/thin hair on baby, these actually stay in the hair.</li>
    <li> Bought these bows and i was so excited to get them in the mail. There no like the picture shows. They DO NOT have the fabric like the picture shows in the back. Very  misleading. I bought  these ones specifically for that  for my 3 month old. But now i cant use them.</li>
