      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Love this foundation not as a foundation</li>
      <li>so I make sure to apply in a well ventilated area with a air purifier going and don&#x27;t breath in while applying.</li>
      <li>But I dont love these product because it doesn&#x27;t provide the coverage that I hoped for.</li>
      <li>(you can see the twist top in the picture below vs. the powder with no cover for the holes).</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Ok i am offically hooked now that ive tried this mary kay foundation powder i will never be able to use liquid again</li>
      <li>Love the Mineral Powder from Mary Kay.  </li>
      <li>I am an Ivory 2 user in winter and Beige .5 in summer and love this product.</li>
      <li>But when used for this purpose - sets the foundation darn well and makes sure it doesn&#x27;t move around.</li>
      <li>primer, I bet it would be even better.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure with the cream foundation as the base/</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>Still my favorite, &amp;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it works best if you make sure to apply a facial moisturizer or primer before you put on your makeup.</li>
      <li>love it ,</li>
      <li>Mary Kay is my favorite mineral powder</li>
      <li>Nothing out there is better.</li>
      <li>It went right over my foundation smoothly and gave it great, sleek finishing touch to keep my foundation in check.</li>
      <li>so I was happy it&#x27;s available on amazon at a much cheaper price :)</li>
      <li>It covers effectively, and it also stays on really well - even without any kind of primer or something else to help it adhere.</li>
      <li>This product stretches far and does a great job of blending your skin.</li>
      <li>So, I was so excited to be able to find it online.  </li>
      <li>I do enjoy this powder.</li>
      <li>No reaction,covers well,feels smooth.</li>
      <li>2-3 light dusting to my face</li>
      <li>As far as how well the product works, it gives good coverage.</li>
      <li>Mary Kay make up doesn&#x27;t have the greatest ingredients of mineral makeups but it doesn&#x27;t have anything I&#x27;m actively allergic to (I&#x27;m allergic to some ingredients that normally should be safer for most)</li>
      <li>Full coverage, yet feels so light.</li>
      <li>It gives me a smoother look, but also keeps a natural look for me as well, and since I don&#x27;t wear much make up, that&#x27;s especially important.</li>
      <li>I am super excited with how fast it came!</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick and the product was as if I bought it right from Mary Kay.</li>
      <li>I really like the smooth, porcelain look</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast, the price was reasonable, and the container has the twisty top to close the holes so the powder doesn&#x27;t spill when I toss it in my purse</li>
      <li>Does not provide as good of coverage as some other mineral makeups I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I buy when good price than other outlets</li>
      <li>Just what I was looking for and at the right price.  </li>
      <li>Same product as you would receive from local consultant, arrived in great shape</li>
      <li>Thank you very much for this item.</li>
      <li>It has a really light weight feel, more so than other types I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I tried buying the same product from Health &amp; Beauty for you and received my package today; I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>I use over top my Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation.</li>
      <li>Is this really Mary Kay?  </li>
      <li>hahaha</li>
      <li>The powder smells fresh, and I can tell it is new because I&#x27;ve been buying it for years directly from a Mary Kay lady for a much higher price.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite powder foundation of the several different brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>And this particular shade works so well with my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised and very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It blends so well, is weightless, and it looks very natural.</li>
      <li>I got in within 3 days of ordering it and 2 days early!</li>
      <li>I have trouble spots (sun spots) around my temples and the powder does a great job of making them less apparent.</li>
      <li>It covers well and looks natural.</li>
      <li>so I reapplied it with one of my trusted old foundations.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this powder its great on the face and looks beautiful I would recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this powder foundation! It blends so well, is weightless, and it looks very natural.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay is my favorite mineral powder</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this vendor can sell this cosmetic at the price she does.  I felt like I was stealing it.  I received it in just a few days.  I have large pours and have tried other mineral foundations but none get into my pours, minimizing their appearance and evening out my skin tone nearly as well as this Mary Kay product.  I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> Great product, great package and received on time!</li>
    <li> If Mary Kay makes it; I consider it good quality.  I am using this successfully, and pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay make up doesn&#x27;t have the greatest ingredients of mineral makeups but it doesn&#x27;t have anything I&#x27;m actively allergic to (I&#x27;m allergic to some ingredients that normally should be safer for most) so I was happy it&#x27;s available on amazon at a much cheaper price :) Talc is a questionable ingredient lung wise so I make sure to apply in a well ventilated area with a air purifier going and don&#x27;t breath in while applying. As far as how well the product works, it gives good coverage. I&#x27;ve found it works best if you make sure to apply a facial moisturizer or primer before you put on your makeup.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this powder! I use over top my Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation. Coverage is AMAZING! Full coverage, yet feels so light. This powder leaves skin looking velvety soft. Great purchase. Will buy again and again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Is this really Mary Kay?  I don&#x27;t think so.  I ordered the Ivory, which was a very dark brownish color.  Every time I used this product I got a headache.  This had flimsy coverage, wore off after a few hours, and did not seem like any Mineral Foundation makeup I have used over the past 15 years.  I think this is a fake.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same product! I used Mary Kay for a long time. This wasn&#x27;t the same powder. Sad sad sad</li>
    <li> Love this foundation not as a foundation but - Use it to set my liquid foundation since I feel that this by itself doesn&#x27;t provide a great coverage. But when used for this purpose - sets the foundation darn well and makes sure it doesn&#x27;t move around. Would have been great if I could have used it all by itself :( Oh well!</li>
    <li> great product.  shear coverage</li>
    <li> I really like the smooth, porcelain look it gives my face.  I use it over blended concealer.  I have rather fair skin so apply 2-3 light dusting to my face and like that it still looks and feels so natural; like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup at all.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation EVER! I tried the Bare Minerals line for 4 weeks and it make my skin break out. I have sensitive skin but this Mary Kay foundation has been my saving grace. It matches my skin tone perfectly and provides a non-greasy coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every mineral powder out there and this is the only one that covered without drying my skin out, and looks natural.</li>
    <li> Great product, but took 3 weeks + for it to arrive.</li>
    <li> Already wrote one it&#x27;s all she use&#x27;s :</li>
    <li> Love the Mineral Powder from Mary Kay.  Used with the liquid foundation, it makes for a perfect finish.  I love it!</li>
    <li> i am very pale in the winter and have trouble finding foundation/powder at drugstores. I have purchased ivory 2 for the summertime, and so i tried this for my winter shade. Its perfect without foundation underneath, i love it! I look like i have good skin instead of like i \\&quot;put my face on\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Good sale!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for this item. It was exactly what I ordered. Very happy. Will order from this site again</li>
    <li> Ok i am offically hooked now that ive tried this mary kay foundation powder i will never be able to use liquid again this stuff is wonderful its coverage is amazing and ive had less breakouts since using this!! Love it</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, but it looks like it will be amazing! I am super excited with how fast it came! I got in within 3 days of ordering it and 2 days early!</li>
    <li> Arrived in great condition</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Exactly the same as it was when I&#x27;ve ordered from Mary Kay in the past many times, except not as expensive. Will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> love it , fast ship&lt;br /&gt;trust which is very great business relationship with customers.&lt;br /&gt;buyers need to trust them  and buy it because i have great positive feel with them.</li>
    <li> Same product as you would receive from local consultant, arrived in great shape</li>
    <li> Will never use anything else. Perfect for sensitive skin. Not greasy or oily. Great coverage that you don&#x27;t expect!! And a must have for woman who wear foundation. Nothing out there is better.</li>
    <li> I do enjoy this powder. I previously spent 60 bucks on Bellepierre&#x27;s foundation powder and though I love it, it&#x27;s so expensive! This is a great substitute and I look forward to buying it again. It is closer to my skin tone and I&#x27;m sure with the cream foundation as the base/primer, I bet it would be even better.</li>
    <li> This product stretches far and does a great job of blending your skin. I have trouble spots (sun spots) around my temples and the powder does a great job of making them less apparent.</li>
    <li> Just got this a few days ago. As soon as I received I opened it up and tried it on with some foundation I bought. The foundation was horrible so I reapplied it with one of my trusted old foundations. Looked great! Although ivory is a tad bit dark for me I bought this anyway knowing porcelain is almost impossible to find. It didn&#x27;t look bad at all! It went right over my foundation smoothly and gave it great, sleek finishing touch to keep my foundation in check. It&#x27;s not glittery and scented which is what I need but didn&#x27;t even stop to think about that when buying. Pleasantly surprised and very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how hard it I found it to get the powder out. I eventually became frustrated and shook the closed powder 10 times more than I should have. hahaha But a good amount came to surface and I could proceed to put it on my face with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for all the pale ladies out there!</li>
    <li> For the price, I love it!!</li>
    <li> Nice flawless finish.</li>
    <li> Excellent powder foundation. I had tried BE and didn&#x27;t like it at all, and stayed away from mineral powder foundations. Then I came across the reviews on this and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. The price is good too.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in great condition and on time. But I dont love these product because it doesn&#x27;t provide the coverage that I hoped for.</li>
    <li> No reaction,covers well,feels smooth. This is not an ordinary powder cover up it feels  good and does blend well with skin tones. I buy when good price than other outlets</li>
    <li> the box had clearly been open several times.  the inner seal sticker was missing when i opened the make up for the first time.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite, &amp; it&#x27;s great to be able to order via Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase from this seller. I recently bought the same makeup from a different seller and was disappointed because it didn&#x27;t come with the twisty top to close the holes so the powder doesn&#x27;t spill out of the container. I tried buying the same product from Health &amp; Beauty for you and received my package today; I&#x27;m extremely satisfied. The shipping was fast, the price was reasonable, and the container has the twisty top to close the holes so the powder doesn&#x27;t spill when I toss it in my purse (you can see the twist top in the picture below vs. the powder with no cover for the holes). The powder smells fresh, and I can tell it is new because I&#x27;ve been buying it for years directly from a Mary Kay lady for a much higher price. I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Guess I&#x27;ll put the review for the Bronze powder here. It makes a lovely sort of color to highlight my base makeup so that I don&#x27;t look like a white sheet. Not really a makeup connoisseur, I use it only when I&#x27;m working because I loathe the stuff, but I loathe this less than any other.</li>
    <li> Thank you. Great product and price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite powder foundation of the several different brands I&#x27;ve tried. It has a really light weight feel, more so than other types I&#x27;ve tried. It covers effectively, and it also stays on really well - even without any kind of primer or something else to help it adhere. And this particular shade works so well with my skin tone. It gives me a smoother look, but also keeps a natural look for me as well, and since I don&#x27;t wear much make up, that&#x27;s especially important.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and at the right price.  Shipping was quick and the product was as if I bought it right from Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and all of a sudden It can&#x27;t be purchased anymore through the MK catalog.  So, I was so excited to be able to find it online.  The seller was quick in shipping and I am very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Flawless finish - i use it with the tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this make up everywhere and this was the easiest and cheapest way to go. and I love it. so glad I found it on here!</li>
    <li> I am an Ivory 2 user in winter and Beige .5 in summer and love this product. Honestly I sell AVON as a side hobby and I still use this product instead. It covers well and looks natural. I don&#x27;t experience build up or an orange look like I do with other powders.</li>
    <li> Does not provide as good of coverage as some other mineral makeups I have tried.  Does not come with a brush.</li>
</ol>
