<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everyone always needs more vitamin D in their bodies. Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I am a woman who suffers from low D3  I have been looking for a Premium Quality D3 .  After careful research and reviews I came across this brand .Natures true Medicine helped bring my level back in the normal range and also helped my fatigue go away. Some people don&#x27;t realize how low vitamin D can affect you. Most people think D3 is just for bones and teeth but it is a vital vitamin for your immune and nervous system. As a woman in remission from cancer i take my D3 level very seriously and knowing Natures True Medicine is part of my everyday healthy living lifestyle I could not be happy!! Great product !</li>
    <li> I got this quickly since I have prime and I was offered this for a discount but this is my opinion. So number 1 it is small so I was happy about that,I hate swallowing big pills. I strangely whitened my skin I don&#x27;t know if it is suppose to do that. I didn&#x27;t see any weight loss with this but I still take it since some extra vitamins don&#x27;t hurt</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best D supplement out there!</li>
    <li> Tiny, making them super easy to swallow. A perfect way to get your daily dose.</li>
    <li> The vitamins arrived very quickly and the packaging was in good condition.  I definitely notice a difference in my energy level and I will buy this product again when it&#x27;s time to restock.</li>
    <li> I live in seattle area where getting the vitamin d is very tough since there is no much sun shine in winter time. This product is very good source of vitamin D. This is incredible product for a great price. Not only is it vegan and gluten free (which I needed), but it is a well made vitamin D3. best this of this product is easy to take. very small. I loved it.</li>
    <li> Really like these. They&#x27;re tiny little gel caps with a powerful punch. They&#x27;re small enough (about the size of the tip of your pinkie finger) that anyone can take them, including our 3 and 4 year old kids. Yet they provide 2,000 units in one little cap, so they&#x27;re great. Nicely done and glad we found these!</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t know that Vitamin D was so important for so many areas of the body.  It can help with cancer and inflammation like Crohn&#x27;s Disease as well as a lot of other problems.  And I didn&#x27;t know that it can help you prevent the common cold and flu as well as sinus infections, which is something that I suffer greatly from.  I have chronic sinusitis and not ONE of my doctors has ever mentioned that Vitamin D might be helpful - I live with what feels like a constant migraine behind my eyes and at least every 2 months need to go on an antibiotic.  I am hoping that this works to keep them at bay, so far so good :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Norman, MD, in a recent article in Endocrine Today, stated “it is now widely appreciated by vitamin D scientists that 50% of people in North America and Western Europe are vitamin D insufficient. Given that two-thirds of the people are vitamin D-insufficient or deficient. It is clear that merely eating vitamin D-rich foods is not adequate to solve the problem for most adults.”  These softgels contain other ingredients including soybean oil, gelatin, veggie glycerin and veggie oil.  And you get 120 softgels for $14.99, I can guess that most meds that do the same things and have the same benefits cost WAY more than that even with copays.  So give them a try - it is cold and flu season, see if they can help reduce infections for you and with other chronic conditions.  I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
    <li> Have been taking this everyday since receiving it.  Love it and will continue using!</li>
    <li> These are great I take Vitamin D regularly and I have been happy with this find.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The delivery was very speedy and the packaging was great. Love the vitamins, the capsules go down easy which is exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Loves this! Great Buy!</li>
    <li> The item is so reasonably priced and was delivered very quickly. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very sick so I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to be in the sun so these are a vital part of my daily routine and health!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome Natural Product. Much better quality than those at the local Pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Trying something different like it so far</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I received the vitamin D quickly and so far have taken a few of them.  I&#x27;m very happy with the service and so far the vitamin seems fine.</li>
    <li> Vitamin D 3 supplement which is easy to swallow. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Was just what I was looking for, great product!</li>
    <li> Everyone needs vitamin D these days.  These very small pills are easy to swallow.</li>
    <li> Great product and exceptional service.</li>
    <li> Easy to swallow. Seem to be good quality.</li>
    <li> Small easy to swallow, no yucky aftertaste.</li>
    <li> These Vitamin D capsules are liquid soft gel to help absorb faster in the blood stream, they are 100% natural ingredients. They help with blood pressure, and eye and bone health. There is a book devoted to Vitamin D helping with weight loss, so I had to try and she how that worked. I have lost a total of three pounds just from taking these for about a week, my blood pressure has lowered a little in that short time frame, and my joints do not hurt as bad as they used to. These Vitamins are easy to take, I love that they are all natural no worries of putting chemicals that are not needed into my body. They really do work and make you feel great.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to swallow capsules.</li>
    <li> No bad taste and very tiny so they are easy to swallow. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> In michigan, sure can use all the D3 I can get.  This seems to be good stuff!</li>
    <li> These worked out really well for me, tiny little gel caps that go down easy.  of course In the Northeast US, most of us are low in D3 being that we have those cold winter months to get through. I found that taking these did help a lot and made a big difference in mood as well.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that 2000 iu&#x27;s of Vitamin D were packed into these little tiny (smaller than a pea) capsules. My doctor said I am very deficient in Vit D, probably because I have hated taking the big calcium + D caps, so always &amp;#34;forgot.&amp;#34;  When she prescribed 4000 iu&#x27;s a day, I was expecting to have to take horse pills! So very happy with these. I take them every morning with my coffee.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Great to use when you have a vitamin deficiency.</li>
    <li> Internist recommended Vitamin D; ordered from Amazon and voila it was in the medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> I purchased D3 from Natures True Medicine because of the very favorable comments from other purchasers. I also liked the ingredients which does not include GMOs and it is made in the USA. Shipping was excellent and I feel the price was too. I received a customary follow-up email inquiry from this company which tells me they are very concerned on how customers feel about their products and service. I know it was just customary email but by their reply made me feel they actually do care about what they sell by thorough extensive research.  I’m a first time buyer from Natures True Medicine but I feel it wouldn’t be the only time.</li>
    <li> I am taking one capsule per day of this product, in consultation with my doctor, and blood tests show that it is maintaining my vitamin D level in the upper normal range. At this level I can get through fall without contracting any cold or flu viruses that previously had been making me very ill. A definite thumbs up for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product naturally enhances my mood, and is excellent bone support. Don&#x27;t miss out!!&lt;br /&gt;  awesome product!! I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to swallow!! I will buy more.</li>
    <li> The many benefits of a Vitamin D3 supplement can be seen throughout the body, as it helps systemically in many functions and organ systems. Vitamin D3 is an essential component to maintain or obtain optimal colon, breast, eye, bone and prostate health, as well as to keep calcium and phosphate reserves balanced and used efficiently. It is also praised for its ability to help reduce inflammation and even assist in weight loss, through the metabolism of fat stores in the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been feeling tired, achy, weak or find yourself becoming ill often, Vitamin D3 could possibly help reduce those symptoms. Of course if your issues are something chronic or acute, you should probably check with your Doctor, as it could be something more serious. But, for general health, this is a great supplement to take and Nature&#x27;s True Medicine makes one of the cleanest, effective, and more balanced formulas that you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin D3 supplement arrived in a small white bottle with a green and black label, sealed with a protective plastic rim over the cap. The Label reflects that it is made in the USA and under GMP Lab practices, which are then tested by a 3rd party. For those with sensitivities or allergies, the softgels contain no artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, magnesium stearate, sugar, starch, milk/lactose, gluten/wheat, yeast, fish, sodium or fillers. It is made with 100% natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle of Vitamin D3 (aka Cholecalciferol) by Nature&#x27;s True Medicine contains 120 very small and easy to swallow liquid softgels, which is enough for a full 4 month supply. Each daily serving contains 2,000 IU, which is the perfect amount to supplement your diet, especially if your blood work shows that you are low or deficient, as mine did. Most Americans are found to have low-D because of the vast time spent indoors and out of natural sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking Vitamin D3 for 5 months now and I have felt great improvement in my overall general health.ral health.</li>
    <li> I really like how small the gel caps are, especially when they each contain 2000 iu.</li>
    <li> My wife has been taking vitamin D for a long time. We usually end up getting a store brand. The quality is important to use, let&#x27;s face it, so is the price. With this product, we get great quality at a great price. We got a 3 month supply and we are very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I live in a Redwood rainforest, so my general exposure to sunlight is brief and elusive. Recently, my blood panels came back as once again deficient for Vitamin D, and thus my quest began. I&#x27;m an office drone, not a doctor, so the following statements are just my personal observations:&lt;br /&gt;* This is a great quantity for the price - other Vitamin D supplements I have purchased contain 30 or 60 doses, whereas this bottle contains four months&#x27; worth of little gelcaps.&lt;br /&gt;* These gelcaps really are teensy. The only irritation I have experienced using these were when I initially went to shake a dose out and dumped half the bottle on my counter (vitamin D supplement has so far not seemed to affect my general clumsiness).&lt;br /&gt;* There&#x27;s no funky aftertaste and the packaging is easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;m noticing I&#x27;m a bit more chipper.&lt;br /&gt;* Furthermore, I&#x27;m not so fatigued throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been taking this product for 10 days, so these could be simply be placebo effect - but admittedly decent placebo effects to have!</li>
    <li> D3 is one of those vitamins that you just simply do not get enough of naturally. One of the most important aspects of this vitamin is that it helps all your medications work better. People do not know that they are deficient in this vitamin and it can help with so many parts of your body too. If you take any prescription medication, you need to take this too.</li>
    <li> I love these tiny little vitamins. So easy to swallow!!</li>
    <li> I take vitamin D3 on a regularly. I like how it boosts my energy level especially in the winter. Natures True Medicine does the trick.</li>
    <li> Nature’s True Medicine was a lower potency Vitamin D-3 supplement. It is 2000 IU so you are advised to take one each day. A bonus is that this Vitamin D-3 supplement is free of GMOs. It has a funky smell, but it does not taste bad. It is an excellent brand and I found ut worked great! The supplement did not make me queasy which is a grand accomplishment. I made sure to take them with a meal.</li>
    <li> I just started taking this D3 vitamin recently by recommendation from my doctor.  I am impressed with the product and the company.  I experienced a shipping issue with Amazon (cleared up to my satisfaction) but received excellent personal follow up from Natures True Medicine to insure I was completely satisfied with my purchase.  I am and will buy this product again !</li>
    <li> These are easy to swallow and  good quality ingredients.  It&#x27;s not easy to find supplements that you can feel good about.  I&#x27;ll be reordering these.</li>
    <li> These are very small pills and easy to take for daily vitamin d supplement</li>
    <li> Great product, highest potency, reasonable price and small pills, easy to swallow.</li>
    <li> During the long winter months, my vitamin D levels dip. My doctor recommends I take a daily vitamin D supplement all year long. I like that these pills do not contain fillers.</li>
    <li> I take 2 per day in the evening to add to another supplement with other vitamins and minerals.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after doing a fair amount of research on the many Vitamin D3 suppliers around.  I was already impressed by existing reviews.  Like most people, I get a little gloom during the sunlight deprived winter months, and very recently I started supplementing and sometimes mega-dosing Vitamin D3.  I used this product for a few months, following some protocols I read from the Vitamin D3 Council, and I felt like I scraped the hibernation state off of me.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this particular brand of Vitamin D3. -- Bobby Beckner</li>
    <li> For Healthy Bones!!! Excellent!!!</li>
    <li> Very prompt service for an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Tiny gelcaps. Very easy to take. No odor. Seems like a great product. We&#x27;ll see if my winter gloominess goes away!</li>
    <li> My first impression of this product was &amp;#34;whoa, this is a huge bottle for this tiny amount!&amp;#34; but then my (pharmacist) husband explained that vitamin D pearls are usually small. After a few weeks of taking these small, easy to swallow, capsules, I am a huge advocate for vitamin D! Living in Northern Michigan I have months of no sun, winter lasts 5-8 months here. By January this year I was needing naps every day, I was simply unable to get through my day. After a few days of taking this vitamin D I was feeling more energy. Now, a few weeks later, I am not napping anymore, I am in better spirits, and I have WAY more energy. Will definitely be keeping this gem in my medicine cabinet from now on!</li>
    <li> so far my d level are doing good with this</li>
    <li> Very Pleased so far. Will update review after a few weeks...</li>
    <li> Just what we needed thanks! Purchased at discounted price for review</li>
    <li> Take one of these every morning. Been using it for many months now.</li>
    <li> Easy to take. Easy way to get some vitamin d</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> I love how easy these are to take. I&#x27;m not choking down a huge vitamin! I&#x27;ve been feeling SO much better this winter with much more energy and I really feel like a lot of credit can go to the Vitamin D3 supplement.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was incredibly fast! I will be a returning customer for sure.</li>
    <li> I was told to take 2000IU of Vitamin D by my doctor, I&#x27;ve been taking 2 - 1000IU tablets daily of the cheapest brand the store has to offer since taking 2 tablets added up. I love that these are little capsules and the perfect amount I need daily. One bottle will last me 4 months! That&#x27;s a great deal. These are super easy to take, no weird tastes or smell plus they&#x27;re made in the USA. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was advised by my doctor to take 2000 iu of Vitamin D because I was low. I take it daily and have no problems with it. It doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach at all and the pill is very small which makes it easy to swallow. I will only know if its working when I get my next blood work results.</li>
    <li> These tiny capsules go down smoothly, without odor or taste. I take these because I dont drink cows milk and I cant have a lot of exposure to sunlight either.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin D., I always run the risk of low vitamin D, and I do notice the difference when I do not take it.  I take 1 tablet a day.  These are perfect size and easy to swallow.</li>
    <li> Blood tests indicated that my vitamin D level was quite low. My doctor recommended a supplement and I&#x27;ve ordered Natures True Medicine, Vitamin D, multiple times and have received my orders in a timely fashion and well packaged. Just what the doctor ordered! :)</li>
    <li> Works great love this product</li>
    <li> Great product got my vit levels where they needed to be. Gluten free product fast delivery. so happy to have gotten this. Received at reduced cost for honest opinion/review.</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing the job and at a good price.</li>
    <li> OMG talk about feeling energized. I love this little tiny pill. You can swallow this without water..lol I&#x27;m not a pill person for some reason pills make me gag but this is the most easiest pill I ever took. Great stuff thank you. I can wait for this company to make an iron pill because I would order that too.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> Vitamin D is one of the supplements of the moment. Liked so many other people mine was a little low. I alternate this with a liquid supplement.</li>
    <li> small and easy to swallow</li>
    <li> I work at night so I need vitamin D. This supplement gives me all I need and now my Levels are back to normal.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have received my product and I so far I like the ease of taking the pills.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The product was delivered quickly and was well packaged.  The pills are a small and easy to swallow.  I plan to buy again as I feel the product provides the same, if not better vitamin quality than many of the more expensive offerings.</li>
    <li> Great all natural product.  I take this when I feel like I am starting to come down with something and it works so great!  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I finally found the right Vitamin D with NO artificial favors, or preservatives, and clear ingredients, NO magnesium steerage...etc. Love it and would recommend to friends and dimly memmbers. clear ingredients and great price. thank you! I am continue using this product. It is just right amount to take 2000 IU of Vitamin D3. I have a lot of energie since I am taking it. Like that it contains NO GMO. The best Vitamin D I ever had.</li>
    <li> Fresh, great packaging, no funky smells, small pearl sized pills...easy to take. really good quality.</li>
    <li> This product is the best Vitamin D3 I have ever purchased.  It really is 100% pure with no GMO&#x27;s added.  Did I mention how reasonably priced the product is?  It is, believe me.  Also, Natures True Medicine, who has developed this product is AAAAAA+ in the area of customer service.  They contacted me to make certain I was happy with the purchase of their product.  I was, and delighted in telling me so.  They wrote back to me and thanked me.  So, let me spread the word -- you  are not only getting a wonderful Vitamin D3 formulation at an excellent price, you are also getting involved with a company who cares about what YOU think and how YOU feel.  I will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Great product and super service.  Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an easy-to-take, incredible product for a great price. Not only is it vegan and gluten free (which I needed), but it is a well made vitamin. It came in the mail very quickly and I actually had the flu (chills, fever, cough) when I started taking it. I am prone to horrible sinus and ear infections because my immune system is typically low in the winter. I expected this flu to morph into something else as it always does and it didn&#x27;t.  I had the flu for one day only--for the first time in my life. I attribute my recovery to this product and I am going to continue using it. I would love to see True Medicine make a drop for kids as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent, quick service for this great product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product!  Highly recommend this seller.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  The product is natural and non-GMO which is very important to me.  Gel caps are very small and easily swallowed.  I will be purchasing more when this order is exhausted.</li>
    <li> very easy to take and feeling much better since I started taking the pill</li>
    <li> For many years my wife has not slept a night through. I read that being low in vitamin D could cause this problem and D3 was suggested. Since starting Natures True Medicine D3 my wife gets a restful sleep without waking up till morning. My labs have shown I am low on vitamin D so I also am taking the 2000 mg. Vitamin D is a sunshine product which most of us do not get enough of due to not spending enough time outside in sunshine. And if you live in a colder climate in winter who wants to go outside. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love these! This product is awesome ~~ Works great and would recommend to others! Fast Shipping too !</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:860b1917d2d6ee31174cf566b3562ff7]] Totally recommend Natures True Medicine Vitamin D3! Will definitely be ordering more from this same retailer :)</li>
    <li> great product and customer service is incredible. love, please support this small company.</li>
    <li> OH MY LORD...OK...I got diagnosed with a very bad Vitamin D definiciency 2 years ago but took some other Vitamin D which worked well but I stopped using them.Fast forward to this year...I started having bad joint pain,bone pain,hellified muscle cramps and headaches.I got the first bottle a month ago and I was taking like 8 pearls  at a time.I noticed that ALL OF MY PAIN STOPPED!!!!I was amazed to find out that this deficiency causes all of this pain. THIS IS MY SECOND BOTTLE BECAUSE I RAN THRU THE 1ST BOTTLE IN A MONTH.THANK YOU JESUS....I WILL BE BUYING TEN BOTTLES AT THE END OF THIS MONTH!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just started using this brand of vitamin. D3 and so far so good. I take this product daily and when I get my vitamin D levels checked with my physician, I will come back and update my review on their effectiveness.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t take vitamin d, you should and these will do the job.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have tried other vitamin D3 supplements and have had issues with most of them. This is definitely a keeper. Easy to swallow no gross aftertaste</li>
    <li> So far seems like a great product BUT this is lab made so I&#x27;m gonna try Nutrigold D3.  Nutrigold D3 is NOT lab made</li>
    <li> I really like the size of these pills</li>
    <li> Wow, making a huge difference in deficient vitamin D numbers for myself and my husband.</li>
    <li> This is a great product provided with great service!  Just what I wanted!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using it.  We all need vD</li>
    <li> After living up North for several months, I became aware of the importance of Vitamin D3 as a vital supplement for mental any physical well being. A product definitely worth purchasing!</li>
    <li> Good quality product.</li>
    <li> I like this supplement!</li>
    <li> I’m very pleased with your product.  I love that it’s a gel cap and that it’s truly a “clean” product…no additives, non GMO. Thanks for making a real good Vitamin D3.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a more compact, easy to swallow vitamin supplement. Easy shipping and quick arrival, too! Very thrilled, will order again. :)</li>
    <li> So far I have enjoyed this brand of D3. I take D3 as well as a few other natural products to assist with my energy levels and mental sharpness. This product is easy to take and the cost as well as shipping were very good. The company also followed up with me by phone to make sure I was a happy customer. If you are not sure about the benefits of D3 just do a simple Google search and you will find plenty of medical studies etc.  I am not a doctor and cant make medical claims but one dose of D3 and one low dose aspirin per day can have great long term effects on your body.</li>
    <li> Both the seller and the quality of the product are superior.  I do applied kinesiology and after testing clients with this and another Vit D3 have found a majority of bodies prefer Natures True Medicine.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Vitamin D?? Most people have a Vitamin D deficiency, so what better way to up the Vitamin D? Take this awesome supplement! I ordered this product because I take Vitamin D daily. This is exactly what I needed and packaging was great. I would order this again. Thanks for the quick turnaround!</li>
    <li> Great product , fast service. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this D - hopefully my next blood test will show that it&#x27;s working on my D levels!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff I&#x27;m on my  second bottle!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. I prefer to do business with small, reputable company than a very large one.</li>
    <li> 2,000 IU is the perfect formulation for [my] Vitamin D3 deficiency.  Taken with a fat, because this vitamin is absorbed in fat, i.e., after an avocado  (I take it immediately after I take coromega omega3 chocolate orange squeeze), this caused my Vitamin D levels to return to normal by my next checkup.</li>
    <li> Dr said to up my levels of Vitamin D she gave me your product....next blood test showed normal levels&lt;br /&gt;I continue to take this.....easy and small gel tablets are nice</li>
    <li> Knowing that many Americans are chronically vitamin D deficient, I love being able to supplement since I&#x27;m not able to spend nearly as much time outside as I would like.  The health benefits are numerous!  The product arrived promptly, the capsules are small and easy to swallow.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good Product- i would buy again.</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful way to get your vitamin D3 when the weather and your schedule don&#x27;t cooperate. Sometimes I use a liquid, but this form is easy to fit into my pocketbook&#x27;s pill bottle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product !!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin.  Works great.  By afternoon, fatigue would almost overtake me.  Since taking this D3 each night before bed, I feel great all day.  No abnormal fatigue by midday.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good supplement..fast shipping, no filers and preservatives! Easy to swallow- one pill a day. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Vitamin D3 2000IU, 100% Pure.  That says it all for me.  I&#x27;m a colon cancer survivor, with half of my colon removed. My doctor recommends that I take 4000IU per day of D3.  This product from Natures True Medicine provides that much in 2 easy to swallow soft gels.  It&#x27;s pure enough to be gentle with my colon.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s enough to make them worth while, not to mention the other qualities such as fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I am a person who does not get much Sun and I am unable to drink milk.  So I worry about my levels.  This Vitamin D works wonderful for me.  I take one a day and I feel so much better.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Vitamin D is important! Many of us are deficient, and that can be terrible for our bodies. I found out I was deficient, which led me to taking vitamin D. Fun fact - I started to gain weight after getting off of a medication, and taking vitamin D got me back on a weight loss track. Additionally, I was told to take this for eye health in case I decide to get Lasik in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notably, this pill is easy to swallow and moderately sized. It has no strange taste. It&#x27;s a good, easy pill, even for those who aren&#x27;t fans of swallowing pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is manufactured in the United States, has no fillers and has a money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> incredible product for a great price and is it vegan and gluten free. Vitamin D3 is a must to maintain excellent health, If you want to lower your blood pressure, vitamin D may be just what you need. If you&#x27;re trying to reduce your risk of diabetes, or lower your chances of heart attacks, rheumatoid arthritis then vitamin D should be at the front of the line in your daily supplement regiment</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I purchased these vitamins because I was told I had a vitamin d deficiency and had to get on d3 2000 iu as soon as possible. I have been taking these pills for two months now and I am extremely happy that I have been. A month into taking the pills I started noticing an improvement in my mood and the level of fatigue that sent me to the doctors in the first place. I got more energy during the day and no longer felt the need to nap when my 3 year old went down for his naps. I found out recently that my vitamin d level has gone up from 20 to 35 which is a big jump and deal for me. I am hoping that continuing to take these vitamins (and going out in the sun more) I will be able to bump my levels up to a good 50. I enjoy that these pills are tiny and very easy to swallow. They have no taste and haven&#x27;t given me any type of side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinions.</li>
    <li> You need a quick Vitamin D supplement, it&#x27;s perfect. Very small gel pill, easy to teake, and you have a big amount to last quite a while. Always eat something with these pills. The only thing, the expiration date is November 2015. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to finish it, especially since it&#x27;s spring/summer.</li>
    <li> This is part of a new supplement plan for me. I know I am feeling better. I know I tolerate the supplement just fine.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Thanks so much for bringing it to Amazon. I will continue to purchase this item. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this vitamin, due to my lack of exposure to the sun (desk job). I can&#x27;t honestly say that I can tell a difference when I take this supplement. But I will say I have no adverse effects. I do feel better when I take it consisyently, so I guess there are some increased benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to take this little sunshine in a pill, and would recommended it to anyone who sits inside all day.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product.</li>
    <li> great product that works well</li>
    <li> This vitamin D is great. It is a very small gel cap that is easy to swallow which makes it easier to take every day.</li>
    <li> This&#x27;s a good make of the supplement Vit. D3!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural Vitamin D with no bad chemicals or GMOs and am so happy to have found this!!  This is a great product and I love that it is shipped quickly.  I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> Love Nature&#x27;s True Medicine Vitamin D3, because of the all natural ingredients, many other products i have seen or thought about buying have many ingredients and some of which i don&#x27;t understand why they are necessary. Also some other brands don&#x27;t guarantee their product, and i was very impressed that Nature&#x27;s True Medicine offered a 100% money back guarantee, so why not try it out!!. Another reason i looked for vitamin D is because i am a vegetarian and often cannot get adequate Vitamin D from natural sources, let alone the recommended amount of Calcium but by using a Vitamin D supplement such as this it will allow me to help my body out by helping my body absorb and use the Calcium available to me to help support and maintain my bones.  all around great product would recommend to anyone!! best product out there</li>
    <li> Felt a good difference in my energy after just a few days of supplementing with these. I have finished the bottle now and my hair has grown back healthy and strong. I had thinning hair and so glad it&#x27;s back. I would have never thought a definancy in D3 could affect my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for a month now and I haven&#x27;t had any colds. As soon as I&#x27;m close to being done with my first bottle I&#x27;ll be ordering another. Definitely would recommend</li>
    <li> Easy to take,  Great service. Very good product</li>
    <li> I actually picked this for 2 reasons.  This was the purest form of vitamin D that I found (no fillers!) and I love the labeling!!  LOL  No, but seriously I feel so much better since I&#x27;ve been taking these.  I have more energy and just plain feel better!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  These guys are doing things the right way.  I&#x27;ve had direct correspondence with ownership and they are incredibly dedicated to customer service and to putting out the best quality product possible at the best possible price.  I like to support people like this who have their priorities straight.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my first purchase.  Fine product and a great value.</li>
    <li> This absorbs almost instantly. If you have low Vitamin D, this can help a lot of aches and pains caused by low Vitamin D. This is truly gluten free--I have fast reacting celiac, and I&#x27;ve been taking it for a week with no ill effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: this is a tiny bit laxative. A non-soybean-oil source (which this is not), might be a better idea.</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended I take D3 and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with results. Labs are looking GREAT!! Edward K.</li>
    <li> Vitamin D supplements are a must for many reasons. I guess you could say I&#x27;m a vitamin D connoisseur. I&#x27;ve taken many different vitamin D supplements over the past few years after finding out I was low on vitamin D. Most of us are. Even if you get spend time in the direct sunlight , if you use sunscreen you may not be getting enough vitamin D. After taking this supplement for 8 days , I&#x27;m sold. All supplements are NOT equal. Unlike some of the others it doesn&#x27;t have added ingredients, it&#x27;s about as natural as you can get in a supplement. The gel tablets are easy to swallow. No aftertaste. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Deliverd promptly.  The quality seems excellent.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Great item</li>
    <li> great vitamin d3 product</li>
    <li> My Dr. informed me that I am lacking in Vitamin D.  I saw these on Amazon and ordered them.  I can&#x27;t wait to go back to the Dr. and see what she says.</li>
    <li> For the forst time in a while my Vit D levels were actually normal.  I am pleased, small capsules with big punch.</li>
    <li> To the extent I can humanly determine, product is as described and delivered as promised. Easy-to-swallow little pearls.</li>
    <li> Often I don&#x27;t notice a difference with supplements but I did with this one.  Great service too--my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; vitamin D supplement!</li>
    <li> I received my vitamin d order from Amazon and I really like the small size of the gel caps.&lt;br /&gt;The order arrived very fast - before the estimated arrival date and I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! The quality is great, the results are great and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Clear (and good looking) labeling, fast shipping, and effective product. Exactly what I ordered at a great price!</li>
    <li> easy to swallow, too early to share the result</li>
    <li> The Vitamins arrived on time and exactly as stated in the description. I am pleased to have finally found a natural vitamin that is not overpriced! The pills aren&#x27;t chalky or too big to swallow. The small, gel capsules are easy to swallow and leave no bitter aftertaste (comparable to a small version of fish-oil pills). I am satisfied and will likely reorder!</li>
    <li> 100% Pure, Premium Quality,,,love this product! Considering I don&#x27;t drink as much milk as I used to, this is perfect for getting my Vitamin D.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for selling a Premium Quality Product!</li>
    <li> Great purchase from a reliable and trustworthy company. Highly recommended. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a relief to have found a source of Vitamin D3 that is not only free of artificial additives but backed up by people who really care about helping others. The philosophy of the people behind the product matters as much to me as the quality of the product itself. As an older person, I take Vitamin D3 to stay healthy, and I&#x27;m grateful to be able to purchase it from such a responsible company.</li>
    <li> This is the best vitamin D supplement that I have ever used. Quanitity in bottle, ease of taking and results are great. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I appreciate the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I have been using this product for several years and we have come to the conclusion that this is the best formulation of Vitamin D available.  We&#x27;ve tried many. We recommend this product if you want to get the best results possible.  William F.</li>
    <li> Just got my blood tests for my annual exam and my Vitamin D is back in the normal range.  Your product got me back where I should be.  Very satisfied and recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I have been diagnosed with Vitamin D deficiency and have bought so many different brands to help this health issue of mine. I started using this product religiously and I believe the quality of this brand makes a world of difference because my Vitamin D levels have improved significantly. This product is truly worth getting because Vitamin D is a big help to people with blood pressure or diabetes related problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I have noticed many Vitamin D supplements contain soy, which I try to avoid because it is likely genetically modified.  This one has no GMO&#x27;s.  I like that.  It is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;The product came a day faster than stated.&lt;br /&gt;I wiill be buying them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Nature&#x27;s True Medicine!</li>
    <li> This is a soft gel that is easy to swallow, yet it packs a whopping 2000 IU of vitamin D3 per serving. I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> exactly as promised safety sealed:)</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price. I was taking 1000IU vitamin D3, which was a regular powdered pill that left a bad taste when I took it, for the last six months because my doctor said I need to as I get older. I love the gel version that these are to make it easier to take. Also, after taking it a few days, I felt a difference (maybe just in my mind but feels real!!) possibly because it is double the dosage that I had been taking. I feel good that it is from a reputable company that takes pride in the quality of their product. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> great product! quick delivery! will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This product works really well for me not too strong gives me energy and better overall health awesome for brain health as well helps to stay focused. I recommend this product I take it with breakfast and it last most of the day. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good product,  nice small pills.  Exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Nice product at a nice price.</li>
    <li> I have a vitamin d3 deficiency issue, and these do the job.  Without taking vitamin d3, I have leg and hand cramps, and have trouble even writing a check out.  With these, no problems, I take 2 a day and have been using these for a couple of months without any side affects, or after taste, they have worked as advertised and have not done any harm.</li>
    <li> Quickly summarizing this vitamin D3, it is a gel capsule, it is easy to swallow, and there&#x27;s no bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to increase my D3 intake and this product has highly quality ingredients.  I prefer the soft gel vs traditional hard vitamins.</li>
    <li> Great Vitamin, it&#x27;s  a better  vitamin D3, from the past ones that I have been taking!</li>
    <li> Beware this has Gelatin.  This was not disclosed on the product page.</li>
    <li> The soft gels are smaller, so very easy to swallow. no wired smell or taste either. Label about the D3 is very detailed, a great product</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT. I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product this is the second time I have purchased your product and will continue to and thank you for the promptness of receiving!  Always happy to see when a Product is 100% Pure!</li>
    <li> Product arrived faster than I expected. Gelcap is small and easy to swallow. Quality is a great. Customer service is the best. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better experience and a better product for the price.</li>
    <li> Easy to take and Easy to swallow</li>
    <li> The quality seems to be good &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any problems taking them.  I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Great! Do what they claim! Worth it</li>
    <li> This D3 2000 arrived quickly and seems to be of good quality. I have been taking it for a week. We know vit D is necessary for absorption of calcium, phosphorous and some other minerals from our intestinal tract for the health of our bones. Vit D3 also has other important functions for the immune system and nervous system. This brand has the perfect dosage. Since I don’t get much sun, taking vit D3 2000 is important to me. I like this brand a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin D pill.  It is small and easy to take and Vitamin D always gives me a little boost in energy.  I highly recommend you try this one - you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural Vitamin D supplement.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!  Maintaining strong and healthy bone density is key for sustaining my active lifestyle.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> D3 is such a great immune builder. I have tried other vitamins like Vitamin C for times when I feel a cold or sickness coming on, but every since I have started taking this D vitamin, I feel a stronger immune system and helps me from staying healthy and energized each day.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is a 100% pure vitamin and great price for what you are getting. Totally recommend trying it out!</li>
    <li> So far this vitamin D supplement has been working very well. I have noticed that I have not felt as sluggish and tired as normal! I would recommend this to anyone who has a vitamin D deficiency!</li>
    <li> My job requires a lot of energy and physical work, and a lot of my shifts are night shifts. This really helps with extra energy for those days, especially when I don&#x27;t get the chance to go outside very much.</li>
    <li> Great vitamin. I love that it is all natural and very easy way for me to take my vitamin D.</li>
    <li> Loving this! I was surprised at how little these were. Sometimes I have a hard time with vitamins and such getting stuck. These are a small gel caplet and is great. I have been looking for a good vitamin D and this fits what I was looking for. I also love that it is pure. That is so important to me. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> I received a coupon to try this Vitamin D3 . I really am happy with it. I take vitamin D daily and this seems to work just as well as my usual brand .  I feel like the size and taste of the pill is good as well. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to add D3 to their diets.</li>
    <li> As a 2x cancer survivor, I am getting my blood tested frequently. My vitamin D levels always seem to be low no matter how often I am in the sun, which is daily. Because of that, I like to take an extra vitamin d tablet daily. These pills are very easy to swallow and don&#x27;t have any side effects. After a couple of days, I noticed a difference in my energy as well as my overall mood. Even for people who are not cancer survivors, they typically have low vitamin d levels. I highly suggest ordering these just so you can have the added benefit especially with winter coming and the sun going down sooner.</li>
    <li> I take Vitamin D daily. This seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> I like to dosage of this product.  It is not to small but not to high.  It makes it easy to adjust it for my husband and me meeting our individual needs.</li>
    <li> Repeat order.  Haven&#x27;t had my levels tested yet but I am less lethargic.  I will post again after the next time I get my vitamin D levels tested.  The pill is so tiny it&#x27;s easy to take and does not upset my stomach at all even if I take without food.</li>
    <li> Good value for your money, item as described.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting taking my vitamin D, I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s effective but if it is then I will reorder it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My parents live out in Chicago, and it gets brutal there in the wintertime. My mom&#x27;s in her mid 50&#x27;s now, and she often complains about lack of sun etc. etc. I decided to look into vitamin supplements to help my mom out, and I cam across this product. So far, so good. Second time buying it. What i like most about it that there are no fillers or surprises. Lots of companies compromise on their integrity for the sake of sales or even reputation, but according to my research and mom&#x27;s feedback, everythings looking good. Price is reasonable too.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price! The pills are easily swallowed. So buy it already!</li>
    <li> I have no way of judging this product.  Only a test by the Dr.&#x27;s office will determine how efficient it is.</li>
    <li> I love thisproduct it come really quickly.I been taking these for a few days and starting to feel better with them. I have been tested for being low on Vitamin D and I feel this product it&#x27;s happening a lot .These pills are easy to swallow. I like the fact that they are natural ingredients too. I recommend this Vitamin D to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price. Perfectly sized pill, easy to swallow! I&#x27;m addicted! received it in several days. no hassles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve had my blood tested and the results came back low. I also need it because I&#x27;m breastfeeding.tgese capsules are nice quality.</li>
    <li> This vitamin is a great addition to my daily routine!</li>
    <li> Great vitamins. Effective and very affordable. Will take again some time.</li>
    <li> I love how small they are, makes it easy to swallow. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I originally started thought about taking vitamin D because of concerns about my bone health.  (Nobody wants osteoporosis, right?)  Of course, the market is flooded with options for supplements and vitamins, and I wasn&#x27;t sure which one would help me the most.  I was also concerned about safety, as so many supplements have chemical fillers, or they&#x27;re made in unsafe conditions.  However, these vitamin D capsules are great!  They&#x27;re not very expensive considering the quality guarantee.  They don&#x27;t taste bad, and I (a notoriously bad pill-swallower) am able to take them super easily every morning.  I have also found that my daily energy level is going up, which is especially important as winter is coming.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for us, great shipping too!</li>
    <li> I like these because they are small and easy to swallow.  Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I take Vitamin D pretty much year round.  I tend to take it less during the summer months since I spend more time outside and in the sun where I can get most of the Vitamin D that my body requires.&lt;br /&gt;Nature&#x27;s True Medicine sent me their Vitamin D3 supplement to try out and I have been taking it everday.  My doctor actually told me to take up to 5,000 IU a day so I have been taking 2 of the Nature&#x27;s True Medicine Vitamin D3 supplements per day and I feel like I am doing me &amp; my health a huge favor every time I take it!</li>
    <li> Got the vitamins and they are great! Tiny pills and I feel better already!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for a few weeks now and am happy with the results.  I live in Minnesota and the winters can get long and most of us here are lacking in Vitamin D.  I take it once a day and am pleased with the small size of the pill.  I really do feel like I have an increase in energy and overall well-being.  I will be ordering more :)</li>
    <li> I don’t go outside very much anymore so I am taking these to be sure I get enough vitamin D.  They have more D and are more potent than most others I have tried.  They are small softgels and very easy to swallow.  They are easy to take and do not have any side effects so I am happy with them.  I was sent a sample unit in exchange for an honest and fair review.</li>
    <li> Here in the Pacific Northwest, taking a Vitamin D3 supplement is a must - these are small and easy to take - non GMO! Big Plus!&lt;br /&gt;A lot of bang for your buck, with 120 capsules per bottle - very nice!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the vitamin D product, especially that it is non-GMO and a very pure product without artificial ingredients, and that it has no preservatives, sugar or sugar substitutes,starch, lactose, gluten, yeast, corn, sodium or fish. I also appreciate the good service!</li>
    <li> We received the product on time, in good condition and at a great price. While we prefer to get our vitamin D from sunshine it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have a back-up plan.  Both my dermatologist and general practitioner  recommended that I take 2000 IU vitamin D3.  This is the best one I have found - pure and easy to swallow.  I will continue to use this product.  Ann H</li>
    <li> Made in the USA, and Gmo free. I am very satisfied with these. Came in quickly and great price. Also very awesome there is 100% guarantee.</li>
    <li> these are working for me , quality is good. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> very happy with my purchase : )</li>
    <li> Since my doctor told me I was vitamin D deficient (by a simple blood test) I have been looking for a good quality supplement.  I especially wanted one with no fillers or artificial ingredients.  This supplement has 2000IU per easy to swallow caplet.  I think it is a great value and arrived quickly after I ordered it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to good bone health!</li>
    <li> It completely enhanced my mood! Sunshine in a bottle!</li>
    <li> Small and easy to swallow. No funky aftertaste or smell! Perfect dosage. No &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; ingredients! :)</li>
    <li> Nice size, easy to swallow. No aftertaste.</li>
    <li> Capsules are unscented and easy to swallow. They remind me of vitamin e capsules. Easy way to get that vitamin d you are lacking and boost your energy.</li>
    <li> No aftertaste or trouble swallowing - my son who has difficulty with pills had no trouble either :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking these a week so can&#x27;t provide any long term benefits but I will say, the pills are very small, small enough that I can take them without water and they&#x27;re not chalky like most other supplements.  I actually don&#x27;t mind swallowing these, which is a perk.  I look forward to the benefits!  Plus the bottle is huge!  It should last quite a while!</li>
    <li> These are nice little easy to swallow gel pills.  I love them and they don&#x27;t have any bad aftertaste.</li>
    <li> I was impressed that the pills are so small and easy to swallow. I&#x27;m glad that the bottle was a solid white, as clear ones can sometime affect supplements if they are placed where light can get to them. During winter months vitamin D is a must for me to take and I would recommend this brand to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have vitamin December deficiency and taking this vitamin D3 has been very beneficial. Many cancer patients have vitamin D3 deficiency which makes you wonder if it is directly linked or a cause of some cancers especially breast cancer. It is good to just be on the safe side and take extra vitamin D3.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described and better value. Packed, sealed and delivers as promise.  Will and have recommend this product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> so far so good! I have taken vitamin D3 supplements for years, as I have a D3 deficiency. If I miss more than a few days taking my supplements I can tell a difference in how I feel. I replaced my previous supplements (Nature&#x27;s bounty) with these and so far so good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get excited about vitamin D supplements, but these capsules are so much smaller than others I&#x27;ve used, which makes these very easy to swallow.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended that I take 2000IU of Vitamin D3 daily when the lab report came out that I was deficient in Vitamin D. Anyone who is getting a routine physical should have their Vitamin D checked - it is not part of the regular round of blood work. Since I work indoors and use sunscreen when I&#x27;m outside I guess I haven&#x27;t been getting my Vitamin D from the sun. I found the Natures True Medicine Vitamin D3 and really like it. It doesn&#x27;t have an artificial colors or flavors or preservatives. Who needs to put extra stuff in our body? With the Natures True Medicine Vitamin D3 I&#x27;m getting what I need - the Vitamin to help keep my bones strong. I like the easy-to-read label too!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because, unlike other vitamins, this vitamin is easy to swallow.  They do not upset  my stomach.  The fact that they are 100% natural gives me the peace of mind that they will properly react with my diet.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> all natural gel capsule. easy to ingest. 2000 iu is the perfect daily dosage for me. Vitamin D3 is a must to maintain excellent health. I highly recommend Natures Best.</li>
    <li> awesome product..love the very small size of the gel-caps. very easy to swallow.</li>
    <li> I have had great satisfaction in my dealings with Darla and products she has introduced me too. I am eager to try her new suggestion of vitamin D.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to take.  I can&#x27;t wait to check my Vitamin D levels in the next 30 days.  It arrived on time as promised.</li>
    <li> Great way to get vitamin d in your diet. My endocrinologist suggested using vitamin d and this fits the bill!</li>
    <li> I like that they are very small and easy to take.</li>
    <li> Great vitamin easy to swallow . 100 percent pure and the iu is good amount!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for review and have not been disappointed !  These are not huge &#x27;horse pills&#x27; that are so common when looking for vitamins and supplements.  Easy to swallow and they don&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Easy to take...good pricing</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Really small capsules.&lt;br /&gt;- Capsules are shaped like an egg and have a semi-slippery outer surface.  Even those with difficulty swallowing pills shouldn&#x27;t find these intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Really haven&#x27;t found any yet.  Will update if I do.</li>
    <li> Excellent supplement. You start feeling better after a few days. Easy to swallow and aesthetic.</li>
    <li> We received the order promptly and are very happy with the product and your services. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. Im naturally a little deficient in Vitamin D as most people are. As soon as I started taking this I felt amazing. I now take it EVERY day. I can always tell a difference when I miss it. The pills are small and easy to swallow. No aftertaste.</li>
    <li> Awesome vitamin! Can definitely see and feel the quality:) Expecting more products from you!</li>
    <li> If you want to lower your blood pressure, vitamin D may be just what the doctor ordered. If you&#x27;re trying to reduce your risk of diabetes, or lower your chances of heart attacks, rheumatoid arthritis, or multiple sclerosis, then vitamin D should be at the front of the line in your daily supplement regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin D is important for regulating the absorption of calcium and phosphorous in our bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main source of vitamin D comes from sunlight. However, foods such as oily fish, eggs, fortified fat spreads and powdered milk are good sources of the vitamin. It can also be taken in the form of supplements.</li>
    <li> Good quality Vitamin D3.  It&#x27;s a brand change for me that might be permanent!</li>
    <li> Very easy way to take Vitamin D, no funny taste and very small capsule.</li>
    <li> Clean ingredients, small easy to swallow no  funky taste gel capsule. Great price. Fast delivery. Gluten and corn free is a big plus as well as no GMO&#x27;s finally a product you can trust that the ingredients are going to help strengthen and support your body. Will order again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I think these are so pure and fresh. I need Vitamin D and these are perfect !</li>
    <li> I have low vitamin D and my energy has been low but since I been taking this vitamin D I have felt better. I was using one from Wal mart that were not oil but A pill and both my husband and I felt tired on them and we feel better taking Natures True.</li>
    <li> The pills are small and so are able to swallow with no problem.  The pills arrived before the time that I was told to expect them.  So, I am very pleased with my purchase.  As far as price goes, I did not check other outlets for prices, etc., but am pleased with how soon it was delivered and in pristine shape.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> We really like this product...very good quality</li>
    <li> Great Product!!!  Small, so they are easy to swallow.  It has never got caught in the back of my throat like some of the other brands.  Seems to be very high quality and the company really stands behind their product.  I get no reaction when taking this Vit D.  No sour stomach.  Just be careful.  If you are vegetarian/vegan, there is gelatin in this product so it is not for you.  - Todd P.</li>
    <li> Seems to offer some joint pain relief.</li>
    <li> One small gel per day and you are all set.  I really like how small they are as they go down so easy.</li>
    <li> No after taste or side effects.  Nice small gel cap, super easy to swollow. Vitamin D is so important in the winter, helps with SAD</li>
    <li> I like that these Vitamin D capsules are so small - makes swallowing them really easy.</li>
    <li> Soooooo important. I like this ALOT.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product. Blood work revealed I was low on vitamin D. This product has been great for me. Awesome price and the exact dosage my doctor told me to take.</li>
    <li> It is as described. Just Vitamin D. They do what they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> I received my package on time and with no damage.  I am a 41yr old who is  Vit D deficient. No matter what the doctors try I still can not get my Vit D levels over 16 ( usually staying around 4-6).  Your Vit D levels should be between 30-100. and I am never even close. I have tried so many Vit D supplements, so I fig&#x27;d why not? I am already taking Vti D 50,000 UI&#x27;s in a prescription but my doctor told me to add a over the counter daily Vit D supplement to it. I have been using Vit D3 2000IU just a few days, but I think I am starting to see a little improvement. I usually have absolutely no energy and feel fatigue constantly, on the 2nd day I woke up and wasn&#x27;t just falling over wanting to go back to sleep. I am excited and hopeful of what the next month will look like. I like the fact that this product in made in the USA and contains no GMO&#x27;s.  I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review  and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Vitamin d. &#x27;Nuff said!</li>
    <li> They are average vitamin D pills.&lt;br /&gt;I was given these for my honnest review which i gave done</li>
    <li> I was taking some pretty large junk vitamins from Walmart and they were making me sick to my stomach every morning. These are so tiny and easy to swallow, and I have not felt sick at all. Awesome product and great customer service!</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin D. It is small as a tick tac and very easy to swallow. It doesn&#x27;t smell or taste funny. Definitely getting a second bottle!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Provides the dosage that I need in a small and easy-to-swallow pill.</li>
    <li> Hating the winter blues? This helps!</li>
    <li> Great product and quality.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and the service was great!</li>
    <li> I wanted to switch my Pure Vitamin D3 supplement dose from 5000 IU to 2000 IU so I placed an order with Nature&#x27;s True Medicine on Amazon and received exactly what I needed in a timely fashion. The product works as advertised as measured by my recent blood test results showing a marked improvement in my Vitamin D levels from a baseline exam from 3-4 months prior.  The pills are very small and easy to  swallow.  I do not take them daily, especially if I go for long walks in the California sunshine, but I do take them 3-5 days a week.  It is great to have on hand as a supplement, especially if combined with calcium, if indicated.  Check with your physician.  -  Anthony T.</li>
    <li> After almost 3 months of taking a daily capsule, blood levels indicate &amp;#34;normal level of Vitamin  D.&amp;#34; Primary doctor was surprised and commented &amp;#34;You must have purchased the good stuff.  These quick  results are not usual.&amp;#34;  Good experience all around with this company.</li>
    <li> Great supplement , really appreciate that it&#x27;s pure quality, great price.</li>
    <li> Will post when I can evaluate more closely</li>
    <li> And started taking it yet</li>
    <li> Amazingly I could immediately feel the results.  I wish I would have started taking it sooner.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s as good as all the other D3, how can you tell?</li>
    <li> I love this one because its so easy to take and swallow no huge pill here its also a really great buy and value and as pure as you can get which is great. Its really important to take Vitamin D3 and it can help you with so many health problems . lots of doctors are says its really the most important supplement you can take I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
    <li> Fast delivery...great product...will order again!</li>
    <li> Natures True Medine Vitamin D is a high quality easy to swallow supplement.  I am very pleased with them and how I feel. I would recommend them to anyone and will buy again.</li>
    <li> It is not fair to rate this product so soon, when I have never used it before and just started to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Give me a year and then I can give you a fair result.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Item was fast to ship and arrive. Item was packaged safely. The vitamins are great, all natural so you know your not ingesting fillers or anything you don&#x27;t want. Capsules are easy to swallow too.</li>
    <li> I take a vitamin supplement but I find most pills too large. Good size and does what it needs to ....I hope. Superb delivery time!</li>
    <li> Easy to take and recommended by my doctor!</li>
    <li> My blood tests showed low vitamin D, which seemed to be causing some physical symptoms. Prescription calcitriol helped, but my levels did not come up enough. I have tried other supplements, but this one has had better results.</li>
    <li> I take this twice daily as recommended by my doctor.  I&#x27;ve used other supplements but these must absorb better because my lab level are finally within normal range and they are not at the low end they are in the middle so this is so good for my health.  I found these at a promotional price and figured i would give them a try and so glad I did. Thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product and shipping was FAST!</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my teen daughter.  Recent lab work showed a Vit. D deficiency.  So after reading up on Supplements, I decided to go with the D3.  She takes 2 per day and has noticed an increase in her energy level.  We expect the next lab report to be back to normal.  Delivery and quality of this product were excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Karen E.</li>
    <li> The vitamins are exactly as described and the shipping was fast. Great product and I appreciated the company sending out a courtesy email.</li>
    <li> Im going to take these until they are gone, my mood is so much better when I remember to take them.</li>
    <li> Love the purity aspect... will truly decide how I like these after I have had enough time to substantially test.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom because she loves taking this supplement. She swears by it. This stuff was great quality and we would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Suggested for neuromuscular pain. So far it seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> I take vitamin d daily and am very pleased with this product. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Very impressed that the co-founder of Nature’s True Medicine emailed me to follow-up on the order and my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> This is a great vitamin D supplement. Since I was diagnosed with a vitamin D deficiency I knew I would have to take something. The capsules are very small so it is easy to take and doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach! :)</li>
    <li> perfect for this winter season, I use it daily, would recommend it</li>
    <li> Love Nature&#x27;s True Medicine Vitamin D3, because of the all natural ingredients, many other products i have seen or thought about buying have many ingredients and some of which i don&#x27;t understand why they are necessary. Also some other brands don&#x27;t guarantee their product, and i was very impressed that Nature&#x27;s True Medicine offered a 100% money back guarantee, so why not try it out!!. Another reason i looked for vitamin D is because i am a vegetarian and often cannot get adequate Vitamin D from natural sources, let alone the recommended amount of Calcium but by using a Vitamin D supplement such as this it will allow me to help my body out by helping my body absorb and use the Calcium available to me to help support and maintain my bones. all around great product to recommend</li>
    <li> A couple years ago my obgyn suggested taking D3 because the average woman is low.  A friend had to help me figure out that my D3 was HURTING MY TUMMY (like up high--stomach--ouch).  So after neglecting to take it, I finally found this product.  Sounds high quality, and noooo pain.  Sticking with it.</li>
    <li> For 6 Years I&#x27;ve had a Vitamin D deficiency so I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products to help my levels go up. Vitamin D3 is the best route as it&#x27;s absorbed quicker than Vitamin D2.  I am very impressed with these! Vitamin D pills can be quite costly and I found these to be a great bargain. I thought for sure I would have to take 3 or 4 of the pills (like you do with some gummies on the market) but was pleasantly surprised when I realized that 1 bottle has 120 pills that are 2000 units per pill, which means if you only take 1 pill each day that this entire bottle will last 4 months! An astounding bargain. I was also really thankful to see the ingredient list is TINY. The way it should be.  These pills are very very small so not hard to take at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these Vitamin D3 pills.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I take a lot of supplements to stay healthy because we are seniors over 65. You need vitamin D3 because most people do not get enough sunshine daily. You need 3,000 to 5,000 units daily so we take this in one pill. This seems to work well for us and it is a great price. This product gives me the high dosage I need for this vitamin, especially in the winter months when I do not get enough sunshine. It comes in a small softgel which is easy to take daily. Recommended! It is difficult to get one&#x27;s D3 levels up into optimal levels. I don&#x27;t have to tell Swanson&#x27;s customers about the benefits of D3. I have always liked NOW products. At 5000 units per caplet, this is a good way to raise your D3 levels. At this dose one can take one every other day. This is good for people who have problems remembering to take their supplements.Thank you for providing this D3 at such a great price! I need gluten-free supplements, and this is one of them. The small gel caps are so convenient to take, too.</li>
    <li> using and love this product!  no side effects and easy to take!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I needed to take vitamin D3 because i was deficient  so I heard this brand was the best so I bought from them and love the vitamin i would recommend to everyone !  (Cathy Ware)</li>
    <li> arrived on time and was high quality .. way too expensive though</li>
    <li> Small Vitamin D capsules and it&#x27;s nice that they are organic.</li>
    <li> I love how small the gels tablets are. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great for those winter months of less sun time. Happy with this.</li>
