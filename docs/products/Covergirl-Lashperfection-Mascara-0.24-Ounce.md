      <li>I have tried other mascaras even other Covergirl mascaras and none come even close as being as good as Lashperfection!!!</li>

      <li>I am very pleasantly surprised to see that I can buy this mascara much more cheaply here on Amazon than in my local drugstore.  </li>
      <li>This has been a favorite for a long time.  </li>
      <li>It is not a dramatic difference, but it works.</li>
      <li>The new brushes do a much better job of separating the lashes and showing off each individual lash.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was nice to save a little money by ordering it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like waterproof mascara because the removal process puts too much wear and tear on the eyelashes, causing them to fall out faster.  </li>
      <li>As for making your lashes look longer and voluminous, I really can&#x27;t comment on that.  </li>
      <li>but while making my lashes look like they&#x27;re naturally very voluminious.</li>
      <li>You dont&#x27; get enough product on the wand and the wand is cheap.</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>It lengthens, doesn&#x27;t really volumize but definably defines with zero clumps.</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t notice much volume.</li>
      <li>so curling properties in a mascara usually aren&#x27;t something I look for) &amp;I&#x27;m also very particular with my mascaras &amp; it&#x27;s rare for me to repurchase one more than 1-2x, but I have repurchased Lash Perfection!&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>I have tried other volume mascaras &amp; gotten much better results.</li>
      <li>One of my new holy grail mascaras!</li>
      <li>I had been looking for this particular product but no store in my area carry it any more.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
      <li>This particular mascara does not claim to add length so if you are looking for that, you should try another mascara.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve already gone through several tubes since my original purchase here on Amazon in early 2012.</li>
      <li>Bottle runs out a little to quickly but its cheap enough that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reality is, if you don&#x27;t have the new brush, the quality of the mascara doesn&#x27;t matter, it will clump.  </li>
      <li>this, the first coat goes on very natural looking, gives just enough separation, length &amp; volume without clumps and never flakes or smudges on me(even though it is not a &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; formula).</li>
      <li>As a big fan of mascara, I&#x27;m always looking for one to make lashes really appear longer, etc.  </li>
      <li>Makes my eyes come alive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s with normal lashes (not too long/not too short - but they also have a natural curl</li>
      <li>I usually buy cheap</li>
      <li>I love this stuff even more than the expensive brands I have purchased in the past.</li>
      <li>They look long and defined, and I would say they look very natural.  </li>

<li> long lashes!!</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days now, so</li>
<li> I would go for a second or third coating but no more, which also means less likelihood of messing it up or getting clumps.</li>

<li> But if you are looking for a mascara that evenly coats and brings out already long and thick eyelashes....</li>
<li> It adheres to the lashes and makes them long and thick.  </li>
<li> I already have long and thick eyelashes</li>
<li> It came a bit dried out which I did not appreciate</li>
<li> This one was not particularly good and also seemed to dry up faster than some others.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I dont consider myself to be a makeup junkie. But i lovvee mascara. I have tried just about every mascara and this is my favorite. I already have long and thick eyelashes so Im not to crazy about volumizing and lengthening mascaras. But I do need a mascara that coats all my lashes evenly without clumping them together and making me look like a spider. The brush on this is perfect. If you are looking to add volume or length to your lashes then go for lashblast. But if you are looking for a mascara that evenly coats and brings out already long and thick eyelashes....this is the perfect one</li>
    <li> As a big fan of mascara, I&#x27;m always looking for one to make lashes really appear longer, etc.  This one was not particularly good and also seemed to dry up faster than some others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why all the rave reviews.  There is nothing special about this mascara.  The brush is pretty awful, the mascara goes on in clumps and does nothing to show off the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Maybelline Volum&#x27;Express One By One Mascara and the brush there makes all the difference.  It&#x27;s quite different from other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality is, if you don&#x27;t have the new brush, the quality of the mascara doesn&#x27;t matter, it will clump.  The new brushes do a much better job of separating the lashes and showing off each individual lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this mascara does not live up to the hype.  Clumpy, no definition. I&#x27;ll go back to the One by One.</li>
    <li> I have naturally long lashes so it takes a lot for me to be impressed with a mascara.  I was willing to try this one because it has a lot of good reviews on multiple websites and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  I bought it in very black and tried it for the first time the other day.  It went on easy and did not clump my lashes together at all.  It made them look more defined and a little longer, but nothing dramatic.  It did not really add any volume or fullness to my lashes at all.  They look long and defined, and I would say they look very natural.  This is the perfect mascara for anyone who wants a more natural look.  It won&#x27;t give you the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; lashes like the name suggests but I think it does a good job of coating each lash without sticking them together or adding unwanted clumps.  Overall, great for a natural look.</li>
    <li> I usually buy cheap mascara-- I&#x27;ll admit it. Here is where price intersects with quality and frankly I don&#x27;t think I will even try another brand or type unless this gets discontinued. Before I found Lash Perfection I would go for a second or third coating but no more, which also means less likelihood of messing it up or getting clumps. Love it!</li>
    <li> Definitly the best mascara that I have ever used! It makes my eyeshes so long and it doesnt clump at all (: BUY THIS! you will love it.</li>
    <li> I threw CG&#x27;s Lash Perfection in my Amazon shopping cart because I was a few dollars shy of the $25 that I needed for free shipping ;P  I never would have guessed it&#x27;d end up being one of my favorite mascaras that I&#x27;d come back to repurchase again!&lt;br /&gt;For reference I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s with normal lashes (not too long/not too short - but they also have a natural curl so curling properties in a mascara usually aren&#x27;t something I look for) &amp;I&#x27;m also very particular with my mascaras &amp; it&#x27;s rare for me to repurchase one more than 1-2x, but I have repurchased Lash Perfection!&lt;br /&gt;With this, the first coat goes on very natural looking, gives just enough separation, length &amp; volume without clumps and never flakes or smudges on me(even though it is not a &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; formula). BUT, I like very va va voom looking lashes (lol ;D) so I apply several coats on each eye and it gives me that flase lash look that I crave but while making my lashes look like they&#x27;re naturally very voluminious. Overall I love this mascara. It was only $5-6 and I&#x27;ve already gone through several tubes since my original purchase here on Amazon in early 2012. Highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara.  The brush does a great job of separating my lashes and not clumping.  The mascara does not smudge or flake after several hours of wearing, like some do. The brush is a good size for handling and application.  The brush handle is easy to hold, and the brush itself is good for getting into the corner lashes.  It washes off easily with soap and water, which is important for maintaining the health of your lashes.  I don&#x27;t like waterproof mascara because the removal process puts too much wear and tear on the eyelashes, causing them to fall out faster.  As for making your lashes look longer and voluminous, I really can&#x27;t comment on that.  My lashes look longer and thicker with any mascara, I guess because they are like that to begin with.  I am very pleasantly surprised to see that I can buy this mascara much more cheaply here on Amazon than in my local drugstore.  I will definitely buy it here next time.</li>
    <li> I gave this a try because I wanted something that would give me volume without clumping. I like the brush &amp; this formula didn&#x27;t clump even after a couple coats. It did a wonderful job of defining my lashes. They were separated &amp; not clumped together. However, I didn&#x27;t notice much volume. I have tried other volume mascaras &amp; gotten much better results. However, because of the definition it provided, I wasn&#x27;t totally disappointed. I just wish it had provided more volume. This particular mascara does not claim to add length so if you are looking for that, you should try another mascara.</li>
    <li> It came a bit dried out which I did not appreciate but the brush applicator is amazing!!! I love it and it really extended my lashes.</li>
    <li> Very good. I use this on a daily basis and it really has a dramatic darkening effect for my lashes so that you can actually see them. It&#x27;s also very easy to wash off and I would definitely reccomend this product!</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best I have ever used! I have long lashes and this mascara doesn&#x27;t clump and makes them look even longer!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite as I have sparse eye lashes. And this is the only one that works for me.</li>
    <li> This is a timeless mascara that proves it value every year.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could continue buying it at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> This has been a favorite for a long time.  It does not clump and goes on great.  Makes my eyes come alive.</li>
    <li> You dont&#x27; get enough product on the wand and the wand is cheap. It doesn&#x27;t spread product  well at all. Disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this particular product but no store in my area carry it any more.&lt;br /&gt;Was delighted to find it and it came quickly and was fresh.</li>
    <li> This mascara is my favorite.  It adheres to the lashes and makes them long and thick.  I have tried other mascaras even other Covergirl mascaras and none come even close as being as good as Lashperfection!!!</li>
    <li> i compared this to one of my other favorites by Korres and they came in close, gets lashes really long and then use a metal eyelash comb and woolah....long lashes!!</li>
    <li> Received, daughter likes it.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. It might take a second or two to dry, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that. It doesn&#x27;t clump for me (love the brush), and it coats my lashes really well. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days now, so not sure if it&#x27;ll dry up quickly or not. Lets hope not!</li>
    <li> One of my new holy grail mascaras! It separates beautifully for those with tangled eyelashes. It lengthens, doesn&#x27;t really volumize but definably defines with zero clumps.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve used yet!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because it seems to have disappeared off the store shelves. She and her friends absolutely love this mascara, and I don&#x27;t know what they will use now that this is no longer available. Not happy when you find something that works for you and the company decides to stop production of it.</li>
    <li> I use this mascara along with the green clump crusher also from Covergirl &amp; as a pair they are amazing! They make my blonde, long lashes look massive &amp; thick. I always get compliments &amp; people always ask what kind of mascara I use. They always seem to think it&#x27;s an expensive one but this mascara is way better than the $30 mascaras I used to buy before. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best mascara, but I was out and this was the best option for me with the price at the time. It is not a dramatic difference, but it works. I just don&#x27;t like how hard it is to take off and sometimes can be irritating after long wear.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it&#x27;s well priced.  I would say its just average as mascara goes.  It covers well but doesn&#x27;t add fullness or length.</li>
    <li> This is the go-to mascara for me. Bottle runs out a little to quickly but its cheap enough that I don&#x27;t mind. I love this stuff even more than the expensive brands I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> I love this,but it has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love Cover Girl mascaras!  Lashperfection mascara has a great brush, applies smoothly with no clumps.  It wears a long time and doesn&#x27;t smudge, run or flake.</li>
    <li> This mascara was bought for my 14 year old and she likes it just fine.  It was nice to save a little money by ordering it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a standard mascara that goes on well.  Note that it is not water proof so it does run below the eyes when eyes get wet.</li>
    <li> This product was identical to anything that I would have purchased at a brick &amp; mortar store.</li>
