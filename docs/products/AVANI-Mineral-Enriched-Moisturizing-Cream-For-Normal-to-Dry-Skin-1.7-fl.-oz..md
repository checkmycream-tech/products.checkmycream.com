<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this moisturizer.  It goes on thick and I don&#x27;t really like the fragrance, but it absorbs pretty quickly and keeps my skin hydrated all day, which is what I was looking for.  I first heard of this brand by buying the eye cream, which I would not buy again because it is not very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a fair amount of product and I think it will last quite a bit.  I might not need to use it this summer, but I&#x27;d probably buy it again for winter, if the price stays the same.</li>
    <li> The scent is a cross between cinnamon and cloves and is like 10 times stronger. You open the lid and the scent is way overpowering. With that said, it does dissapate when you rub it in and becomes tolerable. The first time applied it moisturizes. After that it is more drying than anything. I have mature dry skin. I am sending it back</li>
    <li> This is wonderful.  I have very dry skin and a few dabs on my face and I retain moisture all through the day.  It has a pleasant, not overpowering, scent, and it is not one of those products that makes you feel &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I&#x27;ve used many others but this is the best and I recommend it to everyone.  I&#x27;m about to be 50 this year and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> Great facial cream!!!</li>
    <li> Received the goods inside, apart only less than half the. Someone has used! Really bad, not the first to buy this brand!</li>
    <li> Heavy for me, so I used it as night cream.  I love the results.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> after using this line of product,Avani, my skin has improved drastically.. beat the big department stores(all the big name beauty lines) and retina products from my Dr., hands down.. my skin has not looked this good in years!! i wish i had taken a picture before i tried it.. it might not work for you, but it is a dream come true for me!!!</li>
    <li> I really like Avani Dead Sea Mineral Moisturizing cream.  It makes my skin feel soft.  I am very sensitive to facial products, but have had absolutely no problem with this cream.  I try to find scent free products when possible, but the scent with this cream is very pleasant.  I hope to use this product for a long time.  It arrived much sooner than promised, which is typical of Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend. The best pricing was found on Amazon. This moisturizing cream is terrific. A must try.</li>
    <li> Love tis product.  On my second jar.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  She has very sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t cause any reaction other than good moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is great for girls that have dry skin. I use this with the anti aging cream at night because the anti aging isn&#x27;t as moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have bought it for friends and family.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I love how well this moisturizer works, and how silky it feels on the skin during application. However, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it from Amazon. I was excited about the price, but the one I received felt like it must have been old or a bad batch. The cream was stiff and clumpy,and took awhile to smooth over and absorb into the skin. It felt similar to a moisturizer i had left on the counter for several days with the lid off...</li>
    <li> Avani makes some of the best face crime there is on earth! I love this stuff because it works and makes my skin exactly as it says it will! I would recommend this to any woman. Please give it a try.</li>
    <li> I really just love these products.  I had been struggling to find products for my lightly aging, sensitive, acne prone skin.  I have bought a ton of products, spent a ton of money and finally I found this amazing system.  These have worked wonders on my face in the past 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using them.  I can&#x27;t quit touching my skin...it&#x27;s really soft and especially the first few days after using the peel, my face felt incredibly clean all the time....even with makeup on my face felt cleaner.  My 37 year old skin is less broken out and much much much softer after using these products.&lt;br /&gt;This is what I do. I start with the Cleansing Mud Facial Gel.  I then use the Innovative Eye Firming Serum on my eyes with the Timeless Advanced Micro Crystal Serum on the rest of my face.  Let those dry a little and then top it off with the Mineral Enriched Moisterizing skin cream.  I also use Skin renewal Facial peel every 2 weeks.  I just literally got the eye firming and micro crystal serum.  They are not necessary, I just wanted to try them.  If you want to get started with this system, get the Peel and Moisterizing cream to start with.  Those are magic!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now for the skeptics....(I know because I am one).  Read my other reviews...I am a real person and I am really using these products.  I am not affiliated with Avani in anyway, I felt the need to review these products because they really are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Got into this product out in Hawaii at the International park.  Many vendors selling their wares.  Upon trying another product I went online to find this &amp; &amp;#34;walla&amp;#34; I found it.  I love it, feels like you want your face to feel.  As I said in the gel-cream. - nightly use, sparingly, such a good feel to the skin.</li>
    <li> She is a very happy camper. This is her 2nd. one  Thanks</li>
    <li> product showed up looked half empty and then dried up before could use up.</li>
    <li> I Have Sensitive Skin And Was Worried About It Breaking Me Out. I Also Have Dry Skin And Have A Have A Hard Time Finding Anything That Moisturizes Without Breaking Me Out. This Product Met My Expectations And beyond. My Skin Has Never Felt Good.</li>
    <li> Really like this for a day cream. I Just opened it up last week and there was an air pocket in the jar. After I pushed on cream, I was left with a half of jar !</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I liked it but it was new not old or used, I would recommend this product if its new,</li>
    <li> This product with the facial peel is the best ever.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so awesome! My wife uses it and I tried it under my eyes one day(i.m 37 so getting some wrinkles) and in a few day BAM what a change! it is so moisturizing and not really greasy at all. It last a long time too</li>
    <li> I always reorder. Lovely product.</li>
    <li> This cream is much too drying.  You&#x27;ll notice that even the positive reviews mention that it is &amp;#34;a little drying.&amp;#34;  If your skin feels tight after using a moisturizer, it&#x27;s time to switch to something else.</li>
    <li> I have been using this about a week.  I am hesitant to give this 5 stars, because my skin feels better but has not started looking better yet.</li>
    <li> As you know, in most cases you get what you pay for.  This product line performs and you will notice a difference with daily use. Don&#x27;t forget....any skin program is null and void if you don&#x27;t use sunscreen 365 days a year. You&#x27;re just wasting your money purchasing anything for your face if you don&#x27;t use a broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Love the way these products make my skin feel and at a price that doesn&#x27;t break the bank. I will reorder.</li>
    <li> Nice cream for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this face cream along with the hand cream and the smell made me sick. It gave me a terrible headache and my sinus&#x27;s swelled and I couldn&#x27;t breathe. I had to return them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING TO ALLERGY SUFFERS AND THOSE WITH SINUS ISSUES **********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so strong. Buyer beware!!!</li>
    <li> This is great for my dry skin!  Will order again!</li>
    <li> After you remove dead skin for a healthy glow you must moisturize and this product works well to replace the moisture in your skin for the youthful glow and healthy look. I have used many products as a cosmetologist and for my personal use. These product are among the best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and feels terrific on your skin.  As light as it is it does a wonderful job of moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have tried every face cream on the market, including creams from Dr.s.  I have never experienced&lt;br /&gt;A face cream that leaves my face smooth shiny and feeling wonderful. This product is a&lt;br /&gt;5 star plus!!  I LOVE</li>
    <li> yes...I would recommend it to my friends and to coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;love it...I will order again.&lt;br /&gt;good value for the price..</li>
    <li> I love this product not greasy very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I like and it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Use this after the facial scrub and your skin feels so smooth and good in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Beats waiting in long lines at the mall. I would definately order again. The price is right on!</li>
    <li> product. Very good lotion. Apply on face after you use the Skin Renewal Face Peel. I would recommend for guys and girls.</li>
    <li> Love this product, in less than a month of using it, my skin looks younger, and feels smoother.  Best pace to purchase it is Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the only Avani product that is probably okay that I have tried, I am sure there are much better moisturizing creams out there though...Its okay, nothing spectacular, dont waste your $.</li>
    <li> I purchased this avanti dead sea mineral moisturizing cream, makes my face feel good, does not feel greasy, a little goes a long way. I am sold on this cream, thank you.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the BOMB!  It feels like silk going on your face.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy gunky feeling. I have oily skin so I don&#x27;t&#x27; like heavy creams.  I alternate between this and the Olay 7 in one anti aging moisturizer and I love how my skin looks and feels!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> As with the anti-aging cream this product too is very thick in consistency. You do not need much to spread on your skin but it does go on rather difficult. I put it on while my face is still wet to water it down a little in order to spread it more evenly. Be careful around the eye brow as it will flatten the hair out and look really creamy. Also around the hair line of your face you have to be careful not to get any in your hair as it is thick and hard to get out. I have noticed an improvement in my skin texture but time will tell if I will order it again. If I could find something to thin it out a bit I believe I would like it more. The dead sea minerals seem to nourish my skin but again time will tell. I would say try it especially if you have chronic dry skin that flakes leaving your skin burning because this does do a good job in keeping the skin moist and smooth. I think it is just the thickness of the cream makes it less appealing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks now and I really do see a difference in my skin, especially this time of year (winter/fall) when it tends to be really dry.  I really like the cream, it&#x27;s not too thick, or greasy, it&#x27;s very light and silky when you apply it and I really think it does work.  My only issue is that the fragrance of the cream is a little strong for me, it&#x27;s a bit too perfume-y, other than that--great product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I give a bad review for an Amazon purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two Avani Dead Sea Mineral Enriched Moisturizing cream as gifts because of good reviews. I ordered early to make sure they would be delivered well ahead of holiday. The delivery is fast. When I received them, the outside Amazon box was in good condition. But after I opened the box, the package inside the box seemed to be sinked under water for at least a few days. Both package boxes for cream were wet and damaged.  One bottle was completely broken. The smell was bad and it was a complete mess. The other bottle was a little bit better but was half empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post pictures later.  I&#x27;m going to UPS to send them back. It totally wastes my time and  I have to find something else to give.</li>
    <li> I had the avani dead sea peel and this moisturizer used on me as a sample at sam&#x27;s club. Was still expensive there, and when I checked amazon, they had both products at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;I use this after the peel and love it. I feel like an indulgent (less expensive:)) little spa treatment for me!</li>
    <li> I had bought some locally and was happy to find the same product on line. I loved it. Also received in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> i love this product and the price is right very quick shipping and the package arrive in excellent packing i will be ordering this product again when i use this up...</li>
    <li> I am using this day Cream and for young skin is very good. I have a very sensitive skin and this work for me</li>
    <li> I have been using this prodct and the price is exelent ,good product it leaves the face smoth and is not grease</li>
    <li> it good, great, as good as I was expecting.  I hope my next order would be as good as the first, one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Normally I use Olay Complete but was finding it was really strange feeling and oily and not really doing it&#x27;s job so I decided to get this. Personally I am a huge fan of this now. I like the way it smells(very faint natural scent) and how it feels. The jar is only 1.7fl.oz but I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply it more than once or twice a day so it works out. Will last me a little bit. I think the price is well worth it. Had mine delivered to me in less than 24 hours but I chose one day shipping. Highly recommend if you have really flaky skin like I do. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have had other, cheaper products that worked better.  Also, did not like the feel or texture of the cream.  Too heavy.</li>
    <li> Love this product and would purchase more.  Works wonderfuly on dry skin.  I have used it daily and the results are outstanding</li>
    <li> I bought this at Sams Club and really liked it so had to find more - Amazon :)</li>
    <li> Love my Avani products,I look and feel better when I use them. I am so glad I can find them on Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> I order it for my mom and my sister too. They love it, your skin gets smoothier, and brighter !</li>
    <li> I like the quality and results</li>
    <li> This is my second jar, and I love this moisturizer! It treats my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin very well, I believe my skin looks better now than before I used this product.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer for smoothing and softening the face.</li>
    <li> I have crazy sencitive/dry skin, and face lotion has been a nightmare for me. Im almost done with my first bottle, about to order another. This stuff has worked great for me! Its very moisterizing, but does not leave any greasy residue. My dermotoligist gave it a heads up too, which is always plus.</li>
    <li> I also first bought it from Samsclub, I enjoy this moisturizing a lot and I ordered two at once.  They arrived timely, but since the package is not sealed it is hard to tell it was brand new. The plastic cap is made with cheap material, both moisturizers had leaked into the cap and solidified and as a result, some moisturizer went to waste. I love the fact it is not oily and easily absorbed.</li>
    <li> Very thick. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s legit.</li>
    <li> it so dog and smell good i really love it ....  que bien se siente y deja la piel suave y hidratante</li>
    <li> Wondeful! The price is about 3 times higher in the store!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizing cream, it is very gentle and perfect to use on your face. I noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture immediately after application. I don&#x27;t necessarily think it makes your skin \\&quot;more radiant\\&quot; as claimed on the product page, but it has definitely improved how my skin feels: it is much more smooth! The cream absorbs quickly as it is very light and it smells great (no noxious perfume in this cream thankfully! Just a mild and pleasing fragrance that dissipated soon after applying). Avani&#x27;s moisturizing cream is very effective, it lasts all day and I like that I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it to get this result. It only takes a little to go a long way, increasing the longevity of the cream and the value of the savings (I tried this on a whim seeing the Amazon sale price of $16.50).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any other Avani products, I use this with a different brand of revitalizing serum, cleanser, etc, but I am definitely pleased with this experiment. I recommend this cream for those looking for a gentle, but effective moisturizing cream. I gave some to my mother and my sister after trying it, and they also really enjoyed the product.</li>
    <li> Sam&#x27;s Club carries this product OCCASIONALLY for $40 and not the $42.85 price (for the SET: this product AND the Avani Dead Sea Skin Renewal Facial Peel).  My granddaughter plays indoor and outdoor soccer all year long in cold (St. Louis) temperatures and says the cream makes her chapped face feel so good.  I still have some at home (from Sam&#x27;s Club) which dried out some, but I just added water and it&#x27;s good as new.  We love the way it makes our skin feel WITHOUT feeling oily.</li>
    <li> I use this product after using the Avani Skin Renewal Facial Peel.  It keeps my skins soft and smoothe and hopefully it&#x27;s helped with skin lines/wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The moisturizing cream leaves my skin soft and silky to the touch.  I won&#x27;t go back to using any other moisturizer and highly recommend  it to everyone--especially those whose skin becomes dry when under stress.</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly. Product box open. Not convinced product was fresh. It was not how i remembered my last jar.</li>
    <li> I had encountered this product at Sam&#x27;s and it came along with the Avani Dead Sea Skin Renewal Peel and it hydrates and makes my skin soft after I use the peel I apply this lotion afterwards, it&#x27;s really good and helpful! Such a very good price, online on their actual website is $150 for both products and I couldn&#x27;t have found it anywhere cheaper!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and it is OK</li>
    <li> Just a small dab is all you need. You feel your skin tightening and firming, while feeling smoothed and moisturized. I am hooked for life!</li>
    <li> A good moisturizer.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or dry.  I wish it didn&#x27;t have a scent.  A great product.</li>
    <li> Great price&lt;br /&gt;Jocelyne</li>
    <li> Arrived and looks and smells like the real thing. My eczema/rosacea skin loves this moisturizer after spending hundreds on other moisturizers</li>
    <li> Sampled this at a local sam&#x27;s club and fell in love. My skin feels so soft and silky after using, and not only does it feel good, it looks good too!</li>
    <li> I thought from the reviews on this Avani moisturizing cream that it would help my dry skin.  I&#x27;m having a hard time finding something that I can use under my make-up that isn&#x27;t too greasy.  I have pretty nice skin for my age, but I have a few fine lines around my eyes and mouth, so I need moisturizer to help my make-up look smooth.  When I used this it made my make-up bead up and totally ruined it.  I had to just wipe it off and use my old moisturzier and start over.  I&#x27;m thinking about returning it or just using it at night or when I don&#x27;t wear make-up.  I actually like the smell and feel of it.  It&#x27;s just not what I wanted or needed.</li>
    <li> Bought this product originally at Sam&#x27;s. Was thrilled to find it on line for much cheaper. Love the product and the price!</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  It makes my face look so youthful and my skin feels really nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I typically use Estee or Arbonne so it may simply not be what I am used to, but this is, by far, the thickest cream I have ever used.  it is so think I can feel it on my face for hours.  There is also a perfume type fragrance.  It isn&#x27;t bad, but it is a bit strong and I want others to be aware.  If you have an aversion to perfume, you won&#x27;t like this.</li>
    <li> After 7 days of using this product It stung when I put it on. I have highly sensitive skin, along w/some hormone induced Rosecea. I think it would be a fantastic product if you have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is a great one because it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on your face.  It hydrates skin very well.</li>
    <li> I love all the avani products as whatever is in them it totally agrees with my skin. Feels alittle thick at first on but it gives my skin a boost of whatever it&#x27;s missing &amp; leaves it feeling soft &amp; added moisture, not dry &amp; scaley. Luv it!</li>
    <li> I tried this product in a sale pack I bought at Sam&#x27;s Club and fell in love.  I order it all the time. Amazing!</li>
    <li> This was a nice product but it was a little heavier then what I was looking for. I would recommend it if you have really dry skin.</li>
    <li> I like this cream only in conjuction with the peel,I have very oily skin and this cream is very heavy,it only works if you use the peel and then apply the cream after(the peel leaves your skin thirsty but sooo soft).I would not recomend it for daily use or under make up but before bed after the peel is great.</li>
    <li> I love the product and the price was great....  Paid more than that for the original at a department store.</li>
    <li> The cream is a bit greasier and heavier than I expected. It has a nice fragrance and the container is pretty. It is probably great for people with really dry skin or for people living in places with rigid winters (I am in Phoenix). I will try it as a night cream.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good moisturizer expecially in a dry climate.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as drug store brands. I won&#x27;t through it out....but just using it as body lotion.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning and it makes my skin feel very soft.  I love the whole line of Avani skin creams.</li>
    <li> My skin looks great since I have been using this cream.I have to be careful about products because some make my skin break out. No breakouts with Avani.</li>
    <li> I wrote previously giving this product 5 stars, but after a month of using I&#x27;ve begun to break out in a rash! I know it is related to this product because I tested a week without it and then with it and the rash disappeared when I stopped using and reappeared when I reapplied. I am very disappointed because previously Avani seemed like a great product and the smell was terrific. Perhaps my skin is overly sensitive or I am having an allergic reaction specific to me, but I&#x27;ve noticed this product doesn&#x27;t hydrate and much as dry out the skin and I think this might be due to an alcohol content or some other preservative in the product. Not sure since this doesn&#x27;t have all the ingredients listed. Before the rash started I began to notice that the product did not hydrate as well as it had. When I applied it my skin just felt thirsty, so I suspect that the preservatives, besides being low quality, might have expired (the bottle it had no expiration date, which is very fishy to me). Since throwing this bottle away, I&#x27;ve gone back to using my Boots No.7 and nary a rash nor dryness has reoccurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am dropping my rating of 5 stars down to 1. Sensitive or very dry skin users beware! This product may cause itching or at the very least, do nothing at all!</li>
    <li> I just spent a small fortune with Deep Sea Cosmetics and I find it&#x27;s really way over priced, they caught me in the mall.  I think I did ok on the flat iron though.  I notice these products seem to sting the skin slightly for a few seconds and the other product is the milk cleanser by Deep Sea Cosmetics.  I thought I would try this and so far I&#x27;m pleased.  I&#x27;ll be able to assess it better after I&#x27;ve used it for a while.  At least it didn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
    <li> Nice and non greasy. Works.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. When I first received this, I try using it after my shower and it made my skin soo soft. I have dry skin and when I don&#x27;t moisturize enough, it gets all weird looking like dead skin peeling off. Even if I exfoliate, a few hours later my skin feels like sand paper (not literally but you get what I mean for those with dry skin). I put some of this cream on and my skin stays fresh all day. I really recommend but make sure to check the ingredients cuz it contains some stuff that might react to sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice thick cream that takes a while to work in fully. It seems to calm skin irritations on cheeks. I would buy it all the time if it were on sale more often.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  I use it primarily before applying makeup.  It feels like it gives the surface of my skin a very smooth touch and makeup application is easier and smoother too.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream based on the reviews, though I&#x27;ve never heard of it. For the price, under $20, it was no big deal compared to all the other expensive department store creams. Currently I am pregnant and if you&#x27;ve ever been pregnant, you know the pregnant skin is either super oily or super dry. My cheeks were so dry it was flaky. I was using all kinds of creams, even Aquafor but after they wore off, the flaky skin would resurface. Now with the Avani moisturizing cream the flakiness is gone. I can wear foundation again! The cream is not greasy, but it does have a texture to it as it dries that I am not used to. After a moment my skin feels kind of like plastic. Different...but not bad. I appreciate what it&#x27;s done for my pregnant and hormone driven skin.</li>
    <li> bought it second time now...so moisturized and creamy that make skin like baby&#x27;s on the morning next day!!!!!!!So great! i will buy it for my mother as well lol</li>
    <li> I use a number of Avani products and am pleased with all of them.  I am over 65 and I am told more often than ever that I have beautiful skin.  I use this moisturizing cream, toner, the facial peel and the bar of dead sea mud for cleansing. Really good products.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I have ever used.  It works well under makeup during the day and also as a night moisturizer.</li>
