### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>E Oil - Good for lots of things.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Clove Oil - smells nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lemongrass Oil - Smells nice on Thai food.</li>
      <li>I have tried many OTC products with no results.</li>
      <li>but my baby toe is still infected ( now 12 years) and is not getting better...</li>
      <li>I love Amazon because reviews are not tampered with by companies.</li>
      <li>Read more by searching Lee dot org for &amp;#34;Zetaclear&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and I have yet to see any results or signs of the condition getting any better.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Lamisil - awesome on itchy foot but does nothing for nail fungus ( it actually is not meant to be used on the nail fungus part at all but just on the skin with the itchy part)&lt;br /&gt;ciclopirox</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and the taste is ok.</li>
      <li>I use up the spray twice as quickly as the brush-on solution, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available for separate purchase.  </li>
      <li>After having acrylic nails for many many years they caused a lot of problems with my real nails.  </li>
      <li>careful because then you can get infections easily!!!</li>
      <li>Hi, so it is true.</li>
      <li>Takes 3 months to get better, and 6 months to be completely gone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Almond Oil - nice oil for back rubs...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an OK natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.</li>
      <li>That is right there suspicious.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To start with, just look at the ingredients in ZetaClear Clear Nails Solution as mentioned on their website (in order of prevalence).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undecylenic Acid - a moderately good topical antifungal.</li>
      <li>When I ordered the first item they sent me (1) spray bottle.</li>
      <li>Zeta Clear isn&#x27;t cheap, but it does work if used as directed.</li>
      <li>The nail got better after only a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;The sides of the nail still have some brown color after a couple&lt;br /&gt;weeks and does not look to going away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and I haven&#x27;t had this kind of results</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products and this is the first one that&#x27;s really working.  </li>
      <li>This crud is now dying out and the toe is going back to a flatter, more normal shape.  </li>
      <li>But this stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>I have tried everything and really had given up...sounds like an infomercial.  </li>
      <li>Very unethical when on their website they use the phrase \\&quot;satisfaction guaranteed\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I bought two bottles at 30 bucks a pop and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Now (in August) I can see the nail growing in pink at the cuticle, just like my healthy nails.  </li>
      <li>This should be free with the topical liquid</li>
      <li>Not so much help with fungus.</li>
      <li>had any real impact on my nail fungus.</li>
      <li>clear - helps with the itchy part of your skin on your toes, does absolutely nothing for your nail fungus.</li>
      <li>ithe zeta clear seems to be working really well.  </li>
      <li>It went directly into the trash!  </li>
      <li>and you only find positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Zeta Clear does weirdly dominate the internet and fakes their own positive reviews.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to get rid of a fungal infection, but this seems to be most helpful, so would recommend.</li>
      <li>clear</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Zeta Clear combination brush-on and spray treatment since January 2011.  </li>
      <li>Use Lamisil or Zeta clear for controlling itchy parts of foot, but not fungus on nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With Zeta Clear</li>
      <li>bean oil undecenoic acid - works when used on nail fungus but takes like 1 year to completely kill off fungus&lt;</li>
      <li>I cured my big toe and second toe with the above remedy and have been fungus free since...</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
      <li>It is not clear at first that thus should be sprayed in the mounth for treating nail fungus.</li>
      <li>and I could see a different color in my big toe really fast.  </li>
      <li>In Amazon.com, under health &amp; personal, the add for Zeta Clear nail fungus shows (2) bottles of spray for $11.19.</li>
      <li>yup, expose the nail bed if you really want to kill the fungus), wear loose airy leather shoes or open toe shoes, and prepare for a long battle ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> You must file down the nail (like right down so the nail bed is almost exposed and almost bleeding...</li>
<li> I just read some other peoples reviews that state that zeta clear does not take returns unless the bottle is unopened and there is a 10 dollar restocking fee per bottle.</li>
<li> have since tried for nail fungus a few different products, and I am in no way affiliated with these companies, at the very bottom I am leaving my on personal experience with a cure that did work - filing down the nail and using a combo of tea tree oil, Gehwol Med foot spray, and castor oil acid - aka undecenoic acid.</li>
<li> What a complete and utter waste of cash.</li>
<li> based on other reviewers : only laser works, or Gehwol, or castor bean oil aka undecenoic acid ...</li>
<li> but only if you keep filing your nail down to the nail bed...</li>
<li> The topical product while decetn for an OTC, this sublingual part of the Zeta Clear is way over priced and a complete waste of money, I cant even believe its manufacutred its so poor.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d used other OTC products in the past for longer than a year and had not seen a fraction of the results I&#x27;ve seen with Zeta Clear.  </li>
<li> Buy a lifetime supply for a few bucks at your local pharmacy.</li>
<li> This is a total waste.</li>
<li> /&gt;Grapefruit seed extract - minimally helped control itch, did nothing for nails&lt;</li>
<li> on my review and my use: only product containing undecenoic acid and gehwol med foot spray, and filing the nail down obsessively to bottom of nail bed ( like 2 times a week!!)</li>
<li> I also read other reviews that say laser works.</li>
<li> br /&gt;Using bleach OR hydrogen peroxide on nail - use one or the other</li>
<li> And can be found in other products for much less.</li>
<li> Get a Vogue rechargeable nail filer so you can text with one hand while filing with the other ( just kidding about the texting!)</li>
<li> I was a little reluctant but</li>
<li> This is a waste of money.</li>
<li> One of my toenails has had a fungal infection for the past 10 years.  </li>
<li> This product does not work and the company unethically deletes negative reviews off the internet.</li>
<li> no matter what I do so far :(</li>
<li> dumb</li>
<li> Also, the oral prescribed crazy antibiotic dosage works based on other people&#x27;s reviews but careful, this is also a very dangerous remedy...</li>
<li> She told me it took at least 6 months before it started working, was very expensive and caused some troublesome side effects, so I decided against that route.  </li>
<li> but desperate times lead to dumb and desperate measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but be carefull - dangerous, toxic, and can damage integrity of your skin temporarily ...</li>
<li> - some nurses swear by this dangerous remedy of EITHER bleach or EITHER hydrogen peroxide 10% ( put it with q-tip on their nail</li>
<li> Plus you still have to wait about 90 days for the ugly toenail to grow out completly</li>
<li> Terribly inaccurate description.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A lot of promises - did not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Tamir</li>
    <li> The Amazon description for this product says to apply it to the finger nail but the actual bottle says to spray it in the mouth.     Terribly inaccurate description. Amazon should change it immediately. Unsatisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use Zetaclear to treat nail fungus. It&#x27;s a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, just look at the ingredients in ZetaClear Clear Nails Solution as mentioned on their website (in order of prevalence).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undecylenic Acid - a moderately good topical antifungal. Buy a lifetime supply for a few bucks at your local pharmacy. And can be found in other products for much less. For example: FungiCure, Fungi-Nail, Tinecide. Read more by searching Lee dot org for &amp;#34;Zetaclear&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil - It&#x27;s an OK natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal. It might help with your nail fungus but it costs $5 for 8 oz, not $30 for 0.5 oz plus shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clove Oil - smells nice. Kills fungus? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almond Oil - nice oil for back rubs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil - wha?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E Oil - Good for lots of things. But not for fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemongrass Oil - Smells nice on Thai food. Not so much help with fungus.</li>
    <li> after reading about the ingredients in the bottle that is suggested taking by mouth-I felt I would decline-but-have been using the bottle where you apply to the nails and it helps-thank you</li>
    <li> In Amazon.com, under health &amp; personal, the add for Zeta Clear nail fungus shows (2) bottles of spray for $11.19. The next add shows (1) bottle of Zeta spray for $12.99. When I ordered the first item they sent me (1) spray bottle. Amazon gave me a refund for (1) bottle. I then ordered again and the same thing happened. In order to get(2)spray bottles you have to order (2) of the (1) bottle spray add. It&#x27;s miss leading advertising. It should be corrected</li>
    <li> One of my toenails has had a fungal infection for the past 10 years.  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products and this is the first one that&#x27;s really working.  I&#x27;ve been using the Zeta Clear combination brush-on and spray treatment since January 2011.  If you have a fungal infection, you know that all products (even prescriptions) take months before you see results.  With Zeta Clear I noticed a difference after a couple of months.  Now (in August) I can see the nail growing in pink at the cuticle, just like my healthy nails.  The crud growing under the nail had reached a point where it was compressing the flesh under it into a horseshoe-like shape.  This crud is now dying out and the toe is going back to a flatter, more normal shape.  I&#x27;d used other OTC products in the past for longer than a year and had not seen a fraction of the results I&#x27;ve seen with Zeta Clear.  My sister had used a prescription treatment for one of her nails.  She told me it took at least 6 months before it started working, was very expensive and caused some troublesome side effects, so I decided against that route.  I use up the spray twice as quickly as the brush-on solution, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available for separate purchase.  Zeta Clear isn&#x27;t cheap, but it does work if used as directed.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything and really had given up...sounds like an infomercial.  But this stuff really works.  You must stay with it.  I like that it&#x27;s all natural and I could see a different color in my big toe really fast.  It only works on fungus.  If your toe has been smashed...like one of mine in a motorcycle accident and thickens...it won&#x27;t work.  This is for fungus only.</li>
    <li> It is not clear at first that thus should be sprayed in the mounth for treating nail fungus.</li>
    <li> The nail got better after only a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;The sides of the nail still have some brown color after a couple&lt;br /&gt;weeks and does not look to going away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and I have yet to see any results or signs of the condition getting any better.</li>
    <li> What a complete and utter waste of cash. The topical product while decetn for an OTC, this sublingual part of the Zeta Clear is way over priced and a complete waste of money, I cant even believe its manufacutred its so poor. This should be free with the topical liquid</li>
    <li> I have used this on a couple toe nails and it has helped out alot.  It&#x27;s hard to get rid of a fungal infection, but this seems to be most helpful, so would recommend.</li>
    <li> Who has time to apply this 3 times a day ? Plus you still have to wait about 90 days for the ugly toenail to grow out completly, I&#x27;m not saying the product won&#x27;t work, I was just hoping for a quicker fix.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money. I have tried everything and thought this just might do it. Way over priced for tea tree oil. This is a total waste.</li>
    <li> Hi, so it is true. Zeta Clear does weirdly dominate the internet and fakes their own positive reviews. This product does not work and the company unethically deletes negative reviews off the internet. Test this out. Put into google search \\&quot; Zeta Clear\\&quot; and you only find positive reviews. That is right there suspicious. I bought two bottles at 30 bucks a pop and it did absolutely nothing. I love Amazon because reviews are not tampered with by companies. I just read some other peoples reviews that state that zeta clear does not take returns unless the bottle is unopened and there is a 10 dollar restocking fee per bottle. Very unethical when on their website they use the phrase \\&quot;satisfaction guaranteed\\&quot;. I also read other reviews that say laser works. I have not used that yet.&lt;br /&gt;I have since tried for nail fungus a few different products, and I am in no way affiliated with these companies, at the very bottom I am leaving my on personal experience with a cure that did work - filing down the nail and using a combo of tea tree oil, Gehwol Med foot spray, and castor oil acid - aka undecenoic acid. You must file down the nail (like right down so the nail bed is almost exposed and almost bleeding...yup, expose the nail bed if you really want to kill the fungus), wear loose airy leather shoes or open toe shoes, and prepare for a long battle ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit seed extract - minimally helped control itch, did nothing for nails&lt;br /&gt;coffe grinds - did nothing&lt;br /&gt;gehwol med foot spray - worked but takes forever and you have to file your nail down&lt;br /&gt;blue goo nail fungus - junk - did nothing&lt;br /&gt;Lamisil - awesome on itchy foot but does nothing for nail fungus ( it actually is not meant to be used on the nail fungus part at all but just on the skin with the itchy part)&lt;br /&gt;ciclopirox ( doctor prescribed it to me) - did nothing&lt;br /&gt;Zeta clear - helps with the itchy part of your skin on your toes, does absolutely nothing for your nail fungus. booo.&lt;br /&gt;castor bean oil undecenoic acid - works when used on nail fungus but takes like 1 year to completely kill off fungus&lt;br /&gt;Using bleach OR hydrogen peroxide on nail - use one or the other NOT BOTH TOGETHER!!!!  - some nurses swear by this dangerous remedy of EITHER bleach or EITHER hydrogen peroxide 10% ( put it with q-tip on their nail and this kills EVERYTHING), because it eats away the nail, exposing the nail bed, and eventually kills the fungus. but be carefull - dangerous, toxic, and can damage integrity of your skin temporarily ...err I tried it...yeah dumb I know...but desperate times lead to dumb and desperate measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in conclusion. based on other reviewers : only laser works, or Gehwol, or castor bean oil aka undecenoic acid ...but only if you keep filing your nail down to the nail bed...careful because then you can get infections easily!!! Also, the oral prescribed crazy antibiotic dosage works based on other people&#x27;s reviews but careful, this is also a very dangerous remedy...lots of side effects.&lt;br /&gt;based on my review and my use: only product containing undecenoic acid and gehwol med foot spray, and filing the nail down obsessively to bottom of nail bed ( like 2 times a week!!) had any real impact on my nail fungus. Get a Vogue rechargeable nail filer so you can text with one hand while filing with the other ( just kidding about the texting!) Use Castor oil acid ( undecenoic acid) and tea tree in conjunction with gehwol med foot spray.  Takes 3 months to get better, and 6 months to be completely gone. Use Lamisil or Zeta clear for controlling itchy parts of foot, but not fungus on nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I cured my big toe and second toe with the above remedy and have been fungus free since...but my baby toe is still infected ( now 12 years) and is not getting better...no matter what I do so far :( I am going to post this under every zeta clear so people aren&#x27;t scammed and get proper info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please click on this review if it was helpful!</li>
    <li> waiting to see if its going to work. Not yet.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rate it as of yet.  I think it will take a while to produce results. It is easy to use and the taste is ok.</li>
    <li> This sounded like a topically applied product, but it is actually something to be taken orally.  NO WAY!!!  I rated it one star because that was the only way to write a review.  I would never recommend this product.  It went directly into the trash!  Who knows what the side effects might be if anyone ingested the stuff.</li>
    <li> This product is the only product that worked for me. I have tried many OTC products with no results. I would recommend this product to anyone having any nail fungus and or nail discoloration challenges.</li>
    <li> After having acrylic nails for many many years they caused a lot of problems with my real nails.  I was a little reluctant but ithe zeta clear seems to be working really well.  I&#x27;ve tried other products and I haven&#x27;t had this kind of results</li>
</ol>
