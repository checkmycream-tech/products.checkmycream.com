      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Her skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>After use it, my face is so clean!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s true!</li>
      <li>Most of them were very positive and I would agree for the most part.  </li>
      <li>(Clarisonic even sent me TWO free brush heads when I registered it).     </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is strictly necessary for great skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for exfoliation without using gritty scrubs that can damage the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has made my skin smooth</li>
      <li>Also, the free brush item code was usable with this product, unlike some of the brushes out there that the code was already used when the buyer called in for their free brush.  </li>
      <li>Super clean feel after using it!</li>
      <li>I have had a good experience with this product and can honestly recommend it highly to other consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It polishes as well as exfoliates your skin leaving it smooth &amp; clean.  </li>
      <li>I definitely think this is a worthwhile purchase and have been very pleased with mine</li>
      <li>The pink product is pleasant and supportive of Breast Cancer Research.</li>
      <li>I just use a rich nighttime cream and that seems to balance out any dryness.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that this has the higher speed vs the non-professional and</li>
      <li>After using it, for the first time in my life someone told me that I looked &#x27;Healthy&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I had a skin treatment with it in my skin care professional dr&#x27;s office, and they wanted $200 for it, so I was very pleased to find it at a cheaper price.  </li>
      <li>The Clarisonic (like my Sonicare toothbrush) is superior to similar items on the market.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier, faster, and probably more thorough.    </li>
      <li>The service from the buyer was quick and efficient.  </li>
      <li>The item itself is great, however, there was a brush missing from the package.  </li>
      <li>Also it seems to make washing my face FUN.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now a rare occasion when a break out occurs, rather than the norm before I started using this cleansing item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Jan 2012:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a quick and easy way to achieve professional looking results without the ongoing cost and time to go to a spa, etc.</li>
      <li>When I put the moisturizer on, It soaked right in.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that if these latest spin cleaners were available at that time, it would have definitely been a larger factor influencing my decision about spending so much on the Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>The price seems high, but as I get older, I am much more willing to spend money on my skin.  </li>
      <li>And, the pink is just lovely!</li>
      <li>After my first use, I had immediate results.</li>
      <li>Her boyfriend wants one now too!</li>
      <li>At any rate, make sure you have everything you are supposed to when you open it.  </li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>Most Clarisonics  come packaged with several samples of Clarisonic cleansers.  </li>
      <li>However, if you consider a facial at a salon can run $50 or more, the Clarisonic is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, I am glad I purchased the Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>I have been able to eliminate the expensive spa exfoliation services since purchasing the Clarisonic and had good results with my problematic skin (cystic acne).</li>
      <li>My fine lines were nearly gone, and my skin was so soft even before I put the moisturizer on.</li>
      <li>, you start on your forehead and it beeps after so many seconds deemed long enough to sufficiently clean your face.  </li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;ve used this once a week since purchase and it has been working very well for my skin, the unit itself is beginning to have issues with coming on and vibrating.</li>
      <li>so it all starts to really add up.  </li>
      <li>Different types of replacement heads/brushes are available.  </li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;ve used this once a week since purchase and it has been working very well for my skin, the unit itself is beginning to have issues with coming on and vibrating.</li>
      <li>but I really do like this product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need as much foundation now, when I put my make-up on.  </li>
      <li>However, this was recommended by my dermatologist and has worked excellent in exfoliating without making my skin like it felt as if it had been sand blasted.</li>
      <li>The free replacement head for the unit is such a bonus!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great product to really pamper your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Lee Mellottanser with my Clarisonic</li>
      <li>I bought this to reduce dry patches and to reduce fine lines.</li>
      <li>I called customer service and they offered to sell me a new one!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Also, you don&#x27;t need a lot of pressure while cleaning, just let the sonic action let your cleanser deep clean.  </li>
      <li>Although not cheap on Amazon, it was more affordable here.</li>
      <li>The battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.</li>
      <li>If you sink $200 bucks into this product, consider yourself warned that is DESIGNED TO DIE after a year so the company can sell you a new one.  </li>

      <li>My moisturizers and other skin products feel like they are working more efficiently because my pores are kept open.  </li>

      <li>You can purchase your Clarisonic for less on Amazon and if purchased new, it will come with a card to get a free skin brush and warranty.    </li>
      <li>I saw this product at a local spa and was stunned at how much it cost.</li>
      <li>It depends on what else is out on the market, the price (big factor), features, and how well it really works.</li>
      <li>Although initially it didn&#x27;t appear to be doing much, I have found that turning up the cleaning level has expedited deeper cleaning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Though most Clarisonic&#x27;s are white, the clarisonic also comes in a pretty limited edition pastel pink version with a portion of the sales ($10)going to breast cancer research and a grey version.</li>
      <li>Replacement brushes are not cheap, but it is an investment into your skin that is worth it!  </li>
      <li>If you can afford it, make this an investment purchase in your skincare regiem and you will find you need less other skincare potions to help your skin get healthy.</li>
      <li>This is the same company that puts out the sonicare toothbrush that I had been using for years, so I was swayed to try this item and haven&#x27;t regreted it, even with the hefty price tag, it is so worth it since you will not need to get a professional facial at all, if only occasionally if you choose.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have acne or any major skin issues.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: Similar to most electronics and new items on the market, since purchasing mine there have been similar less expensive over-the-counter variations available.</li>
      <li>You wet the Clarisonic brush head, apply cleanser to your skin or the brush head and gently press the brush head to your skin.</li>
      <li>but I also live in a very dry climate so that could be a contributing factor.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sorry to say this item never arrived.  I received an email message stating the item had been attempted to be delivered, and yet I never received any notification.  I attempted to contact the post office to have the item redelivered and nothing ever came of it.  So, unfortunately I can&#x27;t review this item.</li>
    <li> I had been eyeballing the Clarisonic for a few months before purchasing it and read reviews all over the web.  Most of them were very positive and I would agree for the most part.  I use the Clarisonic at least once a day and try to use it morning and evening every day.  I have noticed that my skin is much smoother and I haven&#x27;t gotten any large blemishes since I began using it (usually I would have gotten a few).  I wouldn&#x27;t say the Clarisonic is a miracle worker when it comes to my skin, however, I do think it helps, especially if you are blemish prone.  I have noticed that my skin is a little drier than normal but I also live in a very dry climate so that could be a contributing factor.  I just use a rich nighttime cream and that seems to balance out any dryness.  The price seems high, but as I get older, I am much more willing to spend money on my skin.  Overall, I am glad I purchased the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Works great!  After using it, for the first time in my life someone told me that I looked &#x27;Healthy&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Super clean feel after using it! I read on another review about not getting an extra head attachment(a $25 value) because the \\&quot;registration code had already been used\\&quot; and it&#x27;s true! I think they use ONE code and thats it. Pretty pointless to advertise it if it&#x27;s not happening. I didn&#x27;t bother to call. But the product itself is great and the speed is powerful. I like how they donate a portion to charity.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I had a skin treatment with it in my skin care professional dr&#x27;s office, and they wanted $200 for it, so I was very pleased to find it at a cheaper price.  I use it every day.  I not only helps me keep my almost 50-year-old skin soft and deep cleans it, it also works on those rough bumpy batches we all get on the back of our arms!  My face looks great.  My moisturizers and other skin products feel like they are working more efficiently because my pores are kept open.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my everyday cleanser helper.  I love the fact that this has the higher speed vs the non-professional and, it can go for 2 minutes for a longer cleaning vs only 1 minute on the non-professional.  Actually, I do a 4 minute cleansing at night; the 2 minute cycle to remove make-up and impurities (I use philosophy foaming cleanser), than another 2 minutes for my regular cleanser (I use a foaming acne product) for my congested oily skin.  Even though my skin is sensitive, it can handle this with the delicate brush head.  Also, you don&#x27;t need a lot of pressure while cleaning, just let the sonic action let your cleanser deep clean.  This is the same company that puts out the sonicare toothbrush that I had been using for years, so I was swayed to try this item and haven&#x27;t regreted it, even with the hefty price tag, it is so worth it since you will not need to get a professional facial at all, if only occasionally if you choose.  I am a cosmetologist in california and I have seen a lot of beauty items come and go, and this is a keeper.  The service from the buyer was quick and efficient.  Also, the free brush item code was usable with this product, unlike some of the brushes out there that the code was already used when the buyer called in for their free brush.  If you can afford it, make this an investment purchase in your skincare regiem and you will find you need less other skincare potions to help your skin get healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my Daughter for her birthday. She absolutely loves it! Her skin has never looked better. Her boyfriend wants one now too!</li>
    <li> I love the product and the service provided was wonderful.  Great shopping experience :-)</li>
    <li> I love the brush, it&#x27;s really nice! After use it, my face is so clean! And, the pink is just lovely! Unfortunately, I cannot apply the code to get the free brush head as amazon advertised.</li>
    <li> My wife waited a long time before purchasing the Calrisonic.  The item itself is great, however, there was a brush missing from the package.  You could see where it was supposed to go in the packaging but it was empty.  To get the brush that was supposed to be with it would have entailed mailing everything back, etc, ect.  It would have been good it customer service could have just sent us the missing part - however, I realize they are just a warehouse sending out products.  At any rate, make sure you have everything you are supposed to when you open it.  If one got missed there could be others.</li>
    <li> I saw this product at a local spa and was stunned at how much it cost. Although not cheap on Amazon, it was more affordable here. The pink product is pleasant and supportive of Breast Cancer Research. As a two time cancer survivor, every little bit helps. The Clarisonic (like my Sonicare toothbrush) is superior to similar items on the market. The timer is plus to the cleaning process. This item has multiple levels of cleaning strength which is also a plus for differences in skin type and aging. Although initially it didn&#x27;t appear to be doing much, I have found that turning up the cleaning level has expedited deeper cleaning. It&#x27;s a quick and easy way to achieve professional looking results without the ongoing cost and time to go to a spa, etc. I have had a good experience with this product and can honestly recommend it highly to other consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Similar to most electronics and new items on the market, since purchasing mine there have been similar less expensive over-the-counter variations available. I can honestly say that if these latest spin cleaners were available at that time, it would have definitely been a larger factor influencing my decision about spending so much on the Clarisonic. However, this was recommended by my dermatologist and has worked excellent in exfoliating without making my skin like it felt as if it had been sand blasted. Initially I used it several times a week, but after about 3 months of use I find that once a week works for me. I use a soft Japanese Facial brush each day when washing my face due to skin sensitivity. Will I purchase another Clarisonic when this one bites the dust? I&#x27;m not sure. It depends on what else is out on the market, the price (big factor), features, and how well it really works. I have been able to eliminate the expensive spa exfoliation services since purchasing the Clarisonic and had good results with my problematic skin (cystic acne). It&#x27;s now a rare occasion when a break out occurs, rather than the norm before I started using this cleansing item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Jan 2012: Although I&#x27;ve used this once a week since purchase and it has been working very well for my skin, the unit itself is beginning to have issues with coming on and vibrating. Not sure if it&#x27;s worn out (cause it still looks brand new), or just a charging issue. I&#x27;ll post more as things progress.before I started using this cleansing item.

    <li> The Clarisonic Skin Care Brush is an awesome tool to pamper your skin. The brush oscilates at a sonic frequency of about 300 movements per second. You wet the Clarisonic brush head, apply cleanser to your skin or the brush head and gently press the brush head to your skin. Moving the brush in circular motions Clarisonic recommends you spend 20 seconds on your forehead, 20 on your nose/chin and 10 on each cheek. A built in timer lets you know when it is time to move on to the next section. And you can set the timer for 1-2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are great! The clarisonic stimulates the skin, cleans and clarifys. It&#x27;s great for exfoliation without using gritty scrubs that can damage the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clarisonic comes with a brush head and it is recommended that you change brush heads every 4-6 months because of bacterial build up and the bristles can wear down. After each use you should also wash the brush head with a antibacterial soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback to the Clarisonic is the price. At $195 retail its not cheap. However, if you consider a facial at a salon can run $50 or more, the Clarisonic is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of models on the market today. The newer models come in the Standard and Pro Versions. The Clarisonic company likes to think of the ProVersion like it is a \\&quot;prescription\\&quot; and this is the model sold by skin care professionals, doctors offices and spas. This version has 3 timer and speed settings and two buttons to use to toggle back and forth between settings. The Standard version has only one button to use to access settings and timer and is the version commonly seen at major retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though most Clarisonic&#x27;s are white, the clarisonic also comes in a pretty limited edition pastel pink version with a portion of the sales ($10)going to breast cancer research and a grey version. Most Clarisonics  come packaged with several samples of Clarisonic cleansers.  Use with care as I have read it breaks some people out. I use Cetaphil cleanser with my Clarisonic and it&#x27;s perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase your Clarisonic for less on Amazon and if purchased new, it will come with a card to get a free skin brush and warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product to really pamper your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Lee Mellottanser with my Clarisonic and it&#x27;s perfect for me.

    <li> I definitely think this is a worthwhile purchase and have been very pleased with mine (Clarisonic even sent me TWO free brush heads when I registered it).     Like an electric toothbrush, this is a good tolol but I don&#x27;t think it is strictly necessary for great skin.  In fact, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen any differnece in the appearance of my skin since I started using it (about three months ago).  What is different is the number of steps.  Instead of exfoliating every other night, getting granules under my fingernails, and takng the time to scrub salt scrub over my body in the shower every day, I just use the brush to cleanse both my face and body.  It&#x27;s much easier, faster, and probably more thorough.    But I do think you can get similar results without the brush if you are committed to your skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, and Amazon had the best price.  Many people said if you buy from Amazon it voids the warranty.  The fix to that is when you register the product, just check that you purchased from a doctor or spa...their form does NOT ask you which doctor.  And even if you did not get a serial # they will accept your registration.    My skin is so much smoother and noticing less blackheads, which are still a problem for me at 45!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but I really do like this product.  It has made my skin smooth and I have noticed my pores have gotten smaller!!!  I do have acne and it has helped to reduce some of the zits, but I still get the occasional few.  I would have given it five stars, but it does cost quite a bit and then you have to buy the cleanser and new brush heads, etc. so it all starts to really add up.  I would recommend it and I do love the way my skin looks and feels!!!</li>
    <li> Clarisonic PRO Professional 3-power level skin care system works great!  It polishes as well as exfoliates your skin leaving it smooth &amp; clean.  I use it everyday and it works like a dream!</li>
    <li> my wife is very happy with this product, the same one they pamper you at the spa&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have noticed a clarity with my skin.  Also it seems to make washing my face FUN.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I could not live without my clarisonic toohbrush but this does not begin to compare. Just sitting under the sink... Broke me out badly</li>
    <li> This Clarisonic has totally changed my skin! Thank God....something finally had to. The device stimulates the pores, removes make-up beautifully, and evens out skin tone quite well. I don&#x27;t need as much foundation now, when I put my make-up on.  One bit of advice, if you use a facewash that truly lathers up, you only need a small drop of it on your clarisonic. If you put a lot of a lathering wash on, the foam will end up in your eyes less than half-way through the cleaning cycle... every time!   The samples of the Clarisonic wash are great. There are 3 varieties for different skin types. I might just invest in the wash from Clarisonic that is suited for me. The free replacement head for the unit is such a bonus! A TRULY GREAT BUY....HOW DID I EVER DO WITHOUT IT!?</li>
    <li> I love this skin tool! I bought this to reduce dry patches and to reduce fine lines. After my first use, I had immediate results. My fine lines were nearly gone, and my skin was so soft even before I put the moisturizer on. When I put the moisturizer on, It soaked right in. I was skeptical about this product after reading all of these reviews. I opted for the pro model because it has three power levels and the option to set the timer for two minutes instead of the standard one minute. I use a foam cleanser and the two minute setting. Before this skin tool, I didn&#x27;t wash my face regularly. I don&#x27;t have acne or any major skin issues. After using this, I can&#x27;t wait to wash my face!</li>
    <li> My Clarisonic suddenly died after a few years, and the battery is NOT RECHARGEABLE.  I did not use it every day or even every week, but it cost $200, and now retails for $225.  I called customer service and they offered to sell me a new one!  So the product is completely useless after a year or two, and the company&#x27;s solution is to sell me a new one?  Terrible product, terrible company.  If you sink $200 bucks into this product, consider yourself warned that is DESIGNED TO DIE after a year so the company can sell you a new one.  I will buy a nice brush and rotate it myself; that&#x27;s why God gave me arms.  This product would never have made it off the ground if not for Oprah (and she can afford to replace it every year).  I am steamed about this and hope this review will save one person from stretching their budget to buy this expensive piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Clarisonic for a couple of years and it has held up well after daily use.  Replacement brushes are not cheap, but it is an investment into your skin that is worth it!  The battery lasts a long time and charges quickly. I keep it in its cradle at home, but take the Clarisonic with me on some of my travels. It can be set to beep at intervals while in use so you know when to change zones on your face ---for example, you start on your forehead and it beeps after so many seconds deemed long enough to sufficiently clean your face.  You do not need to press hard on your face---let the rotating brush do its job.  Different types of replacement heads/brushes are available.  I suggest you keep the plastic cap that comes with the brush head so that it keeps dust/dirt from the environment off of it when stored in its cradle.  A friend used this product before recommending it to me, and I agree with her, it is a wise investment into your skin care.  The only teeny tiny down side at all, which would never have occurred to me, is that I had two different friends make a comment about it plugged in my bathroom, suggesting it was another type of personal device...I will spare the comment...seriously, that had never ever occurred to me! So, when I had a group of friends over, I put it in a drawer as to not send the wrong message! Don&#x27;t let that detract you, it is a terrific skin care system!</li>
