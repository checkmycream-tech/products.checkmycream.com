    <li> Last for about a month. &amp; the curl pattern isn&#x27;t consistant my cousin brought two and I got one and each wig was different</li>
    <li> Matted.  Sent it back</li>
    <li> If you ever worn this wig in th past please be aware that they have really changed the quality of it.  It appears to be made of cheap hair and is not full anymore. The picture use to do the product justice but now I don&#x27;t know who or what makes this wig.  Please do not waste your money on this unless the price drops to $19.99.</li>
    <li> more hair than I expected</li>
    <li> Nice for a synthetic wig.</li>
    <li> Ladies!!! This is the best wig I have ever wore!!! If you like big hair, try this wig. I get so many compliments own her. I love her. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one ladies!!!! I do want to add that I bought TWO.. I ordered it off Amazon and this really shocked me. I didn&#x27;t know they sold hair! It was very cheap and it comes in different colors as well. The shipping was fast and it was packed in a box that did not damage the wig. The wig comes with tape as well. I hope you get it and love it like I do.</li>
    <li> For all the women with natural afro-kinky hair, this is not the wig for you.  Whoever manufactures this wig has changed the appearance.  This wig was my favorite because it blended well with my own natural kinky, curly hair.  The new ones are thin-haired and shiny with a smaller cap.  I can&#x27;t wear the new ones because the hair is too thin, too shiny and cap is too small.  Yes, I&#x27;m complaining because I don&#x27;t want anyone else to waste money on such inferior quality.</li>
    <li> This wig has pretty curls and I really like the style. The only problem is that it&#x27;s too small for my head. My own hair is shoulder length, thick and natural so the wig didn&#x27;t fit right. I tried everything!  However, I would say &#x27;Buy It&amp;#34; because it might fit correctly on you. It&#x27;s cute!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like photograph. Totally wild looking!</li>
    <li> this wig gives me a natural look which i love , i bought two more in different colours and i get compliments  all the time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this wig a few times in the past and I can tell anyone this it&#x27;s not the same wig. It wasn&#x27;t full at all even after using products and styling.  I loved Beshe drew but this wig was horrible</li>
    <li> Hate it gets nappy to fast liked it at first now I hate it</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this wig. it fits everybody Irrespective of head size or shape of face. A good hair investment. It&#x27;s a lot of volume though but looks natural. I wish though that curls at the centre and back were as shinny and curly like the ones in front, I guess they wanted it to look very natural.&lt;br /&gt;Nice packaging!!! Quick delivery!!!</li>
    <li> after reviewing the beshe wig online. I decided to purchase it. Once it arrived it did not appear news but yet that&#x27;s what I paid for.  The wig did not have the curl pattern as seen on the packaging picture. I was very disappointed! :(</li>
    <li> Are you ready for rubbernecking and tons of compliments? Excellent quality for the price!!! I get tons of compliments and it arrived fast!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this item.  It was not like the picture.  The texture is almost &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34;.  It is not kinky.  It is &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34;.  I would caution anyone, confirm what you expect, prior to order.  Sorry, but, I expected more.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 1b over a month ago and today I am ordering the 1 (since I plan to color my hair)  Although it is a lace front I twist out some of my hair and blend with the wig in the front.  Everyone thinks it is my hair and I receive compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> this must be another version of the Drew because I&#x27;ve ordered it from other vendors and it wasn&#x27;t as big as this one.</li>
    <li> Love the big hair...styling options are endless!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the wig.  It did not look anything like the picture.  Sorry, but I couldn&#x27;t recommend this wig to anyone else.</li>
