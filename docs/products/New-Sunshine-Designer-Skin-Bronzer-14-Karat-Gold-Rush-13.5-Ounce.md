      <li>Love the color I get from this lotion</li>

      <li>Favorite tanning lotion</li>
      <li>and i have used MANY lotions.</li>
      <li>but this lotion gives you more of an orange color than a tan one.</li>
      <li>The overall look of the tan that it gives you is perfect.</li>
      <li>I have a nice tan and looks pretty!</li>
      <li>Definitely cheaper than the salon but still the same Great stuff and Great results every time!</li>
      <li>It smells good when you&#x27;re putting it on, then after tanning you smell absolutely</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing and the real deal!</li>
      <li>Plus it has collagen in it to tighten your skin and decrease fine lines.</li>
      <li>The salon charges 3 times or more for the exact product !</li>
      <li>the 14 k gold rush at the salon smells more fresh and</li>
      <li>I used to have the original 14 Karat Gold lotion</li>
      <li>Very quick and easy to apply, absorbs readily into the skin.</li>
      <li>Overall a good product</li>
      <li>Very simple and easy :)</li>
      <li>The starting smell is fine, but the after smell is something I had to make sure to go home and wash off because I couldn&#x27;t take it.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t streak, my tan is even and golden.</li>
      <li>Love the lotion smell and did a good job keeping my skin hydrated and only slight bronzer</li>
      <li>love this lotion, it not only tans you super well but leaves your skin feeling super soft!</li>
      <li>My second favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>first, the smell.</li>
      <li>Overall, I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>You might as well stop being cheap and get your money&#x27;s worth from an actual salon</li>
      <li>but really, there are several other bronzing lotions out there that are better and that will give you more of a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; looking tan, if you</li>
      <li>and there are HUGE and obvious differences.</li>
      <li>so much for the &amp;#34;plateau shattering&amp;#34; effect I was expecting.</li>
      <li>And so much cheaper then the salon .</li>
      <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than if you were to buy it from a salon.</li>
      <li>thank you so much</li>
      <li>next time I wont be so cheap</li>
      <li>Nothing has ever made me tan so fast.</li>
      <li>Great lotion to get you over plautoe of trying to get that extra bronze look for people who tan with a really good base already.</li>
      <li>One of my coworkers actually complimented me on how good it smells, but I just smelled a little burnt.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great and is sold here for less than half of the price at my tanning salon...</li>
      <li>Works really well, so much cheaper than buying in the tanning salon, like $100.00 cheaper, would totally recommend buying through Amazon</li>
      <li>Not sure product is authentic.</li>
      <li>i compared the lotion I bought online to the exact same one at the salon i use to tan</li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten pretty dark from it</li>

<li> blah, I work at a tanning salon and companies other than tanning salons are unauthorized to sell these products so they are tampered with.</li>
<li> the one at the salon was very thick and creamy, the one I bought online was extremely runny and the color seemed a little darker too.</li>
<li> until then, I will be using this sad and disgusting bottle of lotion mixed in with my old lotion just so I don&#x27;t have to waste it or deal with the hassle of sending it back.</li>
<li> I have no idea how this tanning lotion has any negative reviews.</li>
<li> All those negative reviews are from hungry business owners or employees that just want you to buy their products at ridiculous, jacked up prices.</li>
<li> ridiculous</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s kinda runny which makes me think it was either tampered with or is fake...</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Designer Skin products!</li>
<li> Within the past 1-2 years I&#x27;ve probably purchased about 5 lotions or so, and this one was probably the worst.</li>
<li> I am really disappointed with this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product,  great service provided from the seller! Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> The overall look of the tan that it gives you is perfect. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying if you use the lower level bed because it leaves you smelling burnt after you get out. The starting smell is fine, but the after smell is something I had to make sure to go home and wash off because I couldn&#x27;t take it. Overall a good product just keep that in mind when thinking about what bed your going to use.</li>
    <li> excellent tanning lotion at a great price</li>
    <li> Price and quality are a 10!</li>
    <li> I used to have the original 14 Karat Gold lotion so I thought I would try this one (the tan plateau breaking wording helped also). This lotion smells great first off and it feels like silk when you are putting it on your skin. I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten pretty dark from it and I&#x27;m so pale naturally so I would recommend it to all people. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Designer Skin products!</li>
    <li> Love the lotion smell and did a good job keeping my skin hydrated and only slight bronzer so you don&#x27;t streak, my tan is even and golden.</li>
    <li> Good product!  I like the 14 Karat Gold products.  I get really good results and their price point is fair.  I always use their products when using a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and I use this lotion myself. I have to say this lotion is amazing, smells wonderful, will not burn you, and gice tou that great bronze color you want with 1-2 uses. Plus it has collagen in it to tighten your skin and decrease fine lines.</li>
    <li> Great lotion to get you over plautoe of trying to get that extra bronze look for people who tan with a really good base already.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells gret.</li>
    <li> Very simple and easy :)</li>
    <li> i compared the lotion I bought online to the exact same one at the salon i use to tan and there are HUGE and obvious differences. first, the smell. the 14 k gold rush at the salon smells more fresh and the one I purchased online had a strange odor to it. second, the consistency. the one at the salon was very thick and creamy, the one I bought online was extremely runny and the color seemed a little darker too. in addition to the disappointing discoveries ive made about my CHEAP purchase, it doesn&#x27;t make me look any darker. so much for the &amp;#34;plateau shattering&amp;#34; effect I was expecting. next time I wont be so cheap and I will be buying from my local tanning salon, where the lotion isn&#x27;t tampered with. until then, I will be using this sad and disgusting bottle of lotion mixed in with my old lotion just so I don&#x27;t have to waste it or deal with the hassle of sending it back. ridiculous</li>
    <li> Not sure product is authentic. Color and smell do not match the salon. I even purchased the sample pack as things do change from batch to batch.... the salon was constant. What I purchased is very different.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this tanning lotion has any negative reviews. I&#x27;ve been tanning on and off for 7 years and i have used MANY lotions. This is the current lotion I am using. Nothing has ever made me tan so fast. I saw results after only one session. Someone said it makes you orange, I call bs. I did, however, buy this lotion from my tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I really love it plus I got it at a incredible price thank you so much</li>
    <li> Within the past 1-2 years I&#x27;ve probably purchased about 5 lotions or so, and this one was probably the worst. It smells good when you&#x27;re putting it on, then after tanning you smell absolutely awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but this lotion gives you more of an orange color than a tan one. My friend continues to use this lotion and I swear she looks like a carrot... (coincidence? I think not)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No but really, there are several other bronzing lotions out there that are better and that will give you more of a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; looking tan, if you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and DO NOT listen to the reviews saying you have to purchase these lotions from the salons. All those negative reviews are from hungry business owners or employees that just want you to buy their products at ridiculous, jacked up prices.</li>
    <li> Help to give me a darker tan</li>
    <li> Good tanning lotion but it&#x27;s kinda runny which makes me think it was either tampered with or is fake... gives me good results though. Maybe it&#x27;s just runny because it got exposed to heat during shipping? Still a good lotion and I got darker within two days in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Love this product smells great. Good Bronzer. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Great item. Much cheaper on Amazon than if you were to buy it from a salon.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Great tan!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Price is awesome as well!!</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed with this product. I can tan every single day and it does nothing. I will never buy this brand again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion. Love the ingredients in it, the way my skin feels after putting it on and the tan it gives me. I mix it with an intensifier and it makes it that much better. The only downside to this lotion is the after tan odor. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and notice my skin smells burnt afterwards. The lotion smells very nice though. One of my coworkers actually complimented me on how good it smells, but I just smelled a little burnt. Overall, I love this lotion. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Goes on great and feels good.</li>
    <li> Love the color I get from this lotion</li>
    <li> For everyone saying it&#x27;s perfect and blah blah, I work at a tanning salon and companies other than tanning salons are unauthorized to sell these products so they are tampered with. They refill half Of them with other or just regular lotions. You might as well stop being cheap and get your money&#x27;s worth from an actual salon</li>
    <li> Bought from Amazon it&#x27;s amazing and the real deal! Do not pay attention to salon workers or owners they tell stories so you only buy from them! The salon charges 3 times or more for the exact product ! I only buy from Amazon and no one else! The lotions are the best!</li>
    <li> Definitely cheaper than the salon but still the same Great stuff and Great results every time!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and is sold here for less than half of the price at my tanning salon...and it smells good, too!</li>
    <li> Was drug store Juergen&#x27;s lotion on the inside buyers beware. I tested against a bottle from the salon. Returned..</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!! And so much cheaper then the salon . I have a nice tan and looks pretty!</li>
    <li> Not nearly enough bronzes in this. Just like using regular lotion. Spell great though.</li>
    <li> Works really well, so much cheaper than buying in the tanning salon, like $100.00 cheaper, would totally recommend buying through Amazon</li>
    <li> My second favorite lotion. Great smell. Allows you to get a great color in just one tan,..wash your hands afterwards or&lt;br /&gt;Your palms go orange.</li>
    <li> Favorite tanning lotion</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the orange bronze look, that&#x27;s a personal preference but it does work well as far as tanning, and smells very pleasant!</li>
    <li> love this lotion, it not only tans you super well but leaves your skin feeling super soft!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! Very quick and easy to apply, absorbs readily into the skin. Will leave hands a bit orange, so make sure to have a paper towel handy. Great for fair skin - it boosts your tan but doesn&#x27;t make you look to orange.</li>
    <li> Awesome great prices supper fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Ordered on Thursday arrived on Monday from the west coast to the Midwest</li>
