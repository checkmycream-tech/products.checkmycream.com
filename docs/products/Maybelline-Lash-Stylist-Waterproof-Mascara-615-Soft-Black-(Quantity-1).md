      <li>Love it excellent product.</li>
      <li>so I was really glad to find it here!  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara&#x27;s stylist comb!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t liked anything.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to get it in the UK, but for some reason it was withdrawn.</li>
      <li>I so love this mascara, I just cant seem to find waterproof in stores.</li>
      <li>Every mascara i&#x27;ve ever tried, (if i had a dollar for every mascara i tried, i&#x27;d be a wealthy girl),</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>which is why I love the comb instead of the brush.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and do not want to be without it.  </li>
      <li>All i can say is like magic,</li>
      <li>This was my FAVORITE Mascara of all time</li>
      <li>PLEASE!!! :)</li>
      <li>Very good nice and thick like it</li>
      <li>I have not found such a great mascara since, hence buying it for the USA.</li>
      <li>Loved this mascara, bring it back!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>My eyelashes aren&#x27;t that full</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my absolute favorite mascara ever.</li>
      <li>I bought a bunch online, but it drys out quick.</li>
      <li>My order arrived quickly.   </li>
      <li>I was really excited to find this product again because it was one I had loved previously used</li>
      <li>this put a smile on her face.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it in the stores, so I ordered it online and received it right away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only kind that I really feel like separates the lashes well.</li>
      <li>I love the actual \\&quot;comb\\&quot; at the end of the wand.  </li>
      <li>This mascara was exactly as it was desribed.</li>
      <li>magic is in the the comb only brush and the waterproof formulation, which work to separate every lash for a truly fresh-faced look.</li>
      <li>I am able to coat my very blonde eyelashes without getting a gooky clotty look!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>not only did my temporarily just-curled lashes NOT go straight again, they actually curled more &amp; somehow locked in the curl!</li>
      <li>and I always end up with too much mascara on my lashes.</li>
      <li>I have straight as a board eyelashes, my biggest problem has always been getting them curled, &amp; staying curled.  </li>
      <li>If you really want this item regardless of its condition, you can order from this seller, but not me.</li>
      <li>I was sad to see that Canadian retailers stopped carrying it and was thrilled to find out it was available in the U.S. albeit at a premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The comb is the main thing I like about it.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a big health risk buying it because we don&#x27;t know how fresh it is even in unopened packaging.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>My favorite - too bad they don&#x27;t make it any more!</li>
      <li>They quit selling this product where i live</li>
      <li>after i&#x27;d spend an hour curling &amp; recurling my lashes, as soon as i&#x27;d put on mascara, the lashes would spring back straight again!  </li>
      <li>I get my lashes curled, apply this mascara, and WOW!  </li>
      <li>the package was yellowed like it was 100 years old.</li>
      <li>but when it arrived I found it to be clumpy,dry and old.  </li>
      <li>I love the formula and especially like the ease of application with the small comb-like applicator.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this mascara a number of years ago and even used it for my wedding instead of false lashes.  </li>
      <li>, i opened the package &amp; the first thing that freaked me out was the little comb,-</li>
      <li>I decided to buy this product based on all the positive previous reviews</li>
      <li>it was pretty much dried up.</li>

<li> , i opened the package &amp; the first thing that freaked me out was the little comb,-</li>
<li> I decided to buy this product based on all the positive previous reviews</li>
<li> it was pretty much dried up.</li>
<li> Extends lashes to look long and luxurious.  </li>
<li> who knows how long it has been stored this way.    </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep ordering it from amazon for as long as I can.</li>
<li> and I have a hard time finding it in stores where I live in Germany</li>
<li> Some women even accuse me of having fake lashes and are amazed when they look close enough to find they are my real lashes.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s 5 years old in the TUBE, and sold in ridiculous prices.</li>
<li> They comb to apply the mascara gets extremely clumpy</li>
<li> While she wanted Black and not soft black ...</li>
<li> Too Bad this is no longer available in stores.  </li>
<li> whatever is still sold here or circulating somewhere else is NOT FRESH</li>
<li> To expensive to get old product.</li>
<li> it could be all dried up and growing bacteria inside the tube</li>
<li> i&#x27;d never seen a mascara without the usual round brush,-</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes, (or my lashes)!&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this, for those of you who are stuck in the same rut, hesitant to try anything different yet again, do yourself a favor &amp; try this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
<li> The lash comb gets to each lash and slowly separates my lashes so they aren&#x27;t clumped together.</li>
<li> So here i was of course, skeptical, like all the other times</li>
<li> so now i&#x27;m really skeptical.  </li>
<li> so sorry and sad this was discontinued</li>
<li> Maybelline has unfortunately discontinued this mascara.  </li>
<li> I expect and would not mind minor wrinkles, but it was awful!!   </li>
<li> It was infuriating!  </li>
<li> but I was extremely disappointed.</li>

    <li> Too Bad this is no longer available in stores.  I bought a bunch online, but it drys out quick. I was still happy with product/purchase</li>
    <li> This is the BEST mascara EVER.  Extends lashes to look long and luxurious.  I&#x27;ve always received compliments on my eyes but since I started using Maybelline Lash Stylist I&#x27;ve been getting a massive amount of comments daily.  Some women even accuse me of having fake lashes and are amazed when they look close enough to find they are my real lashes.</li>
    <li> My favorite - too bad they don&#x27;t make it any more!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to find this product again because it was one I had loved previously used but when it arrived I found it to be clumpy,dry and old.  I guess it&#x27;s my fault for buying a product the manufacturer no longer makes, so I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> When I realized this mascara had been discontinued, I was SO upset..still am...I&#x27;ve been using it for years!! It&#x27;s my absolute favorite mascara ever. I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds since it was discontinued and I haven&#x27;t liked anything. This one makes my lashes curl even when I don&#x27;t use a lash curler, it separates the lashes and makes each one look thicker...which is why I love the comb instead of the brush. Why would they discontinue it?! I&#x27;ll keep ordering it from amazon for as long as I can.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and do not want to be without it.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores, so I ordered it online and received it right away.</li>
    <li> I looked in numerous stores and couldn&#x27;t find this product. I was greatly relieved and happy to find it on Amazon. I love the formula and especially like the ease of application with the small comb-like applicator.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara&#x27;s stylist comb! I am able to coat my very blonde eyelashes without getting a gooky clotty look!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I wish Maybelline would not have discontinued making it.</li>
    <li> I have straight as a board eyelashes, my biggest problem has always been getting them curled, &amp; staying curled.  Every mascara i&#x27;ve ever tried, (if i had a dollar for every mascara i tried, i&#x27;d be a wealthy girl), after i&#x27;d spend an hour curling &amp; recurling my lashes, as soon as i&#x27;d put on mascara, the lashes would spring back straight again!  I suppose it could be likened to after spending hours curling your hair, then you go out in humidity or rain.  It was infuriating!  So here i was of course, skeptical, like all the other times, i opened the package &amp; the first thing that freaked me out was the little comb,- i&#x27;d never seen a mascara without the usual round brush,- so now i&#x27;m really skeptical.  I get my lashes curled, apply this mascara, and WOW!  All i can say is like magic, not only did my temporarily just-curled lashes NOT go straight again, they actually curled more &amp; somehow locked in the curl! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes, (or my lashes)!&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this, for those of you who are stuck in the same rut, hesitant to try anything different yet again, do yourself a favor &amp; try this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This mascara is great and I have a hard time finding it in stores where I live in Germany so I was really glad to find it here!  I love the actual \\&quot;comb\\&quot; at the end of the wand.  It&#x27;s the only kind that I really feel like separates the lashes well.</li>
    <li> My order arrived quickly.   However, the package was all wrinkled, damaged and stained.   The corner of package was opened... who knows how long it has been stored this way.    I expect and would not mind minor wrinkles, but it was awful!!   If you really want this item regardless of its condition, you can order from this seller, but not me.</li>
    <li> Maybelline has unfortunately discontinued this mascara.  I have always had the best results with this mascara.  I have tried to get the same results with others, but nothing works as well as this one.</li>
    <li> so sorry and sad this was discontinued</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and was so sad when it was discontinued.  The comb is the main thing I like about it.  My eyelashes aren&#x27;t that full and I feel like this mascara helps that issue.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been looking in every drugstore trying to find this. I told her to let me give it a try. While she wanted Black and not soft black ... this put a smile on her face.  Great all around service!</li>
    <li> I wish they would bring this back to stores. I absolutely love it. The lash comb gets to each lash and slowly separates my lashes so they aren&#x27;t clumped together. My lashes look thicker and longer. I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> So i have extremely short eyelashes and nothing works. Until i found this in the store and I can&#x27;t quit using it. It has been the only thing that works. They quit selling this product where i live so i had to buy it online. If you have short eyelashes and nothing has worked for you, try this!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this mascara a number of years ago and even used it for my wedding instead of false lashes.  I was sad to see that Canadian retailers stopped carrying it and was thrilled to find out it was available in the U.S. albeit at a premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magic is in the the comb only brush and the waterproof formulation, which work to separate every lash for a truly fresh-faced look.</li>
    <li> the package was yellowed like it was 100 years old. When I went to use it,  it was pretty much dried up. To expensive to get old product.</li>
    <li> Love it excellent product. Wipe comb on Kleenex before use to avoid clumps. Very good nice and thick like it</li>
    <li> This mascara was exactly as it was desribed. I used to be able to get it in the UK, but for some reason it was withdrawn. I have not found such a great mascara since, hence buying it for the USA.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product based on all the positive previous reviews but I was extremely disappointed. They comb to apply the mascara gets extremely clumpy and I always end up with too much mascara on my lashes. The color is great and I like that it&#x27;s water proof but the application comb is where the product disappoints. I can see why this has been taken off the market.</li>
    <li> I so love this mascara, I just cant seem to find waterproof in stores. I bought two one for me and one for a friend. I always get compliments on my lashes. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Loved this mascara, bring it back!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Maybelline Lash Stylist Waterproof Mascara was the best mascara I found that would lift and separate your lashes!!..BRING IT BACK PLEASE!!! :)</li>
    <li> This was my FAVORITE Mascara of all time but this have been DISCONTINUED for 5 YEARS...Yes, 5 years!!!&lt;br /&gt;So whatever is still sold here or circulating somewhere else is NOT FRESH it&#x27;s 5 years old in the TUBE, and sold in ridiculous prices. So it&#x27;s a big health risk buying it because we don&#x27;t know how fresh it is even in unopened packaging.&lt;br /&gt;For all we know it could be all dried up and growing bacteria inside the tube then we ladies apply it on our lashes.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!! It&#x27;s the only mascara that curls and gives my lashes length and volume!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this product in any store.  Mascara does not run especially if you have allergies.  The comb separates your eyelashes and lengthens them too!</li>
