      <li>Good product, excelente seller&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>So I started researching root touch-up options on the internet and saw good reviews for this.  </li>

      <li>Good option for in-between hair colorings.  </li>

      <li>I have found and I&#x27;ve tried many!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Does a great job, I use light brown for my medium brown hair.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s holding up well, nice and moist.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful temporary hair color and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
      <li>She said it is her new best friend!  </li>
      <li>but then decided I&#x27;d better find a better option.</li>
      <li>I am recommending this product to my friends--it is much better than a spray I had tried.</li>
      <li>but I was ok with</li>
      <li>If I do get water on the hair line when I wash my face, I just reapply more.  </li>

      <li>The only thing is trying to figure out which color is best.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how many uses I will get yet.</li>
      <li>I worried about the shade, but to be honest, I just put it in my part and even if it isn&#x27;t the exact shade of brown, it&#x27;s better than the gray!  </li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair and the light brown color matched perfectly at the temples and bangs, since they are always a lighter area than the hair on the back of my head.</li>
      <li>You may want to choose one shade lighter than what your primary, underneath shade is to get a good match on the first try.</li>
      <li>I like how it is very easy and quick to use--it covers a lot of area at once if needed</li>
      <li>I can easily comb through it at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>This product did what it was suppose to do but it comes off easily if you sweat and living in the South, I sweat a lot.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>

      <li>I have light brown/ slightly reddish hair, and the light-brown marker is a perfect match.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s plastic and light weight and travels well.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, the stains wash off.</li>
      <li>If it dries up quickly, I&#x27;ll go back to using Joan Rivers Beauty Great Hair Day Fill</li>
      <li>5 days before Thanksgiving, and several parties and family get-togethers, I saw my gray roots under a bright light and was horrified.  </li>
      <li>This product looks ok, but you can&#x27;t really keep it overnight without getting stains on your pillow.</li>
      <li>IT WAS VERY HOT</li>
      <li>purchased this item a few months ago and it was great.</li>
      <li>My hair grows fast so within a week of getting my hair colored, I can begin to see the roots, particularly from the top.  </li>
      <li>This product is great when you need a quick touch up, usually I use it around my hair line just to get rid of the gray fast.  </li>
      <li>If the marker holds color for awhile, this will be my new primary method of touch ups.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and natural looking when applied.</li>
      <li>Looks Natural and washes out easily, so must be reapplied after each wash.  </li>
      <li>At just 24 I noticed a handful of white hairs popping up right on top of my head (very traumatic at my age!).</li>
      <li>Helps to bridge between coloring, which I stretch pretty far.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>The one I first bought (and which is advertised on the TouchBack web site) states it provides 60 applications.</li>
      <li>Much better price here on Amazon than what I can find locally.</li>
      <li>Easy to use but not sure if it takes more time than spray options?  </li>
      <li>Works great and completely covers the white until I wash it next.</li>
      <li>I tried this for the first time today and really like it</li>
      <li>This little item does the job nicely and extends the time one may go between hair coloring.</li>
      <li>and it really covers the area needed.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Dr. Oz for telling us about the TouchBack Marker on his show.</li>
      <li>it really serfes the pursopose of using this product even for temporary use.</li>
      <li>Choose a shade lighter than you normally would!</li>
      <li>that given the convenience that I was able to order it with other items from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for a few single strands though, I&#x27;m please and will continue to purchase as it runs out.</li>
      <li>The wide application sponge makes it easy to cover up the part line and the color blends in well.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>It stays put for the next day as long as I am sure not to get water on it.  </li>
      <li>To anyone thinking of purchasing this item:  be aware that you will receive a much smaller product than anticipated.</li>
      <li>and I have no resolution, thus far.</li>
      <li>So far I have two colors</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but Amazon has a good price.</li>
      <li>Long before the rest of my hair needs a touch up, the temples and places right in front are back to gray.</li>
      <li>This product has help me so much in that I can go several extra weeks before I have to touch up my roots.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I would use this marker right along my hairline for fear it would sweat down onto the edge of my hairline/ my face.</li>
      <li>It costs $29.95, just like normal retail on the TouchBack marker, but the product lasts a long time, even though it washes out at each shampooing.</li>
      <li>The price was a little higher than it would have been had I ordered from the manufacturer</li>
      <li>I got it for half as much from Walgreens.</li>

<li> remaining star is that this product could be more reasonably priced, I find it EXPENSIVE!!!</li>
<li> Must be careful how you apply.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had one compact for well over a year, and no sign of it being empty yet.</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t totally match my dark brown hair, but it does make the silver less pronounced and makes it look somewhat faded out.</li>
<li> AND IT DRIPPED DOWN INTO MY EYES AND BURNED.</li>
<li> Always use the little comb that come with it.  </li>
<li> I have 3 or 4 hairs (very thick and noticeably white against my medium brown hair)</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair before, so I didn&#x27;t want to start just because of a few grays.</li>
<li> that I just use the marker on each morning after I&#x27;ve dried and straightened my hair.</li>
<li> and I think it had dried out.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used the marker a few weeks now</li>

    <li> Does a great job, I use light brown for my medium brown hair.  Helps to bridge between coloring, which I stretch pretty far.&lt;br /&gt;Only remaining star is that this product could be more reasonably priced, I find it EXPENSIVE!!!</li>
    <li> This product looks ok, but you can&#x27;t really keep it overnight without getting stains on your pillow. Fortunately, the stains wash off.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I did not care for the smell or texture when applied to my hair.</li>

    <li> it really serfes the pursopose of using this product even for temporary use. and it really covers the area needed.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Colors my hair perfectly. Only used it once. Don&#x27;t know how many uses I will get yet.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work....I wanted it for my hair line and even if you use the comb and follow their instructions, it doesn&#x27;t work....the grey is still there. Covergirl mascara, in brown in the yellow tube, works better and is less expensive. I&#x27;ve also contacted the seller about returning this product and I have no resolution, thus far.</li>
    <li> This review is about the seller, not the product, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item a few months ago and it was great. The price was a little higher than it would have been had I ordered from the manufacturer but I was ok with that given the convenience that I was able to order it with other items from Amazon.  BUT.  I then repurchased last week and the item I received was half the size of what it should have been. The one I first bought (and which is advertised on the TouchBack web site) states it provides 60 applications. The product I received stated &amp;#34;30 applications.&amp;#34; This information is not provided on this page or I would never have made the purchase.

    <li> I like how it is very easy and quick to use--it covers a lot of area at once if needed</li>
    <li> This product is great when you need a quick touch up, usually I use it around my hair line just to get rid of the gray fast.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Does it says it should do...quickly/easily covers gray around sides of hair. The one issue that bothers me is the claim that one marker will last you &amp;#34;60 uses...?&amp;#34; Not even close...maybe 30 uses...and I&#x27;m a guy with shorter hair...so beware !!!</li>
    <li> Good option for in-between hair colorings.  Easy to use but not sure if it takes more time than spray options?  It&#x27;s like putting a marker on your hair!  Appreciate the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; that comes with it to avoid getting color on my part!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work so well. I&#x27;ve tried it in two different colors and the marker doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Pricey and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time today and really like it so was going to order a lot of it from Amazon prime.  Not after I saw the price. I got it for half as much from Walgreens.</li>
    <li> 5 days before Thanksgiving, and several parties and family get-togethers, I saw my gray roots under a bright light and was horrified.  I knew I could never get into my hairdresser with such short notice, and had been thinking I would have to get my hair done more often---more expensive and time-consuming.  So I started researching root touch-up options on the internet and saw good reviews for this.  I decided to give it a try, and oh my gosh, it couldn&#x27;t be easier or faster, with instantaneous results.  I didn&#x27;t like the idea of permanent color, because what if it was wrong?  I worried about the shade, but to be honest, I just put it in my part and even if it isn&#x27;t the exact shade of brown, it&#x27;s better than the gray!  Highly recommend.  This will save me a lot of time and money and now I can spend Thanksgiving weekend not feeling self-conscious  :)</li>
    <li> IT IS A GREAT COVER UP BUT ONE THING I DO NOT LIKE. IT WAS VERY HOT THAT DAY I USED IT AND IT DRIPPED DOWN INTO MY EYES AND BURNED. AFTER I READ THE INSERT IT STATED THAT IF IT GETS INTO YOUR EYES IT COULD BLIND YOU. I STILL USE IT EVERYDAY NOW THAT IT IS COLD WEATHER. IT DOES STAY UNTIL YOU WASH IT OUT AND COVER WELL. THE COMB IS GREAT AND LIFTS THE HAIR OFF OF YOUR SCALP. I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND IT THOUGH.</li>
    <li> not fully colored.it will take time..and once it touced by water,,it got removed.</li>
    <li> I have only used the TouchBack Temporary Color Marker 2 times.  Did not like it at all!  It did not cover my gray at al!  Also; tried it on dry hair and made my hair wet.  I prefer a dry coverup.  Will never use anything like this again.</li>
    <li> These makers are perfect and easy to use. I personally use it while waiting for color touch ups...when my hair is not quite long enough to color my grey hairs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my friend and she loves it.  She said it is her new best friend!  I am now going to order one for myself.</li>
    <li> At just 24 I noticed a handful of white hairs popping up right on top of my head (very traumatic at my age!). I plucked them for awhile but then decided I&#x27;d better find a better option. I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair before, so I didn&#x27;t want to start just because of a few grays. This marker works great. I have 3 or 4 hairs (very thick and noticeably white against my medium brown hair) that I just use the marker on each morning after I&#x27;ve dried and straightened my hair. I just hold a piece of paper up behind the single hair, and run the marker over it 2 or 3 times. Works great and completely covers the white until I wash it next. I&#x27;ve used the marker a few weeks now and it&#x27;s holding up well, nice and moist. I don&#x27;t think I would use this marker right along my hairline for fear it would sweat down onto the edge of my hairline/ my face. Once I go gray there, I will switch to an overall dye. This product is great for a few single strands though, I&#x27;m please and will continue to purchase as it runs out. I have light brown/ slightly reddish hair, and the light-brown marker is a perfect match.</li>
    <li> TouchBack Marker is the best solution I&#x27;ve found to those pesky areas at the temples that will not hold hair color more than a couple of weeks. Long before the rest of my hair needs a touch up, the temples and places right in front are back to gray. This little item does the job nicely and extends the time one may go between hair coloring. It&#x27;s expensive, but Amazon has a good price. The going rate on the maker&#x27;s website is $29.95. Shop around or use discount coupons, and you might get it for less, but Amazon is the best price I&#x27;ve seen. I have medium brown hair and the light brown color matched perfectly at the temples and bangs, since they are always a lighter area than the hair on the back of my head. You may want to choose one shade lighter than what your primary, underneath shade is to get a good match on the first try. If the marker holds color for awhile, this will be my new primary method of touch ups. If it dries up quickly, I&#x27;ll go back to using Joan Rivers Beauty Great Hair Day Fill In Powder w/Brush from QVC, which is actually designed to use on the scalp where hair is thinning, but I use on the hair itself. It costs $29.95, just like normal retail on the TouchBack marker, but the product lasts a long time, even though it washes out at each shampooing. I&#x27;ve had one compact for well over a year, and no sign of it being empty yet. With my hair color, the Blonde shade in Joan Rivers matches perfectly.(Her colors run really dark.) Thanks to Dr. Oz for telling us about the TouchBack Marker on his show.</li>
    <li> Works great for touching up roots when you don&#x27;t want to put hair color in. Easy to use. Lasts at least 1 year.</li>
    <li> Still getting use to this product. Must be careful how you apply. For me I have to work it in for blending for the color will stain your scalp. If you are in a hurry this product is not for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the heat but I received this product and I think it had dried out.  I think I am going to send it back!</li>
    <li> You have to keep rubbing on the hair to get the color to come out.</li>
    <li> I would have to get my roots touched up at the salon every two weeks if it were not for this great product!  Looks Natural and washes out easily, so must be reapplied after each wash.  Tips in use:  Always use the little comb that come with it.  It lifts the hair o you can touch up the root and also protects your scalp from getting marker stripes.  Move the flat side of the applicator along the comb sideways, and repeat.  Slice comb in from different angles to pick p those last few stubborn hairs. Take care to always have the same side of the comb against the skin. It does not take long to learn or to use.  But do watch out for marking the skin- then it will be obvious. I keep it in a zip-lock bag and it has lasted a while without drying up.  it&#x27;s plastic and light weight and travels well.</li>
    <li> Choose a shade lighter than you normally would!</li>
    <li> This product has help me so much in that I can go several extra weeks before I have to touch up my roots.  As recommended, I style my hair and then add the product only to the areas showing.  I can easily comb through it at the end of the day.  It stays put for the next day as long as I am sure not to get water on it.  If I do get water on the hair line when I wash my face, I just reapply more.  The only thing is trying to figure out which color is best.  So far I have two colors and I actually use both.  I am recommending this product to my friends--it is much better than a spray I had tried.</li>
    <li> not the best as advertised</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  My hair grows fast so within a week of getting my hair colored, I can begin to see the roots, particularly from the top.  This product is perfect.  The wide application sponge makes it easy to cover up the part line and the color blends in well.  It washes out but doesn&#x27;t rub off so it&#x27;s good until you shampoo your hair.  Much better price here on Amazon than what I can find locally.</li>
    <li> Poor coverage of gray hair.</li>
    <li> it does cover the gray, but is messy.  i have white hair around my hairline.  i use a comb when applying it so that the excess color doesn&#x27;t mark my face.  it doesn&#x27;t totally match my dark brown hair, but it does make the silver less pronounced and makes it look somewhat faded out.</li>
    <li> Good product, excelente seller&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful temporary hair color and it&#x27;s super easy to use. Just wash and dry your hair and apply to any noticeable gray. It lasts until your next washing and gets you through until your next permanent coloring.</li>
    <li> This product did what it was suppose to do but it comes off easily if you sweat and living in the South, I sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without.</li>
