      <li>It&#x27;s a nice bold red and it really pops!</li>

      <li>Love the color; not quite red and not quite orange!</li>
      <li>I love finding OPI on Amazon, because while I don&#x27;t usually purchase this brand for myself, I do for my family (nail polish snobs), and the price is so much better here than in the store.</li>
      <li>I love this red, I am already on my 3rd bottle :)</li>
      <li>Love this Red if you  are looking for that candy out</li>
      <li>I always top my polish with a topcoat, especially reds and darker colors to prevent color rub off on walls or paper.</li>
      <li>Love this red.</li>
      <li>My favorite red nail polish of all time!!</li>
      <li>I have had this color at salons many times and the color in the bottle was not the same.  </li>

      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>My friend absolutely loves this OPI nail color and has been looking everywhere for it.  </li>
      <li>My aunt loves it, and it came really well packaged.  </li>
      <li>Love the clear red color!</li>
      <li>The color is a true Coke can red.</li>
      <li>Seems like more than I slight variation.</li>
      <li>but no where near what the real color should be.</li>
      <li>so I had to try this new color from OPI.  </li>
      <li>just used a few coats and a top coat,so far its been around 4 days and has not chipped .This</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a pretty red and now, I have found it.</li>
      <li>It is a classic red (I guess they were going for classic coca-cola classic red... makes sense).  </li>
      <li>Coca Cola  polish will be my new go to Red.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right color for a bright red without being too flashy or dark.  </li>
      <li>The only bone I&#x27;d pick with it is that is isn&#x27;t really Coca-Cola Red</li>
      <li>I ordered this barely this weekend</li>
      <li>This color is hard if not impossible to find in stores.</li>

    <li> My roommates and I absolutely love the color, and the quality is what you&#x27;d expect from OPI</li>
    <li> This color is hard if not impossible to find in stores. The product was exactly what I expected and arrived faster than I expected</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift, and with all OPI products, it is amazing.  My aunt loves it, and it came really well packaged.  The only bone I&#x27;d pick with it is that is isn&#x27;t really Coca-Cola Red, it&#x27;s much more muted, but the color is still fantastic.  I love finding OPI on Amazon, because while I don&#x27;t usually purchase this brand for myself, I do for my family (nail polish snobs), and the price is so much better here than in the store.</li>
    <li> I love this color and was unable to find it at retail/ beauty suppliers it is as if it has been discontinued or it is a seasonal color \\&quot;any whoo\\&quot; the contrast of this OPI color (your villa or mine?) to my skin tone is great it really compliments, there is a metallic under tone in this color that you may not be able to detect from the posted image, however, try it what have you got to loose the price is right! You will thank me later, It is a big hit for me!</li>
    <li> Great color! Quick ship.</li>
    <li> Beautiful red, looks amazing on ethnic skin tones from olive complexion to mochas and everything in between, however I don&#x27;t feel it looks as popping on pale skin. The undertones of this color just don&#x27;t suit pale skin as well. Just my opinion. The color is perfection in person!! It&#x27;s a must have red</li>
    <li> Nothing not to like about it.  Perfect.  OPI has an excellent IOS app for the iPhone and IPad. Great help when trying to pick out a color.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and the person I gave this item to as a gift loved it.</li>
    <li> Perfect red color for nails</li>
    <li> FINALLY! The PERFECT red!  Loved this so much I bought it twice!</li>
    <li> Oh. My. God. Perfect formula. Opaque in one coat. Bright clear red. Stunning!!</li>
    <li> Just what my wife wanted.</li>
    <li> Great color &amp; seems to wear better than some other colors.</li>
    <li> Definitely not Coca Cola Red... Odd shade of pink. Compared it to the color at Ulta, very different. Seems like more than I slight variation.</li>
    <li> So very disappointed in the color. Here in Atlanta the Coca Cola Red is ubiquitous and the color of this polish IS NOT EVEN CLOSE !</li>
    <li> I am a Coca Cola collector so I had to try this new color from OPI.  I love it.  It&#x27;s just the right color for a bright red without being too flashy or dark.  All OPI products are great.  They have so many colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. Great service!</li>
    <li> Wow i love this color no matter what season it is this color Red will look great .This color is so vibrant by far one of the best Reds i have used,The name fits great for this polish reminds me of the color on the Coca Cola can even better. Goes on nice just used a few coats and a top coat,so far its been around 4 days and has not chipped .This Coca Cola  polish will be my new go to Red.If you like the color Red this is a must have you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great color!  Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I like this nail polish but, for some reason it coagulated just after three weeks after purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this color- a true beautiful Red.</li>
    <li> This red cream nail polish matches the Coca-Cola can perfectly. The color is a true Coke can red. The color goes on smooth and two coats is all it takes for chip resistant wear, providing you are using an OPI base coat. I always top my polish with a topcoat, especially reds and darker colors to prevent color rub off on walls or paper.</li>
    <li> Awesome color!  Item was received quickly.</li>
    <li> This color is absolutely gorgeous.  Will look good on everyone!  Hope OPI puts it in their line with favorite colors instead of just a &amp;#34;short term&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;color.</li>
    <li> Great red, very close to the others (Thrill of Brazil, New York Apple, etc), but she seems to prefer it.</li>
    <li> Love the color; not quite red and not quite orange!</li>
    <li> This polish is orange. Last time I checked, Coke cans are red. I wanted a polish with blue undertones. Not what I got.</li>
    <li> Love this color and OPI</li>
    <li> Love this color!  It&#x27;s a nice bold red and it really pops!</li>
    <li> Most beautiful, long lasting color I&#x27;ve ever used. This polish is smooth and vibrant. I love O.P.I. but this just knocks it out of the park. It&#x27;s a warm, hot red that truly goes with anything. You can dress it up or dress it down. It took 2 weeks before any chipping and that was my fault. This formula seems above and beyond the other polishes. This color is great for all seasons, any style and it compliments any skin tone. I am a huge fan!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this barely this weekend and I got it super fast!!!  Thank you, product came in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this color by the way, it&#x27;s my new favorite!!  I wanted to try something different for the summer and this is the perfect coral/rose color with a small hint of gold.  It&#x27;s so beautiful, reminds me of the barbie pink color but more natural - adult color.  Perfect!!!  Thank you and I would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Forgive me if I sound dramatic, but I&#x27;ve waited my whole life to find this perfect classic, coke red. It&#x27;s so true, so smooth, so opaque, so consistent. Bright but not obtrusive. Deserted-island choice material. Ahhh, just lovely. I would&#x27;ve easily paid more than the $8 it cost, but really glad I didn&#x27;t have to. It lives up to OPI longevity standards. Matches the color on the cans perfectly. If they&#x27;re smart, they will make this one permanent. Love love love it!</li>
    <li> My favorite red nail polish of all time!!</li>
    <li> Great color. Was hard to locate this shade local.</li>
    <li> I love this color!!! Awesome for toes!!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted! Love the clear red color!</li>
    <li> My friend absolutely loves this OPI nail color and has been looking everywhere for it.  Not only did I find it, but it was reasonably priced and it came very quickly.  My friend was so happy when I gave her the color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be shopping here again.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS--It stays on so well!</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised. Fast delivery. Product perfect</li>
    <li> Great color and came on time !</li>
    <li> Love this red. It&#x27;s CocaCola Red and it&#x27;s just perfect. I have been looking for a pretty red and now, I have found it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and very quick delivery time!</li>
    <li> Love this Red if you  are looking for that candy out Apple read this is the one, packed well for shipping, great quailty,</li>
    <li> I have had this color at salons many times and the color in the bottle was not the same.  I even had it on when i received the polish. Not even close.  It was an okay color but no where near what the real color should be. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this red, I am already on my 3rd bottle :)</li>
    <li> This color is more red that the picture shows.  It is a classic red (I guess they were going for classic coca-cola classic red... makes sense).  It goes on smooth and stays!</li>
    <li> It was darker than I expected. I thought it would be a cherry red.</li>
    <li> The greatest RED! Must have...</li>
    <li> This is a perfect shade 4 me it looks good with skin &amp; hair no matter what I wear or season it is</li>
</ol>
