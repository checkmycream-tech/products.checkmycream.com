<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This spray works great on the window screens.  Keeps the bugs away and also the nasty bees.  Kills them on the spot.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but hate dealing with Avon Ladies asking me to buy makeup I do not want, so finding Skin So Soft here is sooo much easier, quick shipping, and no headaches.</li>
    <li> third time I bought this product in as many months, loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27; ve been wanting to get some of this since mosquito&#x27;s seem to love me. It really works! It also smells good.</li>
    <li> Winter is tough on my skin, so I bought Skin So Soft to help keep my skin moisturized. I have tried every kind of lotion to help prevent and heal my dry skin with no success, but this oil really did the trick.</li>
    <li> enjoying the smell and the effect</li>
    <li> This body oil leaves my skin feeling fresh for hours after my shower. I&#x27;ve had many people ask me what scent I&#x27;m using and they are surprised when I tell them. I use it while my skin is still moist after showering; a little bit goes a long way, just a small spritz goes a long way. The oil is not greasy and dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 30 years; during the summer it keeps the mosquitoes at bay. I&#x27;ve even sprayed it on door screens to keep flys and the mosquitoes from coming in the house they do not like the scent. I understand there are other uses for it but I have to research them.</li>
    <li> the spray top if very hard to push down and it leaks so the bottle gets oily and too slippery to push down.</li>
    <li> Love this product it is so useful and the perfect size for travel. I love that I can pull the pump out and use the cap that it was sold to me in.  Leak proof and was in perfect condition upon receipt.</li>
    <li> I actually LOVE this and BUY this because my DOGS love it! Right after a bath they know they get some of this spray. I&#x27;ve read reviews and apparently this ASSISTS in the prevention of fleas and ticks! Now I have a pit bull and a chihuahua so the shorter hair may offer a difference, but try it on your skin first, see if you love it after a shower, then try it on your pet.</li>
    <li> I spent some time in Nicaragua in 1989, where the mosquitos are the size of &amp;#34;bombers&amp;#34;.  Other people in my group brought heavy duty poisonous stuff to keep the mosquitos away, and I had this.  They ended up borrowing my Avon Skin So Soft Oil because it worked better than theirs.  I never got bitten.  I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon has this, as I couldn&#x27;t find it in my small community.  Still works great and keeps my skin soft.  The scent is strong when one first applies it, but fades away and isn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It&#x27;s good for ashy skin, sunburn, bug repellent, and to make you smell good. Just be careful if you have a cat he or she might not know it&#x27;s you. This is because cats mostly go by scent.</li>
    <li> I went way too long without my Skin So Soft.. it keeps your skin so supple and soft while also repelling all kinds of insects.  Including pesky spiders the creep up and bite at night time.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does exactly as advertised.  Have used this product for many years as well as many of my family members.  Will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> My understanding is that this product can also be used as an insect repellent and that&#x27;s why I bought it. I&#x27;m not exactly sure if it has worked bc I&#x27;ve gotten bit a little bit (not as much as before). The only thing is that I can&#x27;t get over the weird smell. I use it every other day instead of every day now...</li>
    <li> Forget Avon! LOL I buy this for the no-see-ums here is south Floriduh. Controls them well and your skin benefits from not having deet on it!</li>
    <li> Perfect size to keep on hand.  Works great has a mosquito repellent and it&#x27;s not harmful...smells nice.  I recommend spraying it on yourself while you are outdoors, so that there won&#x27;t be a residue on your floors.</li>
    <li> My sister told me that when she lived in Jamaca they used this to keep bugs off and it worked.  Also, my dog breeder said to put it on their bellies, and they have not had any problems with fleas.  My sister used it on her dog and he stopped scratching.  I don&#x27;t know but it works for me and my girls.</li>
    <li> I remember this product from my childhood. It smells great and it is the best Mosquito repellant around. My back yard is a literal forest and my daughter was getting eaten alive this spring and summer until I started using Skin so soft. It worked better than the conventional bug repellants both natural and synthetic. It smells better too! I even put it on my dog! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> works great for keeping bugs and mosquitoes off..  only wished it was a litter larger size.</li>
    <li> This product shipped quickly and safely. Product is effective as a bug repellent while smelling good and leaving skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this body oil an what I love about it is that I. Rub it on after I get out out of the shower and by the end of me dressing myself the oil wears off but the smell is still on you. It&#x27;s not like those other type of body oils that you rub in and you have to rub it off with a wash cloth to get the oily feeling off of you. I truly recommended for us women. I really love it😘😘😘</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I am looking for. Its great for getting rid of ants and great for my dogs sesitive skins.</li>
    <li> Lve this oil especially when iam out in the garden as it repels bugs and smells great. I have dry skin and my skin jst drinks this in!</li>
    <li> Love the skin so soft oil; but the spray nozzle sometimes sticks and you have to pump it several times to get it going again</li>
    <li> Mosquitos hate skin so soft.  This is the best bug repellent out there and it isn&#x27;t even marketed that way!</li>
    <li> Just spent 2 weeks is Thailand along with all of the world&#x27;s mosquitoes.  Skin So Soft kept all those little buggers away from me!  It&#x27;s a winner!  And plus, I didn&#x27;t stink like DEET!</li>
    <li> Perfect for repelling fleas the natural way., if I have pups, this is the only item I will trust until old enough for bathing. I always have a bottle on hand</li>
    <li> So this recent summer I had a huge mosquito and flea attack out dogs ended up getting the fleas and unfortunately brought them in the house so we had a horrible flea infestation!!!! Not fun!!! I would wake up looking like vampires chewed me up all over my legs and feet and even neck and arms pretty much everywhere I was soo angry this whole summer I could even sleep comfortable oh the itching pain and I couldn&#x27;t go to sleep with all those chemicals from normal of woods spray so I looked up on the Internet and came across this people with my issue said they swore by this to keep them away from you at least and they where right as soon as I got this even though I must admit took a Lil to long , I sprayed it right alway and I personally hate the smell of only it smelled a little better but I dealt with it because I couldent stand another minute getting chewed up and this saved I would put it on before bed or when walking around outside or inside my house and I stopped getting bites and when I wouldn&#x27;t wear it at all I would get a bite so yeah this really works or that purpose anyways !:)</li>
    <li> I knew what i was getting i have been using this product since i was a little girl with my mom</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SPRAY! I USE IT ON MYSELF AND I ALSO USE IT ON MY SMALL MALE MORKIE BANDIT. HE HAS DRY PATCHES HE CHEWS ON AND IT HELPS HIM WITH THE ITCHING. IT IS ALSO A GREAT MOSQUITO REPELLANT FOR US BOTH!</li>
    <li> Relief is at hand.  Mosquitoes were driving us crazy.  We had used this in the past and we will never let ourselves run out of it again.  wife uses it on her scalp where she has psoriasis.  Helps the itch and flaking.</li>
    <li> The product is okay.  I purchased four bottles with the pumps, not one pump worked. I was very disappointed because I had to pour the oily liquid into my hands.</li>
    <li> Love this product I use on my dog.. I spray a couple sprays on my hands rub together then wipe my hands down my dogs cost.. She smells great and it also keeps Mosquitos off, which this product has been know for years.. It&#x27;s great for us to.. Happy customer and dog smells great!</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and it is a must.  This keeps insects away and makes my skin feel so good.  No matter where you live this should be part of your daily routine.  It is said to be a great mosquito repellent.</li>
    <li> Bought this to keep the bugs away while camping, it arrived AFTER our last camping trip, but it lasts forever and works...</li>
    <li> How easy to moisten your skin and apply a bug repellent (naturally) at the same time!  I was a bit skeptical that this would actually repel bugs, but I had heard so many people claim it worked, that I just had to give it a try!  Thankfully I was wrong with my skepticism, it REALLY worked!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, useful for sand flies but you have to remember to apply in your ankles and feet too, otherwise you will be bite were no oil. The only complaint is that is very oily and make your skin greasy.</li>
    <li> A nice product but I was hoping it would work as a bug repellent.  No such luck.</li>
    <li> Love it for a lot of reasons....I  can even clean my screens with it...as well as my skin....</li>
    <li> Great packing ,no broken bottles</li>
    <li> Yup, keeping away mosquitoes. A bit oily for me and the smell isn&#x27;t the best (just my view). The product packaging (pump, etc) still works over the course of two months.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Keeps the bugs away!</li>
    <li> This works as well as DEET to keep bugs away, without the dangers of using DEET on Your skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this to keep mosquitoes and knats away.  I should know I used a lot of Deet in the infantry in the jungles.  I guess a bonus of this product is it smells good and keeps bugs away.  This product also does what it&#x27;s called, it does make your skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Nice oil and it repels misquitos very well. Use it mostly in the summer. Don&#x27;t know whats in it but misquitos hate it.</li>
    <li> Use this for the dogs here in FL to keep them flea-free and bug-free.  Also use on myself for same reason.  Typical of Avon, the odor is very strong and cheap-smelling.  But then it&#x27;s not for the scent.....</li>
    <li> Great oil love it just what I needed for dry skin! usually use this after a great shower and it really works!</li>
    <li> Too strong of a smell for me. Does not repel fleas, in case anybody else was interested in it for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and I use for a bug spray daily in the summer.  Seems to work pretty well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I would love to order it but this company doesn&#x27;t ship to Alaska or Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;This is 2013.  ALL major shipping companies, including UPS, FedEx and USPS ship to all the 50 states.&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to support a company whose business practices are not up with the times. Get with the program!</li>
    <li> Received as described</li>
    <li> This brings back memories of my boot camp days. We actually used this for bug repellent. It did the job and it made us smell really good.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and makes your skin soft i also use it on my dogs they cant use flea medicine it keeps the bugs away.</li>
    <li> Easier to order it than find a local representative. Used the product for a long time always works to rid fleas.</li>
    <li> Works for bugs but you have to shower. Big repellent is what it is for.&lt;br /&gt;Skin so Soft?..... I can figure that out.&lt;br /&gt;4 for bug repellent&lt;br /&gt;0 for skin care</li>
    <li> This is a fresh, clean scent for  using after a shower.  It leaves a pleasant aroma which is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great mosquito repellant! I just spray it on my hands, rub it on, wherever,  and the bugs leave me alone. You don&#x27;t need to shower to \\&quot;get it off.\\&quot; It is suppose to be good for the skin. I have had dry skin my whole life, so this stuff is a Godsend!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add to this review, that I am a native Minnesotan. Some Minnesotans believe our State Bird should be the mosquito. If you have been outside in Minnesota, on a warm &amp; muggy evening, you know why. Happy exterior living!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mostly the smell I hate.  I also don&#x27;t like the stickiness.  I won&#x27;t ever buy it again.  My daughter said Avon has a better one that is also SSS.  She likes it.</li>
    <li> Have always liked Skin So Soft.</li>
    <li> Someone told us to buy this to try as a bug repellent.  We haven&#x27;t used it yet as we also bought another bug repellent that we&#x27;ve liked so far.  The product came on time and as described.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. If you have a tub, it&#x27;s a great soak. Plus, it smells good! Skin feels nice.</li>
    <li> Took this to Scotland and it beat the midges! Amazing as bug spray and doesn&#x27;t smell like DEET. As soon as midges moved in, I&#x27;d squirt a bit in my hand and spread over ears and neck and no more bites. Worked instantly.</li>
    <li> I bought this SSS for the use of keeping bugs away (a better bug spray). This works the BEST here in the south! It keeps mosquitos and gnats off better than anything else we can get at the store.</li>
    <li> Avon Skin So Soft is a great product as it not only keeps skin from drying out but as an excellent mosquito repellent. I have used it years past and noticed that I didn;t get any mosquito bites. I continue to use this great product every day and as the saying goes for your American Express Card....(Don&#x27;t Leave Home Without It)!!! This product is a 5 star and above! Love it!!</li>
    <li> my mom loves this stuff so i got it for her and she was happy so that made me happy :)</li>
    <li> I was dating a farmer and everytime I came back from visiting his place....ticks.  It may have helped..but I still had lyme this past summer!</li>
    <li> i was working in a lot of old hay and the fleas were bitting me and leaving bad itching for days. a freind told me about sss and guess what no more bites</li>
    <li> I have used Skin So Soft for many years to spray on my hummingbird feeder to keep wasps, bees, hornets etc away from my feeder so that the hummers aren&#x27;t scared away.  I know that this product is good for keeping mosquitos at bay as well but if you spray a small amount on the platform of the feeder then the bees don&#x27;t go in to drink from the feeder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for that reason alone I will always give Skin So Soft a very HIGH 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This has no effect on mosquitos thought it would be a repellentwith a nice smell , I read many times that mineral oil clogs pores and induces pimples and acne which I am prone to. Regarding softness , it does make your skin so soft ..</li>
    <li> I admit it: I don&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;like this product&amp;#34;, I find the scent to be heavy and gross. BUT... I&#x27;ve used this for years as a spray against mosquito bites &amp; I have to be honest, it works amazingly!!!! The added bonus is that my skin is really soft too! I don&#x27;t use it except during the summer when we spend our evenings outside. But it&#x27;s really great at keeping the bugs away :-)</li>
    <li> Wards off the bugs for at least an hour. Great product if you are not offended by the smell. It definitely leaves the skin greasy. But--no DEET.</li>
    <li> love it. my skin was very dry and i put it in my bath water and it solved the dry skin problem</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, surprised me. This may sound funny but, I bought this to give my dog some relief from bug bites. I&#x27;d forgotten that this works great ! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009R5B8A/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> Old stand by. Works great - even for repelling Mosquitos.</li>
    <li> Lovely product.  Smells good, feels good!  I live in AZ so dry skin is an issue I struggle with.  I don&#x27;t want greasy.  This is perfect!</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this and she is most happy with the product. She gave out several containers to friends as Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this product before but several friends and coworkers from the mid-west recommended it as a bug repellent. I bought it to use on my dog when I take her to the park to ward off mosquitos. I figured I&#x27;d try it on myself first, as a moisturizer. I like the oily feel to it. Not too heavy..perfect for the desert. I don&#x27;t really feel that the moisture lasted very long however. I feel the smell is a little potent and a little on the old lady side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest concern is that the bottle was about a quarter empty upon receipt. It was shrink wrapped in plastic this way and there didn&#x27;t appear to be any leakage from the bottle. I feel that the price of the product is reasonable enough, but I expected a full bottle.</li>
    <li> First of all, there was no sprayer.  2nd of all, it didn&#x27;t work--maybe it&#x27;s me?????  But had heard that it was a great insect repellent.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect cure all for many ills but I use it to keep the mosquitoes away and it works great.</li>
    <li> New thin stuff. So aggravating when they say original. Shipping was timely. I wonder who said SSS is perfect, we so have to ruin it.</li>
