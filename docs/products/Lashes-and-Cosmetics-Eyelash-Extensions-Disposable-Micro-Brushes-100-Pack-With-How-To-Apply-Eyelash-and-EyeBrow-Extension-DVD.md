      <li>What I am looking for is the wands that come with most growth serums in the tubes</li>
      <li>oh cute its pink!&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>but I got a way better deal at RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
      <li>These work fine.</li>
      <li>I use these for eyelash extensions, they are exactly what they are meant to be, perfect size for removing extensions from individual lashes.</li>
      <li>I bought these for crafting - and they work &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34; to apply glue to fine paper cutouts.  </li>
      <li>The application needs to be accurate, safe and adequate.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>These are absolutely useful when I apply my latisse drops!</li>
      <li>These are great for Latisse, Careprost, Bimaprost, much better than the brushes because you don&#x27;t waste product.</li>
      <li>Helps to make application precise and does not absorb too much of the precious product.</li>
      <li>Today is May 8 and there is still a good bit left.</li>
      <li>Application brushes are better than this unusual product.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and these brushes are so great for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>The brush is so tiny to apply the liquid I feel like it more pokes my eye and got more of the liquid in my eye then on my lashes.</li>
      <li>Great product able to apply glue to strips for repair much easier with the small application tip..</li>
      <li>and I needed them right away.</li>
      <li>It applies just the right amount of product</li>
      <li>Good tips,wands themselves are a bit long really don&#x27;t need to be.  </li>
      <li>Items are in good shape; packaged properly for transport, with no missing items or frayed items.</li>
      <li>Buy a bigger size for sure.</li>
      <li>Instead there is a small tip where you put the product that actually works great!  </li>
      <li>My first issue is you can&#x27;t see what you are buying based on the photos</li>
      <li>They are perfect for applying latisse as i have used these before brushes like these come with latisse in the UK, I recently moved to the US and the brushes that come with latisse in America are far too large and waste a lot of the product.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The disposable brushes for Latisse are so costly but using these is an economic way to use the product.</li>
      <li>for which a cotton swab is much too absorbent.</li>
      <li>Do not buy if your used to the latisse brushes they are super tiny on the end with a cotton like dot.</li>
      <li>I may try to find disposable lip stick brushes that are a little more sterile then the ones I found before.</li>
      <li>I squeeze just a drop into the top of Latisse and use that as a convenient little cup to apply the product.  </li>
      <li>Aw well, live and learn.</li>
      <li>This helps you waste less drops each time and get a more precise application</li>
      <li>Shipping costs were higher than actual product.</li>
      <li>I could apply latisse to them and then onto lashes, it was not a brush and not what I expected at all, it is more like a rough q-tip like product</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t use eyelash extensions, I immediately could think of a whole host of uses for them--mainly cosmetic application-related, especially serums, etc.</li>
      <li>But overall it is soft and can have other useful applications.</li>
      <li>Still, they are pretty lame and cheap.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised and will reorder these again (in a bigger quantity!)  </li>
      <li>super small.</li>
      <li>The applicator tip is soooo tiny the product barely stays on it.</li>
      <li>The tip is so small a drop of Latisse would fall right off.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t waste product like the brushes it comes with, but not sure its the most even application either.</li>

<li> I received 3 days after I ordered them and for more than less than half of the price I got my previous ones!</li>
<li> MUCH better than those hard thick brushes that come with the medicine.  </li>
<li> Shows pink in the order, but delivered white ones.</li>
<li> It does not really soak up a lot but just enough to apply.  </li>
<li> Brush is soft and round shaped.</li>
<li> I got them because other reviewers said that using them made their Latisse last longer.</li>
<li> They sell them at the gourd supplier much more expensively , and these I can afford to supply to my art students when I am teaching gourd craft!</li>
<li> This was a big waste of money.  </li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t feel like I waste product at all, as I did with the big brushes</li>
<li> I added a five star rating because the items came sooner than expected date.</li>
<li> I was finding myself with extra Latisse and no more brushes, so I ordered these applicators.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s so small that I can&#x27;t imagine an applicator or brush any smaller.</li>
<li> I ran out of my previous ones</li>
<li> It&#x27;s uses less product.</li>
<li> Pink means small.</li>
<li> The tip of the brush is just like a little bit of fuzz  </li>
<li> Definitely not very useful.</li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> Waste of money for me anyway.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t waste product.</li>
<li> , it was a waste of money for what I intended using it for</li>
<li> These are Way too small for eyelash extension services.</li>
<li> I am not sure what they are designed to do, but it is not to use to place any liquid on the lash line.</li>
<li> Also any intricate task, glue application, jewelry making, cleaning small electronics will benefit from the brush.</li>
<li> Saw someone say you could apply Latisse with these and discovered they are too small.  </li>
<li> They are way too small to hold one drop of Latisse</li>
<li> The tips on these are WAY too small.  </li>
<li> My wife says the brush itself is too small and hard to apply a drop of liquid on her eyelid or on the brush itself.  </li>
<li> and I use them for delicate craft painting and applying ink to gourds.</li>
<li> These are total crap for Latisse application.</li>
<li> Based on the picture, I was expecting to receive a thin brush- which it is not.</li>
<li> Container arrived cracked and broken into pieces.</li>
<li> Totally useless for applying Latisse product.</li>
<li> Useless purchase...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Horrible! I bought these cause I ran out of Latisse brushes. The brush is so tiny to apply the liquid I feel like it more pokes my eye and got more of the liquid in my eye then on my lashes. Do not buy if your used to the latisse brushes they are super tiny on the end with a cotton like dot. I may try to find disposable lip stick brushes that are a little more sterile then the ones I found before.</li>
    <li> I use this for my Latisse when the brushes run out.  It doesn&#x27;t waste product like the brushes it comes with, but not sure its the most even application either.</li>
    <li> Best brushes to use for lasttesse eyelash product. It&#x27;s uses less product.</li>
    <li> These will do the job but they are very cheap</li>
    <li> Works ok. It comes from china so it takes a while to arrive. I use it for lashteese.</li>
    <li> I use these to remove clients eyelash extensions. I ran out of my previous ones and I didn&#x27;t know where to order them and I needed them right away. I received 3 days after I ordered them and for more than less than half of the price I got my previous ones!</li>
    <li> These are total crap for Latisse application. My first issue is you can&#x27;t see what you are buying based on the photos so you have to go off of reviews. The tip is just too micro for lastisse. I break the rules and double dip and use the cap and still, this was a painstakely laborious task with this micro tip. What I am looking for is the wands that come with most growth serums in the tubes but they don&#x27;t sell those seperately so for now I am cutting and shapping the bristles on the orginal lastisse applicators. These might work if they were the next size or two up. Still, they are pretty lame and cheap.</li>
    <li> I didnt know that the color represents a tip size. I just thought &amp;#34; oh cute its pink!&amp;#34;. Pink means small. super small. like needles</li>
    <li> I bought these to use as disposable eyeliner pencils for my khol. They work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great for application of Latisse! Doesn&#x27;t waste product.</li>
    <li> I am giving it a one star as i ordered it on February 1st, and I am not to receive it till the 25th of march. They are perfect for applying latisse as i have used these before brushes like these come with latisse in the UK, I recently moved to the US and the brushes that come with latisse in America are far too large and waste a lot of the product. I would give these five stars if they wouldn&#x27;t take almost 2 months to arrive. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I added a five star rating because the items came sooner than expected date. Items are in good shape; packaged properly for transport, with no missing items or frayed items. Nicely presented in holding case for ease of use. Great product able to apply glue to strips for repair much easier with the small application tip..awesome.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes to apply lattise. They absorb the perfect amount of product . I have recommended these brushes to everyone that I know who use latisse.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Use in place of brushes that come with Latisse.</li>
    <li> Read reviews of others using it with their Latisse.  My wife says the brush itself is too small and hard to apply a drop of liquid on her eyelid or on the brush itself.  The bristles are smaller than a drop of liquid...  But overall it is soft and can have other useful applications.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for Latisse and they were just awful.  I am not sure what they are designed to do, but it is not to use to place any liquid on the lash line. They are garbage in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The tips on these are WAY too small.  Definitely not very useful.</li>
    <li> These brushes are ideal for applying eye lash serum . They are the perfect size and come in a nice container.</li>
    <li> I bought these for crafting - and they work &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34; to apply glue to fine paper cutouts.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again for this purpose.</li>
    <li> these are very fine and I use them for delicate craft painting and applying ink to gourds. They sell them at the gourd supplier much more expensively , and these I can afford to supply to my art students when I am teaching gourd craft!</li>
    <li> These are great for Latisse application! You can also get the generic Latisse at royalcosmetics.net</li>
    <li> Shows pink in the order, but delivered white ones. I guess there are different sizes with the different colors.</li>
    <li> Should have read the reviews more thoroughly.  Saw someone say you could apply Latisse with these and discovered they are too small.  Aw well, live and learn.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely useful when I apply my latisse drops! I have extremely sensitive skin and these brushes are so great for sensitive skin! Will buy more!</li>
    <li> I got them because other reviewers said that using them made their Latisse last longer. I have been using the same 5ml  bottle since the beginning of December. Today is May 8 and there is still a good bit left.</li>
    <li> These are Way too small for eyelash extension services.</li>
    <li> Works great for applying Latisse.  I can use just one drop and have plenty to apply to both eyes.  I squeeze just a drop into the top of Latisse and use that as a convenient little cup to apply the product.  The tip of the brush is just like a little bit of fuzz  It does not really soak up a lot but just enough to apply.  I don&#x27;t think I could use this to apply a liquid liner or actual makeup.</li>
    <li> I use these for eyelash extensions, they are exactly what they are meant to be, perfect size for removing extensions from individual lashes.</li>
    <li> I bought these for Latisse application.  Based on the picture, I was expecting to receive a thin brush- which it is not. Instead there is a small tip where you put the product that actually works great!  It applies just the right amount of product and I don&#x27;t feel like I waste product at all, as I did with the big brushes Latisse supplies for you.  I was pleasantly surprised and will reorder these again (in a bigger quantity!)  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good tips,wands themselves are a bit long really don&#x27;t need to be.  Like that they come in a container instead of a bag.</li>
    <li> Use these every day  to apply my  lash lengthening drops</li>
    <li> Love these micro brushes great for lash extensions</li>
    <li> These are great for applying Latisse.</li>
    <li> I am an ophthalmologist, so the application of Latisse to the lidline interests me.  The application needs to be accurate, safe and adequate. I was finding myself with extra Latisse and no more brushes, so I ordered these applicators.  Now I use them exclusively!  Also superb for micro makeup touchups.  Affordable.  A+++++&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Mary</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking I could apply latisse to them and then onto lashes, it was not a brush and not what I expected at all, it is more like a rough q-tip like product and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying latisse on it, it was a waste of money for what I intended using it for</li>
    <li> Bought for Latisse application ,  one tiny drop on this brush and it can be applied to both eyes. Brush is soft and round shaped.</li>
    <li> The disposable brushes for Latisse are so costly but using these is an economic way to use the product. Thanks</li>
    <li> These brushes are PERFECT for applying Latisse!  Helps to make application precise and does not absorb too much of the precious product. It&#x27;s so small that I can&#x27;t imagine an applicator or brush any smaller.</li>
    <li> They were not what I wanted and returned them.  No ones fault</li>
    <li> I use for Latisse lash growth prescription.  Applicators ran out before solution.  These work fine.</li>
    <li> Great for applying Latisse.</li>
    <li> Application brushes are better than this unusual product. Shipping costs were higher than actual product. Geesh! Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought the micro brushes to apply Latisse. The tip is so small a drop of Latisse would fall right off. Buy a bigger size for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought these to apply my eyelash serum. So far so good. I like them because you don&#x27;t have to apply a  lot of the product in order to get good coverage.</li>
    <li> This might be the best Latisse applicator but I got a way better deal at RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
    <li> Totally useless for applying Latisse product. The ones I received were also white. Waste of money for me anyway. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for lattisse/lumigan application.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t use eyelash extensions, I immediately could think of a whole host of uses for them--mainly cosmetic application-related, especially serums, etc. for which a cotton swab is much too absorbent. Also any intricate task, glue application, jewelry making, cleaning small electronics will benefit from the brush.</li>
    <li> I bought these when I saw a reviews recommending them for Latisse.  This was a big waste of money.  They are way too small to hold one drop of Latisse and you are not supposed to double dip into the cap because of spreading germs.  Useless purchase...I have no use for them...</li>
    <li> Container arrived cracked and broken into pieces.</li>
    <li> Used with Latisse product.  MUCH better than those hard thick brushes that come with the medicine.  This helps you waste less drops each time and get a more precise application</li>
    <li> I purchased this to apply my lash growing Careprost. The applicator tip is soooo tiny the product barely stays on it.</li>
    <li> These are great for Latisse, Careprost, Bimaprost, much better than the brushes because you don&#x27;t waste product.</li>
