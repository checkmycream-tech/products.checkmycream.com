      <li>I love this lotion.</li>

      <li>I was at the point where I wasn&#x27;t able to walk let alone run.</li>
      <li>Should you need to return or order more Melaleuca products</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also ecologically safe.</li>
      <li>Melaleuca Renew skin lotion is the best such product I&#x27;ve found, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I am enjoying the lotion.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Many thanks to kidalia for the best price and fast service!  </li>
      <li>Found it to be one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used with no greasiness and very quick acting.  </li>
      <li>More information can be made available - Ecogal2@gmail.com</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I ordered 2 bottles to take me through the east coast winter weather.</li>
      <li>how well it works, I can honestly say it is worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Best part is being able to bypass the MLM and order directly from Amazon at a decent price.</li>
      <li>and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I was already familiar with this product and glad to find some directly available.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy.....</li>
      <li>Great for back rubs,too.  </li>
      <li>For what it does the price is dirt cheap.  </li>
      <li>WOW, I was glad I did!  </li>
      <li>Shipped quickly, arrived w/in 48hrs.</li>
      <li>Thank-you SO much for having this product available through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This is an exceptional moisturizing lotion for dry skin.</li>
      <li>However, it is worth your time and money to find a Melaleuca representative.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 55 years old and believe me I have  gone through many.</li>
      <li>well worth the money not like anything that you can buy in the store.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I got online and found the lotion through Amazon and am still, to this day, extremely thankful that I was not only able to get it, but that the seller sent it packaged very nicely</li>
      <li>Someone gave me the Melaleuca lotion to try, I was hooked right away.</li>
      <li>I have tried many dry skin products in my 77 years, but this by far helped my Arizona parchment-dry skin the most.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no fan of MLM businesses, but they do occasionally offer something uniquely worthwhile.  </li>
      <li>I will certainly order more Renew in the future from kidalia.</li>
      <li>and it absolutely felt like heaven.</li>
      <li>I had a real problem with prescription medications and my skins reaction.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fast absorbing lotion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a rare form of eczema that started when I was 24 years old which affected the palms of my hands my fingers and the bottom of my feet.</li>
      <li>It was absolutely ruining my life at the time.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than any other body lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>so I tried it with my new tattoo~!</li>
      <li>Fantastic product for dry skin problems.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My tattoo artist recommends Renew highly</li>
      <li>This lotion spreads easily, so not much is required, is absorbed quickly yet keeps the skin moist for hours, and squelches dry itchy skin like nothing else.  </li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s far easier dealing directly with the company.</li>
      <li>My skin always feels soft.</li>
      <li>So, as I got near the end of the bottle, I called the melaleuca company for reorder and they would not allow me to order without joining their organization...</li>
      <li>My 14 month old son has had eczema all over his body since he was 4 months old.</li>
      <li>Plus, I know of someone who was virtually healed of a skin condition using Renew (psoriasis I think), and I have an elderly relative with sensitive skin who says this is the first lotion that actually helps his skin rather than irritate it.  </li>
      <li>You can buy this same size bottle of lotion direct from Melaleuca for $23.00 plus they have a contract with UPS</li>
      <li>It leaves your hands soft &amp; non-greasy, plus it actually feels like it heals my cracked hands.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s well worth trying this product, you will never got back to your previous lotion.    </li>
      <li>My hands instantly went from rough and dried to soft and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>My feet became soft and with a little treatment got to be as soft as it was before my eczema.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this product in treating my Rosacea. I had a real problem with prescription medications and my skins reaction. The Dermatologist tryed several things and the result was still the same, my skin felt like it was on fire. I was instructed to apply the Rx products in the morning and at night just before bed. Each time I would end up washing all RX products off and applying the Renew lotion and boy what a relief it was. I could actually sleep. While this does not cure my condition, it does provide a natural measure of relief in an otherwise painful, prescription world.</li>
    <li> Best lotion in the universe - amazing this does not require a Rx to purchase. There is no obnoxious perfume scent. Shipped quickly, arrived w/in 48hrs.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best lotion I have ever tried.  I wanted to let you all know that $60 for this lotion is outragous and the person selling it should be (insert blank here) You can buy this same size bottle of lotion direct from Melaleuca for $23.00 plus they have a contract with UPS so your shipping will be less through them.  The person selling this product knows what they are doing and knows that it&#x27;s wrong.  As consumer&#x27;s always do your research, especially when you are about to fork over $60 for lotion!</li>
    <li> I have tried many dry skin products in my 77 years, but this by far helped my Arizona parchment-dry skin the most. It is definitely the ingredients that make it different.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my daughters pediatrician for her severe dry skin. I was amazed after using the product for only a couple of days to see the improvement in the texture of her skin. I will continue to use this product exclusively.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry &amp; sensitve hands, I have tried just about every other lotion there is. Some of them were just alright, some left your hands greasy. Someone gave me the Melaleuca lotion to try, I was hooked right away. It leaves your hands soft &amp; non-greasy, plus it actually feels like it heals my cracked hands. The only problem was I did not want to join Melaleuca to buy this product. I was so happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> My SIL introduced me to this lotion while visiting her this past Spring in Arizona. She gave me a sample to take home and it is a wonderful lotion. I loved it so much I ordered 2 bottles to take me through the east coast winter weather. It&#x27;s a fast absorbing lotion. If you skin gets dry from summer heat or winter cold this product is for you. Even my husband uses it.    It&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s well worth trying this product, you will never got back to your previous lotion.    Enjoy.....</li>
    <li> I was already familiar with this product and glad to find some directly available.  I&#x27;m giving it for a holiday gift as well as personally using it.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It stays with me for a long time. My skin always feels soft. I would totally recommend this  lotion to anyone. I have tried a lot of lotions and this I find the best. I&#x27;m 55 years old and believe me I have  gone through many.</li>
    <li> Melaleuca Renew skin lotion is the best such product I&#x27;ve found, and I love it.  Plus, I know of someone who was virtually healed of a skin condition using Renew (psoriasis I think), and I have an elderly relative with sensitive skin who says this is the first lotion that actually helps his skin rather than irritate it.  Many thanks to kidalia for the best price and fast service!  I will certainly order more Renew in the future from kidalia.</li>
    <li> Thank-you SO much for having this product available through Amazon.  I am a breast cancer patient and it is the only lotion I could find that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin during chemo treatments.  A friend had given me a bottle at the beginning of my diagnosis.  After realizing how well it worked during chemo, I did not want to run out!  So, as I got near the end of the bottle, I called the melaleuca company for reorder and they would not allow me to order without joining their organization...even after I explained my cancer situation.  I was so upset.  The last thing a cancer patient is concerned about while go through treatments is joining some organization to buy all their products!  I just needed the lotion... nothing else!  Anyway, I got online and found the lotion through Amazon and am still, to this day, extremely thankful that I was not only able to get it, but that the seller sent it packaged very nicely and it arrived very quickly.  Thank-you for being a blessing to me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Renew Skin Lotion for about three years.  Got it from my daughter-in-law who used it on my Granddaughter.  Found it to be one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used with no greasiness and very quick acting.  When I feel dry skin coming on, 3 days of using Renew and it&#x27;s disappeared.  Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit expensive but worth it.  It&#x27;s also ecologically safe.</li>
    <li> I work in the desert doing building maintenance and pool operations.  It&#x27;s hot and dry in the summer and cold and even dryer in the winter.  Pool chemicals are not good for my hands even with latex gloves on.  I found a small sample cleaning out locker rooms and thought since it&#x27;s going to get tossed I might as well try it.  WOW, I was glad I did!  Renew is NOT greasy.  A little goes a long way. My hands instantly went from rough and dried to soft and comfortable.  I was able to drive without having to wipe off any excess.  It seems to penetrate my skin instead of just sitting on top of it. This is my 3rd bottle.  My wife can&#x27;t keep her hands off of it.  And it has no perfumy scent.  For what it does the price is dirt cheap.  Great for back rubs,too.  Try it. If you don&#x27;t like it, send it to me!  Renew is the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a rare form of eczema that started when I was 24 years old which affected the palms of my hands my fingers and the bottom of my feet. At first we thought it was athletes foot because of my exhausting running routine but after going to the doctor it turned out to be eczema. It was absolutely ruining my life at the time. My feet would get deep cuts in them because the skin was so dry and itchy. I was at the point where I wasn&#x27;t able to walk let alone run. Every lotion I tried burned so bad because of my cuts and the alcohol contained in the product. My Fiance actually got a hold of some of this lotion and it absolutely felt like heaven. My feet became soft and with a little treatment got to be as soft as it was before my eczema. I&#x27;m a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no fan of MLM businesses, but they do occasionally offer something uniquely worthwhile.  This lotion spreads easily, so not much is required, is absorbed quickly yet keeps the skin moist for hours, and squelches dry itchy skin like nothing else.  Best part is being able to bypass the MLM and order directly from Amazon at a decent price.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent skin lotion, leaving the skin soft without any greasiness  or oiliness.  It&#x27;s better than any other body lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I use it on my 3 children who suffer from eczema and this relieves their severe dry skin. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product has helped both myself and  my husband&#x27;s very dry skin. It is not greasy and does the job beautifully.</li>
    <li> At the recommendation of a friend, I bought this lotion for my son&#x27;s excema.  I was skeptical to spend a lot of money on yet another product that might now work, but after seeing firsthand how well it works, I can honestly say it is worth every penny.  It is amazing!</li>
    <li> My 14 month old son has had eczema all over his body since he was 4 months old. This lotion has made a huge difference for my son&#x27;s skin!! I will not but anything else.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional moisturizing lotion for dry skin. I would recommend it to anyone who wants an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Really good lotion well worth the money not like anything that you can buy in the store. My daughters skin condition has gone away due to this lotion</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for a skin issue i have. I believe its eczema, but who knows i have gone to a few dermatologists and thats what they say it is. This lotion is not oily at all and makes my hand very smooth. A bit expensive in my opinion, but it is worth the few dollars.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for dry skin problems. I have even tried prescription medicine and this works much much better!!! Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found Renew online!  My tattoo artist recommends Renew highly so I tried it with my new tattoo~! WOW the tattoo healed quicker than ever!  plus I also have a bit of trouble with extreme dry skin... but no longer!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Renew for a few months now.  I use it on my body, and I never get ashy.  It is fabulous!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful because the lotion immediately is absorbed into the skin. However, it is worth your time and money to find a Melaleuca representative. Should you need to return or order more Melaleuca products, it&#x27;s far easier dealing directly with the company. By the way the company is not MLM as stated incorrectly in previous post.

    <li> I am enjoying the lotion. Thank you so much. I will be placing an order again soon. I would recommend this product.</li>
