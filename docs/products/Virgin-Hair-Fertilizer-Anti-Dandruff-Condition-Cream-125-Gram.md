      <li>It REALLY!</li>
      <li>REALLY!</li>

      <li>REALLY!</li>
      <li>The outer box was old &amp; was barely holding the product inside, although the product top was still safety sealed.</li>
      <li>I love the tingly sensation you feel when you apply it and how it stops the itchiness of dry scalp.  </li>
      <li>The smell lasted until the next day, it smells of peppermint but to strong.</li>
      <li>I only use it 2 times a week because of the strong sulphur odor.  </li>
      <li>I could do without the strong peppermint scent that last for days</li>
      <li>Probably not too smart since I do not know if it is expired or not?</li>
      <li>It did provide a tingling sensation but to much tingling.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not receive virgin hair fertilizer as advertised but received virgo hair fertilizer.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Myou hair is growing and extremely healthy.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product as I have far less dandruff, My scalp is not constantly  itching and my hair is thick and looks healthy. I have recommended it to  family and friends and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> let me just say i heard alot about this product being great for hair growth. When i recevied it i thought i was gettting virgin hair fertilizer but i ended up getting virgo hair fertilizer, wtf?  After three days of using the product the dam tube the product started coming thru little holes from the tube like really? I dont get the tingiling sensation either i believe this is not the real deal. will be ordering from another company</li>
    <li> This made my head burn, I would not recommend it to anyone that is trying to grow hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about getting this product. I used it after I washed my hair and applied it after my hair had dried. It did provide a tingling sensation but to much tingling. The smell is powerful and the tingling is extremely powerful. The smell lasted until the next day, it smells of peppermint but to strong. I couldn&#x27;t take the feeling that it gave and I don&#x27;t think that I would use it again. After using it, it made my hair stick together which caused some matting and tangles. I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see anything happen for as growth but I couldn&#x27;t take the feeling on my scalp.</li>
    <li> i got this product last month and this stuff is great, i love it, i use this product about twice a wk and have noticed a difference. im natural and its helping with the process</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing all the Great reviews, so I purchased 6 of them and I am seeing my bald edges fill in, and hair sprouting up where it was real thin. Just wish it would grow faster, But I&#x27;m grateful to see results..</li>
    <li> It wAs perfect and quick delivery</li>
    <li> If you want to grow your hair this is what you need! I love it!! Makes my eyes water but grows like crazy. This is a must buy</li>
    <li> I have use this product b 4. It a great product. My clients love it. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I wear a lot of protective styles and has a problem with thinning edges.  I used this product around the edges of my hair first to see if I noticed any new hair growth.  After a week of use I notices curly sprigs of hair around my edges.  I have been using on my scalp all over when I feel itching and my hair has grown about an inch in the first month of use.  Arrival was fast and I received the product advertised.  I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Virgin Hair Fertilizer is by far the best  product I&#x27;ve found for my  thinning hair.  I love the tingling feeling it leaves along with the quick hair growth.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser. My hair was thinning out at the sides due to medication that I was taking. It is almost one year since I have been using this product  and my hair has started growing back. Thanks to Virgin Hair Fertilizer and Conditioning Cream 150G.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It has done wonders for my scalp and hair.  I wear braids and no more dandruff or itch since I started using it. It has also helped my edges thicken up. I bought it from the braid shop I went to and was trying to get it ever since and I found a fake version that is sold in beauty stores called Virgo and it is not the same so buyer beware.  I finally remembered to check Amazon and I found it.  I love it.  I ordered and just received two more and plan on ordering more to keep it stocked. Only thing is that it says 150g but you only get 125g.</li>
    <li> Why does my box say Virgo instead of Virgin? It&#x27;s suppose to have sulfur in it also....If the product says virgin on AMAZON it should say the same thing once it gets to my home, right? I can&#x27;t say if the product works or not I&#x27;m just a bit confused on the name change &amp; the ingredients.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my own fault for wasting money on this stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t make it right for them to sell it. It&#x27;s basically just petroleum jelly that they put some sort of artificial smell and something that makes your skin tingle a little bit. It made my skin red and greasy and was tough to wash out. Didnt notice any sort of positive difference and then the back end of the tube busted open and I had to toss it out. This is one of the more obvious review fakers, but I gave it a chance out of desperation. Please don&#x27;t do the same.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT HAS REALL GROWN MY HAIR I HADE NON ON THE SIDE MY HAIR IS DOWN TO MY SHOULDER NOW LOVE IT AND WILL BUY IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> The package was in very poor content, but I like the way it makes your head feel cool when applied.</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with this product! I have no idea what I would do without it! I apply it to my scalp every other day because I have short natural hair that I would really love to grow out. When I started out my hair was about 2 1/2 inches long. After about 3 month my hair was about 6 in the front and 5 in the back. My favorite part about is the the tingling, cool feeling after its applied. I think this product works best with the supplement hairfinity because one of it main side effects is and itchy scalp but with Virgin I don&#x27;t have it anymore. The only thing I dont like is when I put in on around that time of the month. When I say every smell irritates me, its just crazy. So yeah when its that time of the month i cant stand the smell. Other than that I love this product.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for a month or so for the hair at the nape of my neck. I recently experienced a lot of breakage in that area so I decided to start over and shave the hair off. I use this product once a week after i shampoo my hair and so far ive gotten an inch of new growth since i cut all the hair off a month ago. Ive noticed that the hair is coming back in thicker and stronger than it was before I cut it. Im going to keep using this product forever because i love the way it stimulates my scalp</li>
    <li> I was given this product years ago by a stylist I used to frequent...My stylists moved and I was not longer able to get this product so I was &amp;#34;over the moon&amp;#34; when I found this product on amazon.  Make sure you purchase this product from this vendor because there are immitation Virgin products out there.  You know its good if others are immitating the product and its packaging.  It is highly effective in helping hair grow thicker and fuller.  The key is consistancy.  Caution* It is thick so it can weigh down your hair if you apply if too often and too much...but done hesitate to purchase.  It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for those that are serious about growing their hair - This product does just what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> It is taking some getting use to the smell &amp; the texture of the product, but other than that I think I like it!</li>
    <li> I love this, and will be ordering more :)</li>
    <li> This product is the only product that has worked for me and my friend. Quick weaves over time had our edges bald and receding. Having patience and giving the product time, our results are amazing. Our hair and edges have grown finally! We will continue to purchase this product...it&#x27;s Amazing!</li>
    <li> I love the peppermint that is this. When I put it on my scalp it feels cool and nice. It feels like it is working. It does not have a strong sent or a unbearable odor. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the tingly feeling it creates on my scalp. I also experienced faster hair growth with this product. Im on my second tube and i will be buying more and stocking up!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product the amount was less than what was on the ad and in different packaging. Kinder disappointing but it still work the same. It smell like its for scalp repair, BUT IT WILL HELP YOUR HAIR TO GROW!</li>
    <li> This product stinks immensely, HOWEVER, if you are looking for hair growth,  this is it!</li>
    <li> Product just doesn&#x27;t work and it has a very strong smell</li>
    <li> Its a wonderful product, and I will continue to use it and recommrnd it to others to use... I thoroughly enjoy this product...</li>
    <li> I bought this cause someone told me it promotes fast hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Not so sure about fast hair growth, but it feels great tingling on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;pretty hard to get it out of the tube because it is pretty thick.&lt;br /&gt;no magic oil.</li>
    <li> I love it. I have been using this product for years and it is remarkable.  It helps with the growth of your hair and dandruff. My beautician recommended.</li>
    <li> Im seeing results on my 5 yr old thats been experiencing thinning due to a professional braider that pulled too tight.  Using for a little over a month will order again</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Recommend the manufacture put the cream in a jar because the tube is prone to split or crack at the joints as you squeeze the tube.</li>
    <li> Just started using this, but got a girlfriend that thinks its awesome!</li>
    <li> I returned this product because it was a FAKE!!! It came to me as &amp;#34;Virgo Hair fertilizer,&amp;#34; not VIRGIN. BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! The smell is bit strong but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much. Fast results</li>
    <li> Item arrived quick and works great!! thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from my local beauty supply store. It was the same tube shown above (yellow cap and red and white tube). I parted my hair and applied the product to my scalp. Let me tell you, this cream had my scalp LIT. I mean my scalp was just throbbing  BUT A GOOD THROB. I LOVED IT. Some may say it is too much of a tingle but it felt good to me and I believe after 2 days I begin to see my hair waves (spirals/curls) come out. I am a black female with relaxed hair. I had no issues washing the product out. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it does make my new growth really dry and brittle. I will still use the product but not everyday...maybe once a week because that dry brittle hair will break off and I am not trying to have that. Overall the product does work.</li>
    <li> All hair is NOT created equal. I have 4a fine  low porosity hair and the base of this product is a grease...petroleum jelly. Any grease, mineral oil, petroleum mess instantly dries my hair out and breaks it off and that is exactly what it did. So glad I did a strand test first. My advice is&#x27; know your hair and choose the products accordingly.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find this product on Amazon as I can&#x27;t find it in my area. This Virgin Hair Fertilizer really works for me my hair had been thinning out due in part to medication but when I started using this product within two weeks my hair had noticeably  improved, very little breakage and I am regaining fullness I had been losing. I use once every other week.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It REALLY! REALLY! REALLY! WORKS! I used it on my scalp once and six weeks later my hair is on my back! Six weeks ago it was just touching my shoulder! It Works!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. It helps my hair grow in places that are really thin and practically bald. The only reason why that product did not get a 5 is because of the packaging. I need to empty the product into a container because the tube gets holes in it which become sharp and dangerous.</li>
    <li> It works but the smell is very very strong !!!</li>
    <li> It works!  Makes my hair grow quick and thick.  I only use it 2 times a week because of the strong sulphur odor.  But very good.  My hairdresser turned me on to it a couple years ago and I have no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> awesome for the hair growth too. highly recommended</li>
    <li> Hmm? I don&#x27;t know if this works or not? I was extremely confused by the &amp;#34;many&amp;#34; dates that were stamped on the actual tube? Since I paid for it, I use it in hopes that something may occur? Probably not too smart since I do not know if it is expired or not? The outer box was old &amp; was barely holding the product inside, although the product top was still safety sealed. Sooooo, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed &amp; probably already have my answers;(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to try a fresh one &amp; post another review more favorable. If this product is indeed &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; I should have returned it, or asked for clarity sooner;(</li>
    <li> I brought this product (Fertilizer) based on the recommendation of a friend and I must say that it is a marvelous product to use. Not only did my itchy scalp disappear after a few weeks, but my hair is a lot healthier looking and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;but&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely pleased and would definitely recommend it to anyone who not only has scalp issues, but who is looking for a great product to use on their hair.</li>
    <li> I suffer from extreme dry scalp.  The hair fertilizer totally kept the flacks away.  I was able to maintain my hair style much longer.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent ...I got it four days before the expected arrival date and within a week or two of use I got about a fourth of an inch ofnew growth...the smell is very distinct but well you cant have everything...</li>
    <li> I was given this product a few years back and it made my hair grow faster and stopped my dry scalp from itching.  I searched all over for the product and I was so happy to finally find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I am wearing box braids right now so I apply it mostly to my edges around the hairline and I can already see the area thickening.  I love the tingly sensation you feel when you apply it and how it stops the itchiness of dry scalp.  I could do without the strong peppermint scent that last for days but it could be worst....</li>
    <li> Great product makes your hair feel very cool.  Will order again from this sellter!!!!!A+++++</li>
    <li> I love this product, the smell is too strong but it works very well, mad my hair grow faster...</li>
    <li> I can already see the diffrence in my scalp no dry itchy scalp . before I started using the hari fertilizer I had to wash my hair every week, now I can go two weeks before I have to wash it.  although it takes me back to the days when my mother would press my hair .</li>
    <li> I looked at the ingredients to see if I could dechipher what in this product would grow your hair. Mineral Oil? I think not! Herbs and Spices? What kind are they?  I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff, but it seems to be working. I am using MTG and this product and I have seen an increase in the the growth rate of my hair. I have measured it. I went from .375 inches/ month growth rate ( no growth aides for 1st 80 days of my transition) to .4138 inches/ month in one week.  I am now up to .75 inches/ month growth rate.  I started out with a very slow growth rate and I am now seeing marked differences from week to week. I have not tried this by itself, but I started the MTG about 4 days before this. I did not see a marked difference in the 4 days other than thicker hair.  I think the 2 products work very well together.</li>
    <li> Helps with itchy scalp. Can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve experienced any thickening hair but it does cool the scalp and rid of itchiness.</li>
    <li> Nice product so far I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but I like the minty cool feeling it gives me</li>
    <li> The best hair product...since I have started using this product my hair has grown..texture feels nice and hair is so soft to comb</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK FOR ME, HOWEVER, I HAVE SEEN IT WORK WELL FOR OTHERS.</li>
    <li> This product is the best! I&#x27;ve been using it a little over 2 months and it has helped so much with my dandruff and dryness. Recommend 100% P.S. It&#x27;s has a strong smell but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate. I will update as soon as I see results. I like the way it makes my scalp feel. It is a little greasy. Ideal for wearing your hair up. Will weigh it down otherwise.</li>
    <li> My friend and I both had in braids and used this product to combat itchy scalp and dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on it&#x27;s ability for rapid hair growth at this time, but if you need something to combat dandruff and itchy scalp then this is the thing for you. It works and we&#x27;ve recommended to other friends.</li>
    <li> Gave it a four due to it leaking a little because there was a small dent hole which became bigger as I squeezed. I ended up putting the product in a container. It did come early. Still waiting for results but excited to use it.</li>
    <li> My hair has grown tremendously! I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of compliments on my growth</li>
    <li> I cut my natural hair a month ago and I wore a protective style and I mixed my grease and the fertilizer together. My hair grew back in the space of a month. I was shocked!!! This thing is the holy grape for hair growth. My hair is thicker and longer</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, you might see results if you use it frequently! Has a minty scent to it by the way.</li>
    <li> I did not want 125 I wanted 155. Bad news when you make a mistake, very difficult to correct it, I tried. I still want the 155</li>
    <li> Smells strong but I love it</li>
    <li> If you have thinning hair/ edges this stuff works. It&#x27;s very greasy so only use a little bit. It does makes my hair more manageable and it helps with itching. Good product.</li>
