      <li>I cut my hair every 3-4 days, and this shaver has made that very easy for me.  </li>
      <li>This clippers are great, they run very cool, strong, and efficiently.</li>
      <li>i read the manual first, and good thing!  </li>
      <li>It is a really good razor but the guards that come with it do not snap fit.</li>
      <li>Though I did have to go over some spots more than once, I believe this is more of my own lack of barber craft and skill rather than the devices fault. &#x3D;</li>
      <li>, I am satisfied.  </li>
      <li>if you want a real close buzz and a great cut, this is your tool.</li>
      <li>I shave my neck without using a spacer and am happy with the results; it cuts very close without a spacer but doesn&#x27;t hurt or pinch.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say these are perfect for guys who want it short all over- save a lot of money, too.</li>
      <li>and I could not be more pleased with this clipper.  </li>
      <li>I love these clippers.</li>
      <li>It takes like 5 friggin&#x27; minutes at most.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
      <li>The cut is outstanding.</li>
      <li>This bad-boy cut off EVERYTHING... the FIRST time!!!  </li>
      <li>So far, so good!</li>
      <li>been more than two years and this Wahl trimmer is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>Good unit if you want a very close cut (what my barber calls 000).  </li>
      <li>unlike other reviews, i did not have to adjust the blades, used the gauge in the instructions and the blades were in perfect adjustment.</li>
      <li>These clippers easily provide that bald look without a razor.</li>
      <li>easy to use-</li>
      <li>Wahl makes it easy to get a barbershop-like close trim with this model.</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a strong shaver.  </li>
      <li>but that comes from a strong motor</li>
      <li>Been going strong for over two years.</li>
      <li>Fine for me.</li>
      <li>The guides have stayed on just fine for me.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need a zillion attachments so this one works fine for guys like me who like a close crop.</li>
      <li>but they worked just fine on my Caucasian son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>However, I liked them so much I am buying another set.    </li>
      <li>Ive owned several wahl clippers over the years, they all have been great and held up well.  </li>
      <li>Attachments are cheap.  </li>
      <li>It went smooth like butter.    </li>
      <li>I was not trying to be Mr. Clean, just needed something that is easy to maintain.</li>
      <li>but it has a very powerful motor, so</li>
      <li>This clipper gets the job done quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m satisfied overall, cuz it does cut sooo nice...</li>
      <li>I think the product provides a very close cut, but the guards included are 1/2, 1, and 1&amp;1/2 need to make sure you buy guards in addition if you want to use as primary clippers.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
      <li>They are solidly built, fit comfortably in my hand, and cut my hair very easily and efficiently.</li>
      <li>They buzzed off all of my hair quickly, closely, and evenly.  </li>
      <li>What was surprising was, for as long as I had it turned on, the metal blades didn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
      <li>&quot; on the side of them (unlike my old clippers, the Wahl 79300-1001 ), so I suppose manually aligning the blades is the only way to get them to factory specs (1/32 of an inch from touching)... unless you were lucky enough to get them aligned perfectly out of the box from Wahl.    </li>
      <li>I got this for my boyfriend and although he didn&#x27;t like it at first now he doesn&#x27;t even want to visit his barber!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
      <li>These are really great, however they do not adjust if you are using them without an attachment, so if you happen to be someone like myself who happens to have a few moles on my dome, beware.</li>
      <li>I purchased these recently and so far, nothing but great reviews.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This clipper worked so well, that my son wants his dad to cut his hair from now on! This will save me $20 per month.  This product is well worth the money.  Wahl remains to be the best in the industry.</li>
    <li> this is a nice clippers and like the name it will give  u a close saahve</li>
    <li> Just received these clippers last night.  I opened up the package and started reading the instructions.  Almost immediately, I noticed that the upper blade was very fine and that the blades were a little bit too far to right ... so I followed the instructions step-by-step... turned on the clippers, oiled them, turned them on again, then turned them off and unplugged them.  Then I followed the instructions for blade alignment which are:    1)  loosen the two screws that secure the upper blade with a phillips screwdriver    2)  shift the upper blade over to the left--- so that the extreme left-hand tooth of the top blade is to the left of the first small tooth of the bottom blade... and that the extreme right-hand tooth of top blade is touching the big tooth on the bottom blade    3)  align the blades (by slightly pulling them upwards) so that they are straight and almost touching (1/32 of an inch)    4)  tightened the screws    Well, it took me 3 tries to get the alignment to my satisfaction and it took about 10 minutes to accomplish.    I kind of wish this alignment was unnecessary... but then I forgot that these clippers have NO \\&quot;thumb-shifter/adjustment bar\\&quot; on the side of them (unlike my old clippers, the Wahl 79300-1001 ), so I suppose manually aligning the blades is the only way to get them to factory specs (1/32 of an inch from touching)... unless you were lucky enough to get them aligned perfectly out of the box from Wahl.    That being said, it also appears to be possible to lower the blades slightly if the factory spec is too close for your liking... which is what someone may want to do if they plan to use the clippers with no comb and don&#x27;t want their scalp chewed up.    Anyways, after alignment was acheived, I plugged in this puppy and started cutting.  I put on the 1/2 inch comb and buzzed away.    These clippers rule!    They buzzed off all of my hair quickly, closely, and evenly.  I was amazed that I didn&#x27;t have any \\&quot;missed\\&quot; spots or \\&quot;left over\\&quot; hairsfrom around my ears!  This bad-boy cut off EVERYTHING... the FIRST time!!!  Perfect!!!    If you&#x27;ve ever been to the barber shop and gotten a fade (like I used to).  These clippers feel exactly like the one used to blend in the line.  They cut super close and feel differently than the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; clippers that were used earlier in the haircut.    Bottom line is that if you need new clippers, and you like SHORT buzz cuts, you&#x27;d be foolish to pass this product up!  The upper blade has finer teeth than \\&quot;regular\\&quot; clippers (which was the Wahl 79300-1001)... so you know just by looking at these clippers, they will get the job done.    Thankfully, they don&#x27;t disappoint!!!  Once you align the blades, power on, and put them to to your head, you know you will have made the right choice.  The Wahl Balder cuts CLOSE... which is why I use the smallest comb.  I have no doubt going combless will bald you... maybe even nick up your scalp.    I bought these clippers because I was sick of scapling my head with a disposable razor... and then getting my noggin stuck for the following week, while the hair grows out, because the stubble snags into in t-shirts, pillows, blankets, whatever.    Thanks to the other Amazon reviewers whose reviews influenced me to make this purchase, I can now buzz my hair shorter and quicker than ever with the Wahl Balder.    The blade adjustment step kind of sucks, but it&#x27;s no biggie.  This product works... it&#x27;s quiet, comfortable to hold, and didn&#x27;t get hot during a deliberately slow 20 minute haircut.  A huge upgrade over my previously owned (now thrown away) Wahl 79300-1001.    One of the better ways a guy can spend $30.00!!!    Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He shaves his head for the National Guard summer camp. He always had me cutting it, trimming around the ears of helping him shave it. Now with the Balder he can get a very high &amp; tight cut for the military or just to cool off w/o me. He is thrilled at the ease of use and the attachements. It has been a time saver not to mention money saver.</li>
    <li> Going to the barber just to shave my head down stopped making sense. No offense to the hair cutting profession, but all that time and expense just to do something so simple was impractical. I tried a bunch of options. Shaving with a razor/straight-edge did not work, because of nicks and cuts. Not interested in bleeding. Trimmers and wet shavers were also a bust. It took a ridiculous amount of work just to get my hair short enough.    This product really worked. I got a very close shave, with a little stubble on my first try. Fine for me. I was not trying to be Mr. Clean, just needed something that is easy to maintain. The blades are SHARP, so my skin did feel tender the first few times. Throw some alcohol on that scalp to disinfect any cuts. The motor on this Wahl shaver is very POWERFUL  compared to those of trimmers and wet shavers. Make sure you maintain a firm grip to avoid a scalp tragedy. This thing is HEAVY. You don&#x27;t want to drop it. No joke.     The item has paid for itself. I shave my head when I want, no travel or monetary overhead. It takes out the hair in one motion, minus minor touchups with my wet shaver. My scalp has toughened, so no more tenderness. It took a few months for my scalp to adjust. That is the price for trying something new on my skin. I shaved before writing this review. It went smooth like butter.    Learn the basics of cutting hair so you can cut your own hair appropriately, with the grain, against the grain etc, etc. You need to develop a technique to get a consistent hair cut. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a smooth dome but does not want to use a straight edge/razor.    Finally, the comments about the packaging are amusing. Given the American demographic most likely to shave its head, the marketing strategy makes sense/cents. I, however, based my review on the fact the product actually performs as advertised. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it or give it as a gift just because the packaging is ethnocentric.</li>
    <li> This clipper gets the job done quickly and easily. I use it to clip the hair on my head to near-baldness. I have used it about 5 times now and I am more than happy with the results. It does the job efficiently; I get a nice even &#x60;&#x60;shave&#x27;&#x27; and all in less than about 7 minutes.  Once I get used to it I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t take even this long! It is a lot less messier than wet-shaving your head. I wholly recommend this product to anyone who wishes to keep a neat and bald head. It is a great product for its price!</li>
    <li> These clippers definitely deliver as everyone stated. They cut close and when I say close man I mean close like a razor, not only that but it has a very powerful motor, so if your looking for some powerful clippers do not pass up on these or you will regret it. Another thing people are complaining about art work on a box how stupid. This does not discriminate so get over it people. It is apart of the multicultural line of wahl after all.</li>
    <li> You can stack this shaver up to the most expensive in the bussiness, and this one will blow them out of the water.  I cut my hair every 3-4 days, and this shaver has made that very easy for me.  Nice even cuts everytime.  Thats right, I cut my hair perfect everytime, nobody helps me.  It&#x27;s not because I am that awsome, its because the Wahl razor is the best available.</li>
    <li> This buzzer gives the best fades as the title states. Problems? Well if you use it on your facial hair it pulls your hair on occasion. Second I wish it came with a 1/4 inch guard. It comes with a close guard, 1/8 and 3/16.</li>
    <li> I started buzzing my head a few years ago. I went through several clippers (and learned to never use one that runs on batteries or one that&#x27;s meant for beards). If you want a super close cut (#.5 - less than a 1-cut), use the adapter, and you&#x27;re set. This thing is sturdy, heavy, well-built, and priced right. I do my entire head in about 4 minutes. Flawless. Although my co-workers had a bit of a laugh with me when it showed up - the packaging looks like it&#x27;s geared toward black men. Well, it works for us Irish guys, too!</li>
    <li> This clipper provides a very close cut, with attachments from 1/16\\&quot; to 3/8\\&quot;.  Take off an attachment and you go to skin.  I don&#x27;t know whether other models, some for somewhat less cost, do the same job. Either way,  I highly recommend this product for the guy who wants to save money and  always look well barbered.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes it easy to get a barbershop-like close trim with this model. I didn&#x27;t need a zillion attachments so this one works fine for guys like me who like a close crop.</li>
    <li> Had this gem for couple of months now.  Cuts hair like a razor blade.  I&#x27;ve owned several cheap trimmers b4 and nothing beats the quality of Wahl.  Solid feel (maybe a bit heavy for woman) and built.  Bit noisy but that comes from a strong motor so it&#x27;s not a negative in my book.    Update (7/2010):  been more than two years and this Wahl trimmer is still going strong.  Cuts my thick head of hair without any snags!  Hope it&#x27;ll last me for next 10years...LOL</li>
    <li> I ordered through a link for Wahl&#x27;s.  The clipper on Wahl&#x27;s has an adjustable lever.  The clipper that I received did not have a lever.</li>
    <li> This product feels and sounds just like the electric clippers barbers use.  I have male pattern baldness and don&#x27;t like paying for haircuts.  Using the longest spacer allows me to get a close hair cut with relative ease.  I shave my neck without using a spacer and am happy with the results; it cuts very close without a spacer but doesn&#x27;t hurt or pinch. This product is a little heavy (read: made well), but feels comfortable in the hand.  I would feel better about giving it 5 stars if it was cordless, but ultimately, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good unit if you want a very close cut (what my barber calls 000).  Heavy metal construction and appears durable.  Attachments are cheap.  Good unit for the price.  Don&#x27;t buy unless you want a bald look - as the name implies.</li>
    <li> I purchased these recently and so far, nothing but great reviews.  I have used these 3 times or so and always produces a great haircut.  For the money, I would definitely recommend these...</li>
    <li> The last pair of Wahl clippers I purchased are more than 15 years old and still running strong.  I&#x27;m expecting more of the same.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s been cutting my flat tops since I gave up on the barber&#x27;s at Fort Hood in Texas.  One of the problems she was having, was how to get the sides short and the fade right.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Today being Christmas Eve...and me in need of a haircut.  I got one of my presents (mine?) early...along with a haircut.  After the first stroke at the base of my neck...she was giggling.  GREAT, I thought.  I&#x27;m going to be \\&quot;balder\\&quot; for a month...she was just shocked at how much closer it was cutting than our previous fader, the Andis Pivot Pro that my barber had recommended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I any case, the haircut looks great.  The instructions for fading must have been awesome...as this is the best job my wife/barber&#x27;s done yet! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been in the market for a clipper to cut my hair as close to the scalp as possible. My head can not tolerate a blade and shaving cream w/o getting extremely irritated so I needed to cut my head really close - to try and minimize the appearance of my receding hair line.    I have tried other clippers, but they just didn&#x27;t cut close enough - enter these clippers; they work exremely well. It cuts very close and does not irritate my head - Word of advice: let the clippers do the work and don&#x27;t dig in to your head; trust the clippers, they will cut your hair short for you; trust them!!! Also, be careful around the ear-area b/c they can clip you!!    In summary, these clippers are perfect for a short-cut; additionally, the design looks great, is sturdy, and stays cool.</li>
    <li> These clippers easily provide that bald look without a razor. It&#x27;s durable and is heavy enough that is feels like a professional tool and not a toy like some other clippers.</li>
    <li> My only two complaints are:  1. The cord is about a foot too short.  2. It&#x27;s ugly.    Personally, I like to stand in the tub and do the bulk of the hair removal and wash it down the drain (because the hairs are short, I&#x27;m not worried about clogs).  The two bathrooms I tried this in, I could just barely get in the tub before running out of cord.     As for ugly,  it was ugly before I bought it and just never got any prettier.  Others complain about the packaging showing black people on it.  Well, the shaver is listed on the mfg site as being an \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; product.  The color scheme is also that ugly gold that seems to resonate with that same demographic.  Oh well, I guess I won&#x27;t take it to \\&quot;show and tell\\&quot; at work.  The horror of having a few black folks on the packaging did cause me great emotional distress and I&#x27;m suing the mfg for the absolute horror and pain it has caused.  I&#x27;m emotionally scarred, in case it&#x27;s not obvious.  Of course, the really funny part was that it included directions in Spanish.  Those darned illegal black immigrants forcing Spanish upon us must stop!      All in all, it&#x27;s a strong shaver.  The three guards provided are extremely short, so this is for people who either have buzz cuts or shorter.  It blows cordless trimmers away.      Back to the emotional distress, I was pleasantly surprised that the shaver didn&#x27;t turn me black.  From some of the comments I&#x27;d read before purchasing it, I was afraid I&#x27;d become a rapper or something just by using the darned thing.</li>
    <li> This balder does just what it says...it takes it down to just the tiniest bit of stubble on your head.  If that is what you are looking for...this one&#x27;s for you!  Have only nicked myself once or twice when I was careless around my ears...in a few years...using it about once a month or so!  Fantastic product and I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> nice trimmer, seems better-made than my last one, and cuts REALLY close.  i read the manual first, and good thing!  it shows how the blades were to be aligned when cleaning and UPON RECEIPT...my machine was not adjusted acceptably when put together?  yup.  no biggie but why not put it together just right the 1st time?  anyway, seems that after i bought it they finally restocked the look-alike of this razor with another brand name on it?---at wal*mart.  i think the prices were close?  i&#x27;m satisfied overall, cuz it does cut sooo nice...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m italian. That means that my body hair is of epic proportions. I completely skipped over all of the trimmers that are labled as \\&quot;body groomers\\&quot; because my body hair is thicker than most ppl&#x27;s facial hair.     With that said, I ordered this clipper about a month ago and have used it about 3 times to trim the jungle of hair on my body from my neck down to my toes.    It&#x27;s a great tool. I was impressed by the quietness and efficiency. It&#x27;s just a low \\&quot;humm\\&quot; sound (probably because it&#x27;s new). But it didn&#x27;t skip or jam at all and I only had to pass over each area once for an even cut. The width of the trimmers is the same as a professional&#x27;s clippers which saves time for each trim. It handled different variations of each type of hair on me without any faltering.     The contours of the handle were an added bonus. They have a rubbery curved grip so it doen&#x27;t slip and the indents for the thumb and fingers feel as it was designed with some effort of thought. The handle is made out of plastic which makes it a little bit lighter and easy to maneuver.    The first time I used it, I had it on for a long time. I was testing out different clipper lengths and trying to get all the back hair took longer than expected. What was surprising was, for as long as I had it turned on, the metal blades didn&#x27;t heat up. I touched them as I was packing it away and they were&#x27;t even warm. It seems like they can run for very long periods without any overheating issues.    The clippers come with a comb, blade brusher, blade cover clip, travel bag, and 3 attatchments. The attatchments are 3/16th in., 1/8th in., and a 1/16th in. These are all VERY SHORT attatchments. It works great for places that you want to cut most of the hair off. But for places that you want just a trim leaving some hair, you&#x27;ll have to buy bigger clips. They&#x27;re available on Amazon for only a oouple dollars.</li>
    <li> If you think you are getting anything but a bald cutter than do not buy this item! The guards don&#x27;t stand a shot of staying on so trying to give yourself or someone else a cut other than bald in all but impossible!</li>
    <li> A great clipper that does a nice job. Replaced a China made clipper with this one. My only complaint is that I had to realign the blades before using. Well worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my 16 year old white son.  the packaging had afro-americans all over it  no pictures of white people.... it came the day before christmas so i had no choice but to give it to him. the product might be good but they should seriously reconsider their packaging and amazon should seriously think about putting a picture of what the actual packaging looks like. i would have chosen one of the other wahl clippers if i would have known what the packaging looked like. wahl should know what this  clipper is not for black people only. offended?? you bet.</li>
    <li> Ive owned several wahl clippers over the years, they all have been great and held up well.  I purchaced this to replace an older model ive been using for 10 years. this new clipper works great, gets real close and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin like other clippers do. unlike other reviews, i did not have to adjust the blades, used the gauge in the instructions and the blades were in perfect adjustment. Also this is a really good price for these. Its also nice to have purchased a usa made product, its nice to be able to hold someone accountable ,if you need parts or service, instead of hunting for parts online. thanks wahl</li>
    <li> As the item description states it&#x27;s for a balder ultra-close haircut.  Great for beard and trim.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but my favorite.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I just got these and I like them a lot.  My barber cuts my hair with No. 2 clippers all over and charges $11.50.  To keep it looking nice, I have to get it cut twice a month.  These clippers with the longest guide attached do the equivalent in about five minutes and I can keep it looking nice all the time.  I&#x27;d say these are perfect for guys who want it short all over- save a lot of money, too.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and although he didn&#x27;t like it at first now he doesn&#x27;t even want to visit his barber!</li>
    <li> I shave my husband&#x27;s head; he does the beard. W use it to shave just about bald, not for a haircut. Seems to work great. Only have used once, but  didn&#x27;t need to align the blades. It is quiet and a clean shave. The combs aren&#x27;t the same as others and so the beard trim was shorter than usual, but he will use the next size up next time and expect it to do fine. A bit heavier than other trimmers, but still manageable.</li>
    <li> Super sharp blade. I have the classic male pattern baldness thing going on, so I want a close crop every other week. You&#x27;ll want whomever is cutting your hair to have a steady hand. This was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This item failed within the first 5 minutes of use, apparently from a faulty switch.  Amazon, however, replaced it the next day (fantastic service!) and I could not be more pleased with this clipper.  It cuts evenly and quickly, far outperforming the two Norelco trimmers it replaced.  While the first one earned only one star, the replacement gets five stars.</li>
    <li> I think the product provides a very close cut, but the guards included are 1/2, 1, and 1&amp;1/2 need to make sure you buy guards in addition if you want to use as primary clippers.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes the best pair of clippers and this model doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  One of the closest shaves I have ever gotten without a razor.  Great for fading as well.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. They are solidly built, fit comfortably in my hand, and cut my hair very easily and efficiently. I&#x27;ve been through several clippers over the last few years and none of them come to close to these.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s with hair \\&quot;stylists\\&quot; but they would always ask for $10+ just to shave off my hair, one even asked for $20. It takes like 5 friggin&#x27; minutes at most. With this convenient shaver you just grab some newspaper, plug it into your bathroom and you&#x27;re done almost as soon as you get started. Sometimes the switch is kinda tough to turn on though, maybe it might have issues later?</li>
    <li> The blade depth of the Wahl Balder by design is short and fixed for close cuts, not adjustable like the Clipper models. It comes with plastic clip-on combs for cutting different lengths. The smallest of these in my box fits loosely and rattles. Overall the Balder works very well and is a good value.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000I1TNB8 Wahl 79111-100 Balder 10-Piece Ultra-Close Haircut Kit]]    This product is great - gonna save a lot of money on haircuts....!!!  The 3 different size attachments for how close/short you want your cut is a very good touch. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Shaver came defective. Etronics was very reliable - sent it back and got a refund with no hassles.</li>
    <li> These lasted for about 3 years of using twice/week and the motor finally quit working.  Also the gold chrome finish started wearing off.  Overall, I was satisfied.  They do cut very close.  If you want to shave your head like bald guys do this is what you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with these, they are the best and third pair of WAHL clippers I&#x27;ve gone through. They are quieter than the other two I&#x27;ve had.  A word of warning to never drop your clippers or the blades will get out of alignment, and always put the oil on the blades after cleaning the hair off.    The package seems to market to African Americans but they worked just fine on my Caucasian son&#x27;s hair.  A really wonderful product, I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
    <li> easy to use- the different length trimmers are color coded.  Works excellent and a great price for what you get.</li>
    <li> I got this product mainly to cut the hair on the back of my neck in between haircuts.  My hair grows slowly, but the hair on my neck grows quickly.  But it does a good job at that, I am satisfied.  The clippers are sharp, and if you hold them at the wrong angle, you will cut yourselve.  But I am not sure that I suggest these if you are trying to bald your head.  They cut very close, but not close enough for a total \\&quot;clean-cut\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed: a hair cutter that could work well with short cuts. Uniform cut through the head. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase of this product. I do not find it noisey at all, like a few have stated, and I am a 58 year old man who finds everything annoying. All I know is for the price I like what it does. It cuts my hair with ease, I can use the attachments to cut my gotee, and without the attachments I can use it to shave. If you have a steady hand I wouldn&#x27;t worry about nicking yourself even though the blades are sharp. Also the adjustments to the blades are no big deal as I to was worried about that part. I&#x27;m a Tim Allen type of guy but any one can do this. Iv&#x27;e given myself 2 haircuts already and the next one will have paid for this purchase in the savings of going to a barber. I say what&#x27;s not to like about that. You don&#x27;t need to look any farther than this product to be happy.</li>
    <li> This cuts great - the guides are only for very short cuts.   It seems well built for home use.   The guides have stayed on just fine for me.</li>
    <li> While it cuts very well it also nicks the skin alot.  I use it on my neck and I always end up with a cut or two.</li>
    <li> This set of clippers work great at cutting hair very short. I have had these for a few months and have used them weekly during that time. You&#x27;ll notice the blades are smaller and sharper than the average clipper blades.    I managed to break these recently by dropping them from a considerable height onto the hard floor surface of my bathroom - not Wahl&#x27;s fault. However, I liked them so much I am buying another set.    Only downside is the attachments - they seem a bit flimsy. I would&#x27;ve given the product 5 stars if the attachments had been a little more rigid.    Finally, other reviewers have commented that the packaging features African American males only. As a pasty white guy, I can attest that these clippers do not discriminate. So get over it!</li>
    <li> Really great clippers, unless you have any moles on your head. If so, prepare for a bloody mess.  These are really great, however they do not adjust if you are using them without an attachment, so if you happen to be someone like myself who happens to have a few moles on my dome, beware.</li>
    <li> I was normally always going to the barber shop to get a fade every week or two, until my friend suggested I try cutting my own hair each week to save money and always stay sharp.     I heard great things about Wahl products so I decided (after some research) that this was the clipper for me. I cut my hair extremely short, but not bald. This clippers are great, they run very cool, strong, and efficiently. Though I did have to go over some spots more than once, I believe this is more of my own lack of barber craft and skill rather than the devices fault. &#x3D;] I do reccomend having a personal mirror or a set of mirrors so you can check all around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s essentially a pair of clippers, like every other pair of clippers.  The &#x27;blades&#x27; on the front were so sharp that I couldn&#x27;t use it without a guard to be &#x27;bald&#x27; without gouging my head.  I eventually ended up returning it, buying a regular pair of clippers that I could shave my head &#x27;guardless&#x27; with, and then use a Norelco wet/dry shaver to get bald.</li>
    <li> This is the best set of hair clippers I have owned. You will not go wrong with a pair of these. The cut is outstanding.</li>
    <li> It is a really good razor but the guards that come with it do not snap fit. But overall high quality clipper.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Very sharp and not noisy at all. The best one I ever had.</li>
    <li> The Balder Ultra-close clipper (the only part of the kit I use, except for the cleaning brush and oil) cuts closer than any other clipper I&#x27;ve used to do my head. I like it a lot. One caution: be careful -- it will nick you if you&#x27;re not careful, especially around the ears. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now, and I still do it once in a while. Overall, a good product. I&#x27;d buy one again. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband (who is African-American) for Christmas.  He loves it!!  It has a nice clean close cut, and has decreased his time in half when cutting his hair.   We are going to be buying one for his brother, as a gift soon!! I would recommend this to anyone.  We are so pleased with the results from this product!</li>
    <li> if you want a real close buzz and a great cut, this is your tool. comes with everything you need. just plug and clip. saves me money from the barbershop. get you one!</li>
    <li> This is awesome. My husband was going to get his haircut once a week &amp; spending $15 each time. This was the best deal for the price &amp; now I can cut his hair at home.</li>
    <li> I have only used the Balder once, but I was completely satisfied with it&#x27;s performance. The other \\&quot;consumer\\&quot; sheers I have purchased to cut my hair were not well-made. Nor did they cut as well and as close as the Balder. When using the Balder without an attachment your cut is just short of the results you could get with a razor. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants THE SHORTEST HAIRCUT YOU CAN GET WITHOUT A RAZOR.</li>
    <li> Been going strong for over two years. Great clippers.</li>
