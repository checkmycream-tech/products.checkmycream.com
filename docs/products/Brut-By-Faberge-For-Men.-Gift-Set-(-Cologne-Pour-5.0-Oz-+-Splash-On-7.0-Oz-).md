    <li> Quick delivery and product delivered as described.</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised .....</li>
    <li> Great clean smell,. I  recommend.</li>
    <li> Scent does not last long, but what can you expect from $3-a-bottle after shave.  I like the scent, but, well, Brut is Brut.</li>
    <li> Having cheered the NY Jet superstar, Broadway Joe, you can guess at my age ...this product should NEVER be removed from sale. The fragrance is classic.</li>
    <li> what can you say...  it&#x27;s BRUT.</li>
    <li> Still love the smell of this on by hubby! Good value and nice packaging.  Perfect transaction with an Amazon seller!</li>
    <li> I saw this online and it immediately made me think of my dad who wore Brut back in the 80s. So I bought it for my dad&#x27;s birthday. Upon him receiving the calogne, my dad said it brought back so many memories, put it on, went to the mall, &amp; four women complimented his calogne. lol WINNING!</li>
    <li> Nothing matches the smell of brut. Is has been around for a while but is very unique. We love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL, LOVE THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much! My dad loved his birthday gift!! Quick shipping at that!</li>
    <li> good old &amp;#34;Brut by Faberge&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> got this for a Love Gift for my husband who enjoys this fragrance and wears only this on very special times</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but my husband just smells so good in this. He has expensive colognes, but always goes back to Brut. We buy the Brut deodorant as well. Very clean fresh manly scent. Great value in this kit. Better value than buying seperate at the store.</li>
    <li> So happy to find this for my Dad for Christmas...this is &amp;#34;his&amp;#34; scent...it smells great and the price is great too!</li>
