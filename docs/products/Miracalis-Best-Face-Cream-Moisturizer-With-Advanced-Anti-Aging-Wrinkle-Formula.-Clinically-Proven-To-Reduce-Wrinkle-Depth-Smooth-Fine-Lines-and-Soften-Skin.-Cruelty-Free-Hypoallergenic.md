<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s rich and creamy without a strong smell. Some face creams I can&#x27;t wear because they just have too much perfume in them and I prefer odorless creams and cosmetics for my face. The product goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling thoroughly moisturized. I use this one at night and a different one during the day with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works well on aging skin.  Will  continue to use since I am seeing good results.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It is a very good product. I love it and will buy it again.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this cream for a while, before writing my review. It is great that it is not scented. I am using it as a moisturizer on my dry skin. It has been working great so far. I apply it in the morning and in the evening before bed. I have had no breakouts yet, and I have sensitive skin. It makes my skin feel smooth. Overall, it is a great moisturizer. I would highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:507ba6c8a4e184c500af376fa9377805]] After using about half a jar of this product, here are my thoughts:    Pros:    Wonderful texture--silky, fast absorbing.    Leaves your skin feeling velvety and not oily.    Makes your makeup look flawless.    Temporarily adds moisture and makes skin look plumper and more youthful.    Unscented.    Cons:    Contains mineral oil.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to mineral oil, be aware that this product does contain some.    Overall, a lovely feeling face cream that makes your skin look smoother and more youthful, especially under makeup.    I received this cream for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I received this jar of Miracalis face cream in an Amazon box with a book I had ordered. The jar was not in a box, had to use a magnifying glass to read the small print on the see through label no free e-book either. For $30 dollars, it could have come in a  box. I thought ... how frugal can one be Miracalis. All facial companies box their products. However, I have used the cream daily, nightly, has not tightened my skin nor erased the few wrinkles. Therefore I pin this product no stars and returning it in the morning. Oh a star rating is required.Give it One star to post my experience of it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It really creates a smooth look and feel on my skin!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Mom. She&#x27;s in her 70s and her skin was looking tired and dry. I noticed that her skin was looking brighter after using the product. So far no complaints.</li>
    <li> So far, I really love this anti aging wrinkle cream! It is fast and effective and I can already see my fine lines and wrinkles softening. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> DID NOTHING FOR MY DRY SENSITIVE SKIN.  IF ANYTHING, MY SKIN LOOKED EVEN DRYER!</li>
    <li> Pretty certain this caused me to break out / have a reaction. I NEVER have skin break outs, however I noticed after using this continually that my skin was breaking after almost every application. I finished the product hoping it would clear up / balance out but unfortunately it didnt. I have lots of little clogged pores on my forehead which I never had before using this product. I will not be ordering again... Also saw no noticeable improvement in skin tone with this product.</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with it. It is difficult to judge a skin care product after only a week but I have no complaints. I can say that it is not greasy, has no obnoxious smell, and seems to make my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;m really liking the results</li>
    <li> This cream is good it has potential of clear dark spots but at a very slow pace. It soften the skin and smoothen the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST face cream I have ever used! And I have tried them all from high-end to low-end!!! Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this!!!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected and it doesn&#x27;t feel good. I&#x27;ve bought much less expensive anti wrinkle creams and they work right away. This isn&#x27;t kosher.</li>
    <li> Fabulous&lt;br /&gt;Amazzing</li>
    <li> I love this, Your skin will be smooth after a days! my husband is using this product too.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference.  I have used for over a month.</li>
    <li> I have dry patch and acne even though I&#x27;m 60. This creme smoothes everything out and decreases my acne. I&#x27;ve been told I look like I&#x27;m 45.  My skin has never been this good.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Smells good, very light, very smooth. Can&#x27;t tell if help wrinkle yet just start use it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it very long but my skin looks smoother and feels great</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have only used this for a couple of days, I like the way it makes my skin feel, I will comment later on whether it does anything for the wrinkles and firmness. It was delivered as promised, small jar but a little does go a long way.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I have tried many creams that are much more expensive and this one works so much better than any other cream. I am in my mid-20s and have been using this cream for now 6 months (have ordered multiple creams) and see changes in my wrinkles, especially on my forehead (much less noticeable). I have recommended this product to friends and family who have also loved it. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I&#x27;d recommend to others as well as repurchase.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
    <li> Miracalis anti-aging cream has been good to me. Shipped to me in a timely manner and packaged well in a nice little container as shown in the images above. I have sensitive skin and I have had no issues so far with any irritation. After a short period of applying it, I already notice some improvement and look forward to its long term effects.</li>
    <li> Since initial purchase I was kept informed by the seller as to the status of the purchased product, which my wife liked as she was anxious to try the new kid on the block. The product package looks great and much richer than in the images, a very inviting product packaging. Inside, the thick, creamy formula looks rich and prescription-like. Nothing to complain about and given the obvious thought that has gone into the Miracalis Anti-Aging Moisturizer Cream, Daily Skin Care Treatment... we are sure to be repeat buyers since after a short while there has already been noticeable differences in the form of skin tightening and a smooth, clean feeling when hand is rubbed along the face.</li>
    <li> Is Miracalis a play on the word Miraculous? Well, if it can reduce your facial wrinkles by up to 17% after just 15 days and up to 32% after just 28 days, it is extraordinary. Manufacturers aren&#x27;t able to make those claims lightly. This product was provided for my honest review and I want to say that I am noticing a visible difference. My wrinkles are diminishing and my skin feels soft and hydrated. I also love the fact that they don&#x27;t test on animals! On the downside, I read the list of ingredients and I&#x27;m not sure what half of them are. I guess if it works it works...great product!</li>
    <li> I purchase this Product 3 weeks ago, and I couldn&#x27;t be any more happier with it! Easy to use and you can really see the changes in your skin.other thing that I really like is that it smells good.</li>
    <li> Product looks great. Thick, creamy texture. Should last a good while. Bought it for my girlfriend who was looking for a cream like this and says she loves it so far. She&#x27;s happy so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> My wife was looking at anti-aging creams but couldn&#x27;t find any that she really liked or made any noticeable difference to her skin. I saw this cream on Amazon and told her she should give it a try since it had great reviews and seemed to be a good price. She&#x27;s been happy with the purchase ever since and within weeks her skin is noticeably softer and the small amount of wrinkles she had are fading away. Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY CREAMS. I USE THEM EVERY NIGHT AND FACE LOOKS AND FEELS BETTER. THANK YOU FOR SUCH A GOOD PRODUCT. DOLLYE</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and this product did not irritate it at all.  As soon as I applied the cream, I noticed a difference in my skin.  It tightened immediately!  Because of the tightening of skin, it helped the appearance of my make-up.  It looked flawless! I noticed a difference within minutes of my first use.  I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> There are superior wrinkle creams out there-not this one!  Thick and just made no difference in skin texture.</li>
    <li> I actually looked saggy after using this. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product that enhances collagen production, and was&lt;br /&gt;pleased to purchase this Anti Aging Wrinkle cream in a promotion for testing and&lt;br /&gt;review.  The cream restores antioxidants that work to aid in the release of free&lt;br /&gt;radicals.  I have found already a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand of cream for my girlfriend to try out based on the great reviews. She was pleasantly surprised as to the quality and texture, especially because she has very sensitive skin. She has tried a few other creams and using this one there is a notable difference. This seller also goes above and beyond attaching a nice skin care guide, I will definitely be ordering more for her!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for a little over a month. She seems pretty happy with the purchase as her skin feels well moisturized and already looks firmer. She has very sensitive skin and she was glad the cream didn&#x27;t cause her to break out.</li>
    <li> So rich! This is going to be the face cream I stay with. Good service, fantastic product, helpful follow up. I feel taken care of</li>
    <li> Hard to predict as I have only been using it for a few days but I am very very impressed by the follow up and the excellent service in making sure this product lives up to the expectations.  I will get back to you and thank you</li>
    <li> I just got this product in the mail a few days ago. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for The past 4 days and I really like it. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if the fine lines on my neck are diminishing, but my skin feels really moisturized and healthier.</li>
    <li> Not seen any major changes except face feels softer.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love this cream. It&#x27;s not too heavy. Goes on smoothly. Not sticky or greasy at all. Not sure about the wrinkles yet, haven&#x27;t used it long enough.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product that appears to work quick in removing and preventing wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about this product is that it isnt greasy or give you the greasy look on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also drys very quickly which is very nice when you are using this before bed time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to thank Miracalis for allowing me to test this product at a reduced price!</li>
    <li> One of the best things that ive purchased on amazon! Miracalis is actually a miracle and i recommend it to all!  i love unique products, and this is nothing like a product that you&#x27;ll get from any other standard beauty store such as boots, you&#x27;re missing out by not purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Miracalis is not a cream but a miracle. I have been using it for 2 weeks and can honestly say I am most impressed with the results. I have a noticable decrease in the lines on my forehead, my pores are non existant, I have actually stopped wearing a foundation. . After cleansing my face/neck, I make sure to leave the skin damp then apply a small amount of the cream. Does not feel heavy on skin.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as promised. I really like this skin care product.</li>
    <li> I was sent an Anti-Aging Cream with the name of MIRACALIS by MIRACALIS LLC to try and review. I applied the moisturizer cream to my face after I washed it thoroughly so that my face was clean and dry. This moisturizer is very light and thin it is not a creamy moisturizer. If your looking for something that you can not tell that you have any moisturizer on then this is the product for you.Miricalis came is a small 10z/30ml jar and the packaging was lovely. I believe that I would honestly have to use Miricalis for much longer than a week to see the Anti- Aging results that Miricalis promises. I will continue to use Miricalis and hope for a miracle!!!</li>
    <li> My existing line was getting pretty expensive to keep up with so I tried this on a whim. Price was less than my other brand and I&#x27;ve been hearing good reviews. I&#x27;m thrilled with it so far! Great texture and a little seems to go a long way, just a few small dabs did my entire face. Very happy so far!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great feeling cream! Cool going on. Liked the e-book on Anti-Aging tips. I&#x27;m working on my &amp;#34;marionette&amp;#34; aging lines starting to go down from my mouth. They actually look less noticeable. This may just be the cream to soften &amp; MAYBE get rid of them! Keeping my fingers crossed-Thank you!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love the smell and texture of this cream. A little goes a long way. Great product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Been using the product for about a week and so far so good.I have very sensitive skin and many products cause reactions with eye irritation, but so far so good! I&#x27;ll be looking for an eye product in this line next.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results of this cream. I use it primarily for my neck to help with the lines and crepe look of my skin.  I have tried over a dozen products from department store brands to QVC to catalogs but only this product have given me a smoother look . I am a very satisfied repeat customer.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have used many high-end face products in the past and this is the best face cream I have ever used - especially for the price. I did contact the seller over a small issue and the seller corrected the situation immediately and with such great care, checking back to make sure I was satisfied. I will definitely order this product from this seller again. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The cream seems fine but my skin is very sensitive and it seems to clog my pores making me break out.</li>
    <li> It is a great product.  I have been using it for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a couple of days, I have noticed my smile lines are beginning to diminish!  I&#x27;m really enjoying the results!</li>
    <li> I’m getting up there in age and started looking at various so-called “anti-aging” products. This one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seemed like a good price for the claims they made and gave it a shot. I didn’t tell anyone I started using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this daily but my friends are asking what I’ve been doing! They say I glow, I can’t believe it, I couldn’t be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happier.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Nice product. Quick delivery!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This cream really works its amazing cream ever, it brightens my face and lessen my wrinkles, I will continue use this cream.</li>
    <li> Good but nothing different than any other face cream.  No significant surprising results beyond typical moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love the moisturizing effects of this product and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face.  You can apply this product at night or in the morning a few minutes before makeup (allow for time to dry) or both.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Nice creamy texture. A little goes a long way. Its too soon to see any wrinkle results but its really a good buy since you need so little.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Have only been using it for 2 wks now.  Skin looks and feels smoother.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! It&#x27;s packed with ingredients good for my skin, but goes on without added fragrance. So many face care products contain fragrances that can irritate sensitive skin and eyes. This product feels great on my skin and around my eyes without any irritation to my sensitive skin with rosacea. I currently have normal skin, but have had dry to oily skin in the past. I think anyone could use this product. It goes on very emollient, but soaks in right away and dries to a matte finish within a minute or so. I layer skincare products on my face and this layers with no problem. Some products I&#x27;ve tried feel tacky, greasy, or have strong scents. I can&#x27;t bring myself to continue using those products. I have no reservations recommending this product! I look forward to using it! My skin feels great since I&#x27;ve started using it. Very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Works for me and I like that I can use for my entire face.</li>
    <li> I have read before that even if you have good skin, it’s wise to start using an anti-aging cream in your 30’s.  I mean you cant be young forever right!  And all skin needs a little help as we age.  However with that being said, I have to admit I don’t use any moisturizer’s or face creams as I should because I have not found one or shall I say, any that I really liked.  I have a collection in my bathroom of face creams that possible compete with your local Sephora and yet, I use them rarely…. that is until I tried Miracalis Anti-Aging Cream.  When I was told I was going to be able to try this product out by Miracalis I was thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream comes in a glass pot that is light weight and cute looking.  The cream it self is very soft and light.  I found that using a pea size amount was enough to get my whole face and neck area.  It applied on very silky and glided on well without any harsh rubbing to blend it in.  I used this cream twice a day after my daily skincare routine.  I used it in the mornings and at nights before bedtime.  It went on smooth and dried quickly with no residue left behind, greasy look or feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also odorless which I love!!!  Face cream should never have fragrance as that is a potential irritant to the skin.  Since I have very delicate skin that is set off by many products, this truly was a winner for me.  It never irritated my skin or dried it out.  This cream left my skin feeling and looking firmer and softer after almost just 3 weeks of constant use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can apply my makeup almost instantly after using this cream as it absorbed quickly into my skin.  This also works great at night right before bedtime.  As I am ready to hit the pillow after my night time skincare routine, its absorbed nicely and quickly with no nasty residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that I use this product more than any other face creams I have purchased in the past leaving me very satisfied.  I plan to continue using this creamdue to its benefits and the fact that my face looks and feels great so that&#x27;s a bonus as well!</li>
    <li> Really good face cream, nice base and it goes on smooth and creamy and it makes your face feel refreshed and slightly firm.</li>
    <li> I had been using other products from another exclusive beauty line for years, but this was too easy to pass up.  After using for a week, I noticed my skin was soft and felt like it was glowing.  I do not even use make-up most of the time when I go out, or use very little.  This an excellent product, I would recommend it to any woman of any age to try it.  Great price!</li>
    <li> It is thick and it is a nice cream. I don&#x27;t know how much it really works on getting rid of wrinkles; however, it helps keep my face hydrated.</li>
    <li> This cream leave my skin like a paper from trash can</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have very sensitive skin and this is everything it promises and more!!!!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed. I am 53 years old and have few  wrinkles but I thought I give this a try instead of my usual eb5 which I am going back to. What I found was a little didn&#x27;t go a long way. My skin felt drier than I wanted it to feel. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. We all have different skins so I am sure it may work for others differently.  I am 50% Italian and have olive skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom. She was a little concerned at first that I gave her an anti aging wrinkly cream, but after she used it for a while the results spoke for themselves. The product works as described, and my mom continues to talk about how she notices a difference day in and out. Both of us are pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I have been using the cream for about a week now and so far I really like it. At first time using it I liked how there wasn&#x27;t a strong overbearing smell like most creams have. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or oily anf I can even apply my makeup on top of it without any problems. After the 7 days I can say my skin in very moisturized. So far I have really liked the cream.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for  a few days, but, so far my skin feels like it&#x27;s getting an extra boost of moisture.  I</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! My skin got so dry to the point it hurt, then when I put make up on it looked like it was caky but once I put this cream on and applied my make up, my face looked flawless!! My pores shrunk and make up dosnt look caky,my make up dosnt sir on top of my fine lines,it looks like I have baby skin. I truly love this product!!! I will definitely be buying more of this!! Also my face looks much firmer and no fine lines!!</li>
    <li> The cream arrived in a timely manner, however, the cap on the jar was broken and cracked upon arrival. I wrote the seller who took NO TIME AT ALL to replace the jar. Although I did not think it needed replacing, since the cap did not effect the cream&#x27;s quality, the seller, of their own accord, sent a new jar. I was astonished at their level of customer care and service. Beyond excellent. The cream itself is very good. It is not greasy, easily absorbed, and leaves skin soft and smooth. I am pleasantly surprised at the seller and their product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. Packaging not satisfactory - lid was cracked.</li>
    <li> I am glad to find this product to try. So far I like it. I like the texture and the way my skin seems feel refreshed when I put it on.  I want to give it time to see if there is any marked difference from other products I have used.  I must say that I am 65 years old so it will take a miracle to give me skin with no wrinkles :-)</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I really like this product. This is the first time I have bought something like this that really showed results.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I got this moisturizer about 3-4 weeks ago and love it. It is nice and thick and I only need a dab on each cheek and a little on my forehead to cover my entire face. It makes my skin feel so soft and has done an awesome job at keeping it moisturized. I have tried a lot of brands of these creams and this one is right up there with all the top notch name brands that every one knows. I would buy this one again if I ever run out of my large stock of creams I now have. It is very nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> This cream is really great!I had a very dry skin since I moved here in alaska.and it&#x27;s irritates me. But once I tried this cream I noticed the changes.my face is so soft now and oil free..It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and not itchy when I first tried this. So I can say it really works great! I will recommend this to my friend has the same problem as mine.thanks for the great product and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I was offered Miracalis by the manufacturer for review, so that is out there right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for the last 12 days. The cream is light in texture, which is really nice. There is no extraneous scent, a huge plus in my opinion.  So those points attracted me right away. Then, I got a surprise. I actually am seeing a difference in my skin. Yea, that sounds sort of naive I suppose, but I have never really paid much attention to &amp;#34;expensive skin creams.&amp;#34; I am more a &amp;#34;Jergens&amp;#34; girl myself...  just because I never really paid much attention to &amp;#34;frilly.&amp;#34; Maybe I was wrong - and given that my lines are pretty much going away, well, yep, I probably should have paid more attention before now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice seeing the fine lines disappear. Of course, the heavy lines from my lifelong stress and chronic pain would pretty much need a spackle gun to fill in, but hey, seeing the lines around my eyes fade away is really nice. It certainly makes looking in the mirror more pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very nice cream that does what it says, and isn&#x27;t that what this is all about? Many products shout from the rooftops about how &#x27;special&#x27; they are without delivering. This cream delivers. I can recommend it as being exactly what it purports to be. A lovely, smooth soothing cream that helps those fine lines. I can&#x27;t say if it keeps you from getting new wrinkles, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say that, but it is a smile-inducing moment when I can look in the mirror and the skin around my eyes looks so much better!</li>
    <li> My skin has never been this clear, soft &amp; it such great condition! I&#x27;m nearly 50 and it was frustrating to still fight acne! Not any more!!! I&#x27;ll always buy this!</li>
    <li> I like this product and like the consistency.  This is the perfect moisturizer to use at night for me.  Check out the full review of this product here: http://honeygirlsworld.com/miracalis-anti-aging-moisturizer-cream/</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. I use anti wrinkle creams as a preventative to prevent wrinkles.</li>
    <li> A bit &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; - I ended up only using it when the skin is extremely dry.</li>
    <li> This cream instantly made my skin feel tighter and smoother. The only draw back for me was that it made my face red for awhile but I do enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed using this night cream. It feels like a mixture between a cream and a gel. It feels cool going on your face. I do feel if you have real dry skin you will need to top this cream with a moisturizer. I have been using it every night for the last 3 weeks and I have enjoyed it. The cons to this product I feel is that 1 oz is not enough product most night creams come in around 3 oz.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look luminous</li>
    <li> I love this cream, been using it for a few nights and it is so silkly and creamy, takes very little to use and applies very easily, would recommend this cream to anyone, thanks</li>
    <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.</li>
    <li> To be a moisturizer, leaves your face considerably dry. I was not impressed with this product</li>
    <li> The cream is rich but non-greasy and easy to use.  I like it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for only 2 to 3 weeks and it looks like there are some improvements.  Will need a bit more time to evaluate its effectiveness</li>
    <li> This product did not produce!  I did not see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> i was never one to purchase products from companies who sold through amazon. I was always a bit skeptical. But I really liked this product. I goes on so smoothly. I have dry pealy skin and this cream helped so much. I put it on mornings before applying my makeup, and it helped my makeup go on smoothly without showing any dryness or peels of my skin! I noticed my skin feeling a bit tighter and I saw less fine lines near my eyes. My only issue with the cream I have had is I started to get a few acne breakouts, but luckily I have a regimen for that :)</li>
    <li> This seemed to leave my skin dry. Won&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> I love this product. A little goes a long way. My skin looks and feels like velvet! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the way this moisturizer feels. Silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I like it, seems to perform as advertised.</li>
    <li> Although I was excited at first that this product would deliver, it caused a reaction after having used for about 3 days.  My undereye area is an issue with slight crepiness (sp?) and fine wrinkles.  I decided to return because of the reaction.  I have realized that sticking with brand name, proven products for the undereye area are always better for me - Murad works better for me and I&#x27;ll stick with that line.  I&#x27;m 59 and cannot afford to experiment with my sensitive skin at this point.  The customer service for this product (Miracalis) is excellent, though!</li>
    <li> Love this product.. My skin looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> Received today. Wow fast shipping. I put a little on this eve. Felt good. My face felt soft not greesy. I&#x27;m 49 with out door weathered skin. Some facial products seem to make pores look bigger. This did not do this. Happy</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome product. My only complaint was that the glass top was cracked and broken when it was shipped to my door. However the plastic part still screwed on. I use once a day and seems to be making a difference. A little goes a long way, so it should last a while.</li>
    <li> I wonder why it has so many good reviews here. It doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> not impressed-just so so.</li>
    <li> The first bottle I purchased I loved it felt great as soon as I applied it to my skin and there was no fragrance which is important to me.  I opened my new bottle today and there is a slight smell which I can&#x27;t understand if it&#x27;s the same formula.  That is why they only get three stars - seems there is inconsistancies with each lot and manufacturing date.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that absorbs quickly for silky smooth skin and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily later in the day like most others. It feels great and it must work great because I&#x27;m 28 and getting carded again for cigarettes!</li>
    <li> I think this worked as an awesome day or night cream, it was not too thick or too thin, but right in the middle. Not oily at all either. Worked great for my sensitive skin as well. Didn&#x27;t make me break out so that&#x27;s also a plus. I&#x27;m young so I don&#x27;t yet have wrinkles but better safe then sorry</li>
    <li> Started to order this, then looked at the ingredients and massive Amazon hype and catch phrases they try to use to hook you in. There are tons of better products!</li>
    <li> I am only in my early 40&#x27;s, Is there a need for me to use this cream? My curiosity has gotten into me ... besides, there&#x27;s a fine line forming on my forehead so; I decided to give this product a try. I do not usually apply new products on my skin because I am prone to breakouts but, I dare myself to use this anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I got the product with in two days after I ordered it. The shipping and handling was great and the #Miracalis product arrived in good condition. The product looks exactly the same as shown in the picture so; I am truly happy and thrilled to finally try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Texture and Smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is creamy and I like the feel of my skin after the application. It is really soft to the touch and doesn&#x27;t have that oily feeling or dry skin after every application. I just truly love to use it especially before bedtime. It makes my skin relax because it has that cool sensation. Anyway, after few weeks of using this product, the fine lines on my forehead are still there and I did not see any difference. If it is fading a little bit, I cannot tell if it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be brutally honest with you that when it comes to the smell, I am not a big fan of this product. I am hoping that in the future, they will add a pleasant fragrance to this anti-aging cream. It has a smell ... not strong though but, not really pleasant to my nose.  It would have been perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does my skin look younger, attractive and glowing?  That would have been very nice but, I cannot answer that at this time. All I know is that after each application, my skin is truly soft to the touch and I have no breakouts considering I have a sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great product! Received from Tomoson, goes on smoothly and leaves me feeling clean and moisturized!</li>
    <li> I am loving this product! I am in my mid  forties and  I am seeing results after about two weeks of use!  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I use this cream at night before bed. I like the smell as it reminds me of vanilla. It leaves my skin soft and supple. I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  I used the sample up in ten days, so now I want to buy a regular size jar of it.  I don&#x27;t think I used it long enough to see any major difference in my skin, but I was beginning to see a small change.  I really believe that I will see a bigger change after using it for a few months.  I am willing to bet that I will see a bigger change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m still not sure if I see any change. I didn&#x27;t have bad skin to begin with, it&#x27;s just that my face is very dehydrated. I&#x27;ll have to continue use to see if there are any visible changes.</li>
    <li> This  product  GREAT- Ive tried many other anti-aging creams before and nothing tops this- I have combination skin and this blends in so smoothly &amp; is non- greasy- and Ive noticed the delicate area around &amp; under Your eyes have been signifigant- fine lines have just about disappeared- I also use some on my neck to keep away &amp;#34;turkey skin&amp;#34;- so Ladies If You want a product that lives up to its name- this is the one- too bad it doesn&#x27;t come in an industrial size, but I will continue to order it anyway on a regular basis! Thanks Miracalis- Your the Best! Fondly, Gerri.......</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because she was having problems with some other creams irritating her skin or being too oily. She tried this one and she has been using it everyday with no problems and she has started to notice some improvements in her skin already. Overall great product and shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with it so far! Great texture and a little seems to go a long way, just a few small dabs did my entire face. Very happy so far!  The cream is light in texture, which is really nice. There is no extraneous scent, a huge plus in my opinion. I love that Miracalis Anti Aging Wrinkle Cream/Moisturizer works for all skin types.Miracalis anti aging wrinkle cream is a daily moisturizer thats good to use on your face, neck, eyes, and hands.</li>
    <li> I felt and saw a difference immediately......In the past I have used many high end products but I think I am hooked on this product, as I started to panic when my supply was getting low.  I am so glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Works great. Goes on well but, with my oily skin in a few hours it along with so many other products I have used make my skin oily again. Of course I apply after my face and neck have been washed well.</li>
    <li> Very happy, this is my 2nd jar,</li>
    <li> So far I really love the facial serum with c that goes with this and this moisturizer is ok too, light and not at all oily.  The facial serum is better though. Really fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Great product. cant say more</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom. She was a little concerned at first that I gave her an anti aging wrinkly cream, but after she used it for a while the results spoke for themselves. The product works as described, and my mom continues to talk about how she notices a difference day in and out. Both of us are pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> Great product. On my second order and have seen a considerable difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this cream so much!  Makes me skin feel so soft.  It is definitely my cream of choice ;)</li>
    <li> I ORDERED ONE OF THOSE THINGS ON TV THAT THEY SAY DR OZ SAID WAS FABULOUS. I BOUGHT SAMPLES AND THEN GOT BILLED FOR THEM 2 WEEKS LATER. THE SERUM WAS GREAT AND THEY BILLED ME AGAIN AND DID NOT SEND OUT THE PRODUCTS THEY SAID THEY WERE BACKORDERED. BUT I SHOULD PAY FOR THEM.  MY BANK AND I CALLED THEM AND I AM GETTING A CREDIT, THEY LOOKED LIKE THESE BUT THESE ARE BETTER. . AND THEY WERE LESS MONEY. BE CAREFUL WITH THE PEOPLE THAT SEND YOU THOSE SAMPLES. I HAD TO FILE A DISPUTE. I ORDERED TWO TO MAKE SURE I WOULD NOT RUN OUT AS EVIDENCED BY EVERYTHING ELSE I BOUGHT. I LOVE AMAZON THEY HAVE EVERYTHING.AND I  TRUST AMAZON BUT NOT EVERYONE IS HONEST. I ORDERED THIS WITH THE CREAM AND EYE CREAM AND THE SPRITZ AND IT WORKS BETTER THEN THE OTHER STUFF FROM DR OZ. I BET HE DOES NOT KNOW THEY ARE USING HIS NAME. I BOUGHT 4 ITEMS 2 OR THEM X 2.  ALL OF IT X 2 - THE CREAM, SERUM, SPRITZ AND EYE CREAM. IS GREAT AND HAS HELPED MY SKING WITH STRESS LINES AND WHEN I DO NOT SLEEP WELL.  THE PRODUCTS WERE BETTER QUALITY &amp; THE EXACT SAME SIZE AND  THEY COST LESS AND THEY REALLY DO MAKE MY SKIN FEEL SOFT AND THOSE WONDERFUL LINES OF WISDOM SOMEHOW MANGE TO GO AWAY. I LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> This is a lovely cream. I felt the smoothness as soon as I put it on my face and decolletage area. I checked the ingredients and was pleased to see that mineral oil is not one of the top ingredients as this can clog pores. The company also sent me a very nice thank you letter with information on skin care tips which was a delightful extra.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the packaging. The jar does not come in a container. I feel for the price the jar should. When it arrived, the top of the jar was cracked. There was no bubble wrap around the jar. It was just placed in the package.. If I had sent this as a gift to someone and it arrived with a cracked top, I would have been embarrassed. If the jar does not come in a box , than Amazon needs to package the product with bubble wrap. Overall, this is a very nice cream and I like it very much! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer and think that if you use it everyday you see firmer skin over time. My problem is that I tend to use products rather sporadically. A little goes a long way. Great for the neck. Compared to other moisturizers on the market, I think you get great value for your money.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful facial cream. I love how light it is,not greasy,heavy or oily on the skin. It glides on easily and just gets absorbed instantly.  So easy to wear under makeup with no shine and when I applied it,I can feel my skin  so soft and feel it tighten right away. Iv only been using it for a few days,I can imagine how beautiful it is going to make my skin after using it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> You need to try this love it.</li>
    <li> I like how the cream is working on my neck area.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is a pimple here and there from time to time which I had none before using the cream.</li>
    <li> I got it . So far I like it . really soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few days. So I can&#x27;t honestly say one way or another. I rated it a five because everything so far has been positive.</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure how I was going to like this since i very sensitive skin. After using is for about a week, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my skin feeling irritated.  It leaves my skin feeling soft. Im really happy I got this to try. Ill be buying again!</li>
    <li> Feels really nice on my skin, and love only having to use one cream.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I was under the opinion that I had ordered a Clinique cream, so not sure how I received another brand.  Guess I&#x27;ll see what it&#x27;s like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Jo Moreland</li>
    <li> All I can say is My Wife Digs This Product, it works like it is Advertised  Happy to get more.</li>
    <li> This item says it was suppose to be new and and in a box.  This item arrived by itself without any product information or box and no seal.  It actually looked as though someone may have used it before.  I would hope this company would not send an already used product.  The moisturizer also had a funny smell which made me think it was old and was actually used by someone else.  I did try using it, but no change in my skin appearance, but maybe it was old.  Not very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Does do as they describe.&lt;br /&gt;I have just ordered my second bottle and noticed a difference when I had ran out.&lt;br /&gt;It does not irritate my skin and no strong perfume scent.&lt;br /&gt;You do not need to use alot follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will be glad that you did:)</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It&#x27;s not greasy like some of the others and that&#x27;s what I was looking for. I highly recommend this product and plan to use it forever. Thank you Alley. My husband says I look beautiful too lol</li>
    <li> I missed the dead line to return this product, however i wish i had never used it. I have a very sensitive skin, and this product caused extensive skin issues with a rash and weird spotting all over my face. Please be careful. This product is not for everyone and don&#x27;t use it if you have sensitive skin. Further, it has a smell. Its a bit like milk and root beer. In short, try something else.</li>
    <li> This product is simply great.  I noticed a difference in my face just a few days after I started using it. Even better, my husband did...without any prompting. He just said &amp;#34;you&#x27;re looking younger.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> the service is great but the cream made my face so dry and itchy. I only bought this because of the great reviews. I gave it more than a week and as I continue to use it, the more my face got so red and dry and now has red spot all over :(&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return the product.</li>
    <li> Very creamy.  You only need to use a small portion of it on your face. My face feels very smooth.  I strongly recommend ordering it from Amazon.  I came very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debby</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist and I was sent this to test. So far, So good! I&#x27;ve been using this for 3-4 weeks. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is much more supple than with my average store bought moisturizers. This one is mega hydrating, smooth and rich. Aside from being anti-aging it is great for use as a primer before makeup application. My morning routine consists of 1) washing with a konjac sponge and foam cleanser 2) Toning with toner 3) Using Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic Acid serums 4) Moisturizing with a cream/lotion. My night time is about the same except I substitute 3 with a rose hips oil and skip step 4.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well and can be worn under make up.  Wish it were a little thicker and more moisturizing, but overall, pretty good.</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this as a preemptive measure, I have not noticed the reduction in winkles (as I didn&#x27;t really have any). I will say however that I have combination type skin of dry and oily and I had no problems using this product. I have not had any breakouts and I think my skin looks very smooth and beautiful. I&#x27;m using this product in combination with the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My wife says that this is quite good. It makes her skin feel refreshed and toned. It is too soon to tell if it is helping with wrinkles or under eye darkness but she really likes how refreshed it makes her eyes feel!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Absolutely wonderful product. From purchase point to use excellent service and follow up.  Have been using this Moisturizer for several weeks and there is a very noticeable improvement in fines lines under and around the eye.  I have difficult skin, afflicted with Sebborheic Dermatitis (not fun).  Have also taken to cleansing the skin with organic olive and argon oils.  (Great way to cleanse the skin).  Bravo!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;PS  Just gave my mother a jar for her birthday 83!</li>
    <li> If you ever read my blog you hear me say this constantly... &amp;#34;there are products I like then there are products I love&amp;#34;. Right? Seriously, right now sitting on your vanity are products you love and there are products you do not know what to do with. Those products that simply didn&#x27;t work  as you imagined, you didn&#x27;t like the color pay off, didn&#x27;t last, where expensive but you didn&#x27;t like so what do you do with them? Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well here is a product I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Miracalis Anti-Aging Moisturizer Cream. It is a gentle moisturizer made for all skin types. It has a combination of Vitamin E and Co-Enzyme Q10. Two antioxidants that aid in the protection of the skin as well as its repair. Both needed elements for aging skin. Find it on Amazon HERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While those key ingredients are found in this product I find the to be simple, good, ok. In fact when I received it I has impressed that even the packaging was simple. No fancy logos, lettering, packaging, or anything. Just a simple small plastic jar, clean simple font, and nothing else. That kind of surprised me. In the world of mass marketing there was no gimmick on this one. So I gave it a chance and thought to myself.. well I hope the budget was better on what&#x27;s inside the jar. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t feel that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You see for me it felt simple. No dramatic experience, no real results, or transformable skin I can measure. It was simply a good moisturizer. No different then anything you can get at a Dollar Store. But then again that is what it felt like. The packaging, the product, and the marketing... just felt simple and unimpressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I know everyone has different skin and what may work for me may not work for you... I just believe that within this price point there are greater options. Try Adovia or InstaNatural skin care instead for results driven performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to search for proven results driven products that are blue caller budget friendly, that have great ingredients, hopefully US Proud Made, and that I believe will give you true results.t friendly, that have great ingredients, hopefully US Proud Made, and that I believe will give you true results.</li>
    <li> Love it, but won&#x27;t be purchasing again. So little product; such a big price. There are comparable products out there for a fraction of the price of this one!</li>
    <li> I LOVED the review you just left us: &amp;#34;Just started using the product but so&lt;br /&gt;far...love it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have used it for a couple of weeks and have noticed my wrinkles not as noticeable. I think it is  working</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this Anti-Aging  moisturizer through a promotion, I really like that it is not heavy  it is very light weight  and absorbs well into your face  it leaves your face feeling hydrated , I have dry skin and this feels really good on my face it is not sticky or greasy</li>
    <li> love the  product, the first jar I received was great. but the new jar I just opened had a big air bubble in the middle of the jar so the jar wasn&#x27;t as full as it should have been.</li>
    <li> Great skin cream.  I purchased an additional one for my mother.  She loves it too.</li>
    <li> I like this cream and will buy again.</li>
    <li> can see the wrinkle improved and reduced</li>
    <li> I noticed a definite difference within 2 weeks.  Lines much less visible and the overall look of my skin appears healthier and more even toned.  I will continue to buy, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to this product....a bit disappointed. Although my skin feels nice I see no change in my fine lines.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have noticed a difference in my fine line and wrinkles</li>
    <li> This is one fantastic face and neck cream and I&#x27;ve tried dozens, if not hundreds. Smooths and firms with out a harsh chemical peel feeling or weird over-tightening like you get with a lot of the &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; products.  Nice fresh mild smell, not over fragranced. Silky texture, not greasy or watery.  (Did I mentioned I&#x27;ve tried dozens?)  Getting ready to reorder it and the serum (which I haven&#x27;t tried) but I HIGHLY recommend the cream. Excellent product and great value.</li>
    <li> i think it is making my skin look better.</li>
