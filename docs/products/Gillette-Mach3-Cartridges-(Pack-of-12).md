### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent price.  </li>
      <li>For some reason, I still find this the best razor out there.  </li>
      <li>I needed razors... best to buy in bulk...</li>
      <li>Come on, didn&#x27;t you think Gillette was the best a man can get?  </li>
      <li>I am bald by choice and the best way to remain so is with the Mach3.  </li>
      <li>These are the best razors for the money.</li>
      <li>This product plus Noxema Shave cream are a perfect combo.</li>
      <li>To me, the MACH 3 is the best non-battery powered (see MACH 3 TURBO, which I have not tried at this time) disposable razor that you can buy today, that I have tried &lt;br</li>
      <li>Switched from fusion blades to these, very impressed.</li>
      <li>I communicated with the seller and he was great.  </li>
      <li>Has anyone else experienced this?</li>
      <li>As always, Mach3 provides a great shave.</li>
      <li>The durability is not that great though</li>
      <li>and they have been great.  </li>
      <li>Nice!</li>
      <li>these are a good deal</li>
      <li>I think its a good deal for the price these days.</li>
      <li>may be, good quality:</li>
      <li>a fair price, convenient shopping for me</li>
      <li>Seems like a good deal to me considering what they cost at the grocery store.</li>
      <li>But shaving my head (full head of hair) and my face with these is awesome.</li>
      <li>The arrived very fast and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a mainstay in my medicine cabinet for more than 3 years now!</li>
      <li>This is a nice price for 12 cartridges/$20 in case if one needs a replacement.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I found somewhere to get these replaceable blades at a good price.</li>
      <li>But that really has nothing to do with the quality of the razor, which is awesome.</li>
      <li>Good buy for sure.</li>
      <li>Amazon.com is a great place to find bargains and so far I have been happy with all my purchases from the people that sell merchandise through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Cheap price, good product.</li>
      <li>and after 3 shaves, I couldn&#x27;t take any more.  </li>
      <li>Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \\&quot;fins\\&quot; or</li>
      <li>I will order more soon</li>
      <li>How can this be the best if it&#x27;s only 3 blades?  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never come across anything that can better or even match the Gillette Mach3 system.</li>
      <li>Although these blades are marketed for men, I am a woman and love them more than the Venus \\&quot;women&#x27;s version\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Better than the 4-bladers.  </li>
      <li>My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  </li>
      <li>More is not nessesarily better</li>
      <li>I tried these before using sensor Cartridges but found to be making many cuts on my face.</li>
      <li>More blades, better shave...</li>
      <li>It lasted about 15 shaves and still felt better than the Mach3 that I was talking about.  </li>
      <li>Ask any person who shaves their head regularly and I am sure they will agree with this choice for the best and most nick-free shave.</li>
      <li>I hope the Fusion blades continue to be as good as the first couple have been.  </li>
      <li>Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I believe that Mach3 cartridges are more widely available than Schick Quatro cartridges, and that the 4 blades were overkill (let&#x27;s wait for the 7-blade razor to see how that works)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mach3 does a fine shaving job, and it&#x27;s better than the cheap razors you find at the supermarket.</li>
      <li>For tried and true, grab a MACH 3, and start shaving!</li>
      <li>Thank you for a smooth transaction.</li>
      <li>Clearly the mach 3 is better than the rest, more is not always better dude, the mach 3 is like.......</li>
      <li>Buy something else to qulify for free shipping.</li>
      <li>The cartridge fits onto my existing handle and provides a smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>I switched to the Gillette Power Fusion blade and it is Fantastic.  </li>
      <li>And so far nothing has worked for me as well as the good ol&#x27; Gillette Mach 3.</li>
      <li>It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I&#x27;ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don&#x27;t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades.  </li>
      <li>If you like the Venus handle though these blades will clip right on, I love it.  </li>
      <li>But for those on a budget and want a great shave, you needn&#x27;t go any further than the original MACH 3 blade.</li>
      <li>Recomendo, excelente produto, original.</li>
      <li>Customer service representatives are friendly &amp; helpful.</li>
      <li>This is a great value and it stocks me up for a long time.</li>
      <li>overall though a good value.</li>
      <li>but this package is not a bad deal.</li>
      <li>but they last longer and work better (very smooth shave) than any blade I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>The product was as described, and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Unfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems.  </li>
      <li>Overall good products, cut pretty well</li>
      <li>Thanks Gillette for making my skin smooth.</li>
      <li>and I get a weeks worth of</li>
      <li>Worthwhile if your skin is sensitive.</li>
      <li>I used a whole pack of 8 in 1 week, each blade was only good for 1 shave.</li>
      <li>and after a couple of shaves I have to replace my blade pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>First purchase by subscription and it&#x27;s a quick, no-brainer money and time saver.  </li>
      <li>Original product, work great, last a long time.</li>
      <li>Being lazy shopping in Brick-and-Mortar stores, I figured out that Amazon is a great source of everything I need including my shaving supplies.</li>
      <li>But they fit just fine and my picky husband likes them well enough.</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable and that is the reason I got them for.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t even feel the blade the first couple of shaves.  </li>
      <li>I decided to look online for Gillette Mach3 Cartridges to see if I could get a better price than what I was paying here locally.</li>
      <li>This item was well packaged as well as exactly as described.</li>
      <li>absolutely Yes!</li>
      <li>am pleased with the Mach3 and will buy again when this massive supply runs out.</li>
      <li>I got hooked on it since the first time I tried it</li>
      <li>For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the handle, and I&#x27;ve been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.  </li>
      <li>:) I got 12 for $14.95 I would have gotten 5 at my local store for that price.</li>
      <li>I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face</li>
      <li>I have used these since they first came out</li>
      <li>With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.    </li>
      <li>I use these with the newer vibrating handle, they give a nice close shave and cost much less that the newer ones...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed, however, that it doesn&#x27;t take that long before the shave isn&#x27;t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  </li>
      <li>PLus they were much much cheaper than buying from the grocery store.</li>
      <li>might as well go to the barber shop and have them shave you with one of those straight razor things.</li>
      <li>These blades sell for way too much in a store.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re durable (although not as much as I&#x27;d like).</li>
      <li>Thanks again</li>
      <li>Thanks-</li>
      <li>they are not the real deal.     </li>
      <li>You know, your like getting ready to shave and in your mind your thinking, \\&quot;Three blades?</li>
      <li>His shave comes out much smoother with this cartridge as opposed to the one with fewer blades.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I only get 2 shaves per blade, and the 2nd is NEVER as good as the first, obviously.</li>
      <li>recommendation is to go with one of the other products with more than 3 blades.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These blades sell for way too much in a store. This is a great value and it stocks me up for a long time.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality, blade feels blunt and scrapes rather than cuts..I used a whole pack of 8 in 1 week, each blade was only good for 1 shave. Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> These Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s shave closer, with less iritation that any other on-skin razor including Schick&#x27;s quattro.  Additionally, the blades last for at least 10 shaves before needing to be replaced.  The Schick blades were noticeably duller after on 4 or 5 shaves.</li>
    <li> Although these blades are marketed for men, I am a woman and love them more than the Venus \\&quot;women&#x27;s version\\&quot;.  If you like the Venus handle though these blades will clip right on, I love it.  And talk about long lasting- I kid you not: I shave my armpits every time I shower- almost everyday, and it is sick but I have used the same blade for weeks and weeks!  I don&#x27;t recommend that, but you&#x27;ve gotta do what you&#x27;ve gotta do.  Mach3 may be on the expensive side but they last longer and work better (very smooth shave) than any blade I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The product was as described, and arrived quickly. Thank you for a smooth transaction. Will use seller again.</li>
    <li> Amazon, by far had the lowest price on this 12 pack of Mach 3 cartridges.</li>
    <li> First purchase by subscription and it&#x27;s a quick, no-brainer money and time saver.  Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> No one ever \\&quot;taught\\&quot; me to shave, so I don&#x27;t really know how long to use each one. But shaving my head (full head of hair) and my face with these is awesome. I think I over use them a little bit, but one cartridge lasts me for like two, three months. (Shaving my entire head once a week) I&#x27;ve used them for about three years and have gotten an extremely close shave every time. Not once have I cut myself using them.</li>
    <li> It took 12 days for the cartridges to arrive. I have been using a Mach3 since they were released. These blades look like Mach3 blades and come in a box for Mach3 replacement blades, but they must be counterfeit. I had to put my old blade back on my razor until I can go buy replacements at the local drugstore. Save your money, a single blade razor is far better than what is being peddled here</li>
    <li> Packaging indicates they are from Brazil, but these cartridges work as well as any other Mach3 I&#x27;ve used.  As always, Mach3 provides a great shave.</li>
    <li> Third time I&#x27;ve purchased from this source. Refill blades are always fresh and sharp. Will always buy here as long as this product is offered.</li>
    <li> For years and years I used some variation of the Gillette Trac 2.  These blades gave me a decent shave, and I had no real reason to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3, but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave.  My first impression was that this blade is amazing!  I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it.  It was much smoother than any other razor I&#x27;d ever used before.  Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed, however, that it doesn&#x27;t take that long before the shave isn&#x27;t quite as smooth and close as it was at first.  And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time.  And then, at some point, I realize it&#x27;s just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the handle, and I&#x27;ve been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints.  I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon.  I try to get them for under $2 per cartridge if I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be better razors or blades out there, but I&#x27;m content enough with the Mach 3 that I&#x27;ve stocked up on enough to last me for years!</li>
    <li> For some reason, I still find this the best razor out there.  Better than the 4-bladers.  Maybe I&#x27;m crazy.</li>
    <li> Got this product before I even got the notification that it was sent out! Customer service representatives are friendly &amp; helpful.</li>
    <li> Overall good products, cut pretty well and they are sharp and protect you from hurting your skin.  The price is very reasonable and that is the reason I got them for.  The durability is not that great though and after a couple of shaves I have to replace my blade pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately bought a bunch of these as well, and even though they are packed in Gillette packaging (foil printing and all!)... they are not the real deal.     As a longtime Mach 3 user and head shaver... I can tell you without a doubt that these are discards or bootlegs.     The \\&quot;gel strip\\&quot; is fake or poorly done and the blades are not very sharp, which resulted in me, unhappy and bleeding.     I sent a pack to Gillette, waiting for their reply. Contacted seller... no response.     buyer beware.</li>
    <li> It came quickly in a small enough package to fit in our apartment mailbox. Cheap price, good product. They aren&#x27;t packaged for the US, I think they&#x27;re from another country. But they fit just fine and my picky husband likes them well enough. PLus they were much much cheaper than buying from the grocery store. Good buy for sure.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors for the money. I have tried all the new razor fad and still come back to \\&quot;old reliable\\&quot; Mach 3. Thanks Gillette for making my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all manner of shaving systems in the 40 or so years I&#x27;ve been shaving and I&#x27;ve never come across anything that can better or even match the Gillette Mach3 system. I have a very tough barbed-wire beard, but the shaves I get are consistently smotth and close. Recommended without reservation!</li>
    <li> I decided to look online for Gillette Mach3 Cartridges to see if I could get a better price than what I was paying here locally. I did and saved myself a lot of bucks.  :) I got 12 for $14.95 I would have gotten 5 at my local store for that price. Amazon.com is a great place to find bargains and so far I have been happy with all my purchases from the people that sell merchandise through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I get 4-5 shaves with each razor, after that it causes pimples. I find it too expensive, but there is no better alternative.</li>
    <li> This is a nice price for 12 cartridges/$20 in case if one needs a replacement. Being lazy shopping in Brick-and-Mortar stores, I figured out that Amazon is a great source of everything I need including my shaving supplies. Buy something else to qulify for free shipping. Additionally, if you shop with Amazon CC you will be earning 3 points for every dollar spent. Out of $20, this is like $0.60 discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Mach3 cartridges, I use them for years now. Compared to many other brands this is the winner. Expensive: may be, good quality: absolutely Yes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been up and down (literally!) with many a blade (Schick Extreme 3, Gillette Sensor 3, a regular bic) you get the idea. And so far nothing has worked for me as well as the good ol&#x27; Gillette Mach 3. It&#x27;s been a mainstay in my medicine cabinet for more than 3 years now! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does the job it&#x27;s intended to do quite well, and the regular 4 pk pretty much does me a week and half. Unfortunately, I only get 2 shaves per blade, and the 2nd is NEVER as good as the first, obviously. But this is more a matter of an individual&#x27;s facial hair, not so much the blade, and is too open to debate which detracts from the message I am trying to give. To me, the MACH 3 is the best non-battery powered (see MACH 3 TURBO, which I have not tried at this time) disposable razor that you can buy today, that I have tried &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one drawback may be in the price. In recent years the price of the original 4 pack has shot up quite noticeably. I can remember buying one for maybe $6.98 CDN and now I can&#x27;t find one under $8.98CDN, and this is at WAL-MART, no less! But that really has nothing to do with the quality of the razor, which is awesome. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The absolute very best shave may be found in one of those expensive Philips or Braun electric shavers with the fancy bells and whistles, and if you want to shell out extra cash for one, go for it. But for those on a budget and want a great shave, you needn&#x27;t go any further than the original MACH 3 blade. These days, there are a few spin-offs, such as the TURBO as well as a new FUSION brand (with 5 blades! Pretty soon they&#x27;ll make one that just takes off a whole layer of your skin!), and I am interested in checking those out, only thing is they are TERRIBLY expensive. For tried and true, grab a MACH 3, and start shaving!</li>
    <li> His shave comes out much smoother with this cartridge as opposed to the one with fewer blades. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I purchased the razor and blades as the double-bladed sensor was out of stock.  This is the worst design Gillette has yet put forth.  The 3-blade design is much too wide and clumsy. The only shaving done with this razor system was my first layer of skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Gillete Mach3 blade replacements.  The arrived very fast and in perfect condition. Thanks- I will order more soon</li>
    <li> I am pretty old and have used Gillette blades for over 60 years, so I am a fan.    I don&#x27;t know this for a fact, but it appears to me that Gillette might be lowering the quality of the Mach3.  I have used these since they first came out and they have been great.  The last few times I have bought new blades they have been dull and uncomfortable to use.  It seemed to get a little worse each time I bought new blades.  Previously, I used to get about 15 shaves on a blade before changing.  It dropped to 10 and maybe a little lower.  With the latest batch, they feel dull right from the start and after 3 shaves, I couldn&#x27;t take any more.  I tried 5 or 6 blades and they were the same.  I switched to the Gillette Power Fusion blade and it is Fantastic.  I couldn&#x27;t even feel the blade the first couple of shaves.  It lasted about 15 shaves and still felt better than the Mach3 that I was talking about.  I hope the Fusion blades continue to be as good as the first couple have been.  I communicated with the seller and he was great.  He apologized and I told him it was not his fault.  He  credited me with half the purchase price anyway, so he was more than helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I found somewhere to get these replaceable blades at a good price. Thanks again</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use these.  I know they are for men but I haven&#x27;t found a lady&#x27;s razor yet that could touch the Mach 3.  I had been buying the blades from that super-center store (you know the one) and it is more expensive to buy from there than it is to order here online from Amazon.  Especially if you get the free shipping with your order you can&#x27;t go wrong.  One blade will usually last me one week shaving my legs every day.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mach3 for over 5 years now. I got hooked on it since the first time I tried it; I have a thick beard and it is very hard to get a smooth shave. I usually shave every three days when my facial hair has grown enough to get the \\&quot;ounf\\&quot; effect. The blades slide over my beard and erases it: No pain and no mess. If you are a first time user, you&#x27;ll need to buy the  handle; this item only contains replacement blades. Oh, and one more thing, you can reuse these blades several times before disposing it; there is a tiny marker (just like the toothbrushes) which tells you when it is time; or you could just do like I do and replace it every month (8 to 10 shaves).</li>
    <li> Clearly the mach 3 is better than the rest, more is not always better dude, the mach 3 is like.......well, it&#x27;s like one of those sleeper razers.  You know, your like getting ready to shave and in your mind your thinking, \\&quot;Three blades? this can&#x27;t possibly...WHOA!, what the heck was that?\\&quot;  Well Mr., that there was a quality mach 3 shave.</li>
    <li> I shave... I needed razors... best to buy in bulk... these are a good deal</li>
    <li> I used Sensor or Fusion for years and never tried the Mach3.  They were good but expensive and I could only get 3 shaves per cartridge.  I thought I would try this deal since I had nothing to lose but $30. &lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer the feel of the Mach3 over the Fusion. I always felt the Fusion would slip off my face and cut my eye open.  Something about the grip and motion makes it feel unsafe.  Has anyone else experienced this? &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have thick, fast growing facial hair and I get a weeks worth of shaves off the Mach3 for half the Fusion price.  By day 5 it is rawer than the first day, but that is to be expected. &lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the Mach3 and will buy again when this massive supply runs out.</li>
    <li> This item was well packaged as well as exactly as described. I think its a good deal for the price these days.</li>
    <li> they do the trick. i cant believe razor blades in general are so expensive but this package is not a bad deal. i use each blade about 15 times before i replace them although they do dull out after about 8. but i am a very frugal and poor person so i cannot afford to replace them like a prince. overall though a good value.</li>
    <li> Excellent price.  Even if you pay shipping, it beats the Walmart price by a lot.</li>
    <li> Unfortuantely, these mediocre and overpriced blades are probably the best shave that most people will get from the mass produced blades and shaver systems.  It gives a better shave than most 2 blade razors I&#x27;ve tried (Excel, etc.), and 3 blades is about the most blades that I can use on a razor and be able to get to all the nooks and crannies on my face - thus I don&#x27;t recommend the Fusion or any other razor with more than 3 blades.  Here are a few other points:     1)  For thicker beards, these blades will rarely last more than a few shaves before you feel the tug and pull leading to razor bumps.    2)  I do give these blades credit for the flow through design allowing hair and residue to be rinsed through the blades without clogging them; but, then again, why do you need 3 blades in a razor?  With an exceptional blade, you should only need one to cut your facial hair.    3)  Another design flaw with this razor (as well as most razors) is that the \\&quot;fins\\&quot; or whatever they are called, on the bottom portion of the razor head (that supposedly \\&quot;prep\\&quot; your beard) actually scoops away the shaving cream before the blades have a chance to touch that portion of your face - so now you have 3 blades being pulled across inadaquately lubricated skin.  Trust me, you need the shaving cream there when the blade scrapes across.      4) I would recommend getting a classic double edge razor.  My wife has noticed a huge difference in my face and neck - no more razor burn!  I can shave everyday now.  I prefer a Merkur double edge razor which can be found on Amazon or you can do a google search for \\&quot;classic shaving\\&quot; to find them for cheaper.  The blades will usually run about $5 for a ten pack, and one of these super sharp blades last about a week for most people.  Think of the cost savings and the benefit to your skin if you only gave up purchasing the ever increasingly expensive and insane multiple blade cartridges.</li>
    <li> These still work great-no need for 5 blades that I see.  I use these with the newer vibrating handle, they give a nice close shave and cost much less that the newer ones...</li>
    <li> The razor blades arrived only two days after I ordered them.  The box and blades seemed a little bit cheaper than what I would buy in the store, but they work just fine.  The cartridge fits onto my existing handle and provides a smooth shave.  Seems like a good deal to me considering what they cost at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Switched from fusion blades to these, very impressed. I&#x27;ll be sticking with the mach 3&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Original product, work great, last a long time. a fair price, convenient shopping for me</li>
    <li> I think these were knock offs.  They didn&#x27;t feel very sharp and always gave me razor burn.  I&#x27;ve used Gillette mach3 for years and never had this problem.</li>
    <li> Mais uma facilidade que a America proporciona aos brasileiros. Se eu comprasse esse produto no Brasil, pagaria em torno de 70.00 dolares. Viva o consumismo! Recomendo, excelente produto, original. Use em um angulo proximo a 90 graus em relacao ao seu rosto. Aplique pouca pressao e use uma boa espuma. Para espumas Homemade, use de 3 a 5 gotas de glicerina para facilitar o barbear.</li>
    <li> Come on, didn&#x27;t you think Gillette was the best a man can get?  How can this be the best if it&#x27;s only 3 blades?  Who cares if it has an aloe strip?  Schick has 4 blades with its quattro.  Then, Gillette one-upped them with a 5-blader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to go with one of the other products with more than 3 blades.  More blades, better shave...it&#x27;s simple math.  Come on people, get with the program.  These are relics...might as well go to the barber shop and have them shave you with one of those straight razor things.</li>
    <li> I tried these before using sensor Cartridges but found to be making many cuts on my face.I would not say they are good or bad but it depends on skin condition of every person. I would rather prefer Gillite Sensor Cartridges.</li>
    <li> Once in a while i have strayed to other products but in end always have returned back to mach3.</li>
    <li> I bought the new 5 blader from Gillette, but went back to this one. More is not nessesarily better</li>
    <li> Yes, they are pricey and Lord knows why - but I&#x27;ve never gotten a closer or bloodless shave in my life. I received this product as a sample and I&#x27;m the last one to be a slave to advertising. Worthwhile if your skin is sensitive. This product plus Noxema Shave cream are a perfect combo. Never bleed again!</li>
    <li> Mach3 does a fine shaving job, and it&#x27;s better than the cheap razors you find at the supermarket. They&#x27;re durable (although not as much as I&#x27;d like). I believe that Mach3 cartridges are more widely available than Schick Quatro cartridges, and that the 4 blades were overkill (let&#x27;s wait for the 7-blade razor to see how that works)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save feature, they arrive at my door with discount and I never run out of them. Nice!</li>
    <li> I am bald by choice and the best way to remain so is with the Mach3.  Ask any person who shaves their head regularly and I am sure they will agree with this choice for the best and most nick-free shave.</li>
