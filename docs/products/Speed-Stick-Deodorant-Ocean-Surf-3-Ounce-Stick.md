### Positive Reviews

<ol>

      <li>this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>The product is great once you just apply it</li>
      <li>Great deal, smells good.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t soil shirts, and a great value!</li>

      <li>Bought this for my bf before, really good he won&#x27;t be smelly</li>
      <li>I always keep a good amount of these in stock.</li>
      <li>It is a good clean/masculine scent.</li>
      <li>I stood in front of shelves full of deodorants and anti-perspirants, not knowing which one is the best one.    </li>
      <li>Great product good price quick delivery</li>
      <li>And my girlfriends have always liked it too.</li>
      <li>AM SINCERE AND HONEST IN NOT LIKING THE FACT THAT I WAS TOLD I WOULD RECEIVE SIX,</li>
      <li>Deodorant is so much better than antiperspirant.  </li>
      <li>Be sincere</li>
      <li>I have been using this product many years now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the U.S. Army in Korea, and the commissary/PX doesn&#x27;t carry this, my favorite brand.</li>
      <li>My husbands favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>A great price for a great product that is curiously unavailable many times when I want to buy.  </li>
      <li>Love this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>good stick to use under the arms lasting protection all day smells great</li>
      <li>Then again, it&#x27;s a pretty good value</li>
      <li>Glad that they had it available.  </li>
      <li>Which is more important.</li>
      <li>Good pricing &amp; fast delivery for the product.</li>
      <li>Nice scent, won&#x27;t ruin your clothes and feels right.</li>
      <li>this stuff is easy to find in stores</li>
      <li>Good, but not as nice as the former &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent deodorant</li>
      <li>This particular Speed Stick deodorant is as good as it gets.  </li>
      <li>HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING FOR FREE.  </li>
      <li>Great product, pity it isn&#x27;t readily available in the UK</li>
      <li>: We welcome your honest opinion about the product--positive or negative.</li>
      <li>Include the &amp;#34;why&amp;#34;: The best reviews include not only whether you liked or disliked a product, but also why.</li>
      <li>This pack of 6 really holds you off from going to buy more for a while.</li>
      <li>haha :)</li>
      <li>tried and true, used it for years.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; sent deodorant was a true 5 star.</li>
      <li>The scent is not overpowering, which I like; I do not care much for deodorants that act as cologne, for lack of a better way to phrase this thought.</li>
      <li>Love it so much ...</li>
      <li>There is a reason why these sticks cost more that the other scents at the store, and many times are sold out!</li>
      <li>Just as advertised and quick delivery</li>
      <li>I think this is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>This is an easy way to buy, very convenient.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure: If you received a free product in exchange for your review, please clearly and conspicuously disclose that that you received the product free of charge.</li>
      <li>It has a mild, fresh scent, and lasts in extreme heat for a good twelve hours.</li>
      <li>I rotate between the Ocean Surf and the Fresh Scent.</li>
      <li>This stick is just the right consistency.  </li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>And delivered right to your door.</li>
      <li>Not too short, not too long: The ideal length is 75 to 500 words.</li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of Hawaii (&amp;#34;Ocean Surf&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>and so I did and it was working well for me for the first couple of months.</li>
      <li>THAT SEEMS PRETTY SHORT.&lt;br</li>
      <li>no complaints at all, like the large volume that comes as well.</li>
      <li>This deodorant is a great value; it lasts a long while, and is definitely not the cheap-quality stuff, which surprised me considering the price.</li>
      <li>Crisp, clean, personal choice.</li>
      <li>amazing value, especially for bigger size</li>
      <li>Feel free to talk about related products and how this item compares to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks for sending</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and as described.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not that much more to be said -- you get six in the box and the price is roughly comparable to the continental U.S.</li>
      <li>As part of the plot of this episode George sings his own last name in the same melody as the “By Mennon”</li>
      <li>So, I went with plain old deodorant - which must be good for you,</li>
      <li>I usually only buy the original sent.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Can not find this product in the stores where I live.</li>
      <li>This one pack will probably last for a whole year if you don&#x27;t use too much when applying.</li>
      <li>Everyone is particular to a certain product, and this is the only deodorant I will use.  </li>
      <li>Sweating is natural!</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and cool but isn&#x27;t wet and drippy like the typical gel deodorants out there.  </li>
      <li>I WROTE A CLEAR REVIEW AND ONE THAT WAS NOT DEROGATORY OR PROFANE, YET IT WAS CENSORED BY AMAZON, SO LET ME FOLLOW THEIR GUIDELINES REGARDING</li>
      <li>Mostly meant for reapplication throughout the day for me at least.</li>
      <li>but the protection doesn&#x27;t last too long especially for a person like myself who can sweat a lot at certain occasions.</li>
      <li>I am a female and yes, this deodorant does smell a little masculine but it not so much that I can&#x27;t mask it with perfumes or lotions.</li>
      <li>Being quite active during the day and sweating a little more than the average person, I take out a star as I find sometimes I have to reapply mid day.  </li>

<li> It covers any odor well and have not experienced any skin irritation.</li>

Feel free to talk about related products and how this item compares to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY: BECAUSE THIS IS ADVERTISED AS BEING SIX, OR 6, AND IT CAME TO ME WITH FIVE, OR 5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Be specific: Your review should focus on specific features of the product and your experience with it. For video reviews, we recommend that you write a brief introduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPECIFICALLY, THEY SAY THEY ARE SELLING YOU SIX, AND ONLY SEND FIVE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Not too short, not too long: The ideal length is 75 to 500 words. Video reviews have a 10-minute limit, but we recommend 2 to 5 minutes to keep your audience engaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY SEND YOU FIVE, INSTEAD OF SIX AS ADVERTISED.  THAT SEEMS PRETTY SHORT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Be sincere: We welcome your honest opinion about the product--positive or negative. We do not remove reviews because they are critical.

    <li> My son asked me to get him deodorant sticks one day (he was 12 at the time), and I ventured out to a nearby drug store.  I have never used deodorant myself so I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  I stood in front of shelves full of deodorants and anti-perspirants, not knowing which one is the best one.    I decided to test-smell each one of the deodorants (since my husband advised me against getting our son anti-perspirants) there and I came across this one.  It does not make my son smell like a grown man, yet scented enough to make him smell, say, \\&quot;groomed and presentable\\&quot;.    Some stores don&#x27;t carry this scent so I decided to check on Amazon and I found them here.  It is on my shopping list now.</li>
    <li> Excelente duration 8months. I use this product since 2001. But</li>
    <li> Everyone is particular to a certain product, and this is the only deodorant I will use.  It has a mild, fresh scent, and lasts in extreme heat for a good twelve hours.</li>
    <li> This particular Speed Stick deodorant is as good as it gets.  It goes on smooth and cool but isn&#x27;t wet and drippy like the typical gel deodorants out there.  This stick is just the right consistency.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years now and plan on using it for as long as it&#x27;s around.  If you don&#x27;t like wet gel or cakey, pasty white deodorants, then give Speed Stick Ocean Surf a try.  Nice scent, won&#x27;t ruin your clothes and feels right.</li>
    <li> My partner loves this deodorant and we have a hard time finding it in stores so we bought this on amazon.  Glad that they had it available.  Wish they sold them in smaller packs.  I hope deodorant lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> For some reason I only wear deodorant, not antiperspirant+deodorant. I guess I&#x27;m not that sweaty of a guy. Not sure why I&#x27;m telling everyone on the internet. Regardless, this is my go-to brand, and it was great to buy it as a 6-pack to stock up.</li>
    <li> The product is great once you just apply it but the protection doesn&#x27;t last too long especially for a person like myself who can sweat a lot at certain occasions. I am a female and yes, this deodorant does smell a little masculine but it not so much that I can&#x27;t mask it with perfumes or lotions. A relative of mine suggested for me to try it because I wanted to stay away from those aluminum, parafum ingredients and so I did and it was working well for me for the first couple of months. It&#x27;s just that my body got used to it and a few hours after application, I started to give off an odor. Hence, it don&#x27;t believe this product is the best for all day protection. Mostly meant for reapplication throughout the day for me at least.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product many years now. It is a slight bit more expensive per ounce on here but I gave it a chance being I didn&#x27;t want to got to the store that day.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product.</li>
    <li> Great product good price quick delivery</li>
    <li> amazing value, especially for bigger size</li>
    <li> tried and true, used it for years. this stuff is great. no complaints at all, like the large volume that comes as well.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you with the wet feeling you can get with some and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. After my grandmother got a nasty case of Dementia, I researched all the ways to avoid it. And the aluminum in anti-perspirant came up a lot. So, I went with plain old deodorant - which must be good for you, right? It&#x27;s made up of about 30 ingredients that have chemical names about 50 letters long. Anyway, hopefully not as bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;So this stuff is easy to find in stores and I like the smell. And my girlfriends have always liked it too. Which is more important.</li>
    <li> Good, but not as nice as the former &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent deodorant, that was discontinued a few years ago. I&#x27;d give it 4.5 stars. The &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; sent deodorant was a true 5 star.</li>
    <li> Being quite active during the day and sweating a little more than the average person, I take out a star as I find sometimes I have to reapply mid day.  Then again, it&#x27;s a pretty good value and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised and quick delivery</li>
    <li> This deodorant is a great value; it lasts a long while, and is definitely not the cheap-quality stuff, which surprised me considering the price. The scent is not overpowering, which I like; I do not care much for deodorants that act as cologne, for lack of a better way to phrase this thought.</li>
    <li> This pack of 6 really holds you off from going to buy more for a while. I&#x27;m just on my 2nd one! This one pack will probably last for a whole year if you don&#x27;t use too much when applying. I usually go about 10-15 strokes for each armpit</li>
    <li> A great price for a great product that is curiously unavailable many times when I want to buy.  And delivered right to your door.</li>
    <li> Bought this to try it and not go to the store. Call me lazy but I loved it. I usually only buy the original sent. I think this is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Great! Love it so much ...</li>
    <li> Deodorant is so much better than antiperspirant.  Sweating is natural!</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite deodorant. Works great for him.</li>
    <li> Crisp, clean, personal choice.</li>
    <li> Good pricing &amp; fast delivery for the product.</li>
    <li> Good buying experience.</li>
    <li> I have reactions to just about every pitstick except this one.  I will be screwed or stinky when they discontinue this.</li>
    <li> Standard item, used for years. This is an easy way to buy, very convenient.</li>
    <li> good stick to use under the arms lasting protection all day smells great cannot get this product here in Australia</li>
    <li> Awesome deodorant. If it was on Subscribe &amp; Save id order it here instead.</li>
    <li> I prefer these over anti perspirant/deodorant varieties, simply because they stop my armpits smelling like arse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for close to 20 years. Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t soil shirts, and a great value!</li>
    <li> I always keep a good amount of these in stock. It is a good clean/masculine scent. There is a reason why these sticks cost more that the other scents at the store, and many times are sold out!</li>
    <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as promised.</li>
    <li> This deodorant provides me with all day odor protection.  I like the scent but there are plenty of other scents to choose from in the Speed Stick arsenal if &amp;#34;Ocean Surf&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t to your liking.  I also appreciate that this comes in a six pack and that it ships to military addresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss the &amp;#34;By Mennen&amp;#34; marketing slogan and can&#x27;t think of Speed Stick without the Mennen brand.  I remember the Seinfeld episode that used the Mennen jingle.  “What’s the difference? You know the way I work, I’m like a commercial jingle. First it’s a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, you hum it in the shower, by the third date it’s “By Mennen” -George Costanza, Episode 142, The Chicken Roaster-  As part of the plot of this episode George sings his own last name in the same melody as the “By Mennon” jingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I last purchased this in February of 2015 and paid $16.84 for the six pack.</li>
