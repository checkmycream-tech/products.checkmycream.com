      <li>I heard good reviews about the Sedu</li>

      <li>happiness with it??</li>
      <li>It worked great, smooth even heat, didn&#x27;t catch my hair, and my hair looked beautiful.  </li>
      <li>perfect size and my last one lasted for 5.5 years!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the Sedu and the Chi.</li>
      <li>:]</li>
      <li>[how many is that?</li>
      <li>My roomate&#x27;s CHI was amazing, but the original CHI does not have temp control.  </li>
      <li>All in all this flat iron is great!</li>
      <li>This is the BEST flat iron on the market!</li>
      <li>I have had many through the years, and this one is average at best.  </li>
      <li>My daughter loved it, thanks</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t fry my fine, color-treated hair.</li>
      <li>It works great and who doesn&#x27;t love pink?</li>
      <li>Great flat iron!</li>
      <li>The light weight makes it effortless to use, the long swivel cord is great, and it has an adjustable range of temperatures</li>
      <li>This product worked great while it lasted, but it doesn&#x27;t have a long life.  </li>
      <li>my cheap one make better job than this one , nice color , not crazy about how its work , i regreted not getting the big size.</li>
      <li>I was also pleased that the pink is not cloying, a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly and works well without the smell of burning hair.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly and my daughter loves it.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price, I&#x27;ve owned over 15 different flat irons, and this one is the best!</li>
      <li>/&gt;She loved it while she was able to use it, but the right angle, power cord strain relief did not protect the inner electrical wires from breaking after 1000 days of daily service and storage.</li>
      <li>It works better than those cheap Revlon and Conair flat irons.</li>
      <li>I really hope everyone gets one; it&#x27;ll really make your hair smooth, soft, and shiny! :]</li>
      <li>The Sedu lasted a really long time and had a nice cord, but it didn&#x27;t have plates like the Solia.</li>
      <li>When it first arrived, I was a little taken aback at how light this unit is, and I originally thought that light might equal cheap and flimsy, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it so far.</li>
      <li>I bought this iron because the temp adjustment goes down to 140, making it more hair-friendly for the fine haired folks.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I may be able to take it apart and solder the fragile wires back together, but we&#x27;ll probably just be safe and buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I personally like this better than the chi.</li>
      <li>and it probably would have last longer if i hadn&#x27;t of dropped it so many times.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>i LOVE this flat iron!</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
      <li>I have used many different flat irons over the years and Solia performs far better than any</li>
      <li>This keeps her hair straight all day.  </li>
      <li>There are inexpensive irons at the local drugstores in the U.S. that have dual currents or just buy a cheap one when you get to your destination.</li>
      <li>It really makes your hair silky smooth and flat.  </li>
      <li>I found nothing special about this flat iron.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This flat iron gets HOT!</li>
      <li>The surface is not as smooth as other ceramic irons and it just didn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>The Chi fried my hair and this is perfect for those who have bleached or damaged hair like mine as it is really gentle while keeping your hair straight in bad weather!</li>
      <li>Like most swivel cords, it is fragile so don&#x27;t mess with it a lot or move it around too much.</li>
      <li>never thought this iron would last this long, but it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
      <li>My hair is wavy and prone to frizz, and Solia straightens my hair without frizz and leaves it soft and shiny!  </li>
      <li>It might still be alive if it was never wrapped up and put away after each use...</li>
      <li>This iron only operates on U.S. current, it does not have a higher setting for use overseas.</li>
      <li>Heats up quick, the cord is long enough and so far has been lasting me!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had this flat iron a few years ago and I was upset when it broke. I heard good reviews about the Sedu so I bought that one next. It was more expensive and was not better by any means, so when it broke I went back to the Solia. I love this flat iron! It works better than those cheap Revlon and Conair flat irons. It&#x27;s better than the Sedu and the Chi. The Sedu lasted a really long time and had a nice cord, but it didn&#x27;t have plates like the Solia. The Chi fried my hair and this is perfect for those who have bleached or damaged hair like mine as it is really gentle while keeping your hair straight in bad weather! I would warn those who buy this product to be careful of the cord. Like most swivel cords, it is fragile so don&#x27;t mess with it a lot or move it around too much. All in all this flat iron is great!</li>
    <li> I personally like this better than the chi. The color was a plus but the product itself is great. Heats up quick, the cord is long enough and so far has been lasting me! The only thing I dont like it the on off switch is in the inside but its so minor.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it, thanks</li>
    <li> Was not impressed with this iron at all. The temp gauge is done in white on a pink background so it&#x27;s very hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;Turned very low and it still fried the ends of my hair.  The surface is not as smooth as other ceramic irons and it just didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Heats up quickly and works well without the smell of burning hair. I like that the cord swivels and stays out of the way.     I think I should have bought the wider one, 1\\&quot; is perhaps too narrow for my hair, but that&#x27;s my fault. If I feel I need a wider one, I would buy the Solia again.     Traveler warning: This iron only operates on U.S. current, it does not have a higher setting for use overseas. Even with a converter, it does not work overseas, so don&#x27;t bother to pack it. There are inexpensive irons at the local drugstores in the U.S. that have dual currents or just buy a cheap one when you get to your destination.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron 2 years ago.  It worked great, smooth even heat, didn&#x27;t catch my hair, and my hair looked beautiful.  Only problem, which is a BIG one, it quit working 2 days after my warranty ran out.  Hmmmm, I&#x27;ll call that fishy.  This product worked great while it lasted, but it doesn&#x27;t have a long life.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing one again.  I&#x27;ll be going back to corioliss, it lasted 8 years before I had to replace it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron gets HOT! It really makes your hair silky smooth and flat.  I highly recommend it.  Great product for the money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after careful reviews of other straighteners and after all the recommendations; ordered.  Product is impressive and quite sturdy feeling.  Heats up quickly and my daughter loves it.  She&#x27;s had other straighteners in the past that left her straight hair in the morning and frizzy in the afternoon.  This keeps her hair straight all day.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used many different flat irons over the years and Solia performs far better than any I have ever used. My hair is wavy and prone to frizz, and Solia straightens my hair without frizz and leaves it soft and shiny!  I love it!! My sister has one as well and she loves it! My hair looks like I got it done at the salon after using this flat iron. It used to take me at least 2 1/2 hours to press and straighten my hair, but with Solia I don&#x27;t even have to use a pressing comb and now it takes me less than an hour to straighten my hair.  This is the BEST flat iron on the market!</li>
    <li> I found nothing special about this flat iron.  I have had many through the years, and this one is average at best.  I have been using one with longer plates which may be the issue.  I ended up returning the item.</li>
    <li> I have this iron and I like it; I bought it after looking over lots of reviews. My roomate&#x27;s CHI was amazing, but the original CHI does not have temp control.  I bought this iron because the temp adjustment goes down to 140, making it more hair-friendly for the fine haired folks.  Four stars because I don&#x27;t personally like the plates the move, because you have to place hair carefully in the middle so strands don&#x27;t get caught/pulled as the adjustable plates push in (a feature promoted as heating hair evenly). I was also pleased that the pink is not cloying, a nice surprise.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price, I&#x27;ve owned over 15 different flat irons, and this one is the best!</li>
    <li> My daughter truly likes her flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickness of heat * * * * */5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Color * * * */5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Comfort * * * * */5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My happiness with it?? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * [how many is that? XD]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great product! :] I really hope everyone gets one; it&#x27;ll really make your hair smooth, soft, and shiny! :]</li>
    <li> I gave this Solia flat iron to my wife for Xmas in 2009. It stopped working yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loved it while she was able to use it, but the right angle, power cord strain relief did not protect the inner electrical wires from breaking after 1000 days of daily service and storage. It might still be alive if it was never wrapped up and put away after each use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be able to take it apart and solder the fragile wires back together, but we&#x27;ll probably just be safe and buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars for three years of satisfactory performance.</li>
    <li> my cheap one make better job than this one , nice color , not crazy about how its work , i regreted not getting the big size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a straightening iron. It&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s okay. I use it everyday and it does the job.</li>
    <li> When it first arrived, I was a little taken aback at how light this unit is, and I originally thought that light might equal cheap and flimsy, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it so far. The light weight makes it effortless to use, the long swivel cord is great, and it has an adjustable range of temperatures so I don&#x27;t fry my fine, color-treated hair. Not all flat irons have adjustable temperatures, so that&#x27;s what sold me on this model. I&#x27;m styling impaired, so I need all the help I can get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 4/17/2012**&lt;br /&gt;I never thought this iron would last this long, but it&#x27;s still going strong. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! Makes my hair shiny and silky.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. I have 4c hair and it is wonderful. I highly recommend this flat iron. I need to purchase another one because I broke a piece off but it still works like a champ.</li>
    <li> The replaced a GHD that I fried trying to use in Europe.  It works great and who doesn&#x27;t love pink?</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend for her graduation from cosmetology school. She loves it!</li>
    <li> i LOVE this flat iron! perfect size and my last one lasted for 5.5 years! and it probably would have last longer if i hadn&#x27;t of dropped it so many times. this flat iron is light enough that you don&#x27;t get tired doing your hair and heats up in seconds.</li>
