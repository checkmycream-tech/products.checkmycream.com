      <li>Very nice plate!</li>
      <li>The etchings are perfect and the images are gorgeous!</li>
      <li>Attractively packaged in an envelope and mock leather sleeve, it&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
      <li>This plate is amazing!</li>
      <li>I own all the Cici&amp;Sisi plates - had to have this xl one too!</li>
      <li>But I guess for ppl that already have a stamper and just need a plate, it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>Love love love this plate!!!</li>
      <li>It was in a really nice case and it seemed like it was made from really good material.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with their very high quality.</li>
      <li>Absolutely excellent very high quality stamping plate.  </li>
      <li>It was also a nice weight.</li>
      <li>and it comes in a nice case.</li>
      <li>It seems like the image would transfer really nicely.</li>
      <li>Excellent high quality.</li>
      <li>I love all the design.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Arrived as promise and safely packaged.</li>
      <li>Love this plate -</li>
      <li>I love this stamping set of designs.</li>
      <li>Love everything about this plate.  </li>
      <li>But a truly awesome stamping plate especially for the money.  </li>
      <li>I love all the designs &amp; it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to stamp with.&lt;br /&gt;Adorable</li>
      <li>In other words, each stamp is a full nail, which is awesome and what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t flimsy or cheap.</li>
      <li>They are terrific to use, come out great.</li>
      <li>All images picked up cleanly, and had no problems with getting images to fit my nails.</li>
      <li>So I re gifted it because I didn&#x27;t even realize what it was at first.</li>
      <li>I especially love that while it&#x27;s clearly a holiday themed plate that there are still images that will be useful all year long.  </li>
      <li>I love all the patterns and will be purchasing any new plates this company makes.</li>
      <li>The actual plate looked really nice.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite brand of stamping plates.</li>
      <li>a different stamp is very &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34; looking and a bit overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Just be aware that the images are very &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I really do like this.</li>
      <li>The back is smooth plastic</li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It is thick and backed much better than any plate I&#x27;ve ever gotten...and I have ALOT of stamping plates!  </li>
      <li>It is very sturdy and the polish adheres to the stamper well making a clear image on your nails.</li>
      <li>What I really do like about this is that at the bottom of the plate you can choose any where you want to stamp from since it is a continuous design, guaranteeing your thumb nails will be completely covered.</li>
      <li>Clear images.</li>
      <li>I really want to re order it soon and actually use it.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t use some of the bigger images as a whole.</li>
      <li>I completely accidentally bought this.</li>
      <li>The back of it had this nice thick shiny finish with a Christmas tree on it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the images,  but after receiving the second damaged playe, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order again.  </li>
      <li>It is like people would have to study your nails for at least a full minute to register what each stamp was depicting!  </li>
      <li>Also one of the few to make full nail designs big enough for longer nails.</li>

    <li> Very nice plate! Attractively packaged in an envelope and mock leather sleeve, it&#x27;s a great bargain. All images picked up cleanly, and had no problems with getting images to fit my nails. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!</li>
    <li> I really do like this. It is very sturdy and the polish adheres to the stamper well making a clear image on your nails. It used to be that some nail plate images were too small and I was unable to cover my whole thumb nails - I do not have that problem with this plate and in fact, I would argue that some of the images might be too big making them difficult to recognize. What I really do like about this is that at the bottom of the plate you can choose any where you want to stamp from since it is a continuous design, guaranteeing your thumb nails will be completely covered.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this plate.  I especially love that while it&#x27;s clearly a holiday themed plate that there are still images that will be useful all year long.  The images are well etched and stamp quite well.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this stamping set of designs. They are terrific to use, come out great.</li>
    <li> Love love love this plate!!!</li>
    <li> This plate is amazing! All the Cici&amp;sisi plates are though. The images are a little bigger than some of the other sets though and I couldn&#x27;t use some of the bigger images as a whole.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I love all the designs &amp; it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
    <li> fast shipping. excellent quality</li>
    <li> A well made, beautiful plate!! Buying from Cici &amp; Sisi again!! A must have!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed. This is the second holiday plate I have received damaged. I LOVE the images,  but after receiving the second damaged playe, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order again.  😧</li>
    <li> Etching is deep so it&#x27;s easy to stamp with.&lt;br /&gt;Adorable packaging!!&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a protective sleeve.</li>
    <li> Great plate! No issues with it picking up images!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite brand of stamping plates. Every design stamps out every time. Also one of the few to make full nail designs big enough for longer nails. I love all the patterns and will be purchasing any new plates this company makes.</li>
    <li> I completely accidentally bought this. I have 1 click settings and pocket ordered it. I found out because I got a txt saying &amp;#34;your item has been shipped&amp;#34;. So I re gifted it because I didn&#x27;t even realize what it was at first. I didn&#x27;t use it but I will say that when I got it, I was shocked at how nice it was. It was in a really nice case and it seemed like it was made from really good material. Wasn&#x27;t flimsy or cheap. The back of it had this nice thick shiny finish with a Christmas tree on it. The actual plate looked really nice. It seems like the image would transfer really nicely. It was also a nice weight. I really want to re order it soon and actually use it. Wish a stamper came with it so I don&#x27;t have to order it seperately. But I guess for ppl that already have a stamper and just need a plate, it&#x27;s good. And it wasn&#x27;t expensive at all.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I was very impressed with their very high quality. I received it in a timely manner. Great job CICI &amp; SISI! I will buy your products again. Merry Christmas, and Stamp On Ladies!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent very high quality stamping plate.  The images come out perfect, with no problems like lack of transfer etc.  Comes in very high quality packaging and the plate itself is not the thin type of plate I&#x27;m used to.  It is thick and backed much better than any plate I&#x27;ve ever gotten...and I have ALOT of stamping plates!  Just be aware that the images are very &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34;.  In other words, each stamp is a full nail, which is awesome and what I wanted.  However, I found that doing all of my nails a different stamp is very &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34; looking and a bit overwhelming.  It is like people would have to study your nails for at least a full minute to register what each stamp was depicting!  There is just a lot going on!  So I am thinking that I may use these as accent nail stamps, like maybe for my thumb and ring finger, and use less busy, maybe single character stamps on the remaining nails.  But a truly awesome stamping plate especially for the money.  I definite keeper!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Also came in a protective sleeve. Love it!</li>
    <li> very happy with this plate!</li>
    <li> Definitely a well-made plate. Excellent high quality. The back is smooth plastic and it comes in a nice case. The etchings are perfect and the images are gorgeous! Perfect for the holidays and there are some winter-y ones on there so you can use them after the holiday season is over as well.</li>
    <li> Clear images. Took 1 star of because not much of a variety on the plate itself. Some are not attractive.</li>
    <li> Great plate for the holidays! I love all the design.&lt;br /&gt;I would keep it in its sleeve so you dont dent it up or nick .</li>
    <li> Arrived as promise and safely packaged.</li>
    <li> Love this plate - I own all the Cici&amp;Sisi plates - had to have this xl one too!</li>
