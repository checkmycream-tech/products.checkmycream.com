<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;lovely fragance!&lt;br /&gt;great purchase!&lt;br /&gt;recomended!&lt;br /&gt;i always buy this perfumes, it is my favourite and tobe my first online purchase of a perfume it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!</li>
    <li> My husband and I bought some small gifts/tokens for people whom we will be visiting abroad.  Since we are on a budget, we decided to get some gifts sets of perfumes, and some perfumes that are not too pricey.  For just casual friends/acquaintances, we will just give a small perfume sample like Givenchy, CK, Polo, and Sephora $50 gift set.  For my mother-in-law, I wanted to buy something a little more special than just the small-bottled perfume.  I searched online and found out that a lot of people like the smell, so I gave it a try.  For the price, this is really a good buy.  I have another Burberry perfume which I use:  Burberry Brit--which I love!!!  I receive many compliments when I wear it.  My husband loves the smell on me.  Hopefully, she will love/like this perfume as I have never tried this before. I will update this review as soon as I receive her feedback.</li>
    <li> At the beginning I was a bit cautious for buying perfumes online, but after I received I noticed that it&#x27;s a great purchase and it&#x27;s really worth it for the price. Will do it again!</li>
    <li> I looove the scent and my old Burberry Classic would stay on for hours like an EDP should.  This particular one fades like a body splash, making me doubt its authenticity or freshness.  I&#x27;m not sure what it depends on but now I&#x27;m stuck with a 3.3 oz bottle that I can&#x27;t even wear because the smell is gone by the time I step outside.</li>
    <li> I do not buy online to often , but the was a pleasure, The prices were great, and so far shipping was on time. Will be back again</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loves it. I know she&#x27;s a big fan of Burberry in general, but after looking at the prices of their products I knew I had to find something a bit more in my price range. While I was worried about buying a perfume online without having smelled it first (after all, I&#x27;m the one who&#x27;s going to have to smell it on her), this fragrance proved to be subtle and sweet and not at all overpowering. If you&#x27;re looking for a good gift for your lady, it would be hard to go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister because I bought her a smaller bottle of this same scent last Christmas and she used it all up.  You can get this large sized bottle for cheaper than you can find the smaller bottle at any department store.  It makes a good gift if you&#x27;re a guy.  It smells good if you are a girl.</li>
    <li> I have many allergies and I am very limited as to what types of cologne and perfumes I can wear? Years ago someone gave me some Burberry&#x27;s original scent and I have been wearing it ever since. It has such a light clean lovely fragrance. It is not overpowering and heavy as so many scents are these days. I can use one light spritz and enjoy the scent knowing it will not cause me any allergic reations and that I will not choke the people around me  either. You have to try it to find out how delightful it really is!! Great price from Amazon too!</li>
    <li> This product was shipped fast and safely. It isn&#x27;t an off brand and smells just like ones in the store. I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> More of a musk sent then I would like it to have.  Does not have a long staying power when you wear it.  Maybe the other brands smell better but I just didn&#x27;t care for this parfum.  Have wore it twice and will end up giving it to someone else in the family who may like it. One good thing, I did get a much better deal price wise buying it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance; I&#x27;ve had trouble finding scents that work with my body chemistry, and this one is a dream come true!  It&#x27;s on the spicy side and quite soft.  Super price through Amazon, too!</li>
    <li> this perfume is soooooo awful its not longlasting i spray myself like 50 times before going out the door i cant wait for it to be finished</li>
    <li> This is an awsome fragrance, a sweet powdery scent with a touch of peach and it also has great staying power.  Unfortunatly this one is being discontinued by the Burberry Company.</li>
    <li> Burberry Woman is the mother of Burberry Brit, that&#x27;s for sure! And thankfully for me, neither are like Burberry Weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burberry Woman is a very easy-to-wear, low-sugar peaches &amp; cream, vanilla-based scent. It stays close to the skin but lasts a very long time. The jasmine is well-behaved on me (which is rarely the case!). The fruits are present but not sickly or sugary ... just fresh &amp; sweet. It&#x27;s one of those rare fragrances which smells great from top to bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why this is classified as a fruity floral. It&#x27;s an oriental vanilla to me &amp; the freshest one I&#x27;ve ever tried. However, it&#x27;s not for the kids - this one is for women, imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burberry Woman would make a great choice for a ladylike office fragrance, an everyday scent, or even a bedtime perfume. It&#x27;s wearable nearly any time of the year, except perhaps on the hottest days of summer.</li>
    <li> By far, may favorite perfume!  So much cheaper through Amazon versus the department store!  Have been wearing this for years and LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This has been my signature scent for almost three years.  I try to have a bottle available at all times so when I saw that my bottle was a few drops from empty I immediately logged on to amazon to order another one.  I found perfumania accidentally but I&#x27;m soooo glad I did! I ordered July 27th and my package arrived today, July 28th.  Of course I compared the box and bottle to my current (I have purchased from other vendors and discovered that they sold knock offs) and both are legit.  Needless to say, I will be recommending this vendor to family and friends and will be purchasing more perfume in the (near) future!  Thank you Perfumania!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;ve been paying dept store prices all along.  I am extremely thrilled to know that better prices are on Amazon.com....thank u :)  this was also my first online purchase...yay!</li>
    <li> A lot of people are saying that the much more affordable Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy Love smells exactly like this perfume. I own both, and while I agree there is a huge similarity in the drydown, they are not identical. FL is more youthful. It&#x27;s much more creamy and sweet, and because of this it has more of that \\&quot;comforting\\&quot; feel to it. I&#x27;ve found it has better staying power, but poorer projection than Burberry. Burberry has many more floral notes, especially in the opening, which hardly resembles FL at all. It takes a good 30 minutes for the similarities to really come through. I think Burberry is more mature and perfect for the workplace. FL is more playful and flirty. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to work because it does not convey a serious nature. Burberry, on the other hand, is the scent of a powerful woman! Because I&#x27;m a poor college student and it&#x27;s so pricey, I save my Burberry for interviews and for the workplace in the future. Both are essentials in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - does anyone know if this seller is legit for sure?  I am seeing mixed reviews, but would like to consider buying at this price in the future. I just want to be sure they&#x27;re selling an authentic product!</li>
    <li> great product! at this price I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be authentic...It is 100% authentic and non-dilluted. Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> The price was great. The shipping was free. It arrived quickly. And I love my perfume! Thankyou.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product many times from Amazon, but this was the first from this seller (Amazon). It arrived looking perfect and wrapped. But once I sprayed it, it did not smell like Burberry or anything at all. It was a total fake and waste of money. I do not recommend purchasing this perfume from them at all.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this parfum and I always make it one of her presents for Christmas or her birthday on Jan. 7.  Finding a good deal is usually the hard part.  I used to go the Mexico a lot and would buy it there, but I wasn&#x27;t really sure if it was authentic.  This is by far the best price I have found (almost half the price the department stores are charging).  I&#x27;m very happy and my daughter smells yummy.  I LOVE it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this perfume.  It is classic and light in a way that makes it perfect for every day use, but special enough for special occasions.  Its not an overwhelming scent that you can smell from miles away, but rather intimate enough that when someone does smell it on you, they will be sure to compliment you.  It makes me feel special wearing this perfume, and the price couldn&#x27;t be more right.  The bottle is huge and so inexpensive! Nicely done, Burberry!</li>
    <li> Both requested and both love it - mission accomplished !&lt;br /&gt;The ladies think it is the best and always request it :)</li>
    <li> This has quickly become my favorite purfume.  It works better for daytime or special occasions; it&#x27;s very light and the musk/sandalwood gives it a particular sexiness.  A very feminine, breezy fragrance.  Only drawback, the fragrance does dissipate quicker than other purfumes I use.</li>
    <li> Great, authentic product for less than what I would have paid at a department store. Would recommend &amp; definitely use again.</li>
    <li> I bought one from amazon dealer. I like the smell but it fades so fast. Maybe 1 to 1,5 hours is maximum period for staying in my skin or clothes. :((</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this fragrance and get many complements, I&#x27;m making this my signature blend, due to your cost it&#x27;s now possible. Thanks.</li>
    <li> i get several compliments a week on this perfume.  i wear it every day and only very rarely do i switch to an evening scent for special occasions because this perfume works for both!</li>
    <li> First of, you&#x27;d better be sure you want it, cuz perfume &amp; cologne are not return-able on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to buy this for my girlfriend as a little gift for Mothers&#x27; Day, but it took a long time to be shipped, and I didn&#x27;t get it until near end of May.  By that time it was too late and I&#x27;ve already had to buy something else for her on Mothers&#x27; Day.  The thing that pissed me off was I didn&#x27;t know the thing could not be returned as there was no warning from amazon, so I for sure won&#x27;t ever buy perfume from amazon again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my girlfriend opened it, she wasn&#x27;t so thrilled about the smell, as it was a little too old for her (she prefers fresh-smelling perfume) unlike what people reviewed about this product.  I guess it will be sitting unused on the shelf for a long time.</li>
    <li> I never smelled anything like this, its great. It stays on all day with only needing just a little. Best scent I ever had. Love it.</li>
    <li> Received my order very fast-almonst next day! I like the fragrance and do not think that is not real Burberry, because the price is very low!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Burberry Classic by Burberry of London, since it came out; which was somewhere around 1998. It it the most romantic, safisticated, alluring fragrance ever. Everytime I wear it, which is almost everyday, I always get asked \\&quot;what is that wonderful fragrance you are wearing\\&quot;? Yes I do tell them. There are fragrances that some people like; this is one everyone loves, men, and women alike!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nov.14, 2011, I just recieved another bottle; and this was the freshest bottle I&#x27;ve had in a while.</li>
    <li> I have worn this for so long it&#x27;s ridiculous. Started in my very early 20s and now I&#x27;m in my late thir--never mind. I&#x27;ve gone through dozens and dozens of bottles and each time I empty one I think, \\&quot;I really have to try something else; variety is the spice of life.\\&quot;  And I go out and buy something new, traitor that I am.  And I wear it for three days and then pooh.  It&#x27;s not the same. And no one stops and demands to know what I&#x27;m wearing.  And my mom says I don&#x27;t smell like myself.  Not to mention I tend to be allergic-y to many fragrances; either I get horrid red splotches or develop a whopper of a headache. Burberry London (or Classic or whatever they&#x27;re calling it again) has never broken me out.  Only made me and whatever I happen to be wearing smell like delicious wrapped in yummy. So back to the classic I run.  Ergo, this is less of a review and more of love letter.  The base, top notes and all that jazz have been covered by reviewers more eloquent than I. All I know is that this is my signature scent and that if you are a female, try it. Certainly it won&#x27;t smell as perfect on everyone as it does on others, but Burberry is always worth a try. The Sandlewood, the Jasmine, the musk, the Vanilla.  Oh heaven! How is it so woodsy and sweet at the same time?  Dunno.  But Amazon&#x27;s price is really great and even if you can find it cheaper, I&#x27;m not about to turn my credit card over to some fly by night place and wait for shipping from some far flung place. (Most discount perfumeries have that less than reputable feel.) Some say it&#x27;s not long lasting but it lingers nicely on me.  And when I open the door of my closet, Burberry wafts out in the most delicate but insistent way. Once you&#x27;re converted, don&#x27;t even bother, like I foolishly do, to try and court another.  Just dance with the one that brung ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, there have been rumors of Burberry London&#x27;s demise for years.  And I fall for it every time and succumb to the deepest panic.  All I know is they still currently make it, and I have seen no proof otherwise. I hope some fancy schmany exec in charge of fragrance over at Burberry will look at all these 5 star reviews, (as in my mind he/she regularly searches Amazon for tube stocks or knitting needles) and is reminded again that the love shown here is just a teeny fraction of the international cult following this scent has.  They must never stop making it. Buying one extra bottle is never bad idea because \\&quot;discontinued\\&quot; is a four letter word to any fan of Burberry. Too much of a good thing, and this rarely applies to perfume, IS a good thing in the case of Burberry London.  Now I&#x27;m off the stare at the bottle (it&#x27;s never changed in all these years) and sashay in the general direction of anyone&#x27;s nose that&#x27;s around.rently make it, and I have seen no proof otherwise.

    <li> The product arrived on time and my mother loved it.  It was hard getting a person that would ship to Puerto Rico but gratefully this product was able to be shipped.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive present to add to what I had already purchased for my wife&#x27;s birthday when I came across this item.  The price and the size seemed reasonable and with the speedy free 2-day shipment provided by Amazon Prime, I received it in plenty of time.  It lived up to its reviews as my wife now says it is one of her favorites!</li>
    <li> excellent smell for women all ages try this one please  my sister had one and the hit in your nose is terrific</li>
    <li> Although sold in a Burberry bottle, the product I bought was not perfume.  I think it was scented water.  It smells like Burberry perfume, but as soon as you spray it, the scent disappears.  No other perfume I have \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; like that, and no matter how much I spray it the scent doesn&#x27;t last, so I can only conclude I was sold scented water.  I am VERY unhappy with this purchase.  Then when I wanted to return it, the return policy was something like perfume is considered a toxic substance and can&#x27;t be shipped back. This is the 1st purchase I&#x27;ve ever been unhappy with on Amazon, where I feel I got \\&quot;taken\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Timeless, the only perfume thats a must-have for me, that i replace every time it runs out.  Most other burberry fragrances are great as well.  But, of course, youll want to try it on your own skin at a dept store or something beforehand.  But def buy it here; its much cheaper.</li>
    <li> PLEASE TRY THIS ONE...only if you don&#x27;t mind giving off a sexy vibe!!.&lt;br /&gt;Burberry original fragrance,is one SEXY,PERFUME.I can wear this in the summer even though I don&#x27;t consider it a light summery fragrance;I prefer jessica mcclintock or cabotine for summer.However I was wearing this about 2 years ago and went to pick up a pizza I had ordered ;the manager kept smiling at me and finally asked what perfume I was wearing,was it expensive ect... kindly answered his questions and even wrote down the name so he would get the right perfume for his girlfriend. I&#x27;ve also had several late teens and 20 year old&#x27;s ask what i&#x27;m wearing(female)Ithink thisis a more of a over30 type fragrance,it&#x27;s worldly and to be frank,smells like an experienced womans smell I don&#x27;t mean that in a bad way on the contrary;you give off a refined respectable vibe,and somewhat conservative.IF this is not you,maybe skip this one.However if you want men to wonder how you smell respectable and sexy at the same time and what other secrets you possess.....</li>
    <li> This is the only Burberry scent I love! I&#x27;ve been in love with this scent for years. It has a very earthy smell, hint of musk and creamy vanilla! Yum!</li>
    <li> I know everyone has different preferences when it comes to smell but this perfume is a great one. I would highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a comfy, everyday scent mixed with a bit of vanilla.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone, got the product, well packed, and its the real Burberry.Also has a plastic wrapping on the box. I cant ever get off this scent.</li>
    <li> Smelled it at somebody else and liked it. Now I&#x27;m sort of getting tired of it (a good time for a new present :-)</li>
    <li> I am always cautious about buying products like this that are non refundable online and i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve EVER left a product review on Amazon from anything I&#x27;ve bought but I need to rave about this. This is my absolute favorite perfume and it costs 80 dollars at Sephora. For HALF THE PRICE I got it on here and it said it would be delivered in about a week and it was delivered to me the next day!! I literally just received it and I am thrilled. It is exactly what I have been buying at Sephora. Same packaging, same smell, same exact fragrance. I will absolutely be buying this from them every time now. WOO HOO!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong on Burberry&#x27;s products, especially at such a great value. I get many compliments when ever I wear this.</li>
    <li> Burberry Classic is a just that....a classic!&lt;br /&gt;And the price was excellent on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> My Mother of all people introduced me to this scent when I was about 24 years old, so going on 7 years now.  It is versatile as it can be worn from daytime into the night.  The lasting power could be a little better, but it lingers on.  Prior to being introduced to Burberry, my favorite sexy night scent was the classic Opium.  My fiance of 7 years does not like scents that are too musky, so he doesn&#x27;t care for my Opium. HOWEVER, HE LOVES BURBERRY OF LONDON.  I&#x27;m not good at figuring out tones, but it does have a musk tone to it but it is very soft but yet sexy as well. The musk tone is not the overpowering tone in this scent, otherwise fiance would not love it as much as he does.  It is also a sophisicated and professional scent, BUT AGAIN, SOFT AND SEXY AND VERY VERSATILE.</li>
    <li> I used Burberry several years ago, and recently decided to get back to it. Well it&#x60;s a wonderful, elegant and yet casual smell. I can wear it day and night, and always get complements on it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with it is that it doesn&#x60;t last as long as I wished it would. Nevertheless, I gave it 5 stars, because the smell is so wonderful that I couldn&#x60;t give it just 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;And of course, Amazon offers a great price on this product.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know where it came from as it had some arabic writing on the packaging (maybe duty free shop or surplus overseas)....but it was real deal and as expected.  great price and came on time</li>
    <li> Burberry is my favorite perfume. A summer scent sure to have others asking what you&#x27;re wearing! Light, sweet and addictive smell! A must have perfume to add to your collection!</li>
    <li> If you want your woman to smell like pure sexiness and to be asked what she&#x27;s wearing everywhere she goes, get this for her.</li>
    <li> I always purchase Burberry- its one of my favorites,  However the two bottles you sent were old, and the contents were brown rather than the light color.  Unfortunately, I gave one as a gift to a friend !I.  I  realize I should have returned, but I was travelling.  Will not take the risk of purchasing perfume on line in the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give  this a one star. I am like the rest of the reviewers. I have worn Burberry for years and love the fragrance. There is no Burberry scent to this fragrance. Colored water with an alcohol scent. Very very disappointed and I&#x27;m contemplating turning this company into the better business bureau. Money is too hard to come by to waste on scam artist and I am very surprised amazon would do business with this company.  Just wish I had read the reviews first</li>
    <li> Run dont walk and buy this perfume. It is soft but interesting and it can be used everyday and yet it is also great for the evening.  If you are looking for something soft but long lasting get this one!</li>
    <li> i used this fragrance when i got married October 16 2004, i loved it then and love it still i want more, this will be my sent.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! it&#x27;s not even perfume, it is scented water. you cannot return it. i spent my money for nothing. it smells like burberry but it disappears in 2 minutes. i&#x27;m not happy with it, and if you don&#x27;t want to  spend your money for water, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Great daytime perfume and so easy to wear with most everything that I finished the entire bottle quickly.  Not my favorite perfume but I really liked this one.  I don&#x27;t agree with the previous reviewer about the sensuality bit, I found it more casual than that.</li>
    <li> Casual yet expressive.  Great everyday scent for spring and cooler summer weather. Light with a touch of sweetness. Every time I wear it, I get loads of compliments.</li>
    <li> This is the fragrance I wear to work. Burberry Classic is so sweet and  is simply my signature fragrance!!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love my Burberry perfume and have been using it for years and will continue to do so. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS DON&#x27;T THINK ABOUT IT ANY LONGER PLACE THAT ORDER BECAUSE TRUST ME THIS SCENT IS AMAZING!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Light, able to wear during the day or on an evening out.  You don&#x27;t need much and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and the best price for the amount that I found.  I Love it.  Also, came very quickly.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this perfume, so I was thrilled I could order online and not have to trudge to the stores to shop! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product was mailed quickly and was packaged very well. I had no worries about it being damaged for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Oh man, the first day i wore this scent, everyone i encountered, everywhere i went sd tht it smelled so good. Frm tht day i knew it was a keeper!</li>
    <li> This is too sweet smelling and kind of loud.  I purchased this because at the time it was the fav. of a celebrity whom I liked.  I guess everyone has different tastes.  Will not purchase again or recommend.</li>
    <li> Last all day... def one of my favorite smells. Cant go wrong with this choice! Great gift for any woman</li>
    <li> I have used this Burberry Parfum for years.  Have tried other scents, but I always return to this one.  Great scent.  Try it, you will love it also.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product! I did not have any problems at all. I will definitely make additional purchases in the future.</li>
    <li> I usually buying this brand of perfume. The last order that i received I didn&#x27;t open until today and the smell is not burberry!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now I can not exchanges, Is out of date for amazon!!! but this is a thymus!!!</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s my favorite perfume of all time. I try others and I always come back to it. You could say it&#x27;s my soul scent.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume... and my husband loves it on me :) This seller has a spectacular price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Super, extra, hiper, lux, torpeda fast shipping !!!&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> My wife likes Burberry perfume. I also like it. She wanted it, I purchased it. Very good price, service was quick and painless. Product was as advertised. Delivery was quick. Wife is happy and you know what that means........I am happy.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! I have always been satisfied ordering from here. I got my perfume in 6 days, it was wrapped exactly how I buy it from the store. The only difference is the amazing price! I would and have recommend to my friends and family. It smells great and I&#x27;m always getting compliments.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle for the price! I was surprised at how much perfume I recieved for the price a paid.. impressed!</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling cologne ever. I wear it any time day or night. I always get plenty compliments. Your price is the best ever also.&lt;br /&gt;  Thamks so Much,&lt;br /&gt;  Henrietta Collins</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burberry for a couple of years now.  It&#x27;s such a great perfume, not overbearing like most.  I am always being asked by others what I have on, it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> My first encounter with this fragrance was in the lotion form, given to me by my grandmother. At first, I thought it was too much for me. However, years later I caught a whiff of it and decided to try it out. I went into Sephora and spritzed some on. Later that evening, I asked my boyfriend to tell me what he thought. Needless to say, rave reviews! A few little sprays lasted the whole day. Since purchasing and wearing it daily, I get compliments from anyone who is within smelling distance (usually in a hug, and both men and women!). It makes me feel classy and sophisticated, without being overly musky. Lasts a long time and I rarely need touch ups (though I usually have a small bottle in my purse). It depends on your own body chemistry, so I recommend trying it on your skin first. I think this is definitely a long term scent for me, one that makes me feel more mature (as opposed to the fruitier scents I wore in my late teens/early 20&#x27;s) and worth every cent! I found it at a local Burlington Coat Factory for about the same price here, for 1.7oz. Glad I can still find it cheaper than in some of the other stores!</li>
    <li> The perfume will not last more than an hour. I have this one previously and normally it would be good for the whole day but i guess the price is too good to be true and i cant even return it anymore. I feel scammed.</li>
    <li> Smells DIVINE! This is a powder-sweet and refreshing scent that won&#x27;t overwhelm the senses. It&#x27;s soft and subtle, yet killer if it complements your body chemistry. I love using this particular fragrance (especially during special occasions). It exudes both simplicity and sophistication--wonderful qualities that make me feel so feminine and utterly sexy!!! Try it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering this on the internet after reading come bad reviews.  I decided to take a chance and I am sooooo happy that I did.  I got the real Burberry at an AWESOME price!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Fragrance ever, been using it for years now.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time i&#x27;m buying it online, and it was a bad idea. I thought buying it directly through and from Amazon, will be save me from getting a fake one, but the parfume i received was definitely not the Original. Smells like it for the few seconds and not even as strong as the original, and it reaaaaaaally lasts for minutes not hours. Too bad...Gotta go a grab the real one from Macys, exepensive but at least i know what i am getting.</li>
    <li> The order was exactly as expected. Unopened package. The scent is exactly the same as the store baught version. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it. Some of the other reviews said it was like water with a little perfume, but I think it smells just as strong as the one I tested in a department store.</li>
    <li> The bottle of Burberry I received from Amazon.com was so weak it didn&#x27;t last 5 minutes on the skin. Save yourself the drama and buy it from a department store. What a terrible disappointment in quality control.</li>
    <li> I love how this perfume smells. It is very deep in the scent which is something I like and shipped quickly in quality packaging.</li>
    <li> I bought this without even smelling it. I was looking for new fragrances and this one came up as an alternative if you enjoy Channel #5 (which I love), so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. So glad I did, it is soft and lovely and maybe it&#x27;s only draw back is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last the day. I gave it 5 stars anyway because I really like it and will continue to buy in the future.</li>
    <li> Hands down, best perfume ever!  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years.  When I saw the price on Amazon, I thought, &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34;.  Turns out, I was wrong!!!  Fantastic purchase ~ my burberry goes everywhere with me!!  Yum yum!!</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this fragrance, she likes it even more since we got such a great deal on it.</li>
    <li> Burberry Woman has an uncomplicated scent.  It&#x27;s my go to scent year round.  It almost never fails to draw a compliment from both men and women.  I love it!</li>
    <li> this has become one of my most favorite perfumes to wear anymore - as it goes great for day time or evenings!</li>
    <li> I love this scent....it&#x27;s one of my all time favorites.  Smells very crisp and clean.  Long lasting but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> and I loved it too! It is a great aroma and it is perfect for a woman that likes to inspire her husband!!!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s a classic. It&#x27;s elegant and lasts all day. It&#x27;s one of my favorites and I hope it never goes away.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see this on Amazon.  First smell and I knew something was really off.  No it literally smelled like insect repellent. Thankfully is does not last long.  Spend the extra and buy at reputable store.</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for YEARS! I just recently ran out, and when I went online to my favorite suppliers, I could not find it. I check Burberry&#x27;s website and they, too, do not have it. I&#x27;m starting to panic a bit because this is seriously the ONLY scent that I wear. I love it. I have received so many compliments throughout the years when I wear it. It lasts all day long, and it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite. Please, please, please Burberry, do NOT stop making this perfume. It would devastate me.</li>
    <li> My daughter came home from Basic Training in the Marine Corps, and smelled so good, I couldnt rest until I smelled the same, Burberry By Burberry smells so good, it would even smell great on a man, LOL!  I just love it, and have bought at least 2 bottles recently.  I cant believe the bargain price also. I spray 2 sprays right after bathing, and I still smell the cologne when I go to bed at night!! It truly has staying power. Trust me on this one, if you put it on, you will  be enjoyed by the people who come in contact with you. Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> there is no trace of parfum inside....save your money!!!  only colored water inside...fake product!!!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll never again bye this product!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive sinuses but perfumes have always been tough to wear for me. This scent was VERY strong. One spray and the sneezes rolled in. I did, however, enjoy the scent. Unfortunately for my nose it had some real longevity. I went all day at work and still smelled wonderful by the time I got home. It was unfortunate that my sinuses did not agree with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered my perfume last week and it came in before they said it would in excellent condition, for the price u cant beat it. It was brand new in package with the plastic still on the box. And it smells wonderful. Thanks</li>
    <li> Its one of the best perfumes for women ... and damn cheaper than market price ... This is perfectly original, comes packed in a lovely manner ... it was sold by amazon.com ...</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t perfume... had faint smell of Burberry that immediately disappeared once applied. I&#x27;ve worn this perfume, purchased elsewhere, for years and have never had such a problem. I noticed immediately the color was off and was very disappointed in the lack of fragrance. Amazon was awesome and refunded me for the trouble. 5 stars for you, Amazon support team!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for many years, and this is not it. At first it smells terrible, then it dries down to no scent at all. Guess I have to repurchase from Nordstroms or Sephora, where I will get the real thing. Very disappointed; I thought I was safe buying directly from Amazon, I was wrong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for yrs &amp; I&#x27;ve never experienced any with such little fragrance. Almost like it was watered down.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfum, loved it!!  I have been using this parfum for months now, and I use it on a daily basis and still have plenty.</li>
    <li> I fell in love w/ this perfume when I smelled it at Kohls: it was a musky/amber/woody fragrance. This is NOT the scent I was hoping it would be. The only reason I ordered it here instead of at Kohls was because I was making an Amazon purchase anyway, so I figured \\&quot;why not add the perfume?\\&quot; Big mistake. I thought there was something wrong with my nose - this smells like nothing. Well, that&#x27;s an exaggeration - it smells like a very very subtle hint of something, but even that something isn&#x27;t the scent it&#x27;s supposed to be. And I just learned the hard way that you can&#x27;t return fragrance purchases to Amazon because perfumes are flammable. I&#x27;m so angry - thanks for nothing, Amazon. Last time I ever buy perfume online.</li>
    <li> My sister loves this perfum and it smells really good. Great size for the price...it should last her a while too.</li>
    <li> Smells beautiful and is light enough for everyday wear. Great staying power with just a couple &amp;#34;spritzes&amp;#34; lasting all day. Burberry never disappoints!</li>
    <li> Could barely smell anything. Was watered down and the smell seemed off, not burberry. Just smelled liked chemicals that were watered down. What a waste of money cant ever return it. I have bought a couple of perfumes from Amazon before with no problem. This was just horrible, went in the trash can.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this perfume.  Smelled it on my hairdresser and decided I HAD to have some.  So glad I purchased it.  Would highly recommend.  Light and sensual scent!</li>
    <li> Burberry is one of my all time favorites.  It is light yet noticeable receiving many complements each time I wear it. Not floral at all.  .</li>
    <li> This is the only scent I wear, and this is the best value I&#x27;ve ever seen for it. Normally you would get a bottle half the size for this price.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck when I found this bottle of my favorite Burberry fragrance. I&#x27;ve found it pretty hard to find. At a price below $40 I was a bit skeptical of the authenticity but I can report it is the real deal. I&#x27;m super happy AND I smell great:)</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME! I HAVE BEEN WEARING IT FOR EIGHT YEARS AND IT NEVER GETS OLD. IT IS PERFECT FOR DAY OR EVENING IT IS MY SIGNITURE SCENT, IT GOES ON A BIT STRONG, BUT NOT TOO HEAVY, AND FADES INTO A LOVELY WARM SLIGHTLY SWEET FRAGRANCE.</li>
    <li> definitely not the real thing. stick with buying in a department store. very disappointed. knew the deal was too good to be true. a 1oz bottle normally runs $30+ this 3oz was $35 w/shipping</li>
    <li> My fiance does not like it as the fragrance does not last for more than 2 hours....smells good for the first 1 hour..</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite scents for years now.  It&#x27;s warm, slightly musky scent that feels classic and sexy at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon for this size bottle.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS THE BEST PRICE THAT I COULD FIND FOR THIS ITEM &amp; MY WIFE LOVES THIS, SO IT WAS A WIN-WIN FOR ME. I WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> I received Burberry when expected. I had some Burberry left in a smaller bottle that I had purchased earlier from a local store. When I sprayed your Burberry it was like day and night . Your Burberry was or watered down or had alcohol added to it . It just didn&#x27;t smell nothing like my small water of Burberry.  I will never again buy perfume from Amazon. And of course we can&#x27;t  return it . Shame on you Amazon .</li>
    <li> After you spray it on, one second later, it does not smell at all. I would not buy this again from here. I have been using this perfume for years and love it but this one is a rip off. The price is great but does not last at all after you spray it on.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my wife.  We normally make the purchase from a local reailer....at a considerably higher price.  This purchase exceeded our expectations.</li>
    <li> Real expensive in stores and rarely available through outlet stores. Great price for the big bottle.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re fairly sensitive to most florally perfumes then this will probably be your best bet. This is the first perfume I tried that didn&#x27;t give me a headache. It smells lovely and light and is never overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent, it lasts a long time and I get tons of compliments on it!  It also arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Burberry perfume as ordered for a gift for my niece.  I personally am not familiar with the scent but she loves it.</li>
    <li> My son got me started on Burberry Perfume back in 1994 on Mother&#x27;s Day while he attended college in Boston and I get so many compliments of how good I smell (I cannot smell it on me though), so it must agree with my body and would never think about switching to any other scent.</li>
    <li> good product meets our expectations, arrived on time and is what the provider advertises, good price, carries out further purchases with you</li>
    <li> I had this perfume given to me as a gift and absolutely loved it. But it is a bit pricey in department stores. When I saw it for this price I jumped on it. I ordered on Monday and I received it on Tuesday, and that was with free super-saver shipping, I was shocked. Smells just like my last one. Love it.</li>
    <li> perfume seems watered down scent is very faint not happy with this product&lt;br /&gt;I did get it on time and packaging was perfect.</li>
    <li> I got this gift for my mom for christmas and she absolutely loved the smell and the cute container. She is a happy mommy.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I found it here cheaper than any were I looked. It is great. You smell like a movie star.</li>
    <li> Was happy and surprised by size for that price I got it for..great deal ...would definitely recommended this product from this site .</li>
    <li> My wife loves it!!!  I even love it.  Sexy, sexy, sexy.  Best price I found both on the web and locally.</li>
    <li> thanks for the super fast shipping!  i ordered on a thursday and received on friday afternoon!  just in time for my anniversary!  i don&#x27;t remember when i first discovered this scent, but as previous posters have noted, nothing else has come close to this for me over the years.  classic and simple, this fragrance is timeless and smells very expensive.  buy it!</li>
    <li> I love burberry original scent ! Sometimes with all the new product going on people forget that we really, really, just liked the original - loved getting this at a great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great a perfume,  my friend asked me to order this for her since she used to have a smaller one.  She was very happy to get this one</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even smell the perfume 15 minutes after spraying it on.  I recommend getting your perfume from another place.  WASTE of my money!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume! Unfortunately, they are doing away with it. So I thought I would find some on here, the one I received has the same smell of it, but doesn&#x27;t last on my body as long as it normally does, the fragrance fades quickly and it does have small amount of an alcohol to it. I think it&#x27;s bootleg. This really upsets me.</li>
    <li> This is a must have scent.  It does not smell flowery or body-powderish.  It is soft, warm, woodsy &amp; kinda musky but very feminine at the same time. Great for all seasons and wears very well.  It is by far one of my all-time faves.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift, and it speaks not only in terms of brand but of fragance. I know people who bought this in stores for 80 bucks! Talk about savings galore.</li>
    <li> One of my most favorite scents.  LOVE IT.  Excellent Christmas gift!  One spray and you area done.  Very Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the scent- I&#x27;ve used this and their weekend scent for years. I always gets compliments when I wear it!</li>

    <li> If I could give this 0 stars, I would. In short: it&#x27;s water. Buy this perfume in person from a department store so you can actually smell it with your own nose before owning it and then finding out you can&#x27;t return it to Amazon. This stuff ordinarily smells fantastic... what a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my girlfriend for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;She loved it.&lt;br /&gt;The price was one of the lowest I have seen.</li>
    <li> I just received my large bottle of Burberry today and I am really pleased.  After reading a few of the previous reviews, I was abit skeptical that this bottle might be a knockoff, but I can assure you that it is not.  I&#x27;m not sure what a few of the other people received, but I know my fragrance and this is a genuine bottle of Burberry.  The packaging is department store quality and the scent is as well and I&#x27;ve been using department store Burberry for years.  I thought I would take a chance on Amazon due to the price and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  I sprayed it on this morning when I received it and it is still going strong at 10:00 p.m.  There is no alcohol or weird smell to it...it&#x27;s authentic and I encourage you to purchase it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  An amazing fragrance at an awesome price!</li>
    <li> This scent lasts only for 2-3 hours. I compared with the same perfume from a store and this was different. The original store perfume that I put on my wrist lasted for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;But this bottle that Amazon sent does not last at all, in fact I have received no compliments on it. My friends standing 2 feet away can&#x27;t smell it - only I can smell it when I bring my wrists to my nose!&lt;br /&gt;I should have listened to the advice by other reviewers. This is the first time Amazon has disappointed me :(&lt;br /&gt;Moreover I cannot return it, as this is a hazardous item... and I don&#x27;t know if Amazon will give a refund.</li>
    <li> love it, got this from my daughter in law for Christmas and the scent is wonderful! - love it! yah</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a new scent for months.  I made the right decision.  I love this scent.  It is very pleasing and use it day and night.,</li>
    <li> This is a Good price and good size, smells as potent as the previous one it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;Note that fragrances are made in the following potency level, from most potent to least&lt;br /&gt;1. Parfum&lt;br /&gt;2. Eau De Parfum&lt;br /&gt;3. Eau De Toilet</li>
    <li> I love this purfume. It is soft and feminine, without being overly sweet, and is perfect for any occasion, formal or casual. I wear it daily and only switch to something else when I feel like a change.  However, I find myself defaulting to this purfume over and over again.</li>
    <li> Something is wrong with perfume, it could be fake or waited too long in the storage center. it is smells okay when you first spray it but after a while it changes. My wife smells like somebody else right now, which is okay for while ;) but I want my wife back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this because you can not return it to amazon, they don&#x27;t accept liquids because of shipping hazard. Amazon disappointed me for the first time after 10 years of use.</li>
    <li> This perfume  is not very pleasant when it is first sprayed however as it gets stale you get a nice fruity scent. It can work for women who likes mild fruity perfumes</li>
    <li> this is a very lovely fragrance and makes you feel pretty and lady like .It stands out and makes people notice you because of how good it makes you smell and feel and the price was outstanding this has been a very good experience .I am glad  I purchased this item andd i look forward to the excellent quality in anything else i purchase as well.Thank you</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PERFUME.&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE WAS SO REASONABLE AND I BOUGHT THE BIGGEST SIZE BOTTLE&lt;br /&gt;THEY HAD. YOU WON&#x27;T FIND A BETTER DEAL!&lt;br /&gt;THE SHIPPING WAS EXTREMELY FAST!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK-YOU!!</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVED IT.ITEM WAS AS DESCRIBED. IT SHIPPED QUICKLY AND EVERYTHING WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. I WILL SHOP HERE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, it&#x27;s all I wear.  I am so pleased with this purchase, it is perfect.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom&#x27;s birthday (mid-40s) and she loved it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 1.7 ounce bottle of this same perfume from a popular retailer.  When I researched on Amazon  the same perfume and found I could purchase the same thing but 50% more  for 1/3rd less cost, I took the 1.7 bottle back!</li>
    <li> I love Burberry, however the Weekend Burberry is the best.  This really needs more of a feminine smell.  It still smells ok.</li>
    <li> best price around, i love burberry and my mother too so we both use it and this large bottle has lasted forever</li>
    <li> Made a great Christmas gift.  I will be purchasing more of this next Christmas.  You can be sure.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like Burberry Brit better, It has a stronger scent. This works very well for daytime use and it should not bother anyone around you.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it has a soft smell and last for hours.  It was very resonably priced and the shipment was quick.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my old and decided I wanted a change.  So I went on a perfume quest and decided this was the fragrance for me.  I read the reviews and out of hundreds of opinions only a small fraction was unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me being optimistic, placed my order.  The price was great (I love getting a deal)! The next morning (after my delivery) as I got ready I squirted my neck and my wrists and noticed the smell was off.  Not only was it a little off, but not much smell lingered.  I squirted a little more... and still not much..  and then again, because I guess I don&#x27;t learn very fast.  (By this time, I started to notice what a previous reviewer said about the cat urine smell).  At this point, I should have gone to work smelling like a cheap hooker (who rolled around in cat urine); but fortunately, the cat urine smell didn&#x27;t linger, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust your instincts, don&#x27;t buy this perfume from this seller.</li>
    <li> The best scent for the best price, found it on Amazon.  Will continue to order as needed.  I could probably go for auto-ship on this, lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 3 years, and I get compliments daily on how yummy I smell.  It isn&#x27;t over powering like a lot of perfumes, its very subtle and flattering.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever wearing anything else!</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this perfume. It smells great, although it isn&#x27;t a scent I&#x27;d wear to work. Great perfume for going out or a date. It&#x27;s also my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite scent in the world.</li>
    <li> This product came right away - no waiting! It is an amazing deal for my favorite perfume which is so light and fresh with a&lt;br /&gt;slight vanilla scent! I receive so many compliments!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got the European feel - the smell is stronger and more noticeable than American brands. Great value for money. Bought it as a gift for my wife, and she loves it enough to stop using her preferred brand.</li>
    <li> What I received was not real perfume. It does smell like vodka with a hint of fragrance, and in 5 minutes the smell is gone.</li>
    <li> Received the product timely as the seller stated.  No complaints!  As always this is a great smelling parfume.  The only complaint would be the size.  Not sure if it is misprint but it was actually a 1.5 ounze instead.  But for the price and the great smell that I love I had no complaints.</li>
    <li> My first ever perfume purchased online. Since it&#x27;s a valentine gift, my expectation was way high. I carefully opened the package and did a little test...it passed with flying colors. It&#x27;s long lasting, it&#x27;s sweet, it&#x27;s not overpowering, it&#x27;s definitely not a fake.</li>
    <li> This has been my signature scent for years, its what my family and friends know me for. I purchased it off amazon, with amazon as the supplier. The scent was weak. I emailed Burberry asking if they changed the formula and they asked me to send the bottle to them to test it. Needless to say, it&#x27;s not the authorized version. It was a copy. They said they will NEVER sell Burberry fragrances on amazon, and the dealers have an agreement not to sell to unauthorized retailers that&#x27;s pretty strictly enforced. So buyer beware. This is not an authentic product, and you can not return it because its considered a hazardous material. Do yourself a favor and purchase it at a department store and keep these unauthorized suppliers from profiting by selling fake perfumes.</li>
    <li> Great gift for wife, she really likes this product. This has been a favorite of hers for several years.  She does not use very much at one time, the last bottle last a long time.</li>
    <li> Sooo disappointed! This is not the real Burberry it smells like scented water.....ZERO STARS! I want my money back.....do not purchase if u are looking for a genuine product.</li>
    <li> Best perfume I have found.  Scent is not too strong and it is getting harder to find since it has been released for a number of years.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this fragrance, and much to my dismay, I received a watered-down substitute. While it does smell like Burberry, within minutes after spraying, the scent virtually wears off. At this point, I just use this fragrance for something to wear around the house (yes, I have house scents!). For potential buyers, please heed the warnings of so many of us on here! This product is fake, and I feel bamboozled out of my money. That said, I am now forced to go to Bloomingdale&#x27;s and just purchase it from a counter salesperson.</li>
    <li> It was the perfume I requested and it showed up on time, I have no complaints and nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> I loved the scent.  This was a great price for 3.3 ounces.  Department stores sell the bottles that are half that size for much more.</li>
