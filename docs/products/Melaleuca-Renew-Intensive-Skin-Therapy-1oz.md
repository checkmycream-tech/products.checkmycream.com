      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product and the quality.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps it works better for some than for others.</li>
      <li>I have found that the soap I&#x27;m using has made more of a difference than</li>
      <li>Purchased for my grand daughter.  </li>
      <li>We love this product and have used it for years.</li>
      <li>I love keeping my family healthy by giving them superior supplements, feeding them high quality food and keeping our home clean and toxin free with superior cleaning products that are super concentrated and do the best job ever without harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>The lotion in general is great</li>
      <li>Very good for dry skin</li>
      <li>Just go to a pharmascy and for $20.00 you can buy a huge bottle of Renew.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Melaleuca products.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy using it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s WORTH it.  :-)</li>
      <li>and i finally found it here and ordered some more!LOVELOVELOVE!!!amazing product works great and keeps my hands real smooth and soft and not all</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>I go, the small tubes are perfect for going through security at the airport~</li>
      <li>this product is awesome, relieves dry skin quick, thanks for the product...</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than that, so that makes the price too high in my opinion.</li>
      <li>My aging father asked me to purchase it for him, he lives in a dry area and loved the feeling of it.  </li>
      <li>These little bottles are great for you purse or travel.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>but anything was worth a try.</li>
      <li>She was right.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great skin therapy, but the bottle is small as hell.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and leaves my hands soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky with lotions!</li>
      <li>Nothing for the first week.</li>
      <li>Regular lotions or creams did nothing replacing moisture on my hands, but this helps keep it in check better than anything.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The cream is nice and soft and soothing but does not last on my hands.  </li>
      <li>We will tell everyone how great this is for dry skin no matter when the dry skin is just dont think it is going to heal skin in 1 week.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t think it has affected my eczema in a positive (or really any) way.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>almost gone!!!!We really did not think it would work</li>
      <li>I use one application daily, right after my shower, and no itching or flaking skin anymore!</li>
      <li>This lotion is amazing - it&#x27;s the ONLY brand that&#x27;s worked well with my sensitive skin, especially with winter dryness on my hands.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the near future.</li>
      <li>Finally a moisturizer that I will be purchasing again because it really works!</li>
      <li>While my hands are soft, moisturized, and don&#x27;t need another dose of lotion after this soaks in, I still have to use my medicated stuff for the eczema.</li>
      <li>Melaleuca helps me do this at an affordable price when I purchase DIRECT from the company.</li>
      <li>The delivery came early</li>
      <li>but we are happily surprised.</li>
      <li>My adult chile uses this product and recommended it</li>
      <li>I like that it comes in small size for easy carrying</li>
      <li>I can help you enroll as a melaleuca customer and get this amazing lotioN at less than half.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s too small, better to buy a bigger size.</li>
      <li>Having it available in small size is convenient for purse/car/desk use.  </li>
      <li>Wrinkles are less noticeable overnight, Really!!  </li>
      <li>It really moisturizes your skin and heals any dry areas you may have.  </li>
      <li>It is very helpful and calming to apply to my 5&amp;#34; scar due to wrist fracture operation.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to anyone thats allergic to cold or simply whoever has sensitive skin/dry:)</li>
      <li>This makes my extra, extra dry skin feel hydrated and soft.</li>
      <li>I loved this product it was actually given to me by a my mother in law&#x27;s friend she had seen me washing dishes and my hands are really sensitive to the dish detergents so it tends to get a rash or when its very cold.</li>

<li> Renew was not better than my lotion that I can buy locally at a much lower price.  </li>
<li> specially it&#x27;s very expensive compared to other good lotion on the market.</li>
<li> work better, are safer and less expensive</li>
<li> I stocked up on it it because I&#x27;ve learned when I find something I really like, it usually gets discontinued!</li>

<li> It didn&#x27;t help with the Keloid but did help other things.</li>
<li> It is not worth your money.</li>
<li> But the lotion is not worth it a penny because it just made my skin even drier after application.</li>
<li> It has been a month and the dry hard skin is</li>
<li> If you want this at a cheaper price, or any melaleuca product you may be looking for online, may I suggest you take a few minutes and email me and find out how you can save.</li>
<li> dried and rashy like.</li>
<li> Sadly didn&#x27;t work for my eczema (topical steroid withdrawal.)</li>
<li> $18.43 for this shit!?</li>
<li> It is a small tube like you would put in your pocket.  </li>
<li> Not a very good quality when it comes to skin lotion</li>
<li> My husbands finger has had hard skin on for over a year.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so sad!</li>
<li> This is the worst decision I&#x27;ve made on buying something online.</li>

    <li> This lotion is by far the best there is on the market. You can&#x27;t find this or any of Melaleuca&#x27;s finest products in any of your grocery stores. If you want this at a cheaper price, or any melaleuca product you may be looking for online, may I suggest you take a few minutes and email me and find out how you can save.

    <li> I&#x27;m very picky with lotions! I can tell you this lotion is awesome! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I NEVER write reviews, but I will vouch for this product.  This lotion is amazing - it&#x27;s the ONLY brand that&#x27;s worked well with my sensitive skin, especially with winter dryness on my hands.  I highly recommend it! Buy the bigger bottle... it&#x27;s WORTH it.  :-)</li>
    <li> Renew was not better than my lotion that I can buy locally at a much lower price.  My sister likes it, so I decided to try it.  Perhaps it works better for some than for others.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> One ounce is just nothing, I think I got 4 applications from it.  I bought an 8-oz bottle from e-bay for 18 bucks.  You can compare the pricing yourself.</li>
    <li> Really good moisturizer. This makes my extra, extra dry skin feel hydrated and soft. Finally a moisturizer that I will be purchasing again because it really works!</li>

    <li> The delivery came early so I gave it a 3 stars for it. But the lotion is not worth it a penny because it just made my skin even drier after application. Not a very good quality when it comes to skin lotion specially it&#x27;s very expensive compared to other good lotion on the market.</li>
    <li> Very good lotion.will buy again.</li>
    <li> I loved this product it was actually given to me by a my mother in law&#x27;s friend she had seen me washing dishes and my hands are really sensitive to the dish detergents so it tends to get a rash or when its very cold. I had ranned out and i finally found it here and ordered some more!LOVELOVELOVE!!!amazing product works great and keeps my hands real smooth and soft and not all dried and rashy like. I highly recommend to anyone thats allergic to cold or simply whoever has sensitive skin/dry:)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do without.  Not greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;vanish&amp;#34; shortly after you use.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough.  The only product I use.  I no longer have cracked finger tips in the winter.</li>
    <li> We love this product and have used it for years. This is an ideal lotion to use after sun exposure, and during the winter to keep skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my grand daughter.  Her mom says it works great.  My adult chile uses this product and recommended it</li>
    <li> I use this around my eyes and it actually makes a difference. Wrinkles are less noticeable overnight, Really!!  My Mom and Sis both use this also and they say the same thing.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the quality.  I will definitely be ordering more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I was at my son&#x27;s house in Topeka, KS and my daughter in told me try this I was very happy with it so I ordered my own</li>
    <li> I have Roseacea and very dry skin besides....I use one application daily, right after my shower, and no itching or flaking skin anymore! I stocked up on it it because I&#x27;ve learned when I find something I really like, it usually gets discontinued!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Melaleuca products. I love keeping my family healthy by giving them superior supplements, feeding them high quality food and keeping our home clean and toxin free with superior cleaning products that are super concentrated and do the best job ever without harsh chemicals.

    <li> This seemed to work effectively on moderate excema...thank you!</li>
    <li> The lotion in general is great but it&#x27;s too small, better to buy a bigger size.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  It really moisturizes your skin and heals any dry areas you may have.  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!  These little bottles are great for you purse or travel.</li>
    <li> This lotion is probably as good as what you can get at the drugstore in an intensive type formula.  But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than that, so that makes the price too high in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I got this as an add on for $8.  It is a small tube like you would put in your pocket.  My mistake for not seeing it was only 1 oz.  The cream is nice and soft and soothing but does not last on my hands.  I have to keep reapplying it.  I will probably not buy this again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and leaves my hands soft. A friend recommended it because she has a skin condition that dries out her hands, so I decided to try it for my eczema. It doesn&#x27;t make enough  of a difference for that anyway. While my hands are soft, moisturized, and don&#x27;t need another dose of lotion after this soaks in, I still have to use my medicated stuff for the eczema. I have found that the soap I&#x27;m using has made more of a difference than this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless! It&#x27;s a very nice lotion and I enjoy using it. I just don&#x27;t think it has affected my eczema in a positive (or really any) way.</li>
    <li> smaller than i thought it was gonna be but all around liked it</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin in the winter time. I had tried creams, lotions, vaseline, and it didn&#x27;t seem like anything locked moisture in. This stuff is great! Will definitely buy again if needed. Bought the travel size to put in my purse when needed. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I have ever tried to heal my cracked, bleeding fingertips.  I have an autoimmune disease that causes everything to dry out, including my fingertips along with mucous membranes everywhere in my body.  Regular lotions or creams did nothing replacing moisture on my hands, but this helps keep it in check better than anything.  Now I carry it with me everywhere I go, the small tubes are perfect for going through security at the airport~</li>
    <li> My husbands finger has had hard skin on for over a year. He has tryed everything even creams his doctor gave him. A friend told us about renew. We thought yeah right but anything was worth a try. Nothing for the first week. My friend said it might take a month. She was right. It has been a month and the dry hard skin is almost gone!!!!We really did not think it would work but we are happily surprised. We will tell everyone how great this is for dry skin no matter when the dry skin is just dont think it is going to heal skin in 1 week.</li>
    <li> I have been a Preferred Customer of Melaleuca for 12 years and I truly have switch&lt;br /&gt;all the products that I would use in my home to Melaleuca and save a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;They work better, are safer and less expensive then the grocery stores!&lt;br /&gt;I get this renew 1oz for $1.99. All of the products listed here are 2-3 times higher.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so sad!</li>
    <li> I was told to use this for Keloids. It didn&#x27;t help with the Keloid but did help other things. Still use but not for what I wanted it for.</li>
    <li> Was recommended this product. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream - will be ordering more very soon.  Very good for dry skin and it has helped a great deal&lt;br /&gt;on my legs and arms.</li>
    <li> Sadly didn&#x27;t work for my eczema (topical steroid withdrawal.)</li>
    <li> It is very helpful and calming to apply to my 5&amp;#34; scar due to wrist fracture operation.</li>
    <li> $18.43 for this shit!? Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s great skin therapy, but the bottle is small as hell. It is not worth your money. Just go to a pharmascy and for $20.00 you can buy a huge bottle of Renew. This is the worst decision I&#x27;ve made on buying something online.</li>
