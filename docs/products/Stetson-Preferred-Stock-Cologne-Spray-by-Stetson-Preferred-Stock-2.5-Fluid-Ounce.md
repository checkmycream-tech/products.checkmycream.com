    <li> Originally what led me to buy a few bottles of this cologne was one specific reason...I had very little of a 3.4oz splash bottle left.When stores were closing down it was a great opportunity to buy Preferred Stock at that size to keep a good supply of it years ago.Anyways a year ago I looked around for Preferred Stock again but all I could find locally was the 1.7oz size spray bottle.I found this 2.5oz size and thought this was a blessing BUT ten years ago the old-school colognes started going through reformulations and presentation removals with the IFRA cracking the whip.So how did Preferred Stock turn out today? well let&#x27;s see...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presentation:&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was the &#x27;slimming squares&#x27; decal is no longer reflective silver it&#x27;s just a white color now.That same decal used to be stamped on the bottle top...it&#x27;s no longer there just bare.Different font for the Preferred Stock logo but it&#x27;s not ugly.Different color of glass for the bottle which is more of a black and purple tone.The old stuff was a smoky black with sort of a dull copper tone.Kind of an updated look and cost efficiency signs at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preferred Stock&#x27;s Scent:&lt;br /&gt;This cologne to me had a citrus soaked in wood smell with an addition of a few notes.One was a lavender soap note that had a creamy white character to it like Ivory also.Second was the patch of vetiver that gave this cologne it&#x27;s green character.Like walking out of the woods into a moist grassy field.Lastly a smaller note which was leather-fairly dark and bold though as Preferred Stock had a minor similarity to Drakkar Noir through this note.Describing the reformulation is tough as initially what I smell seems hazy/bundled up while the original Preferred Stock was put together in a finer way.Vetiver is a distant memory as it&#x27;s light sprinkled throughout in tiny doses but that finish is gone.The wood and citrus smells similar but not as pronounced as it used to be.Still getting a decent amount of that Drakkar leather.The semi soapy note is something very different.First thought that hit my mind was violet with a hint of cinnamon?Interesting but if this scent was designed differently for the right cologne it would fit in better.Ah but the mental vision of washing my hands at a creek with this white soap and smelling that grass is long from my memory of Preferred Stock.And the stroll through the citrus soaked woody forest had a bit of fog to make my venture a little confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;If I was an individual that walked into a store and tried the current Preferred Stock for the first time? it would be four stars.It&#x27;s cheap,wearable,masculine and smells pretty decent...it just doesn&#x27;t match up to the old formula.When Coty put out Preferred Stock I thought they were really onto something.Can&#x27;t think of how many other guys put this on a pedestal with other pricier colognes of the woodsy nature.I&#x27;ll finish up the two bottles as it&#x27;s not nose garbage but yes...Preferred Stock&#x27;s not what it used to be.rakkar leather.The semi soapy note is something very different.First thought that hit my mind was violet with a hint of cinnamon?Interesting but if this scent was designed differently for the right cologne it would fit in better.Ah but the mental vision of washing my hands at a creek with this white soap and smelling that grass is long from my memory of Preferred Stock.And the stroll through the citrus soaked woody forest had a bit of fog to make my venture a little confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;If I was an individual that walked into a store and tried the current Preferred Stock for the first time? it would be four stars.It&#x27;s cheap,wearable,masculine and smells pretty decent...it just doesn&#x27;t match up to the old formula.When Coty put out Preferred Stock I thought they were really onto something.Can&#x27;t think of how many other guys put this on a pedestal with other pricier colognes of the woodsy nature.I&#x27;ll finish up the two bottles as it&#x27;s not nose garbage but yes...Preferred Stock&#x27;s not what it used to be.</li>
    <li> I suspect that this might be a knock off of this cologne, but I couldn&#x27;t tell (and I&#x27;ve been smelling it since I was a kid). My only complaint is that the label was almost completely rubbed off and there was that white paper/adhesive residue. Overall very happy with the product. I am not, however, the one using it daily.</li>

    <li> Purchased this for my husband. He can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. It smells great on him too. Packaging, and delivery was perfect.</li>
    <li> I am glad I looked this up while at walmart I saved some money and got a stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> Great product. Poorly packed for shipping. No bubble wrap or even air bags. Had very inadequate amount of brown paper. Product box had large indention on top corner. Plastic lid was broken. I had to affix spray nozzle. Works fine. Would have been embarrassing if I had bought and shipped as a gift.</li>
    <li> This was a good value. Cost less then the 1.75 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne on my husband, and it last all day. This was the best price I found, and it shipped quickly. I will be a repeat buyer!</li>
    <li> gift... they liked it and I enjoyed it as well. Not over powering.</li>
    <li> A delightful fragrance that most women love!</li>
    <li> I always get complimented on my cologne when I wear it. I can&#x27;t find it in any store.</li>
    <li> It could be that it is not original, it does not smell good , no one liked it, wont recommend it</li>
    <li> I always use this cologne</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE!!!</li>
    <li> My husband has not gotten yet but loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne and I love having the product delivered to our home. We order this cologne frequently and the product has always shown up in great condition.</li>
    <li> Love this Cologne for 15 years or so now.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite cologne about 10 or even 15 years ago.  But I did not find it to have the same scent as back then when comparing the new and old bottle. It seems the recipe has changed.  I would say this is now good, but not great.  I would really like to know if the formulation changed.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I love this scent.</li>
    <li> Great cologne at a great price. Always stick with the classics and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great product and my wife loves it when I wear it!!!!  :)</li>
    <li> I have been using Preferred Stock for years and love the fragrance. I ordered this spray on line, and  I don&#x27;t know if this is authentic PS, but the fragrance is not the same.</li>
    <li> great great great price and my boyfriend smells soo good!!!!</li>
    <li> My son-in-law loves this cologne for his daytime wear.  I buy it for him every Christmas. I keep him supplied!!</li>
    <li> Outstanding !!! Always have used it. Will use nothing else. Perfect scent. Try it, tou will love this awesome product.</li>
    <li> great price smell good</li>
    <li> For a fairly inexpensive cologne, this smells really good on my husband. This is his week day cologne.</li>
    <li> Before I go out dancing I spray some Preferred Stock on me and while in the Night Club dancing, I sweat a lot, but the sent of the Cologne is still on my body and my shirt, and the many women I dance with they would always say to me that I smell great and they ask me the name of the Cologne that I wear. I think it&#x27;s a chick magnet, but it&#x27;s not...many of the women I danced with they all them like the scent and the way I dance.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know what this product is you&#x27;ve lived in a cave. Great scent at a great price, with a long lasting effect. I&#x27;ll always prefer it, so it&#x27;s aptly named.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t normally give this high rating but the care in packaging shows attention to detail from vendor. Would purchase from again!</li>
    <li> loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for years.  It is by far my favorite.  I&#x27;ve had more people complement me on the smell than any other cologne I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
