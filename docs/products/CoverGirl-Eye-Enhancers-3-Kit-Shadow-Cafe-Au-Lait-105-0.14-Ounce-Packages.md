<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Also love these colors. They make for a pretty eye.</li>
    <li> Great makeup with fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know the eyeshadow was frosted.  Looking for matte finish.</li>
    <li> I like these natural colors. The picture is a little darker than the actual eye shadow but I think if they posted it as-is it would be hard to tell what color it was. It is very natural looking.</li>
    <li> Very light coverage, almost sheer. Even with a good eyeshadow primer, you have to cake it on to get any color. Look elsewhere for color.</li>
    <li> An old time favorite is back again.  This is a great neutral daytime pallette.  I do wish the middle color was a bit more pigmented but, for the price, I can&#x27;t complain!  Non-irritating, pretty colors, awesome price...so, I&#x27;d call this a win!</li>
    <li> I have bought cover girl makeup for years and will in the future but I will not buy  this  product again. Didn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
    <li> It works like any other shadow by CG. I have pale skin so I think it allows me to create different looks with only one product.&lt;br /&gt;I can go from day to night with just adding a little dark shadow.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of covergirl since 2008. I have pale skin, brown hair and blue eyes. I bought this because I wanted a new natural colors with brown and pink in it. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have trashed my receipt because the color is very light, hardly noticeable once on my skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! These colors are perfect. They go with everything and if applied correctly make eyes pop! Great price and fast shipping as always from Amazon. I even got to use a coupon!</li>
    <li> These colors go well with my green eyes... it is hard to find something that will match green eyes AND go along with all of your outfit color choices!  This shadow is a &#x27;must have&#x27; in my make-up kit!</li>
    <li> The package wasnt properly packaged &amp; thrown on the box along with other items.&lt;br /&gt;The white portion was chipped &amp; broke to other color, I cleaned it the other two tones survives.  I decided not to return it not worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;(Note to self, do not buy eye shadow online)</li>
    <li> Like the colors. They go on well.</li>
    <li> This color pallet is great for my pale complexion.  I don&#x27;t wear heavy eye shadow, I just want a little color to brighten my face and make my eyes pop and this combo is great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, I hate spending tons of money on shadow.  This is easy to blend (with a makeup brush, don&#x27;t bother with the dumb little wand it comes with it&#x27;s useless) and doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
    <li> somewhat shiny for my liking. i don&#x27;t like the glittery look, i&#x27;m too old for that. but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Was all busted up when I received it. Useless.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but dark not dark enuf  &amp; light shades too light.</li>
    <li> My eyes are glowing now.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Although they look a little darker in picture. Goes on nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great little compact for fair skin. I have light blue eyes and this color combination works wonders with my eyes and shows through my darker brown glasses. Easy to apply and I don&#x27;t apply any primer and it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> The quality has decreased exponentially.  The colors do not stay the whole day and the color pallets are not that compact</li>
    <li> I was hoping for the colors to be a little more pigmented, but they&#x27;re somewhat lackluster once applied. I find the need to layer quite a bit to even notice the middle shade, which is unfortunate because it looks so lovely condensed. The left-most color is the boldest of the three, but even that is muted unless you wet your brush.</li>
    <li> I like the colors of the eye shadow having purchased it before.  However, I wish I had read the other reviews before ordering online.  The eye shadow was just thrown in the box with the other items I ordered.  It banged it&#x27;s way to my house and arrived, not completely broken up, but definitely not as good as new.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for more coverage.  It&#x27;s nice but a bit paler then I need. Very natural looking though so I am keeping it for everyday use.</li>
    <li> CoverGirl Eye Enhancers 3 Kit Shadow is another great Cover Girl product. I use the color in one way or another almost daily. I have dark brown eyes and I like the lighter color on my lids and the darker in the crease. The colors go on easily and never flake or fade during the day. I love the ability to mix and match the colors or blend them to my own specifications. Well worth the small price!</li>
    <li> I do not like mate finish, but applies well.</li>
    <li> I regret buying this product even though it was so cheap. As they say, you get what you pay for. It literally looks like chalky powder that just blows off.</li>
    <li> I have red hair and pale skin, and this is my go-to daily eyeshadow. Great value, defines my eyes without looking too harsh, and the colors are complementary and natural looking. If you want a neutral every day look, this is it.</li>
    <li> Received product was all broken...Very disappointed.</li>
