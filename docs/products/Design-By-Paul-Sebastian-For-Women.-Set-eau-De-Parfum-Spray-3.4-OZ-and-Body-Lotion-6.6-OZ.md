      <li>and i absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I took a chance by ordering it online.  </li>
      <li>the more you pay the better----but</li>
      <li>I have been purchasing Paul Sebastian Design since 1992, always at reputable department stores.  </li>
      <li>I had to use pliers to remove the top.</li>
      <li>Love this....</li>
      <li>the fragrance is nice and clean.</li>
      <li>First, the lotion does not smell like Design; in fact, it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything good.</li>
      <li>A favorite of my wife and the purchase was easy and on time.</li>
      <li>So I thought that this would be a great gift for someone for Christmas; I got it for just $21 dollars and thought wow</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She was way more excited about getting Paul Sebastin&#x27;s Design.  </li>
      <li>This was such a good deal!</li>
      <li>💟 Would recommend to anyone who wants to smell great but also wants a sophisticated scent, not a teanager scent. .</li>
      <li>It has a crappy cheap smell to it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well, I don&#x27;t know much about this product for myself as it was nicely packaged</li>
      <li>This smells like a cheap copy of the original fragrance.</li>
      <li>that being said, I bought it for my husband&#x27;s former wife and she was absolutely delighted with this gift.  </li>
      <li>it was in box, smelled good and properly described.</li>
      <li>The spray from the newer bottle, which is bigger and supposedly a good deal, lasts about 3 hours.</li>
      <li>I love this product so much and when I discovered that Amazon sold it</li>
      <li>Of course I ordered it right away and was excited about rec&#x27;ing it.</li>
      <li>hello ladies is that telling you something... the price is right, and the smell is clean and fresh...</li>
      <li>They had it right.  </li>
      <li>I was excited until I sprayed my wrist from my own bottle of Design which I purchased from Macy&#x27;s and then sprayed my other wrist with this \\&quot;Design\\&quot; that came from Amazon - for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would totally recommend this perfum, it  has such a beautiful scent, you should try it.</li>
      <li>It has a nice clean smell and doesn&#x27;t cause headaches like other flowery types.</li>
      <li>Design perfume I received from Amazon is the same as the original scent, however, it&#x27;s NOT as strong &amp; doesn&#x27;t s  </li>
      <li>I thank Amazon so very much for their prompt service.</li>
      <li>this product was exactly as specified.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s her favorite cologne (the only one she uses) and she has used it for years.</li>
      <li>This is the first time that I have been dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>including the fast shipping!</li>
      <li>This was my first time purchasing Design online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First time trying the body cream and loves the texture.  </li>
      <li>It arrived exactly as was promised and on time.</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>i used it today for the first time and within 3hrs i got six compliments... and 4 were from guys...</li>
      <li>I bought this for my cleaning lady and she really loves it too.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper when purchased together like this.</li>
      <li>Oh by the way it is the real deal not a tester.</li>
      <li>And, yes, this is the real thing---NOT a knockoff like another reviewer said.</li>
      <li>nice fragrance, long lasting</li>
      <li>paid more for smaller bottle at dept store last year .</li>
      <li>I buy for my mom on her birthday and other special days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as if the maker watered down the parfum for the sake of offering a bigger, better deal.</li>
      <li>Design Perfume smells like the same scent , but it is absolutely not the strong scent  of years ago...</li>
      <li>In contrast, I have another, smaller, bottle of Design from over ten years ago; when I use the older bottle, the fragrance lasts about 8 hours.</li>
      <li>Began wearing it at 45 years old I believe and at age 66, still wearing the same brand!  </li>

<li> i don&#x27;t like harsh smells, but if your not sure buy the tiny bottle first and then work your way up if you like it...</li>
<li> I still will purchase Design perfume, I think Coty decreased the chemical ingredients for economical reasons...</li>
<li> the creme smells a bit like it may be old not sure,</li>
<li> This is NOT real Paul Sebastian Design</li>
<li> have spent hundreds of dollars with Amazon.</li>
<li> if only I could have found this deal when I was looking for it in the sears a few months ago...</li>
<li> day like the almost empty bottle I purchased from Macy&#x27;s 2 yrs ago...</li>
<li> perfume is not good, scent doesn&#x27;t last and clearly the color of perfume is lighter than my previous Design.</li>
<li> the past year I tried different scents like Flowerbomb $90 delivered, and Guess Gold $160 delivered thinking</li>

    <li> I just have to say this was excellent!</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for almost 29 years and have always loved it.  The lotion keeps my hands moist and the fragrance lingers for awhile, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments!</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent for many yrs now and i absolutely love it. So I thought that this would be a great gift for someone for Christmas; I got it for just $21 dollars and thought wow if only I could have found this deal when I was looking for it in the sears a few months ago...lol!!! Oh by the way it is the real deal not a tester.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by the products of this fragrance set which I purchased in spring 2010. First, the lotion does not smell like Design; in fact, it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything good. I&#x27;m going to put it in the charity bin with the hopes that someone somewhere will like its \\&quot;scent.\\&quot; As for the parfum, I find the fragrance weak. In contrast, I have another, smaller, bottle of Design from over ten years ago; when I use the older bottle, the fragrance lasts about 8 hours. The spray from the newer bottle, which is bigger and supposedly a good deal, lasts about 3 hours. It&#x27;s as if the maker watered down the parfum for the sake of offering a bigger, better deal. But this is not a good deal, and I would not recommend buying the set.</li>
    <li> Love the scent! Bought it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much and when I discovered that Amazon sold it I was thrilled. Of course I ordered it right away and was excited about rec&#x27;ing it. Well to my surprise it arrived in just a couple days and was not damaged at all. I thank Amazon so very much for their prompt service. I would recommend using Amazon to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have been using this scent for years and I LOVE it.  Also this set is a great value and comes with the lotion.</li>
    <li> this is grandma&#x27;s favorite perfume so I had to get this for her for christmas. she loved everything about it! including the fast shipping! thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and cream, great deal!  I would totally recommend this perfum, it  has such a beautiful scent, you should try it.</li>
    <li> this product was exactly as specified. the perfume and the box were in excellent condition. Very happy with my purchase. thank you.</li>
    <li> this set is great.. i used it today for the first time and within 3hrs i got six compliments... and 4 were from guys... hello ladies is that telling you something... the price is right, and the smell is clean and fresh... i don&#x27;t like harsh smells, but if your not sure buy the tiny bottle first and then work your way up if you like it...&lt;br /&gt;all i know is that i fell in love with it... now it&#x27;s up to you weather you think you&#x27;ll like it or not... i think it&#x27;s sexy...</li>
    <li> STINNKY... Gave it away.  I would have thought that PS would have put out a better fragrance for the woman but nope... I was wrong.  No fault to the seller though.  It arrived exactly as was promised and on time.</li>
    <li> I wear this perfume every day. I really love it. It&#x27;s so light and refreshing. I bought this for my cleaning lady and she really loves it too.</li>
    <li> Design has been my choice of fragrance since its debut in the 80&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m very frustrated that I can&#x27;t get all  the items I like,</li>
    <li> it was in box, smelled good and properly described. I would buy this product again for future presents. thank you</li>
    <li> This smells like a cheap copy of the original fragrance. The spray bottle was very difficult to open. I had to use pliers to remove the top. The fragrance cream smelled like plastic with a little old scent. I should have paid attention to the other negative ratings. They had it right.  Even though the price was less than the department store it wasn&#x27;t a bargain because I won&#x27;t be wearing it. Its going to Good Will on the off chance that someone else might not mind it.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my aunt.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s her favorite cologne (the only one she uses) and she has used it for years. It has a subtle fragrance.  First time trying the body cream and loves the texture.  Always gets compliments on it.</li>
    <li> A favorite of my wife and the purchase was easy and on time.</li>
    <li> loved the size and the set. paid more for smaller bottle at dept store last year . love this perfume</li>
    <li> Love this item and great transaction</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the size of the cologne very nice large size, the body creme is nice and silky also. the creme smells a bit like it may be old not sure, maybe just the way it smells but nice anyway, this was a gift to myself  as I did have a small parfum bottle of it that I adored.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this fragrance but got it for my mom.  She has used it for years and was very happy with the gift set.  The fragrance was certainly authentic.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> This lotion and perfume is wonderful.Everyone likes it.It has a nice clean smell and doesn&#x27;t cause headaches like other flowery types.Men and Women always stop and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.Great price at amazon, I use to pay 60 for it.</li>
    <li> &#x27;&#x27;  I&#x27;VE BEEN WEARING &#x27;&#x27; DESIGN &#x27;&#x27; BY PAUL SEBASTIAN, SINCE &#x27;&#x27;  1987-  IT&#x27;S  A  KEEPER , TRY IT , YOU&#x27;LL SENSE , WHAT I&#x27;M SAYING&#x27;&#x27;  YOU&#x27;LL  LOVE  IT &#x27;&#x27; .</li>
    <li> Much cheaper when purchased together like this. I buy for my mom on her birthday and other special days. It does smell nice on her and she gets complimented often. Began wearing it at 45 years old I believe and at age 66, still wearing the same brand!  This is her scent and everyone knows it! 💟 Would recommend to anyone who wants to smell great but also wants a sophisticated scent, not a teanager scent. .</li>
    <li> I have used Design for the past 30 years, but I hate going to the chain stores in the mall just for my cologne. I am so glad I took a chance by ordering it online.  It was here in just 4 days and cost less, even with shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Paul Sebastian Design since 1992, always at reputable department stores.  This was my first time purchasing Design online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just minutes ago I received this package from Amazon. I was excited until I sprayed my wrist from my own bottle of Design which I purchased from Macy&#x27;s and then sprayed my other wrist with this \\&quot;Design\\&quot; that came from Amazon - for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Amazon stuff must be a copycat product.  It has a crappy cheap smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so angry and disappointed.  This is NOT real Paul Sebastian Design parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;returns\\&quot; page says this product cannot be returned and Amazon does not provide any way that I can find to get satisfaction. I can&#x27;t even find an Amazon \\&quot;complaints\\&quot; area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent hundreds of dollars with Amazon. This is the first time that I have been dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless some Amazon representative fixes this problem, I will never order from Amazon again nor will I hesitate to tell everyone I know about this mess. I don&#x27;t have money to waste.</li>
    <li> Love this....I use the eau De Parfum Spray and layer it with the body lotion.  I&#x27;ve used it this way for several years.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> It was great to be able to get the Design lotion.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to find locally.  The quality of the perfume and lotion is just as good as always.  This is my favorite scent and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years.</li>
    <li> lovely scent that lasts. Always get compliments</li>
    <li> nice fragrance, long lasting</li>
    <li> this was ordered for a family member, they were very happy with the quality of the product.  packaging was perfect for a gift.</li>
    <li> Design perfume I received from Amazon is the same as the original scent, however, it&#x27;s NOT as strong &amp; doesn&#x27;t s  day like the almost empty bottle I purchased from Macy&#x27;s 2 yrs ago...I put the old bottle on one day and, as usual I could still smell the scent in my bedroom 8 hrs later.,the next day I sprayed the Amazon Design on, and 4-5hrs later Perfume scent smell  was NOT in my bedroom..Design Perfume smells like the same scent , but it is absolutely not the strong scent  of years ago...I still will purchase Design perfume, I think Coty decreased the chemical ingredients for economical reasons...</li>
    <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know much about this product for myself as it was nicely packaged and I didn&#x27;t want to take it apart to open it--that being said, I bought it for my husband&#x27;s former wife and she was absolutely delighted with this gift.  Says she has been wearing it for years and won&#x27;t wear anything other perfume!  So, the gift was a hit!</li>
    <li> This was such a good deal! I only paid $24 delivered for this perfume and lotion combo, and my wife was delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past year I tried different scents like Flowerbomb $90 delivered, and Guess Gold $160 delivered thinking the more you pay the better----but never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was way more excited about getting Paul Sebastin&#x27;s Design.  And, yes, this is the real thing---NOT a knockoff like another reviewer said.</li>
    <li> The set was a replacement.  I&#x27;ve used Design for years.  Also, I liked the price.</li>
    <li> Buyers beware...perfume is not good, scent doesn&#x27;t last and clearly the color of perfume is lighter than my previous Design.</li>
    <li> the fragrance is nice and clean. when i get dressed up i put this on. i get compliment all the time</li>
</ol>
