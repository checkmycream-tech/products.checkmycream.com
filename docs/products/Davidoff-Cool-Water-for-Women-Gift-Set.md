      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed them immensely.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed when I received this was that the &#x27;gift box&#x27;</li>

    <li> Excellent Highly recommended! A+ Deliver more fast as expected.</li>
    <li> I really love this scent.  I bought these as a treat for myself, and I feel treated.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed them immensely.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend to others who enjoy the fragrance.</li>
    <li> The product was better than when you buy it in a store. The packaging was perfect and the deliver was very good too. Definitely would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> my friend loved her gift</li>
    <li> The wife loves it and so do I. Now I dont even have to leave the house to buy it! :)</li>
    <li> It was delivered perfectly on time and I really love it 😍</li>
    <li> Because it was the cheapest deal I could find, I ordered it on Amazon. This was a fake, I compared it to my old bottle of the perfume it smelled different, like it was infused with too much alcohol. I was disappointed with this purchase, I should of listened to another reviewer who aslo said it was fake.</li>
    <li> it lost during the delivery.  However, they replied me soon and delivered me soon.  It is good.</li>
    <li> I bought it for the wife, she was delighted when she opened it. Great delivery. It got everything that she could ever possibly need.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my sister in law.  I had it shipped directly to her, and it arrived in a timely manner.  She was thrilled.  Great price for a great product and excellent service.</li>
    <li> I have this is mens and it&#x27;s great-the women love it.  The other day I was in the car with my sister and I loved this perfume she had on so, I asked her \\&quot;what are you wearing\\&quot;  she replied \\&quot;Cool Water-women\\&quot;.  Incidentally I bought this gift package for her on the prior CMAS and it represents a great value with the free lotion and shower gel.  Cool Water---Keeps me doing the deep inhale!!</li>
    <li> Excellent price- super fast shipment!  Great company to purchase from! I will definitely buy from this company again.  thank you-</li>
    <li> I love the perfume in this set. It smells clean and fresh. The lotion smells good, but feels more like creamy perfume. It does not help make your skin soft or hydrated.</li>
    <li> It arrived as advertised and my better half is happy with it</li>
    <li> I have no words to express the satisfaction that I gave with this parfum, I love it ! It is my favorite without a doubt</li>
    <li> Gift sets are the way to buy this.  Wife always smells soooooo good.  Always draws comments from people she meets.</li>
    <li> This perfume has been around for many many years. The price on this was definitely a bargain! The first thing I noticed when I received this was that the &#x27;gift box&#x27; it comes in was missing the top. If this had been a gift for someone I would have liked to have the top. But it wasn&#x27;t, so no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;When I went to spray my first spray (i hadnt smelled this in years!) to my dismay the spray didnt spray!&lt;br /&gt;At first I freaked out and was going to send it back the next morning, and I went to complain to my husband, and it magically sprayed. It was a MIRACLE! I hate the hassle of returning stuff. Sure enough same scent as always. This is not a watered down product, but be advised this is an EDT not an EDP, you may need to spray more that once a day to keep the intensity of the scent.</li>
    <li> GOT THIS AS A GIFT AND IT CAME IN GOOD CONDITION AND ARRIVED ON TIME.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it lasts a long time and shipped fast</li>
    <li> The product is nice, qualitywise and otherwise, very good for casual use, stays put and gives a fresh feeling throughout the day. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Cool Water is my favorite, and this price cant be beat. I will ever order from a store again....Amazon nailed on this price/purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells like sope, and the smell is pretty strong.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Even if you put a little bit, the smell is pretty strong.</li>
    <li> Very clean and fresh!!</li>
    <li> This was the first time I tried a Davidoff product and I am extremely pleased. The fragrance lasts for almost the entire day.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for it for months and I couldn&#x27;t find it. Finally I found it here! I love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, which she really liked. But The both of us came to the same conclusion, after about 15 minutes of wear time the sent/Oder dissipates. You cant even smell it after about a half hour of wear. Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> This was my first perfume when in my teens. I just got it this year for my birthday present and I still love it! Very much recommend it if you don&#x27;t like the sweet candy smell of perfume. Cool Water is very fresh and clean. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I liked it, its aroma is pleasant and lingers, the only thing is that I do not find in this presentation (with the body cream and shower gel) in my city and bring it more expensive but I like</li>
    <li> Not as good as I remembered it. This smells like some rancid, watered down version of the real \\&quot;Cool Water\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Love this item it was a gift. I love the smell of it and look forward to ordering it again.</li>
    <li> My niece loves this fragrance, so she really loved the gift set. Great deal for Christmas gift.  Love Amazon lots</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Dad for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery arrived in time.&lt;br /&gt;My Dad loves the shower gel and the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I would / recommend this to others.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and HAPPY 2014!&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Pete&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps:!! i believe that with my being tired, i did not pay close enough attention to the &amp;#34;ratings commentaire&amp;#34; and&lt;br /&gt;i believe that i reversed the 2. the comment for the women&#x27;s cool water got typed in for the men&#x27;s and the&lt;br /&gt;cool water comment for the men got typed in for the women&#x27;s.  lol!!</li>
    <li> No, seriously...it is! I have been using it almost exclusively for years. I get lots of compliments from men and women when I wear it. Sometime people even follow me around! Ha! It&#x27;s a very salty/sweet smell....I know that&#x27;s an odd description, but clean really isn&#x27;t the right word either. Kinda like that amazing salty air smell by the beach, minus the seaweed and fish smell! I love it and it was delivered perfectly and quickly!</li>
    <li> Its a gift, so I cannot really comment on the quality of the smell but the packaging wasn&#x27;t really that great or neat. It kinda looks like it has been on display shelf for long. A little dusty and worn out. For a moment I thought it was used but the seal is intact.</li>
    <li> Great christmas gift, my mom asks for this stuff every year for christmas and this is the best price i find every year by far</li>
    <li> Perfectly satisfied with my purchase.  Received exactly what I ordered and I feel like I got a great value for the money I spent!</li>
    <li> I like .. the fragrance is soft and fresh! very summery thanks for their services: D! and very good shower gel: D</li>
    <li> It was a perfect gift; the person who I gift was verry happy when I gave this present. It is a very good parfum</li>
    <li> Great value, AWESOME PRICE...&lt;br /&gt;The perfume smells so so so good ;) And so does the lotion and the body wash.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The wife asked for this for Christmas. After doing some late shopping I found it here and the price was much cheaper than the stores.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend, after finding the men&#x27;s cologne wanted to try the women&#x27;s version.  She loved it as her Christmas gift.  The scent isn&#x27;t strong smelling.  It is well balanced.  AS someone who can&#x27;t stand strong smells of perfume on men or women I find this to be a nice change.  Best part is that the sent is very pleasant.  Reminds me of a floral stream area.  Probably the reason for the water title.</li>
    <li> Product was a gift for a friend for her birthday. Was very happy with the gift. Perfect product waith a great price.</li>
    <li> Such a great gift idea! When the box arrives was a little bit torn on the side. But nothing a little glue can not fix. Im very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Is a gift that will be loved, cause she loves Cool Water.</li>
    <li> A gift to my daughter and she was thrilled to get it. The smell is very nice and soft.</li>
    <li> The product is good than when you buy it in a store. The packaging was perfect and the deliver was very good too. Definitely would buy this product again. I like so much.</li>
    <li> to over price i keep this one because it smell so good but its to small for that price i view the ocnces next time before order</li>
    <li> This perfume set smells really good and the lotion leaves my skin very moisturize. I would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Buenos dias, el dia de hoy me tome la molestia para calificar esta compra, la cual cumplio con los parametros que esperabamos. Quedamos conforme con la compra, gracias.</li>
    <li> Smells really good...</li>
    <li> on time, very good, excelent</li>
    <li> RECOMMENDED SELLER EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> It was an okay gift.  The cologne here is not a perfume so the pleasant, light scent doesn&#x27;t stay.  Nice for a summer&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PERFUME FOR MY MOTHER AND SHE LOVES THE WONDERFUL SMELL..</li>
    <li> Light clean scent that last a long time....I usually prefer more floral scents....but this is nice, I don&#x27;t regret buying it....it&#x27;s a great price for all three</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS ONE FOR MY WIFE , AND EVERYTIME SHE PUTS IT ON , MAKES HER IRRESISTABLE. WE BOTH LIKE IT A LOT. FRESH AND CLEAN .</li>
