      <li>I was looking for these exact studs, and they are perfect.  </li>
      <li>amazing quality definatly buying it again</li>
      <li>I am sure its a good product.</li>
      <li>i like the earing and they are package it in a nice way</li>
      <li>First off, let me say that these earrings were a great buy.</li>
      <li>Other wise they are perfect.</li>
      <li>it starts out skinny and steps up 2 more times...</li>
      <li>I have ordered 3mm ball earrings many times before...</li>
      <li>I have birds and they love to bite shiny things.</li>
      <li>love the earrings</li>
      <li>I am pleased with my experience all around.</li>
      <li>One caveat, the diameter of the Studex posts is greater than that of my Clair&#x27;s stud piercing ear rings.</li>
      <li>Delivery was faster than a speeding bullet, and they were exactly as described and look really good.</li>
      <li>fine..</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re fine</li>
      <li>They are perfectly fine for my intentions.</li>
      <li>After that, my ears were fine.</li>
      <li>Anyway once I got them in they were totally fine, comfortable and looked</li>
      <li>Be sure you get the right size to fit your gun.</li>
      <li>They look really nice, especially if you have more than one ear piercing, which is why I bought them.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth it because I got 12 pair for just over $20 with shipping.</li>
      <li>They seem to be the only kind that do not irritate my ear lobes.</li>
      <li>because i do believe ppl mess up...but the intergrity of the company is what makes it a good company and</li>
      <li>They are solid and very comfortable to wear all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>very reasonable pricing on this product.</li>
      <li>These were still a great deal at $22, but honestly $5.95 for standard shipping on an item so light is absurd.</li>
      <li>tried multiple evenings and on the 3rd night I was successful.  </li>
      <li>were turning my piercings funny colors or leaving buildup.</li>
      <li>first off...</li>
      <li>First of all...</li>
      <li>Finally, although they were shipped USPS snail mail, the ear rings arrived quickly and very well and securely packaged.</li>
      <li>so i thought this was a good deal because i usually have to pay for shipping on each set of earrings that i get</li>
      <li>And yes, it&#x27;s worth the temporary discomfort from putting slightly thicker earrings in :)</li>
      <li>Got my ears pierced by Clair&#x27;s using, supposedly, stainless post ear rings.</li>
      <li>Any place that does piercings wants to charge $50 for a pair of piercing studs, even if you don&#x27;t get your ears pierced.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping and</li>
      <li>These earrings are like the ones you get when you first pierced your ears, so they normally don&#x27;t get your ears infected.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend these!</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I really like them.</li>
      <li>peirced three on my own ears and six of a few freinds.</li>
      <li>Buying earrings that will fill all the holes and not cause an allergic reaction is not easy or cost effective.</li>
      <li>Got far more bang for my buck (even w/ the extraordinarily high shipping cost) than if I&#x27;d purchased one pair - locally or online.</li>
      <li>I wish they have more style, so that they don&#x27;t look so plain.</li>
      <li>Yes they are oddly gauged, so I had to put them in one at a time and make sure I cleaned properly every day.</li>
      <li>They are sterilized (before you open them) stainless steel.</li>
      <li>only type of earrings are using my ears fast shipment will work with them again</li>
      <li>I need these because I have sensitive ears.  </li>
      <li>put my daughter&#x27;s old earrings in from when she got her ears pierced</li>
      <li>I ordered these and tossed the Clair&#x27;s drek after my ears were swelling and, in time, turned grey around my \\&quot;stainless steel\\&quot; piercing studs from Clair&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve left them in for over a month and no problems... and they&#x27;re 8 year old earrings.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve left them in for over a month and no problems... and they&#x27;re 8 year old earrings.  </li>
<li> The gauge is far too thick for normally pierced ears.</li>
<li> I used to buy these same earrings from Claire&#x27;s because they lasted a long time and never stained my skin.</li>

<li> A complete waste of a purchase.</li>
<li> So, I needed to have earrings that could stay in and be sort of bird proof -- they have bitten through hollow earrings and put dents in others.&lt;br</li>
<li> i have 9 holes in one ear and 3 in the other...</li>
<li> I have five piercings on one side, and six on the other.</li>
<li> I have three piercings in each lobe and all the other earrings I was trying</li>
<li> If you have slightly gauged ears then you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
<li> Not true, I discovered.</li>
<li> Something to keep my ear piercings from closing w/out causing infection or turning my ears gray (or green).</li>
<li> I got the idea to buy earrings used for piercing, just so I can have everyday earrings in all the time.&lt;br</li>
<li> Just does not fit the stud gun at all.</li>
<li> Hypo-allergenic earrings work for a short while, but when the coating wears off, the earring is terribly uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I bought this item because I&#x27;m too lazy to keep putting on and taking off my earring throughout the week.</li>
<li> They are very plain as well.</li>
<li> I keep having trouble with earrings irritating my skin.  </li>
<li> tried to put it in... and realized that they&#x27;re too thick for my holes.....</li>
<li> they looked soo big and stupid...</li>
<li> i&#x27;m sooo annoyed at this situation...</li>
<li> that i did not contact the company and give them the opportunity to rectify this...because i am soo annoyed...</li>
<li> annoyed annoyed...</li>
<li> the only reason that I gave them 4 instead of 5 was the awful shipping costs.</li>
<li> the stem is designed soo weird...</li>
<li> Well they are as described but the end looks alot like a sting ray barb and its difficult to get off and on.  </li>
<li> it was weird...</li>
<li> unpleasant</li>
<li> am so disappointed!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have birds and they love to bite shiny things. If I don&#x27;t wear earrings my holes close up. So, I needed to have earrings that could stay in and be sort of bird proof -- they have bitten through hollow earrings and put dents in others.&lt;br /&gt;These work! They are solid and very comfortable to wear all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Now if I could only get the birds to understand, &amp;#34;Leave it&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that these earrings were a great buy. You get 12 pairs of sterilized studs. They look really nice, especially if you have more than one ear piercing, which is why I bought them. I have three piercings in each lobe and all the other earrings I was trying were turning my piercings funny colors or leaving buildup. I will say that these must be a slightly different gauge than what I was wearing before, because when I put them in there was a bit of a stretching feeling. I got my ears pierced at Claire&#x27;s so maybe that&#x27;s why. Anyway once I got them in they were totally fine, comfortable and looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the only reason that I gave them 4 instead of 5 was the awful shipping costs. These were still a great deal at $22, but honestly $5.95 for standard shipping on an item so light is absurd. I don&#x27;t regret buying them, and they did arrive a lot faster than I thought they would (about 2 days, and they came in on a Saturday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> i like the earing and they are package it in a nice way</li>
    <li> I am sure its a good product. Just does not fit the stud gun at all. So cannot say how well they attach. Be sure you get the right size to fit your gun. I just use them for piercings that are already healed.</li>
    <li> I bought these for home-use.  I don&#x27;t pierce ears.  I keep having trouble with earrings irritating my skin.  Either my ear will itch, or it will swell from the earring&#x27;s metal...  Hypo-allergenic earrings work for a short while, but when the coating wears off, the earring is terribly uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my daughter&#x27;s old earrings in from when she got her ears pierced and I noticed that my ears didn&#x27;t react to them... I&#x27;ve left them in for over a month and no problems... and they&#x27;re 8 year old earrings.  I got the idea to buy earrings used for piercing, just so I can have everyday earrings in all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping these would be multi colored, but they are just solid steel studs.  Not a big deal.  The &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; appearance goes with everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to put it in... and realized that they&#x27;re too thick for my holes.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subsequent hours I spent attempting to force it in were...  unpleasant ~.~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried multiple evenings and on the 3rd night I was successful.  After about 4 days of discomfort (and twisting them, just like I&#x27;d just gotten my ears pierced) they&#x27;re fine and I&#x27;ve not removed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No reactions... no discomfort... and I have extras in case I lose any.  I leave them in 24/7 w/o worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)  And yes, it&#x27;s worth the temporary discomfort from putting slightly thicker earrings in :)</li>
    <li> very reasonable pricing on this product. All the piercing studs are hygienically packaged for individual use with a studex piercing tool. Shipping was fast. I am pleased with my experience all around.</li>
    <li> love the earrings great quality earrings only type of earrings are using my ears fast shipment will work with them again</li>
    <li> The gauge is far too thick for normally pierced ears. I couldn&#x27;t even push them through to attempt to stretch the piercing holes. If you have slightly gauged ears then you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. A complete waste of a purchase.</li>
    <li> These are the studs that you get when getting your ears pierced. They are sterilized (before you open them) stainless steel. They seem to be the only kind that do not irritate my ear lobes. Delivery was faster than a speeding bullet, and they were exactly as described and look really good. But, the shipping and handling price made me gasp. I almost changed my mind.  Since I was ordering 12 pair, I bit the bullet.  Out of curiosity, I weighed the package on my postal scale. It did not weigh a pound and parcel post cost for one pound was $5.38. My daughter and granddaughters want their birthstones.  I looked to see what this seller&#x27;s S&amp;H was for one pair of earrings, and they want the same $9.95. Has anyone heard of postage gouging?  If you can afford it, buy them.  My rating is based on the shipping cost.</li>
    <li> First of all...I have ordered 3mm ball earrings many times before...so i thought this was a good deal because i usually have to pay for shipping on each set of earrings that i get i have 9 holes in one ear and 3 in the other...anyways...first off...they are not balls...they look like balls in the picture...but they aren&#x27;t...and there is no picture to enlarge...but i thought...fine..i will give it a try...and i wish i didn&#x27;t...so..second...the stem is designed soo weird...its like a sting rays barb...it starts out skinny and steps up 2 more times...wth...why would it do this..?? this just made it worse...and irritated my ears when putting them in...it was weird...3rd....trying to get them out when my ear became infected was the same...4th...there is no way they are 3mm...they looked soo big and stupid...i was annoyed...annoyed annoyed annoyed...i&#x27;m sooo annoyed at this situation...i have had my ears pierced for 20 years...and never had this happen before....not happy...not satisfied...and in pain....///i will state in all fairness...that i did not contact the company and give them the opportunity to rectify this...because i am soo annoyed...but if they read this...and reach out to me...i will note that....because i do believe ppl mess up...but the intergrity of the company is what makes it a good company and what keeps people coming back....</li>
    <li> I have five piercings on one side, and six on the other. Buying earrings that will fill all the holes and not cause an allergic reaction is not easy or cost effective. Yes they are oddly gauged, so I had to put them in one at a time and make sure I cleaned properly every day. Other wise they are perfect.</li>
    <li> sterile and good quality the come sealed in pairs and sterilized. good for piercing ears and use as safety earrings</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I&#x27;m too lazy to keep putting on and taking off my earring throughout the week. These earrings are like the ones you get when you first pierced your ears, so they normally don&#x27;t get your ears infected. I just put them on and they stay in place painlessly. I really like them. I wish they have more style, so that they don&#x27;t look so plain.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted! I used to buy these same earrings from Claire&#x27;s because they lasted a long time and never stained my skin. But sometimes, after long use the back will come off and I&#x27;ll lose the earrings. But this way, I always have back-ups. Very impressed with the speed of shipping and product!</li>
    <li> I was looking for these exact studs, and they are perfect.  Fast shipping and the price is great.  Any place that does piercings wants to charge $50 for a pair of piercing studs, even if you don&#x27;t get your ears pierced.  I need these because I have sensitive ears.  I do not want to pay $50/pair when I only needed 3 pair.  This is definitely worth it because I got 12 pair for just over $20 with shipping.</li>
    <li> Got extra spares so when my granddaughters lose one...They will still have matching sets th use and make it easier</li>
    <li> Well they are as described but the end looks alot like a sting ray barb and its difficult to get off and on.  They are very plain as well.</li>
    <li> peirced three on my own ears and six of a few freinds. amazing quality definatly buying it again</li>
    <li> They are perfectly fine for my intentions. Something to keep my ear piercings from closing w/out causing infection or turning my ears gray (or green). Got my ears pierced by Clair&#x27;s using, supposedly, stainless post ear rings. Not true, I discovered. I ordered these and tossed the Clair&#x27;s drek after my ears were swelling and, in time, turned grey around my \\&quot;stainless steel\\&quot; piercing studs from Clair&#x27;s. Another plus side to these is that they \\&quot;lock on\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing one - or both - ear rings. Got far more bang for my buck (even w/ the extraordinarily high shipping cost) than if I&#x27;d purchased one pair - locally or online. I plan to order \\&quot;gold\\&quot; Studex piercing ear rings next... to compliment my gold dangley ear rings... -- One caveat, the diameter of the Studex posts is greater than that of my Clair&#x27;s stud piercing ear rings. So, my ears needed to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; to these (stretch the piercings) for a couple of days. After that, my ears were fine. -- Finally, although they were shipped USPS snail mail, the ear rings arrived quickly and very well and securely packaged.</li>
    <li> i ordered this studex on march 12, i think it&#x27;s a good deal cuz you&#x27;ll get 12 pairs of earrings. and i ordered it because it has a lot of good reviews. but until now i haven&#x27;t received it yet... i supposed to receive this yesterday april 3 2013.i am so disappointed!!! this thing doesn&#x27;t deserve a star!!!</li>
