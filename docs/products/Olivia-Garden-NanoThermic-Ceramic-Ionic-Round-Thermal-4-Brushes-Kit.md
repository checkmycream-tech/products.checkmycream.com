<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these brushes!! So lightweight and has a nice handle grip. These brushes were super expensive at my salon.</li>
    <li> They are the best brushes I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the money. All for brushes are less than you would pay for two of them. I have curly, frizzy hair and these brushes make my hair smooth once I am done blow drying with them.  I have recommended them to friends and they agree!</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed that I paid $60 for these and they came with a price tag of $39.99</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of round styling brushes, and they work well when blow drying my hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly.. It Came Different Presentation..</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re easy to clean, the finish hasn&#x27;t worn off (yet), and different sizes are perfect for different things. They also speed drying and styling immensely and are good for travel, too. I really like them. The only issue is that the bristles are a little sharp, but that&#x27;s true of any nylon bristled brush- i&#x27;m sure those could be blunted at time of manufacture, but no one has figured that out yet. The bag is pretty handy for holding the ones I&#x27;m not using- I just wish each brush came with its own slip-on cover, so I didn&#x27;t have to keep putting them back in the plastic sheaths. I&#x27;m a clean freak about certain things, and I honestly would&#x27;ve paid 10$ more for that. But I definitely dig these.</li>
    <li> Really fast ahipping and product was acurately described</li>
    <li> They are very good brushes. well grab the hair. the hair dries faster eliminate frizz, and the brightness that leaves the hair is awesome. I use my dryer BaByliss Pro Nano, which is also ionic, for best results and also completed faster.  Ohh, and the presentation is worth every penny. very good presentation and very lightweight.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> could have bought the 2 sixes I needed a lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> This bag of olivia garden brushes are amazing.you can not find this price for 4 olivia garden brushes in stores.The brushes are light ,easy to work with and dry hair fast and eliminate frizz.</li>
    <li> Excellent // I love it.. When I can I will purchase another one .. of course. Tanks for this purchase</li>
    <li> in love with this brushes! i have a lot of brushes and, by using this, i make my hair in half of time.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist had one of these brushes and raved about it and I loved the color and design so decided to purchase the set.  Wow - couldn&#x27;t be happier with them.  High quality, attractive design, work great on my hair.  One use and I have thrown out all of my old round brushes.  These are far nicer than anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, don&#x27;t snag hair, well made and the size selection is just what I needed! Would by these again!</li>
    <li> Regarding the brushes, they&#x27;re amazing. Don&#x27;t get stuck in the hair (even the most tangled hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled with these), they also leave the hair really soft, pretty weigtless, love the design and color. I think the only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the shipping but that&#x27;s a whole different story that has nothing to do with the product itself. I&#x27;m a hairstylist so I&#x27;m always looking for new brushes and tools and these brushes are pretty amazing  :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to start using it on my clients. It arrived in good condition. I can tell it would do great things for my clients..</li>
    <li> I have looking for round brushes that made my hair shiny not frizzy.  These are excellent brushes that do exactly that. They also come  in a clear plastic carrying pouch which is great because my kids know not to use them.</li>
    <li> These brushes gives the best blow out.  A lot of salons use them and sell them.  Looking to replace an old one, I went on Amazon &amp; found this set, which is an even better value!  The single brushes on Amazon are also a great value, so I also picked up a flat brush (to brush out dry hair -- one or two reviews compared it to Mason-Pearson, &amp; they were right on).  I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends to come here online &amp; shop!!  If you use the right size barrel for your hair length, you will get a salon-quality blow-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of tips:  don&#x27;t use too much product in your hair.  Dry hair loosely &amp; then start styling.  Pick up small sections.  You can spin the brush, pull hair &amp; blow dryer straight up from scalp, curl/twirl the ends -- depending upon what result you want.  My hair is very fine, colored (read: delicate), curly/wavy, and past shoulder length to below chin in front with long bangs.  Last tip:  I always use salon shampoo &amp; a gf just suggested Tresseme&#x27;s line of keratin smooth -- &amp; it WORKS!!  rain, humiditity &amp; NO FRIZZ.  kid you not.  I&#x27;ve had salon keratin treatments (flat straight boring hair), alternatives which didn&#x27;t last long, this is a MUCH better &amp; affordable solution.  worth giving a try.  Happy hair!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. I only needed a couple of sizes so I gave the others to friends and they loved them too</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> Greatest curling brushes I have ever used.  Different sizes help with longer or shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes. I am a professional stylist and this set is a HUGE bargain! I went to my local salon centric and they were much more expensive individually. They have a pick so you don&#x27;t have to mess around with a comb for parting when doing a blow out. Makes the hair super shiny. A good stylist has to invest in good tools to compliment their work! I may buy this as a gift for my stylist friend</li>
    <li> Great Thermal round Brushes!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE!!!! Worth it!</li>
    <li> love these brushes.  cant use them real well yet.  but working on it.</li>
    <li> Great items, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love the Olivia Garden brushes. J6st wish i had bought the bamboo handles like i did before.  rubber on handl pulls my hair out. Plan to return the item.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!  They really seem to grab the hair and work great for blow drying my curly hair straight in much less time.  Definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> I love them. it is weightless. it leaves my hair soft and shine.The only issue is that the bristles are a little sharp and burn. I have TwinTurbo hair dryer and the brushes get burned</li>
    <li> Great brushes, great price !</li>
    <li> My hairstylist told me she found these brushes here at amazon.  They brush through my hair easily and style without getting hair tangled in the brush. The different sizes allow for different looks. Comes in a great carry bag.</li>
    <li> like I&#x27;m pleased and recommend I recommend it to other customers are very versatile and the quality I expected&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> So happy! looking for an Affordable set of professional brushes with picks on the bottom.  And the carrying case is a real plus!</li>
    <li> They were Recomended by my stylist and they do what I need them to do.  I prefer a bristle brush but it takes too long on work days. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> Love the new brushes! So easy to use and don&#x27;t hurt your scalp.  The pics at the ends of the brush are great for sectioning your hair while drying!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  The style really holds all day and it&#x27;s great to have multiple sizes of brushes for different areas.</li>
    <li> I really like these round brushes. They have a rubber handle which makes it easier to hold on to while blow drying your hair. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> my kit contained 3 brushes  AND a manufacturer&#x27;s card saying the price was 39.95...I paid 59.00..I feel ripped off..but I have been hearing this about AMAZON lately...the shipping charges are incorporated in the price...so perhaps they should take a look at what is int he package before sending it..Never again</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic. They make my hair so much softer and easier to flat iron/style. I love them!</li>
    <li> Good quality, good price, arrived fast and in good condition. Recommended for professional or private use.</li>
    <li> Pristine Condition. Fabulous Brushes.</li>
    <li> I love them, my hair dry faster using them.</li>
    <li> The plastic around the grip get tangled in my hair and breaks it...I don&#x27;t appreciate it that:(</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> they do get hot but if I use these I don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron ... they work GREAT</li>
    <li> i love this brushes is amazing how fast you can dry your hair and the quality of the products,I&#x27;m really happy with this product and  in the future I&#x27;m going to buy more brushes from this sellers to complete my collection.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes!  Received sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> The brushes themselves are very nice and seem as if they&#x27;ll hold up for a while without the bristles coming apart, which is definitely a plus for tangled thick hair. However, I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars solely for the price. I paid $59.00 for this yet the tag that comes with it states &amp;#34;All for only $39.95 (salon value: $55)&amp;#34; did I miss something?</li>
    <li> Love the fact that do not pull your hair and they are great for fast drying!&lt;br /&gt;And for the price they are great.  This is the cheapest place to buy them!</li>
    <li> Perfect, highly recommend!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good, so far I&#x27;m quite happy with them.  I still get lots of flyaways, but that may be my lack of blowout skills, rather than any fault with the brushes.</li>
    <li> If your looking for the perfect round brush set look no further! This set is a steal for how well they perform! They fit comfortably in my hand and are practically weightless. Plus they dry the hair in no time at all!! Seriously a must own!</li>
