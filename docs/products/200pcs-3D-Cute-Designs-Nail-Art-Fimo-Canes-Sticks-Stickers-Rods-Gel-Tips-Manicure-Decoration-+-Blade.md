      <li>You get so much more and more variety for your money this way and</li>
      <li>My girlfriend and daughter&#x27;s love them and can&#x27;t wait to use them .</li>
      <li>And I can&#x27;t believe how many choices there are.</li>
      <li>I love these canes.</li>
      <li>Do not go for your favorite design unless you have cut these before&lt;br /&gt;Fruit and flowers a plenty in this set.</li>
      <li>I would order again and have ordered more.</li>
      <li>its a great variety, it shipped fast</li>
      <li>These are soo cute in person.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited to use this pile of nail art!</li>
      <li>The razor that it comes with is  AWESOME and super sharp</li>
      <li>Would have loved more of a bigger variety of these....</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m really happy with what I got and would say it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>they are really cool</li>
      <li>So I doubt I&#x27;ll really ever need to get more.</li>
      <li>Yes there are repeats, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing since</li>
      <li>Yes they are about half the size of most Fimo canes on here, but I got a really good variety.</li>
      <li>The razor is sharp, and I got a great assortment.</li>
      <li>But other then that great deal and product</li>
      <li>, some of them are cute enough to want more than one stick.</li>
      <li>recommended the same to a friend who was also very pleased with the delivery time and the product.</li>
      <li>and I love trying new things.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this product has changed since it got so many good reviews, but I received mine yesterday</li>
      <li>There are a lot of fun designs in here.</li>
      <li>The designs are really nice, but had I known of the size prior to purchasing them</li>
      <li>Over all, totally worth it if you&#x27;re into doing your nails</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>I can see how the young teens would really love these.</li>
      <li>The only one I wish was in it were bananas, but that&#x27;s OK because I can hand paint those if I want them.</li>
      <li>I have used these several times now and they slice easy (thanks to the included razor)</li>
      <li>A couple of canes were absolute garbage, just unidentifiable sticks of color.</li>
      <li>Product arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
      <li>The price of the fimo canes and the amount was what really convinced me to purchase these canes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really excited to start doing my nails in different designs.</li>
      <li>I Wish there where more variety I received  some canes like 6 times and other once.</li>
      <li>(I only had one like this, but that&#x27;s most of the reason why I only gave it 4 stars) getting a repeat of that one</li>
      <li>I like most of the designs, but there are a few that are too some to tell what the are.</li>
      <li>They are also really easy to slice, I was worried about not being able to get them thin enough</li>
      <li>When the items arrived I was really excited to open the package and finally try out nail art with fimo canes.</li>
      <li>I got tons of duplicates and very few cute designs.</li>
      <li>what I&#x27;ve noticed with the pre-cut fimo slices is that some of them are entirely too thick and therefore hard to use, with slicing your own you can very easily remedy that.</li>
      <li>I got one or two that were a little bigger (I wish I got more).</li>
      <li>but they are proportionate to my natural nails.</li>
      <li>I was skepticle at first because the picture showed two sets of the same ones, but since people said they got all different ones, I went ahead.</li>
      <li>My advice is to spend a few more dollars and order a different set of canes form a different seller.</li>
      <li>(not even necessarily nail art specifically, because these just make it so easy you need to special nail art skills, though I personally like to incorporate them into some other design) and completely worth the money for how long these will last you, especially if you slice them thin.</li>
      <li>There were minimal duplicates and the service was fast.  </li>
      <li>Mine came in a day early and they are smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
      <li>I am able to get them so thin.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s pretty typical.</li>

<li> I sorted through all of them and less than half are worth keeping.</li>
<li> You need to have rather flat nail surfaces to make these work well.</li>
<li> and I can get them super thin.</li>
<li> so i have some for quite a long time.</li>
<li> I got doubles of maybe four or five of them, but since I got everything I was hoping for ( bows, fruit, flowers, and some random ones I thought looked cool)</li>
<li> I&#x27;m less likely to use.</li>
<li> makes it not really matter.</li>
<li> I expected a variety since there were 200 of them...</li>
<li> A few days earlier than expected...</li>
<li> Well when I opened the package I was really surprised to see how small the canes were!</li>
<li> The canes were less than 5 centimeters long and .5 centimeters wide!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try these for a while and when the price dropped down</li>
<li> it&#x27;s so sharp, but it does in fact come covered in a little cardboard sleeve so no worries there.</li>
<li> It is extremely tiny which makes it a little hard to control so there is a learning curve in slicing these</li>
<li> Test out an odd stick or cane you wont use (Puerto Rican flag for me.</li>
<li> I was missing.  </li>
<li> I have tried the razor and a few of the canes.</li>
<li> it didn&#x27;t bother me at all that I got a few doubles or a couple</li>
<li> Not happy with this product and such a waste of time and money.</li>
<li> I was super disappointed because out of the 200 fimos over 65 of them were fruits....</li>
<li> These rods are really really small.  </li>
<li> sure you use a cutting board or something that wont take damage from the razor...if you dont your gonna have a bad time</li>
<li> its expected yo get some fruit but not that many...and there were some canes that made no sense and seems as though they are used as fillers...was sad..</li>
<li> In am obsessed with nail art</li>
<li> I was worried about the size because I don&#x27;t use fake nails</li>
<li> The canes are difficult to cut and use.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t forget to buy the blade for cutting the rods!</li>
<li> That and as annoying as it is that some may be chipped/broken to the point that you can&#x27;t use most/all of the cane</li>
<li> and I was very disappointed.</li>

    <li> These are soo cute in person. Mine came in a day early and they are smaller than I thought they would be. I was worried about the size because I don&#x27;t use fake nails but they are proportionate to my natural nails. Some duplication but I don&#x27;t mind, some of them are cute enough to want more than one stick. They are also really easy to slice, I was worried about not being able to get them thin enough but that wasn&#x27;t a problem at all.</li>
    <li> Omg! I just got these in the mail. And I can&#x27;t believe how many choices there are. I&#x27;m really excited to start doing my nails in different designs. This is definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Well done!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product has changed since it got so many good reviews, but I received mine yesterday and I was very disappointed. I got tons of duplicates and very few cute designs. A couple of canes were absolute garbage, just unidentifiable sticks of color. I sorted through all of them and less than half are worth keeping. My advice is to spend a few more dollars and order a different set of canes form a different seller. I wish I had.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Yes they are about half the size of most Fimo canes on here, but I got a really good variety. There were some duplicates but that&#x27;s pretty typical. Overall I&#x27;m really happy with what I got and would say it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use this pile of nail art! I have plenty to choose from. Even got some holiday ones too.</li>
    <li> I like most of the designs, but there are a few that are too some to tell what the are. I got one or two that were a little bigger (I wish I got more). I have enough nail art to last the rest of my life</li>
    <li> The selection variety is great.  These rods are really really small.  There were minimal duplicates and the service was fast.  Can&#x27;t wait to start using them and creating my own nail designs.</li>
    <li> The canes are difficult to cut and use. Not happy with this product and such a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> but the plastic bag was damaged  but the sticks was in good condensations ..my sisters like it.. maybe i will buy them again</li>
    <li> Totally what I thought</li>
    <li> its a great variety, it shipped fast and i was happy with my purchase. theres a lot of them so i have some for quite a long time. great quality</li>
    <li> The speed of the delivery and the product made my daughter very happy. The price made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;We recommended the same to a friend who was also very pleased with the delivery time and the product.</li>
    <li> The designs are super cute...but be warned!!!  You need to have rather flat nail surfaces to make these work well. Both my daughter and I have rather curved nails and even the smaller designs do not stay adhered well. I guess we will be using them primarly on our big toes in the Summer time.  Good value for the price though - plenty of designs and colors included...  Don&#x27;t forget to buy the blade for cutting the rods! I can see how the young teens would really love these.</li>
    <li> They came in the mail today. A few days earlier than expected...and it had a short shipping estimate too! I have tried the razor and a few of the canes. They cut amazing! I am able to get them so thin. There are a lot of fun designs in here. I only wish there was no Puerto Rican flags. There were two or 3 of those. Im in love.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use a cutting board or something that wont take damage from the razor...if you dont your gonna have a bad time&lt;br /&gt; Test out an odd stick or cane you wont use (Puerto Rican flag for me. Im so white Im wonder bread) Do not go for your favorite design unless you have cut these before&lt;br /&gt;Fruit and flowers a plenty in this set. Also very cute bows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Awesome product..will buy again IF I ever run out!</li>
    <li> In am obsessed with nail art and I love trying new things. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try these for a while and when the price dropped down I went ahead and ordered them. Of all the packages this was the best deal. I was skepticle at first because the picture showed two sets of the same ones, but since people said they got all different ones, I went ahead. And I did get all different ones. I got doubles of maybe four or five of them, but since I got everything I was hoping for ( bows, fruit, flowers, and some random ones I thought looked cool) it didn&#x27;t bother me at all that I got a few doubles or a couple I&#x27;m less likely to use. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;d order them again, however 150 is A LOT and ive heard people say you can get up to 100 slices out of each stick. So I doubt I&#x27;ll really ever need to get more. The only one I wish was in it were bananas, but that&#x27;s OK because I can hand paint those if I want them. So anyone who is looking between this and another packs, I personally loved it. The razor is sharp, and I got a great assortment. I&#x27;d reccomend it to anyone! I also ordered foils and best glue ever for both these and the foils. Best glue ever comes highly reccomended by a lot of the nail tutortial artists on YouTube. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-heather-</li>
    <li> I ordered and received these they are really cool can&#x27;t wait to use them. I would order again and have ordered more. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love these canes. I Wish there where more variety I received  some canes like 6 times and other once. I also ordered 200 and only received 196 I hope they  send me the 4 I was missing.  But other then that great deal and product</li>
    <li> OMG so many!! Yes there are repeats, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing since, hey, you could like the one that&#x27;s repeated. For example I got 4 Hello Kitties which is awesome because I was really hoping to get those. That and as annoying as it is that some may be chipped/broken to the point that you can&#x27;t use most/all of the cane (I only had one like this, but that&#x27;s most of the reason why I only gave it 4 stars) getting a repeat of that one makes it not really matter. The razor that it comes with is  AWESOME and super sharp, I accidentally cut my finger a couple times without even realizing it it&#x27;s so sharp, but it does in fact come covered in a little cardboard sleeve so no worries there. It is extremely tiny which makes it a little hard to control so there is a learning curve in slicing these but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll never want to go back to pre-cut fimo ever again. You get so much more and more variety for your money this way and what I&#x27;ve noticed with the pre-cut fimo slices is that some of them are entirely too thick and therefore hard to use, with slicing your own you can very easily remedy that. Over all, totally worth it if you&#x27;re into doing your nails (not even necessarily nail art specifically, because these just make it so easy you need to special nail art skills, though I personally like to incorporate them into some other design) and completely worth the money for how long these will last you, especially if you slice them thin.</li>
    <li> love love love!! would recommend to all my friends!! cant wait to do my nails and my three daughters nails!!</li>
    <li> I was super disappointed because out of the 200 fimos over 65 of them were fruits....and the others had multiples of the same canes as well. Would have loved more of a bigger variety of these....I expected a variety since there were 200 of them...its expected yo get some fruit but not that many...and there were some canes that made no sense and seems as though they are used as fillers...was sad..</li>
    <li> These are a great addition to my nail art collection.  I can not wait to use these with some of my designs. Excellent price and fast delivery. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and daughter&#x27;s love them and can&#x27;t wait to use them .</li>
    <li> The price of the fimo canes and the amount was what really convinced me to purchase these canes. I paid around $12 (including shipping) for 200pcs + blade. When the items arrived I was really excited to open the package and finally try out nail art with fimo canes. Well when I opened the package I was really surprised to see how small the canes were! As someone who does tons of research before purchasing an item, I knew that these canes were a lot smaller than those from MASH, etc. The canes were less than 5 centimeters long and .5 centimeters wide! The one good thing about these is that the assortment is really good and I received only 4 duplicates! The designs are really nice, but had I known of the size prior to purchasing them I would have probably ordered the MASH set. I will still be using these in my nail art , but will probably in the future place an order for MASH. Hopefully this helps someone make their decision.</li>
    <li> I have used these several times now and they slice easy (thanks to the included razor) and I can get them super thin. This is a big assortment to choose from, only 3 were duplicates.</li>
