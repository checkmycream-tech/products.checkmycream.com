      <li>This product great &amp; is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Comes in an excessively nice carrying case.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just somewhat effective.</li>
      <li>At most its good to loosen them up before having to rely on your fingers.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Better than most you can find!</li>
      <li>Usually a good blast of water will clean it, then we rinse it in alcohol to kill bacteria.</li>
      <li>Better off using your fingers than this thing.</li>
      <li>Most helpful review here.</li>
      <li>Like to hole style better than the loop.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to most people, unless you&#x27;re looking for perfection.</li>
      <li>However, it will not save you from having to squeeze most blackheads and comedones.</li>
      <li>The loop version works much better and easier to use.</li>
      <li>Just set it over the pore, push, and it&#x27;s clean!</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend it to everyone who has blackheads.</li>
      <li>The seller was prompt in shipping and accurate in description.  </li>
      <li>The description for this item is accurate.</li>
      <li>Gentle, nice case.</li>
      <li>The all you have to do is take some tissue and wipe it clean and then move on to another blackhead.</li>
      <li>This is WAY to large to get most acne.</li>
      <li>Recommend most highly!</li>
      <li>This blackhead remover is by no means perfect, but for the most part it will get blackheads out (especially after a long, hot shower).  </li>
      <li>We received it quickly.</li>
      <li>It is a professional item which most of estheticians use.</li>
      <li>I would lay down money that noone in the history of comedome extraction has ever successfully used an extractor like this on themselves, to get rid of even one blackhead.</li>
      <li>We all have issues and sometimes it helps to have the right tools to manage them.</li>
      <li>Hmmmm, I am wondering why there are such great reviews since this product doesn&#x27;t actually work for me.</li>
      <li>You are much better off with a pore strip, which actually works.</li>
      <li>i really don&#x27;t know how to use it!</li>
      <li>This actually a pretty good piece of gear for removing blankheads, it could be improved by tilting the head slightly away from the main body of the tool.</li>
      <li>For anyone with large pores, this item gets the job done without any scaring chances</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>these really do work wash your skin and heat up the area</li>
      <li>Sturdy stainless steel.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work like you&#x27;d think</li>
      <li>When the tool arrived, my son tried it out and it works wonders, without as much pain as you would expect.  </li>
      <li>The curved design really works well.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s delicate and painless and helps keep you looking good.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and vendor.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I bought this extractor after I read a few good reviews about it, but after using it following their instructions, I can honestly say that it doesn&#x27;t do anything to blackheads, at least it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>The cleansers we were using may have been preventing new blackheads, but they didn&#x27;t help the existing ones.  </li>
      <li>I am really not sure why this product has so many favorable reviews.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my 15 year old son to help get rid of his blackheads.  </li>
      <li>I like it but still not sure why I choose this one as there are so many similar items for a cheaper price.</li>
      <li>The most useless are the positive reviews because they&#x27;re totally bull$%@ng</li>
      <li>At first the pressure hurt when pushing down.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, blackheads are by nature deeply inserted into the skin, and this tool doesn&#x27;t completely remove them (if at all), which means that all your doing is leaving the actual blockage deeper into the skin.    </li>
      <li>Actually I lost it after having it for a little while and am now buying the exact same one to replace the lost one.</li>

<li> This tool was perfect in removing those nasty deep black heads.</li>
<li> and it really suched that hard.</li>
<li> Wow, this isn&#x27;t even small enough to use on blackheads.</li>
<li> If you have monster zits, then by all means get this, but if you have the normal to even small blackheads, keep searching.</li>
<li> It did not clear one pore or remove one blackhead.  </li>
<li> Very solid and works well with some technique, I just wish it had a big and small end for different sized problems.</li>
<li> Not worth the time and expense of shipping back.  </li>
<li> This product did not get out any blackheads, the only thing it did was leave little circles all over my face.  </li>
<li> I bought this product along with another that has an oval loop vs spoon with hole in the center.  </li>
<li> What a total waste of money.</li>
<li> This product is a simple metal rod with a small apature at one end.</li>
<li> I guess those reviews are what made me buy this useless product in the first place.  </li>
<li> other people might get if they try to use their fingers, tweezers, etc.</li>
<li> The blunt cup shape exerts too little pressure on surrounding flesh to force anything out.</li>
<li> Black heads come out with ease!</li>
<li> The device has too small openings to get the blackheads unlogged.</li>
<li> This product is not effective.</li>
<li> Made my face worse.  </li>
<li> maybe because i&#x27;m doing it wrong</li>
<li> I threw it out after two uses.  :(</li>
<li> Worthless.  </li>
<li> My children and I were very disappointed in this product.  </li>
<li> item is designed for someone else to use on you, probably with equally miserable results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My children and I were very disappointed in this product.  It appears sturdy however, the design does not lend itself to extracting blackheads as it is intended.</li>
    <li> This product is not effective. The holes that are supposed to be pressed over the blackheads are simply too big for all but the biggest blackheads. Furthermore, blackheads are by nature deeply inserted into the skin, and this tool doesn&#x27;t completely remove them (if at all), which means that all your doing is leaving the actual blockage deeper into the skin.    You are much better off with a pore strip, which actually works.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm, I am wondering why there are such great reviews since this product doesn&#x27;t actually work for me.</li>
    <li> I was hoping the two ends were different sizes but they&#x27;re actually the same.  Very solid and works well with some technique, I just wish it had a big and small end for different sized problems. Comes in an excessively nice carrying case.</li>
    <li> Wow, this isn&#x27;t even small enough to use on blackheads. It&#x27;s way too big. What a total waste of money. Trust me people, I don&#x27;t review purchases at all but this time I bought something and it really suched that hard. Don&#x27;t buy this people because it doesn&#x27;t work. Most helpful review here. The most useless are the positive reviews because they&#x27;re totally bull$%@ng you.</li>
    <li> The seller was prompt in shipping and accurate in description.  I bought this product along with another that has an oval loop vs spoon with hole in the center.  The loop version works much better and easier to use.</li>
    <li> Worthless.  Not worth the time and expense of shipping back.  Made my face worse.  I threw it out after two uses.  :(</li>
    <li> This blackhead remover is by no means perfect, but for the most part it will get blackheads out (especially after a long, hot shower).  I would recommend this to most people, unless you&#x27;re looking for perfection.</li>
    <li> We received it quickly. It has helped my son get rid of some persistent blackheads.</li>
    <li> If you have monster zits, then by all means get this, but if you have the normal to even small blackheads, keep searching. This is WAY to large to get most acne.</li>
    <li> I am really not sure why this product has so many favorable reviews.  I guess those reviews are what made me buy this useless product in the first place.  This product did not get out any blackheads, the only thing it did was leave little circles all over my face.  Please do not buy this piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> I would lay down money that noone in the history of comedome extraction has ever successfully used an extractor like this on themselves, to get rid of even one blackhead. Both cup-shaped heads (think tiny melon-baller) are impossible to line up with anything on your own face - while looking in a mirror - unless you have iguana eyes on inch-long stalks. The blunt cup shape exerts too little pressure on surrounding flesh to force anything out. This probably pleases some lawyer, but it renders the tool useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is designed for someone else to use on you, probably with equally miserable results.</li>
    <li> This product works well and is good quality.  Actually I lost it after having it for a little while and am now buying the exact same one to replace the lost one.</li>
    <li> I bought this extractor after I read a few good reviews about it, but after using it following their instructions, I can honestly say that it doesn&#x27;t do anything to blackheads, at least it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This works for blackheads. Orginally got it for my teenage son but have uswd it for myself.</li>
    <li> Better than most you can find! Like to hole style better than the loop. Gentle, nice case.</li>
    <li> This tool was perfect in removing those nasty deep black heads. At first the pressure hurt when pushing down. Once you get the handle on using the tool it works perfect. As you apply pressure the blackhead pushes itself through the opening of the tool. The all you have to do is take some tissue and wipe it clean and then move on to another blackhead. Perfect tool to use on blackheads.</li>
    <li> Product is of excellent quality! It works great and gets the job done. The service was commendable! I highly recommend this product and vendor. A++++++</li>
    <li> This item is UNREAL! For anyone with large pores, this item gets the job done without any scaring chances other people might get if they try to use their fingers, tweezers, etc. Highly recommend. Very easy to use. Just set it over the pore, push, and it&#x27;s clean!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 15 year old son to help get rid of his blackheads.  The cleansers we were using may have been preventing new blackheads, but they didn&#x27;t help the existing ones.  When the tool arrived, my son tried it out and it works wonders, without as much pain as you would expect.  The curved design really works well.

Usually a good blast of water will clean it, then we rinse it in alcohol to kill bacteria.</li>
    <li> This product is a simple metal rod with a small apature at one end. Better off using your fingers than this thing.</li>
    <li> But my daughters helps me and with help these really do work wash your skin and heat up the area, I use it for my face it do work.  Also use a simple toner afterwards and it will close your skin up. Now these are not going to work if you are not giving it the proper use of time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work like you&#x27;d think</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Great Seller!</li>
    <li> The device has too small openings to get the blackheads unlogged. I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I did what the instructions told me to do, and all I got was a bunch of circles all over my face.  It did not clear one pore or remove one blackhead.  Just left marks that took an hour to go away.</li>
    <li> This actually a pretty good piece of gear for removing blankheads, it could be improved by tilting the head slightly away from the main body of the tool. But in the overall it works well</li>
    <li> Strongly recommend it to everyone who has blackheads. Doesn&#x27;t scratch the skin. It is a professional item which most of estheticians use. You will love it!</li>
    <li> i really don&#x27;t know how to use it! it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions, which i was expecting it to. been experimenting with it and it&#x27;s just somewhat effective. maybe because i&#x27;m doing it wrong, i wouldn&#x27;t know cause THERE&#x27;S NO INSTRUCTIONS!</li>
    <li> The description for this item is accurate. The quality is good. Sturdy stainless steel. Good price. However, it will not save you from having to squeeze most blackheads and comedones. At most its good to loosen them up before having to rely on your fingers.</li>
    <li> We all have issues and sometimes it helps to have the right tools to manage them. This tool definitely does the job. it&#x27;s delicate and painless and helps keep you looking good.</li>
    <li> Item as promised, promptly shipped. Recommend most highly!</li>
    <li> I like it but still not sure why I choose this one as there are so many similar items for a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> This product great &amp; is easy to use. Cant beat the price. The shipping was fast. Made from great quality material. Use it often, beats using fingers &amp; leaving marks. Black heads come out with ease!</li>
