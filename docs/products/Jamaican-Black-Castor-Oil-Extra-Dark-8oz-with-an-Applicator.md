<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchase this from Ebay a couple of months ago I don&#x27;t think it was the real thing.. This is so much better, the oil is darker.</li>
    <li> used for a month with no results...</li>
    <li> Phenomenal for natural hair grow.  I mist my natural hair with a water bottle and pour some in the palm of my hand and work in yo deal.moisture or use the dropper for scalp applications and everyone mentions how thick and healthy and long my hair looks... I think I like this one better than regular JCO&lt;br /&gt;.this is extra dark.. (better ash)</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this and it came less then a week. Packaging was good and no problems. If your thinking about getting it I say go for it! It&#x27;s really thick so if you&#x27;re buying it to grow your hair make sure you mix it with another oil like olive oil or almond oil.....  Update: Ordered another bottle Thursday and got it the following Saturday. Super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. It is almost like honey, very thick. Moisturizes my hair very well. I will recommend but not sure if it helps with hair growth yet. Need more time with it.</li>
    <li> It is a heavy and thick oil.  But OMG my hair feels great!  Had to wash it twice and then conditioned with regular conditioner. Well worth the purchase folks.</li>
    <li> It is a good item ..shipping was quick ..the only thing is it is greasy a little bit ..but I think it is a good item</li>
    <li> I use this on my face, mixed with water and rosehip seed oil.  My skin is looking a lot healthier.</li>
    <li> jbco has saved my hair. .it&#x27;s thicker stronger and shinier.. love it</li>
    <li> Really Helped my hair. I know some buyers said that they did not like the smell however the smell did not bother me. I have used it for about 3 weeks and I do notice a difference. A few months ago my hair really broke from  crown area from me using a popular product. Before I bought this product for about a month I really worked on my hair to help the bald spot to grow back. I got pretty good growth before this product just using Aphogee to stop the breakage, Aphogee Curlific deep conditioner,Aphogee Curlific leave in conditioner, and oil(coconut,olive oil,  and now castor oil)  Also not combing hair everyday just twist and tuck for protective style with my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was oiling with the Castor Oil everyday but now every two days. I also learnt that my hair needs to be oil regularly. At first it did cause my scalp to itch just a little and I mean a little however now it does not full strength.&lt;br /&gt;*I will post pictures in a month and show you the before and the after...you will be amazed...I will post June 17th..that will be three months since hair broke and shed....left March 17th and right June 11</li>
    <li> It is for a 2oz tube but otherwise great. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Works well for moisturizing my hair. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see hair growth though.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does exactly what I need it too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and really like it thus far. I use it as a sealant and it leaves my hair soft and shiny while helping to control frizz. I don&#x27;t mix any lighter oils with it but it never leaves my hair feeling greasy like regular castor oil does.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and applicator really helps.</li>
    <li> my hair has become thicker thanks to this product</li>
    <li> This product is so good, dandruff on my son&#x27;s scalp gone with just one week of use. He maintains it once a week to keep dandruff away. It also makes my hair so soft, it relaxes my curly hair, i mix this with my conditioner and keep it on my hair for 3 minutes and makes my hair more straight and so shiny. I had some allergy before with a product and made my scalp itchy and sometimes wounded but when i used this castor oil, the itch and wound completely disappeared !!! Wonderful product. It is also good for my heels, no more cracks. For my skin, less wrinkles, definitely lots of moisture and hydration. I will buy this again and again. I hope amazon continues to carry this product.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, well packed, good quality oil. I use castor oil for my fine thin hair and I had good result. the oil is thick and I use it as a carrier oil to dilute my essential oil</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have some thinning and some balding on my sides and i&#x27;m starting to see some results.  I will continue to use this product and hopefully i will acheive the results i&#x27;m going for,</li>
    <li> It Stinks!!!!!  Also it makes my scalp itch like CRAZY and lots of shedding.  I read on line that Dark Castor Oil will create lots of shedding and itching due to the ash (because the castor beans are roasted gives the appearance and resulting ash is included in the oil which creates the smell and supposed healing properties).  No thanks.  I will stick with the pure castor oil, as I never had any problems with the pure.</li>
    <li> Arrived with everything. This is the best castor oil  to buy. I will be buying again.</li>
