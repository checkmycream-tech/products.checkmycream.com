      <li>that you love him every day, and mom too, of course.</li>
      <li>Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it&#x27;s just to many to count.</li>
      <li>This is a very inexpensive aftershave, and it smells great imo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40&#x27;s right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I kind of miss the glass bottles this stuff came in because plastic makes it look cheap.</li>
      <li>I was looking up which brands of cologne attract the most girls, and I found Aqua Velva.  </li>
      <li>The musk smells ok, but i dont know what that one used to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
      <li>I LOVE the aroma from this product.</li>
      <li>My wife and daughters love this scent.  </li>
      <li>I have not found a better product in all these years.  </li>

      <li>I surprised how good it is!</li>
      <li>Very true though falls from your shelf,medicine cabinet,or vanity</li>
      <li>but it is a great basic, classic scent that many women find attractive (maybe bc</li>
      <li>so I can have a smooth and healthy face after shaving every time.</li>
      <li>Good price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, good item...</li>

      <li>its just plain AWESOME!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just plain perfect.</li>
      <li>I prefer a liquid aftershave, rather than a lotion (it seems to absorb quicker), and Aqua Velva Classic Ice Blue is one of those legendary fragrances.</li>
      <li>My pharmacy and super market only carry the 3.5 oz bottles, so I was happy to locate the 7 oz size on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Its nothing like the original from years ago.</li>
      <li>but, they changed the original scent.</li>
      <li>Clean yes,masculine?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was looking up which brands of cologne attract the most girls, and I found Aqua Velva.  Two weeks ago, it arrived in the mail.  Now I&#x27;m moving to a country which allows you to marry up to 20 women.  It must have been the pretty blue color.</li>
    <li> This blue, cooling, Aqua Velva is, naturally, as good as I&#x27;ve bought in a store, and I bought four bottles of it so it should last a long time!</li>
    <li> During my 3 month stint on Parris Island as a USMC recruit I used gallons of Aqua Velva, none of it ever touched my face. This wonderful \\&quot;aftershave\\&quot; was used exclusively to add fragrance to our mop water so when we cleaned the floors of our squad bay it smelled slightly less bad than body odor. I would recommend this wonderful product to anyone looking to add a little spice to their cleaning routine.</li>
    <li> I waited until I used this product for 32 years before I would leave a comment. Well the 32 years of testing this product on my face everyday [ 11,680 days, but who&#x27;s counting ]..this product should only be used by men who shave and would rather not have a nice red rash on there face. This product cools the face, and about the smell being loved by women...well I have 4 children...enough said...just buy it...the end</li>
    <li> Although this is one of the cheapest aftershaves out there, it is the best. If you put this same product into a high-end, 100 dollar bottle, it would still sell. It&#x27;s got a perfect balance between the  leathery musk scent and barbershop astringent (alcohol) scents. If there is a classic \\&quot;masculine scent\\&quot; then this is it, and there isn&#x27;t a woman out doesn&#x27;t enjoy this smell. But more importantly, it feels damn good after a shave. Teens shouldn&#x27;t look down on this product because it has been around forever and their fathers used it. And snobs need to ignore the price. This is a classic scent that should never fall out of style.</li>
    <li> This stuff will never go out of style.  Cool astringent qualities on applcation . . . then a lingering very fresh, very masculine scent(and not at all overwhelming or offensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working against this product are the same things that work for it:  It has been around forever and it is cheap.  Therefore snobs won&#x27;t touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite after shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way -- my present supply is in a plastic container labeled, &amp;#34;New Shatterproof Bottle!&amp;#34;.  #1. I really don&#x27;t think the marketers care if it&#x27;s shatterproof or not.  They want to improve profit margin.  The plastic is ok, but if there was a choice . . . I&#x27;d take glass.  #2  Whoever designed and then signed off on this horrid bottle should be fired. I suspect in the interest of getting the consumer to use more, the hole in the top of the bottle is too big.  It seems impossible to dispense this into your hand without some of the product running down the side of the bottle and leaving a blue stain on your sink (or tabletop) when you set it down.</li>
    <li> I love Aqua Velva and have used it over 20 years but I tell you the truth I hate your new 7 oz bottle of plastic or whatever it is, give me the glass one back.  The new plastic spills more than you can use and there is no way you can control how much comes out and what you can capture in the palm of your hand.  I really do hate the new bottle, can&#x27;t you give us a choice of bottles in 7 oz size.</li>
    <li> I decided, on a whim, to buy a bottle of Aqua Velva since my Dad used to wear it. As soon as I opened the bottle I remembered the couch we used to have in the living room and his spot next to the lamp where he used to read the paper in the mornings before I got up. That arm rest would smell like classic aftershave (Aqua Velva, Skin Bracer, Old Spice, or English Leather) for hours after he left the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my two year old son comes downstairs in the morning to find me reading on our couch (next to the lamp, of course) I have the bottle ready for him because he loves to smell it. I wonder if I can teach him to call it \\&quot;Smellygood\\&quot; like I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the things that make life worthwhile. Don&#x27;t feel guilty for \\&quot;not spending enough money\\&quot; on something trendy.</li>
    <li> The old standard, been using it for years. My wife like the fragrance better then more expensive after shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it&#x27;s in a plastic bottle now.  But what I did, I have an old Aqua Velva glass bottle and as it empties out, I fill it from the plastic bottle. So I have the glass bottle on my counter in the bathroom</li>
    <li> what a great value: memories, great classic smell, manly. The transaction was fast, smooth and without issue. This and Clubman are required for a legitimate portfolio of scents</li>
    <li> HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it&#x27;s just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I&#x27;m sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40&#x27;s right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There slogan was \\&quot; There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN \\&quot; and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It&#x27;s just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.</li>
    <li> I have used dozens of men&#x27;s fragrances over the decades (I&#x27;m nearing 50) ranging in price from a few bucks to tens of bucks and there is something in Aqua Velva (I think it&#x27;s the oakmoss?)that really blends well with my body chemistry. I even used it while working out (HARD) and while I don&#x27;t necessarily recommend it, it definitely worked for me. I also have a male relative who wears it and when he does, I give him two thumbs up which is our little personal communication that I know what he is wearing and I like it. Fellas, give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I was feeling nostalgic and bought a bottle of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a retro kind of guy and shave with a double-edge&lt;br /&gt;razor. It&#x27;s only natural that I&#x27;d want to follow my shave&lt;br /&gt;with Aqua Velva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product better than bay rum (I just bought a&lt;br /&gt;gallon). I like the fragrance, which goes on strong -&lt;br /&gt;but dissipates into a low-key scent that&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;It cools and refreshes my face after shaving and leaves&lt;br /&gt;me with a tingly feeling that&#x27;s welcome in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father used this stuff in the sixties, and it&#x27;s funny&lt;br /&gt;how scents take me back in time. The scent reminds&lt;br /&gt;me of my Dad, and how dearly I miss him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;retro kind of guy&amp;#34; because of the happy associations&lt;br /&gt;with things made and used decades ago. Don&#x27;t get me started&lt;br /&gt;on cars from the sixties and early seventies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, new things have no soul. I&#x27;m glad that Combe/Williams&lt;br /&gt;Company continues to produce this after shave. Now bring back&lt;br /&gt;the glass bottle and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell your dad that you love him every day, and mom too, of course.</li>
    <li> I love this product smells great works great gives a great cool after shave feeling one thing I do have to say is that it is strong and it will overpower whatever cologne you put on so I wish it came in a lighter scent but the same scent . But other than that it works great been buying it for years .</li>
    <li> When I was younger I used two after shaves: mennen skin bracer and the original aqua velva scent. I bought a bottle of this recently. I was disappointed slightly. It still worked but, they changed the original scent. The original scent was crisp, clean and distinctive. I wish they would have left the original scent alone. It was fine as it was.</li>
    <li> Much different than the way it used to smell years ago.  Too overpowering!</li>
    <li> great after shave for electric razor not some soothing balm but will kill bacteria left behind</li>
    <li> I prefer a liquid aftershave, rather than a lotion (it seems to absorb quicker), and Aqua Velva Classic Ice Blue is one of those legendary fragrances. They have been making it for almost 100 years. and it has that timeless masculine smell that still appeals to men. I find Aqua Velva gives a refreshing scent, and it also helps to sooth and tone the skin, and make it more firm. Also, the price is great for a quality product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Perfect doesn&#x27;t get any better Thank You</li>
    <li> I just recently started wearing this. My wife hates the scent, but I like it and think it smells really nice and manly. The only problem I have with it is the \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; it does, and that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s winter right now. I will definitely be using it throughout the summer however</li>
    <li> Classic! Smells great and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Have been using Aqua Velva for nearly 45 years, but for the last few years have been unable to buy anything other than 3.5 Oz. in the local stores and drug stores.  Also the cost for 3.5 Oz. locally is nearly 80% of Amazon&#x27;s cost for 7 Oz.  I ordered two bottles of the 7 Oz. size and I am set for a while.  My wife and daughters love this scent.  If you are also a fan, order at least two bottles.  Great value and you won&#x27;t run out easily.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good item... Really the only aftershave I&#x27;ll ever use, it&#x27;s a classic.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and smell great. Very refreshing on the skin. I like it alot.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for fathers day (along with a few other things) and he loved it! The after shave has a pleasant smell &amp; it isn&#x27;t glass! Which is a relief because I have 4 kids who like to play around with things.</li>
    <li> The title pretty much says it all. This is the best performing aftershave I&#x27;ve tried, despite being among the very cheapest - even when bought in a brick and mortar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I can only give it four stars because of it&#x27;s aroma. It smells artificial and heavy handed, not necessarily UNpleasant, just not very good. As such, I use this when my skin needs a little extra love after a sub-par shave, or when I just want to treat my skin a little nicer than normal. When I have had a good shave, though, I prefer Tabac, Clubman, Proraso, or Eton College. Luckily, the aroma isn&#x27;t especially long lasting, so that downside isn&#x27;t really a very big deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this to smell nice after I shave.  When I put it on I smelled awful.  I am 19 and I smelled like a grandmother with too much perfume.</li>
    <li> I was worried about this being a glass bottle and it getting damaged in shipping, but it was plastic.  This stuff smells great and my wife loves it.  I use it after every shave.  It does sting a little, but it leaves my face feeling great!</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive aftershave, and it smells great imo. The only problem for me is the menthol. Alcohol based aftershave does not bother me at all, but the menthol does. Not only does it sting excessively when I first apply the aftershave, it leave my skin slightly irritated for hours afterwards. This is an issue for me even when I apply the Aqua Velva to areas I haven&#x27;t actually shaved (like say the back of my neck). Due to its low price and very pleasant scent WOULD actually recommend this to anyone who likes an aftershave that contains menthol or who is curious to try one. But for me, that particular ingredient turned out to be a complete deal breaker. After maybe the 3rd or 4th time I used this, I actually poured the rest out. Now I know to avoid any aftershave with menthol. I won&#x27;t be buying Menen at the grocery store Proraso online any time soon either.</li>
    <li> Smells like Aqua Velva.  I wish they would produce the old Aqua Velva Sandalwood scent.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it so I love it. Reasonably priced, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> First off,  my grandfather used Aqua velva... when i was little id always sneak some of this stuff..its that good!  Now, as an adult  i keep the tradition going...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fror WWII to now...theres a reason when this stuff has lasted...its just plain AWESOME!!  thats way...most of those dorky hipster millienal or whatever they call themselves would probably push this stuff away because its been around for years..thats ok  more for  us...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a close shave (baby faced here)  i put this stuff on..that &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; tells you thats its working...and that cool, crisp, powerful scent takes over...my girlfriend has always commented on great i smell too:)  this stuff does tone to a point and leaves you even smoother...whats there not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sure, when compared to some higher end after shaves some snobs might look down on aqua velva...but for the price and  the quality..its a Winner!.. ive saved a glass bottle and keep refilling mine..you can still get them you just have to look..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you use cologne after using this ...depending on what it is..youll get a great scent..ive used Drakkar (lightly) and well lets  just say my honey and i will stay in:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line ..Aqua velva is worth checking out...</li>
    <li> Best after shave and I&#x27;ve tried Club Pinaud and Old Spice as well as some newer stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its great smelling and feeling all day. Very smoth and contains alcohol, but does not feel like its drying out my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst product design of any consumer product, ever. No idea how this design ever passed quality control, but I literally lose 3-to-1 what I try to get on my face....for some odd reason when I try to dab it out on my hand, there is a big hole and it gushes out all over the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product, but cringe every morning when I lean over my sink and it runs all over my hand and the bottle, so I have to wash both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE re-design it!</li>
    <li> Like the oder and the feel when I put it on my face.  I have tried other brands but the reviews from people I know they prefer the oder of this brand. Not hard on the face when dry.  Does not leave dry skin.</li>
    <li> needed to have it so I can have a smooth and healthy face after shaving every time. highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> In my opinion you cannot ask for a better after shave. Excellent smell and the cooling effect on the skin, outstanding. I&#x27;m old school and this stuff has been around for over a half century [like me].&lt;br /&gt;Nothing better around</li>
    <li> I only use this aftershave in the summer because it tends to dry my skin in the brutal Chicago winter. It works great after a nice straight razor shave; smells great and cools my skin. It&#x27;s alcohol-based, but I&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t sting as much as I expected. Since the dispensing hole is a bit too big, I cover half of it with my thumb before squirting it into my hand. One day, a female acquaintance hugged me and commented I smelled really good. Two weeks later she asked me out ;)</li>
    <li> Since 1970 I had been using this After-Shave and lately have been a little difficult to find it in the stores, so Thanks to Amazon, that made it possible to continue using it...! I LOVE the aroma from this product.</li>
    <li> This product is an icon!  I am 70. When I first started shaving around 1960, it is what my dad used. I have not found a better product in all these years.  A clean,  fresh,  manly fragrance that is not overwhelming and I still get lots of compliments from the ladies like,  &amp;#34;that&#x27;s nice, what are you wearing&amp;#34;.  A man doesn&#x27;t need a $50 bottle of a fancy product!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing for the price, but a little too alcoholic.</li>
    <li> Off and on again I desire to buy a bottle of Aqua Velva&#x27;s Ice Blue.It&#x27;s cheap,it works,and smells nice.I personally wouldn&#x27;t hype the &#x27;cooling sensation&#x27; on your face because it uses menthol...so does Skin Bracer.I kind of miss the glass bottles this stuff came in because plastic makes it look cheap.Very true though falls from your shelf,medicine cabinet,or vanity better chance of survival(thumbs up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent Quality:&lt;br /&gt;Well some people label the Ice Blue aftershave scent as very masculine,really clean,or arctic/winter scented.Clean yes,masculine? a little(maybe a little musk in there).In my opinion this Aqua Velva has always had a springtime/linens hanging in the warm sunshine character to it.Where it begins to lose a star is this lemon note comes in (which is nice).But in combination with the overall scent it reminds you of carpet deodorizer (sprinkle and vacuum).Not unpleasant as it&#x27;s a fresh scent but once you pin down the scent it&#x27;s hard to overlook what Ice Blue reminds you of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;As an everyday aftershave aside from the cleaning aisle familiarity I really like Aqua Velva.Can&#x27;t wear it at work for two reasons.The first the mint/powder scent of Skin Bracer is a very masculine scent-you work a job of labor your scent tells your vibe as a man.Secondly,wearing Ice Blue just makes you want to escape the chaos of the work environment.Sitting on your back deck with a cigarette and drinking a cold one and watching the sunset.Not a care in the world just the gentle summer breeze and the sweet scent of linens hanging on the clothesline.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, is because more is not an option. I&#x27;m 26 now and have been using this aftershave snide I was about 14. I&#x27;ve used others and was pleased with others, but I keep coming back to Aqua Velva Ice Blue. It&#x27;s just plain perfect. The it feels amazing and smells even better and even when it settles it still has the same scent only softer. You will see reviews that it doesn&#x27;t last all day. Those may be true for those individuals, but It does last on me. That completely depends on your body chemistry. I&#x27;ve been married for a few years now, and everytime I try a new aftershave my wife says it&#x27;s nice, but not Aqua Velva. This is her favorite as well as mine. You know what they say happy wife happy life.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aqua Velva for years and love it. My pharmacy and super market only carry the 3.5 oz bottles, so I was happy to locate the 7 oz size on Amazon. They delivered the 7 oz bottle in a timely manner, and I am well satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;navydoc</li>
    <li> I thought it was a bargain price, but it actually cost more than if I had bought it locally.</li>
    <li> Reformulated crap!!!  Very watered down and doesnt last more than 20 minutes.  Its nothing like the original from years ago. I still have an original bottle with some in it, and i remember it well, and also have an old bottle to compare to.  Even an old glass bottle smells better than the new bottle i have now.  Very watered down and reformulated crap just like all the classics they ruined.  The musk smells ok, but i dont know what that one used to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;Buy Brut instead.  Although its also reforulated, it will still last over 3 hours or more and smells similar to the old scent.&lt;br /&gt;Even Old Spice has been ruined.</li>
    <li> Who cares about the dated smell, although it isn&#x27;t bad or overwhelming.  It doesn&#x27; t really last that long either.  Its the firming and cooling of the skin that makes this worth the purchase.  My face feels tight for hours when using this after a good old fashioned wet shave.</li>
    <li> Yikes, this stuff is cheap-o.  Smell&#x27;s cheap, looks cheap, IS cheap.  Go with Gillette&#x27;s stuff if you in the $5 range</li>
    <li> It does indeed soothe, cool (I&#x27;m not sure about &amp;#34;tone,&amp;#34; I&#x27;m still pretty flabby) but it is a great basic, classic scent that many women find attractive (maybe bc it reminds them of their father&#x27;s scent).</li>
    <li> The best cooling after shave. I recommend this after shave to all men.</li>
    <li> Aqua Velva Classic Ice Blue has a subtle, pleasant fragrance, yet is most affordable! My friend says that it feels really refreshing on his face, and wakes him up, in the mornings. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i have been using this longer than most of you have been alive. i can&#x27;t say it attracted the ladies. but i liked it.</li>
    <li> It was a present for my brother.  He likes it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been passing this after shave by for a long time thinking it was too \\&quot;old man\\&quot; or whatever. I picked up a bottle on a whim and man was I surprised how good it is! It feels great after shaving with just the right amount of menthol for that cold tingly feeling. The scent is pleasant, not overpowering and it lasts for awhile. Very good product.</li>
    <li> hey,  This After shave Lotion is Great.  Cool, Refreshing and the Girls Like the Fragrance.  I really appreciate the mild feeling the lotion provides my skin.</li>
    <li> I was shocked after using this as a cologne to find out it is aftershave. Once I am able to grow facial hair I will definitely start using it as after shave.</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff for years and years.  Good price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I tried this after-shave as really my first foray in to aftershave, on a recommendation. The smell is amazing and exactly the &#x27;grandpa&#x27; -esque scent I was going for. It is classy without being AXE, and the perfect combination of a great, yet not overpowering smell, with a great refreshing and stinging feel when applied.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, nice plastic bottle.</li>
    <li> the product is magnificent smells awesome and is great on the skin everyone who has used AV knows that but i noticed alot of people dont like the plastic bottle i do hears why. about a year or 2 ago i bought a big bottle of aqua velva i think 7.5 oz glass bottle i kept in in my dresser somehow it cracked and by the time i noticed the stuff was gone it leaked into my draw so i prefer the plastic</li>
    <li> I get this for my dad for Christmas every year. It arrived in a timely manner and the price is fantastic! This is the least I&#x27;ve ever spent on this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Pleased and will purchase again, for that nostalgic effect</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandfather not knowing the actual price they retail for. Which is only $5 when I paid $8+. Other than though it cam in a plastic bottle and is exactly what it looks like. I give it 3 stars because of the price.</li>
    <li> Smooth, manly scent!  Without a doubt the best feeling aftershave, and the best toning/moisturizing aftershave.  The only drawback is the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long...which could be a merit to those professionals working in settings where strong scents are unwanted.</li>
    <li> I like the aftershave. I like the classic aroma. BUT: are you kidding me? Who designed the bottle? It is the worst bottle and cap combination ever. You cannot use this product without spilling some. I am telling you, this container was scientifically developed with one purpose in mind: to spill over your counter. It&#x27;s an ultimate spilling machine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aqua Velva for several years after using English Leather for many years before that. I like the smell and it&#x27;s soothing after a fresh shave.</li>
