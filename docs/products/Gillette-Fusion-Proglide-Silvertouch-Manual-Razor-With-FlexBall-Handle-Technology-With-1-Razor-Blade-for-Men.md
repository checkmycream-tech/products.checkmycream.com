<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excelent product ! Thank you</li>
    <li> very good .GUA HUIZI BI FENGSU SAN GENG GANGJING .HAOPING .ZAN YIGE. FUJIAN REN DE PINGYING SHANGBUQI!XIEXIE !</li>
    <li> OK. Gives me razor rash. I don&#x27;t think it is any better that other razor. The glide isn&#x27;t anything great. I would rather use one that doesn&#x27;t swivel.</li>
    <li> We love this shaver. Thank you. My husband is the one using it and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I used to use bit cheaper one before and ended up cutting myself couple of times. This one is very smooth and the blade seems to last forever unless you decide to swap the blade!</li>
    <li> Swivel head is clearly a marketing ploy. I can&#x27;t tell it does anything beneficial at all during use.</li>
    <li> I have always used Gillette razors. They always come out with a new version every couple of years. I try to resist buying the newest version, but the fact is every new model is better than the last.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time yesterday and it gives a great shave as my regular Proglide shaver. This one may have a slight edge but felt the purchase was worth it since the blade and shaver were under $4 and the blades are generally around $3 by themselves.</li>
    <li> great product as expected</li>
    <li> Great Idea, work outstanding</li>
    <li> Nice razor, just wish blades did not cost so much.</li>
    <li> I disagree with how expensive the replacement blades are, but this provides the best shave I&#x27;ve had is a while.</li>
    <li> Worked as described. No problems. Cuts my facial hairs.</li>
    <li> Fabulous shave,  very close shave.</li>
    <li> Delighted with my purchase.  The Gillette razor arrived as described by the Seller and it arrived ahead of schedule.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I recently got to sample the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology from Gillette. I found this razor to be well above average. After using it to shave my face multiple times, the blade has remained sharp, and I have not seemed to miss any spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this to my typical razor, I feel like this one contours to my face the best. I also like the thin, single blade on the top of the razor for fine trimming. But, I do miss the vibration feature that my normal razor has. And, for this reason I&#x27;d give this razor 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a special offer from Gillette.  The razor itself is great.  I got a close shave without nicks, cuts, or irritation.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the ball concept.  I feel like I have less control of the razor, which made me a little nervous about the area near my jaw and neck.  I definitely recommend the blades, but I would use a different handle.</li>
    <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used. Fits well, stays put. The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale. By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz. I measured a Gillette disposable at 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it. I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced. I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor. Again--felt very solid and well constructed. The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #1,&amp;#34; I did not shave for several days, so that I had a 3-day beard. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard. I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel. I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften. This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck. I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory. As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave. Thus, both the Field Tests confirm the capability of this product. It works as advertised. When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel. With 5 blades closely spaced together, this is not a trivial feat. After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color. The Flexball pivots in 2 different ways. As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction. There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far. You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting. This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever. There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place. This fastener appears to be very solid; I doubt anything will come lose. The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering. It appears to operate flawlessly. All of this is to allow the razor to match the contours of your face. That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.) To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. The razor feels very solid. One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris LawsonY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors.

    <li> Recently I received  a free sample to try The Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball  manual men&#x27;s razor and I am impressed!  It really is the best shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time. I  had let my facial hair grow out so when the weather warmed up and it was time to mow my beard, trim and edge my mustache I was going to have to have a good quality, durable razor to get the job done without a painful frustrating experience.  This razor provided that and  more. I  liked the Flexball because it just glided nicely with the contours of my face and neck. The handle was easy to grip and hold with no slipping. And on the back of the razor it has a really nice little trimmer. It edged my mustache perfectly. I had a nice smooth shave with no bumps or burns. The razor blades handled a lot of hair with absolutely no clogging.  I highly recommend this razor. The only problem I have with it was the blades had to be changed right away.</li>
    <li> This razor works really well...always been a Gilette fan and needed a new stick. The on,y thing I&#x27;d change is to buy the power version which seems to help with my sensitive skin. I got this with a coupon and you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work really well.  Clean shave without cutting myself.  Blade lasting well.  (We&#x27;ll see hos costly new blades are though; it is a Gillette.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer here said &amp;#34;Think of this as a Mercedes that just got new handling capabilities.&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d go quite that far, but this had a nice feel.  I&#x27;m a guy who tends to shave the hair on my cheeks with an electric razor, and the stuff on my neck I use a blade, because most electrics tend not to do that well of a job with my neck hair, so enter a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seems to have a more flexible feel than most - many blades I&#x27;ve used have felt like a &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;, they&#x27;re not that flexible and I end up having to contort my hand.  This feels a bit better in that regard.  Truth be told I&#x27;d rather just use an electric for the whole thing, but my whiskers don&#x27;t seem to allow that, so I need a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked this one.  Hopefully it holds up, as I like the &amp;#34;not as rigid&amp;#34; feel.</li>
    <li> I received GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR from Gillette to try for free in the mail yesterday. At first I didn&#x27;t really want to try a new razor since I already like the razor I&#x27;m using right now. My first shave is very smooth, neat and clean. I shave in a hurry almost everyday so a razor that doesn&#x27;t cut or snitch will be my favorite. No irritation after shave too. Plus it&#x27;s easy to handle and grip even when my hands are wet. I am very impressed. Much better than expected for a hand held razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mach III blades for years.  I will only be using Fusion Blades from now on.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball is an extraordinarily smooth razor.  This is the smoothest razor I have ever used, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head rotates perfectly and smoothly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a bit on the heavy size, but that is actually a benefit as it seems to impart a little more control.  It makes it only a little less desirable as a travel razor if you are trying to save weight.  I imagine that Gillete will make lighter, disposable versions using the Fusion blade which can serve that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend without reservation.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Buzz Agent to review. I enjoyed the closeness of the shave I was able to get with this razor. The flex ball allows me to get a better shave around my neck because it flexes to the curves. I would buy this razor again, and will continue to use it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it are the cost of the replacement blades.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have tried, this razor provides a very clean shave it reduces the risk of getting cuts since the flexball adjusted to the contour of your face. I have also used it in my genital area and I have had the best experience that I had so far. Other razors would get me cuts all over my nuts but this razor has the thinnest blades that provide a safe shave. The only negative I see on this product is the price, the blades are quite expensive but at the end of the day of you are looking for a professional look it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> This razor has it all. I like the five blade system for a close shave. The pivoting ball head makes is a plus for shaving all those curves and angles without nicking yourself. The weight of the razor is nice. This is not a lightweight razor which is a plus for me. I seem to get more nicks with the lightweight razors. The only drawback to this razor is the cost for the replacement blades. In the end though, it might be well worth the added cost as this razor delivers a smooth, close shave.</li>
    <li> The Fusion continues to be my razor of choice.  The blades are sharp and don&#x27;t cause any nicks until they&#x27;ve endured significant use, and I like the inclusion of the single blade on the top edge in order to trim under my nose and at the edges of my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the other only thing I can say about this particular model is that the tray in which the razor rests in between uses is smaller than most of the others that have come with Fusion razors I&#x27;ve purchased, and I like that it takes up a little bit less space on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I received to test  it by Buzz agent. I was very satisfied with the results. Left skin smooth, easy to use no break out.</li>
    <li> A razor is a razor is a razor, right? Well not quite! After receiving a sample of the New GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE RAZOR WITH FLEXBALL HANDLE TECHNOLOGY I was more than excited to see the latest and greatest offered by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This newest product offering is certainly a cut above (pun intended!).  With the flexball handle, the razor edge is designed to pivot around the contours of your face and maintain a much closer contact for an overall much cleaner shave.  I liked that I only needed to make one pass over each area of my face and neck and didn&#x27;t have to waste any extra time during this morning ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that&#x27;s tired of having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow right after their shave, I HIGHLY recommend trying this one out! You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. He shaves his head, this razor gives him the smoothest shave yet, no little missed spots whatsoever, no irritations in hard to get to bits. This prompted me to give it a whirl. I by far prefer this to the lady razors out there I&#x27;ve tried. So now...I must buy a second one to replace this one I have taken over...I don&#x27;t think he cares much for having to retrieve it from my bath caddy every time he wants to shave. :D</li>
    <li> Any disposable razor users need to try this. I assumed nicks and cuts came with every razor. I thought a little pulling was supposed to be the norm. I used this razor and it didn&#x27;t cut or pull. It was smooth and close. I&#x27;ll never buy a disposable again.</li>
    <li> I received this razor FREE from Gillette as part of a product test group.&lt;br /&gt;I let my beard grow for months &amp; decided to shave when my new razor arrived. As usual, Fusion did not disappoint. I shaved the right side with my standard Fusion and the left side with the new Flexball handle. Both with new blades installed. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting but I could not tell the difference. Bottom line, the Fusion is a great series of razors. I will continue to buy replacement blades but my advice is to get whatever handle is cheapest. I would not pay extra for power or Flexball. I just can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby to try.  He has traditionally used Gillette Sensor Excel twin blades for the past decade or so, which I have on subscribe and save.  He&#x27;s tried some of the other, more multiple-blade, razors a few times and commented that, though they certainly give him a smoother shave, the price is too much to consider them regularly.  He has a heavy, fast-growing beard and needs to shave daily when he goes to the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s used this a few times now and it&#x27;s still sharp, with life left.  He did like the Flexball handle and the smooth shave but commented that it&#x27;s too bulky to get into the small spaces around his nose.  In seeing other comments, this seems to be a common disadvantage of these larger, multiple blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, at this time, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s been convinced to switch.  He was back to using his two-blade standby when he got ready for work this morning.  If there was only a way to combine the two . . .</li>
    <li> May 23, 2014 by Nevets1231&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product from Gillette for review, and I have to say I&#x27;m indifferent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Gillette for years and just recently moved away in favor of cheaper blades from Harry&#x27;s. I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle and I got a great, smooth shave. As usual, I love the blades and the single trimming blade on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what to think about the whole &amp;#34;FlexBall&amp;#34; thing, however. I can&#x27;t tell a whole lot of difference in the maneuverability of the razor with the addition of the flexball. Most of all the flexball adds a significant amount of weight to the front of the razor. It throws off the balance of the razor and makes the area around the base of the cartridge bulky and weird to grip.  This is something that I would probably get used to but I&#x27;m not sure I would want to.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a special offer from Gillette. The blades themselves are pretty good but overall seems like any other razor. I will not go out of my way to use this razor again.</li>
    <li> Received this razor from Gillette for free in exchange to write a review. The Gillette fusion proglide flexball razor was pretty good. It gave a close shave and moved freely around the contours of my face. It seemed to be good for my sensitive skin and did not irritate my face. Overall I would say this is a pretty great razor. If you are looking for a close shave and have sensitive skin then I would give the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor a try!</li>
    <li> Well I have had my new Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball for about a month now and couldn&#x27;t be happier I have never been so smooth and shaving has never been easier less strokes smoother skin it&#x27;s a win win for customers choose this razor and you will never need another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used A LOT of different types of razors and I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect one.  My facial hair is thick and slightly curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle from the manufacturer in order to test the product.  I&#x27;ve used it twice now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it was the thinner blades or the FlexBall design, but this was definitely one of the closest, most comfortable shaves I have ever received.  The razors glided smoothly for the entire shave and left no irritation or cuts.  The shave was rather effortless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it was really close.  I usually have to go over thick patches a few times, but that wasn&#x27;t necessary with this new Fusion ProGlide.  Maybe that is why it was easier on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one issue with this razor is that the blades are right in the middle of a slightly large head.  As a result, it is hard to do precise trimming, like around sideburns or under the nose.  I found I could not get the blades into the exact places I wanted to put them because the razor head was in the way.  And I didn&#x27;t find the trimmer on the back to be very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the detailing, however, this was the best razor I have ever used.  I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is Wow. I usually have issues finding a razor that will give me a close shave without razor burn. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cause my face to break out.&lt;br /&gt;I got to try a free sample from Gillette and was a bit skeptical. It didn&#x27;t take me long to figure out that I was wrong. I got a great shave and guess what?? No razor burn. Great product Gillette, you&#x27;ve won me over.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Fusion razor for a couple of years now, but thought I&#x27;d see if the Proglide/flexball handle arrangement made much of a difference. I was skeptical, especially adding cost to something I was perfectly happy with. Since I wear a full beard, I don&#x27;t shave my whole face, but I need good control so I don&#x27;t make a mess of it. The Proglide handle is a huge improvement with almost completely effortless control. It almost felt like it knew what to do without any input form me. The blades provide a baby&#x27;s bottom level close shave, so I guess I&#x27;ll just settle in with the new razor. Since I get more than a month from a cartridge and rinse the blades thoroughly, I may get even longer. If you are doing your whole face every morning, this is the state of the shaving art!</li>
    <li> Received a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall from Gillette recently to try. I was skeptical that the FlexBall would actually improve my shaving experience but I was wrong. I soon noticed that those little aggravating areas that required extra attention before no longer existed. I was getting a remarkably close, clean shave with less effort. I told 2 of my buddies who shave their heads and now they are hooked as well. Nice innovation by Gillette.</li>
    <li> The Fusion ProGilder Razor is a pretty good product overall. It gives a nice, smooth shave, getting very close and making the face feel so great. The FlexBall handle also helps a lot, adjusting to my face as I go. It helps to make sure I get all the hair off, no matter what part of my face I&#x27;m shaving. I&#x27;ve never really had a razor that works this well; however, the cost of this razor is a little bit more, but I think it is far worth it. The only reason I took a star off is because it can sometime dig too deep, and it gave me a few cuts. But honestly, that could also be from my clumsy personality. Try it out!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion razors are just better than the rest.  Somehow, they manage to reinvent them every 12-24 months.  I can&#x27;t really say the &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; is any more or less exciting than the previous incarnations of the Fusion razor, but the result is still superb and I highly recommend these for a cut-free, close and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I am a clippers guy for face grooming.  Electric trimmers dont irritate my skin.  I got to try a free sample of this from Buzz agent, and I may be a believer... such a close smooth shave, with no irritation afterwards.  I may be a convert!</li>
    <li> I got this product in the mail from Gillette, and was excited to see if it would be an upgrade over my Gillette battery powered razor.  I wanted to try out the razor&#x27;s performance at shaving those tough hairs at the angle of my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did an ok job of that since the razor swivels nicely at your chin and other angular surfaces on your face.  I have to say that having a battery powered razor more than makes up for not having a flexible razor.  You still have to work manually to get those tough hairs.  Subtle thing, but having a battery powered razor saves you those extra couple of seconds in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like shaving manually, this could be a good option.  I&#x27;ll stick to my battery powered razor though!</li>
    <li> I received this razor set from Gillette to test out, and I am proud to write a review for such a great product. I have used completely disposable razors here and there when I have been desperate, but I always go back to the normal razors because they last so much longer, and work like a dream. In the past I have used Gillette products such as the normal Fusion Proglide, so I had a good feeling from the get go. The handle itself has a nice weight to it, and the grip prevents it from slipping in your hands while shaving. Before testing this, I have used Schick Hydro, razors from the Dollar Shave Club, and previous other Gillette razors. Time and time again, I come back to using Gillette even with the higher cost associated with the product. Using the Schick Hydro, I found it to be a close shave, but compromised in how careful I had to be when I used it. It was so sharp, that I constantly cut myself. The Flexball technology makes this glide against any area of your face. I&#x27;m usually in a hurry in the mornings, so being able to lather up and shave quickly, yet efficiently, is very important to me. I have only nicked myself once or twice after using this blade 4 or 5 times so far. Its hard to end up with cuts on your face, because of the way in which the flex ball allows the blades to glide against just about any surface of your face. It reminds me of the Dyson vacuum cleaner with ball technology, only in a shaving product. The blades on Progide razors last quite a while, as long as you dry them completely after each use. The lotion strip always dries quicker than the blades themselves wearing out, but that seems to be typical with the best manual razors that are competing with these on the market. I think that Gillette really improved the Proglide razor by implementing the Flexball technology, so that the razor can go every which way and help guys out that are limited on time to shave, like myself. I want a quick, painless, close shave. This product goes above and beyond on all of these things, and I would be glad to recommend this product to any of my friends, as well as my father. Investing in good razor blades is important, and the handle proves to be just as important. I can&#x27;t wait to continue to use this product more on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> As always, great products.  Love the feel.</li>
    <li> This is just amazing, I used before a razor with 4 blades and I thought that it couldn&#x27;t get any better, the feeling, the smoothness, the cleanliness is just wonderful, 4 blades are things of the past now, welcome our new 5 razors overlords.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette and have been very pleased with its performance.  The new Flexball allows the razor to hug the contours of my face and provides a nice clean shave.  I have had far less nicks compared to other razors I have used.  I have sensitive skin and have had no irritation from the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch.</li>
    <li> When I first received the Gillette Fusion Proglide with the Flexball I thought it was a great improvement.  Rather than just adding another blade, Gillette actually provided a much needed enhancement to the non-electric razor.  The flexball really did follow the contour of my face, but the problem I had was that it was taking 3 or 4 or even 5 passes to remove my facial hair and this was just 2 days growth.  At first I thought maybe I just received a dull blade, so I replaced it with a new one, also a plus that it takes the same blades as the other Fusion Proglides.  However, the new blade did not reduce the number of passes to shave my beard.  I removed that blade and placed it on my Fusion without the flexball and behold 1 maybe 2 passes and no hair.  The only explanation I could think of is that the flexball reduces the amount of pressure or redistributes it across the entire blade, which one may think that is better for an even cut, but in fact it just wasn&#x27;t cutting as well.  So that is why I gave 3 stars ... it follows the contour of your face, but takes more time and passes to get a clean smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  It glides across my face smoothly and gently that you barely feel it.  I tossed my other blade out which was too rough on my face.  Definitely pleased with this.</li>
    <li> I really dont see a difference between the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch and Schick Extreme 3 disposable razors. There is a point when adding more blades does not mean the razor is that much better. I feel the more razors actually worries me about getting a really bad cut. Not only that, but it also hinders accessibility. I like that the Gillette Fusion has a precision trimmer for those places. Even though Gillette has 5 blades, I feel like the blades were pulling on my hair when I was shaving my chin. I also see many spots where the shave is not very close. Each pull was a little more easier with the Gillette compared to the Shick quatro, but I dont think I want to use the same blade more than twice with the Gillette Fusion since there is some hair caught in the blade that I cannot get out (Only after the first shave). Not only that, the thin blue layer or &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; is also wearing down. I usually use my disposable blades twice too so I think thats a negative for Gillette since it costs much more. I also dont feel I have as much control over the razor since the handle is so far away from the blade. Overall, I would not spend the extra money on this razor. #Gotitforfree #Bzzagent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many razors on a search for one that works on me. Providing both a comfortable shave and good experience I had finally settled with the Mach 3. As most razors don&#x27;t provide the smooth, non irritating shave I desire. I have very sensitive skin so I never really thought about switching to any other. When I was invited to try this razor it made me curious looking at its design and functionality. Upon receiving it in my  BzzKit I was excited to try it. It didn&#x27;t have feeling of the typical  shave, it was very smooth as if it were just gliding over my skin and taking the hair with it. It was an amazing painless shave something i&#x27;m not use to. With little thought on switching I can say I finally have a razor in which i do not have the burning sensation I felt using previous razors. I would highly recommended this to anyone esp those with sensitive skin as I do. Price is no object when it comes to comfort, so price don&#x27;t matter with this product.</li>
    <li> This is great. It is so smooth and just glides on my skin…And the ball helps so much for those tough turns and edges.</li>
    <li> Works great still a big fan of my Gillette with the trimmer attachments but this one gives a smooth shave</li>
    <li> I have used disposals for a long time and never really thought about it but I just received This Gillette fusion proglide for free from Gillette and it&#x27;s AWESOME! The closeness I receive is amazing without nicks and cuts. The flex ball really goes with the shape of my face and glides smooth for a great all over shave. I will definitely be buying these from now on and make sure to tell all the guys about this must have. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> Nice close shave, best razor that I have tried.Smooth and no nicks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of gillette razors, none can compare to this 5 blade razor, first off I recieved this from Gillette in the mail 2 days agao, wasn&#x27;t ready to shave but, before I did, I studied the package front to back to see how it was packaged then how easy it was to open, next I took it out the package and studied the razor for about ten minutes before i even used it, played with the swivel, looked at how it was built, then I rubbed it against my arm and it cleaned the hair off as if it was never their. When i did shave my face I did one side with shaving cream and the other side with nothing at all, because i usually bump up even with shaving cream on, the razor actually contoured my face because of the ball action, i even went sideways and it pivoted to my face, my jaw line and under my my jaw down to my neck. Thanks to to strip on top I got moisturizing. Haven&#x27;t bumped up yet on the plain side or the shaving cream side yet. I think this is a product beyond itself thanks to the 5 blade, contured handle which has some weight to it, not flimsy at all. and the flex ball makes it easier to get in those hard areas. I will be using this for some time now, unless Gillette comes out with a new one.Get this one</li>
    <li> I received this Razor as a free trial from Gillette.  I previously used the Fusion, which is an excellent razor -- my favorite part is the precision trimmer on the reverse side of the cartridge.  This Fusion Proglide with Flexball is noticeably smoother, and the multi-pivot allows me to shave super efficiently without nicking myself up at all.  I&#x27;d buy this if it wasn&#x27;t already a free trial - a small investment for something that is used so often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for twenty years, from the Sensor through the Mach3 to, for the past few years, the Fusion. I&#x27;m very, very familiar with using the Gillette blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Fusion ProGlide manual has the new FlexBall technology, which I thought would be really cool, especially on the neck. The problem is the swivel is slight and abrupt, causing the razor to slide while shaving while caused several nicks and a stinging small slice. And while the neck pivoted when it shouldn&#x27;t, the blade stabilizer doesn&#x27;t give when it should, so the blades are don&#x27;t really flex well to contours at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave Gillette the benefit of the doubt and tried to use this razor two more times, thinking maybe it just took some getting used to. Nope. My next two shaves also resulted in nicking, which I haven&#x27;t had in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the up side, the new blades are noticeably thinner than my regular Fusion and sliced through hair (and skin) like warm butter. The shave was close and clean without pulling up on any of the hairs (which leads to ingrowns). So I&#x27;m hoping these reengineered blades come to my core Fusion soon, because I won&#x27;t keep cutting myself on this wobbly frame.</li>
    <li> Nothing new but a good razor. i would definitely buy this razor again, but I would also buy some others that do the same job. Gillette sent me a razor to try and I do like it. Honestly it would come down to which razor was the better value at the time. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this one though, it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> love this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it truly cleans without effort! and not a whole lot of nicking myself:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend:)</li>
    <li> I received a review unit from the manufacturer, just about when I was out of blades with my other razor, so that was good timing for me to try the Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a frequent shaver, usually once or twice a week at the most. My beard just doesn&#x27;t grow that fast. So I&#x27;ve gotten in about 4 or 5 shaves with the Flexball Proglide. My &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; razor is the regular Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does do the job, it cuts through my beard just as well as the normal Fusion, or any other 5-blade system. I do like 5-bladr razors more than others, as I don&#x27;t seem to nick my face as often, and it&#x27;s better on my skin as long as I go slow. I do get a nice clean shave out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this flex-ball thing, it just feels too gimmicky. It&#x27;s not poorly made, it doesn&#x27;t make the shave worse or anything, it just doesn&#x27;t *add* anything. I don&#x27;t know the retail price difference, if there is one, but I would certainly never pay extra for the Flexball.</li>
    <li> Ok so starting out I thought that the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall would be another gimmick aimed at consumers, why on earth would you even need this? What is the difference between this and all other Fusion razors? They are already a great product having tried numerous other Fusion Razors as a tester before I was a bit apprehensive but thought why not lets see what the big deal is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting out the razor performs much like all other Fusion and Gilette Razors, it works, it works well but I&#x27;ve always felt they cheapen the razors to get you to buy more blades every week. However its a fantastic product none the less. The Pivoting handle makes those hard to reach areas a little easier, now don&#x27;t get me wrong this isn&#x27;t going to solve all those faces you make when shaving but it does help a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle, razor, is typical quality from the folks at Gilette, they really have made a quality product that shows. I just wish the blades lasted longer, that seems to be everyones gripe with them, not to mention the cost of the blades. They seem to have gone down a bit in price and I believe that more and more this seems to be the turning off point for many people. However if you want quality I guess you have to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, I&#x27;d recommended it to a friend, a co-worker, or anyone else. When something works it just is that easy.</li>
    <li> The best razor I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> i loved this razor! it glides so smoothly and it left my face feeling amazing after shave. i love this razor i give it a 10+ i reallly reccomend this to everyone. i received this product through BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I love the Product that I got from the brand.  I love the way it works on my face.  I also love the Flex ball that the razor comes on.</li>
    <li> got a really nice clean shave with this razor, with alot less strokes and irritation. i&#x27;ve been using Dorco blades for a little while because of their (ridiculously cheap) price, but i&#x27;m going to have to reconsider my priorities after trying the Fusion ProGlide with Flexball. Thanks to Gillette for free trial.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I can trim my beard and get close up with the trimmer on the back of the blade and le the 5 blades on front for a close shave that lasts and does not irritate my skin. overall a great design with the swivel side to side and the pivot back and forth. very comfortable thank you</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Technology.  I have been shaving for almost 50 years and the Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall handle is by far the best shave I ever had.  It does glide over your face and with all its blades it gives a nice close shave, as smooth as a billiard ball.  I would recommend this razor for new shavers and old-timers alike.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Proglide with Flexball gave a good, close shave. However, I find that the large shaving head causes extra friction on my face and it is hard to accurately trim around my goatee. I&#x27;ve given this a few tries, but keep going back to my double blade system. It is a good system, but it is just not for me.</li>
    <li> With all the improvements to razors in recent years, I thought &amp;#34;what else can they do?&amp;#34;  Well Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall did it again. The Flexball caters to the curves of your face for a clean close smooth and irritation free shave. I didn&#x27;t even have to use aftershave it worked so well. I am grateful to have used this product and will continue to do so going forward.</li>
    <li> At first I was a little skeptical and thought maybe Gillette was trying to sell more razors by adding a useless feature. But I have to say that after 4 uses I am a believer. Not only does the new flex ball feature work, it works great!! The flex ball feature allows the razor to keep more contact with my skin which results in a smoother shave with less irritation. I am an exclusive razor user and have tried everything on the market, Gillette is my go-to for razors and they have not disappointed. It took me a couple shaves to really notice the flex ball feature and after about the fifth shave with the same cartridge I was really impressed at how much it helped with the irritation and ability to get around all the angles of my face. I will be picking up the power version as soon as it comes out.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. The blades glide across my skin and leave me with a shave that I can go out into the world and be proud of. I love that this device can slide through every hair on my face in even the most uncomfortable and inaccessible areas of my face. The flexball technology allows me to comfortably shave with the knowledge that I will walk away from the mirror with a clean cut. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody who is fed up with razor burn, uncomfortable shaves, irritation, or any other reason they would hate their current razor. Thanks to Bzzagent, I got to try the greatest razor on the market, and now it&#x27;s your turn.</li>
    <li> The flexball handle is a great innovation. I have very sensitive skin and normally break out or have a reaction. The flexball really lets the blade follow the contours of my neck and face. Thank you Gillette for sending me a Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball handle.</li>
    <li> Five blades -- it&#x27;s almost become a joke the way they squeeze more and more blades on these razors, but I have to admit that it works. Though the name is a mouthful, the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch does a pretty amazing job of shaving. Where other blades hit rough spots, such as under the chin or certain parts of the neck, that feel like shaving sandpaper, the Proglide cuts through like butter for a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you are paying more money for such a nice blade. In my experience, however, it&#x27;s worth it. Try a two-blader, then try this five-blader. I can pretty much promise that you&#x27;ll never want to go back.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Heavy handle. Good feel overall. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it moves or pivots when youlook at it on your face but it seems to do a good job. Seems as if youdont have the need to keep going over an area as much. Very close and s,ooth.</li>
    <li> Like most guys, I&#x27;ve used several different razors before.  Some have three blades, four blades or even five.  But none of them have the Flexball technology of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball.  I was skeptical that the Flexball would make any difference in the shave.  But I got this razor from Gillette to try and I can say that it does make a difference that you can feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn&#x27;t change the face of shaving (no pun intended), but it does make for a more comfortable shave, no question.  It moves with the curves of your face, requiring less movement of the wrist on the handle when moving downward on the face.  I like to shave from sideburn to sideburn and the Flexball moved nicely with the shape of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make me want to ditch my electric razor (I alternate between electric and traditional), but if given the choice of a razor, I would choose this one first.  The Flexball is a nice addition to a product that we have all known and used for years.  It&#x27;s enough you make you appreciate its addition to a typical household item.</li>
    <li> My first reaction of the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR was that it&#x27;s probably just an overpriced razor that looks really, really cool (However I got this from Gillette to try for free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave every day and I have a thick, manly-grizzly bear beard. After using this razor for 7 WEEKS, MY FACE FELL IN LOVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY FAVORITE POINTS:&lt;br /&gt;1. I no longer have to take multiple swipes to get a close shave&lt;br /&gt;2. This one blade is going on 2 months and it still shaves better than my old razors&lt;br /&gt;3. 7 weeks and I have not cut myself once? It&#x27;s me or the razor and I&#x27;m pretty sure the new Flexball handle has something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;4. The edging blade is perfect for getting those hairs that go up my nostrils&lt;br /&gt;5. When I grew out my beard to about 4mm it cut through it with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;6. My neck is not braking out any more, which I also attribute to the contour hugging Flexball Handle.&lt;br /&gt;7. It fits very comfortably in my hands&lt;br /&gt;8. It looks as great as it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVE:&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;ve got nothing. Really, I genuinely Love this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  Will this Razor replace everything I have previously used?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% certain that this is the only razor I will continue to use until some crazy 1 second shave technology is invented. I have used Electric shavers, and 2-3-4 blade razors and this is the closest, easiest, most comfortable shave I have had.</li>
    <li> I received the product from the brand to try not BZZAGENT. While I typically use The plain proglide I have to say this is a nice UPGRADE! I would recommend buying this product and trying it for yourself. It has a nice even shave and even works on my thick hair!</li>
    <li> I received one of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razors from the Gillette company and was initially skeptical about how much better this flexball technology would be versus a standard razor. My first few shaves were just cleaning up my beard, and I really saw no difference in the shave. A few weeks later though, I decided to shave the beard for the summer. That&#x27;s when I felt a difference in the quality of the shave. I was able to finish the jaw and neck area with just one pass instead of having to go back and hit the \\&quot;corners\\&quot; again to catch patches of hair that the usual razor misses. Not only was it faster, but by not having to make multiple passes, I ended up with a lot less razor burn (basically none) for my first full shave in a year!</li>
    <li> Not bad - I still prefer the ease of using an electric razor, but this is one of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve ever tried. it pivots well and goes over the skin easily. I tried it as a part of review panel - gillette sent it to me for free to review. my girl actually started using it to shave her legs - says its better than the venus she usually uses.</li>
    <li> Just got the new Gillette proglide Silvertouch mens razor with flexball technology. Best shave ive ever had and it saved time.No cuts or nicks left my face feeling very smooth.Highly  recomend.</li>
    <li> I used this razor and its the best Gillette ive used yet... the flexball is awesome</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this product so that I may participate in a study group for the new flex ball razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical of this razor before trying it because the most important part of the razors are usually the blades, and not so much them movement of the razor, or at least that is my opinion. But from the commercial that is being shown (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;GsIMz0krxdA), I was one of the men always making the faces when shaving, so I guess this razor was made for someone like me. Also that fact that I am a black male, i have really curly facial hair and most razors usually end up giving me a bad case of razor bumps afterwards because they do not shave my face correctly. It has been a few years since I shaved with a razor since I want back to traditional shaving with depilatory cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - After using this razor three time, I have had no instances of razor bumps, razor burn or discomfort after shaving. The 5 blades work like a charm and do not tug when they are supposed to be cutting like other razors that I have used in the past. I still make the &amp;#34;shaving face&amp;#34; primarily because I am used to doing it, but the razor does a good job of bending and turning when I got to the jaw and neck area of my face. My girlfriend also complimented on my close shave and said I look much more youthful compared to using the depilatory cream so that is a major plus! This razor also gives a really close shave, which to me is the most impressive part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - I only received one blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - This razor may be may gateway back into the shaving game because it works really well. If you have a Gillette Fusion Proglide without the Flexball, there may be no need to upgrade, but for anyone looking for a new razor to try or coming from depilatory creams like myself, this product is definitely worth it. 5 Star Product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch. Here&#x27;s a simple pro/con list to break it down:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* The thick handle made it easy to grip and I felt I had more control over the device.&lt;br /&gt;* The 5 blades gave me a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;* The moisturizing strip moisturized my face and made it feel good man.&lt;br /&gt;* The pivoting action of the razor made it helpful going from the neck to the jaw without having to shave in sections.  I think this would be helpful anywhere else you need to shave that has contours.&lt;br /&gt;* The blades seem to last longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve ever tried (no joke)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The moisturizing strip got very soapy and slippery at first, combine that with the pivoting action of the razor and it slipped around the first few runs and I ended up cutting myself, a very small knick - perhaps me getting a little too into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with the only negative being potential user-error, I can say it deserves 5 stars pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I received this free from Gillette on offer for a review.  This in no way influenced my opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> I got this Gillette fusion free from gillette and I have had the best experience that I had so far. Other razors would get me cuts all over my nuts but this razor has the thinnest blades that provide a safe shave. The only negative I see on this product is the price, the blades are quite expensive but at the end of the day of you are looking for a professional look it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this new razor I was scared of razor bumps or cuts but none of that happens when I used the Gillette razor</li>
    <li> Just received this as a sample from Gillette in the mail the other day.  Figured it would work about the same as other razors I have tried in the past.  I was wrong!  This is definitely a great razor.  One swipe is all that&#x27;s needed for a clean, smooth shave.  I like how the head moves with the contours of your face.  Will definitely continue to use this!  Thanks Gillette!!</li>
    <li> I received GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR from Gillette to try for free in the mail yesterday. At first I didn&#x27;t really want to try a new razor since I already like the razor I&#x27;m using right now. My first shave is very smooth, neat and clean. I shave in a hurry almost everyday so a razor that doesn&#x27;t cut or snitch will be my favorite. No irritation after shave too. Plus it&#x27;s easy to handle and grip even when my hands are wet. I am very impressed. Much better than expected for a hand held razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second review: Durable razor but pricey !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor for almost 4 weeks now. Razor still give a very close shave, no irritation or cut. Very durable. Planning to switch my old razor to Gillette Fusion Proglide razor but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it since the price of Gillette Fusion Proglide razor at Target is 13 dollars. Kind of pricey for a razor but let see how long Gillette Fusion Proglide razor could go. I will let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathan Lutterloh.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor that Gillette sent me. I love the way it glides leaving a clean and close shave. Its also really gentle as I dry shave. Only things I would change is the grip as when it was used in the shower it was a little hard to hold onto once wet.</li>
    <li> I would like to preface this review by saying that I did receive ths product from Gillette but, as you will read, has nothing to do with my bias of the product. I have been a customer of Gillette razors for as long as I&#x27;ve been shaving. I buy their brand usually for two reasons: I am comfortable with the reliability of the brand, and two, I always seem to get what I pay for. That being said, I dont feel that the new \\&quot;technology\\&quot; implemented in this specific product is enough to rebrand the product itself. The particular cartridge that came with my sample did actually feel a bit dull for being brand new. It pulled a bit at my skin for having a new and improved lubracating strip and I didn&#x27;t seem to get the brand new experience that I was expecting. For that reason, I gave it three stars. I will most certainly still purchase Gillette razors in the future, and my outlook on the products they put in stores is still of highest regard. However, the Flexball Handle didn&#x27;t do anything more for me than the cartridges I currently buy. I would most certainly not recommend this product over another product that is similar. The razor just didn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it.</li>
    <li> I would like to thank Gillette for giving me an opportunity to try out yet another great razor in their product line, The pro-glide Silver touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pro-glide silver touch adds for me a better weight to the razor and better feel as its new shape fits better to my hand than the normal pro-glide I was using before. The Silver touch rotating ball technology is nice as it helps contour to my face as I&#x27;m shaving, which helps the ease of picking the razor up and starting a new line every time. The weight of the razor gives the appeal that something is actually in your hand when your shaving, also the new handle just fits and feels 100 times better than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side notes is that is stills uses its great 5 blade razor head from the normal pro-glide which is fine as that works great in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this razor is fundamentally better than the normal pro-glide as it weight and shape as so much nicer than any other razor out there.</li>
    <li> From the very beginning, even though the razor head felt the same as many others I&#x27;ve tried -- a nice smooth conditioning strip, good blades -- it never did a very good job. I nicked myself more with this razor than with any other I&#x27;ve used in years. The shave was not close, and the flexibility of the head to go over curved areas of the skin was not impressive. It really felt like the flexball system made the shaver slip a little to the left or right, very tiny amounts, causing nicks and a lack of precision. The handle wasn&#x27;t particularly ergonomic, either. I would definitely recommend a regular Gillette razor over one with the flexball technology.</li>
    <li> I have always used gillette razors. I got this new razor as a promotion from Gillette. This new razor handle improves an already good experience. It is very comfortable to use and rounds the contours of my face very easily with fewer nicks and bruises. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Received my free trial razor and have found it to be a nice improvement on an already great razor in the Fusion Proglide. The Flexball technology makes the razor a little more forgiving around the areas under my chin &amp; neck where it is easy to lose good contact with the skin. I find I have to go over the same area less times than with other razors. It also feels very comfortable to grip. Overall, a great razor and a good upgrade if you like the Fusion Proglide!</li>
    <li> I just finished using this new razor for the first time and it really was a pleasure.  I was able to shave my beard in long smooth strokes and the pivot at my jaw was phenomenal.  I didn&#x27;t have to go back once to touch up areas!  Probably smoothest, fastest shave I&#x27;ve ever done in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the same since the added the touch up razor at the top.  Styling my goatee is very difficult but I was able to get the line under my chin with it.  Ultimately, I had to switch to my straight to finish up the detailing.  If you don&#x27;t do that kind of detail work, I could easily recommend this as the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Works well around the jawline and cheekbones but not really that beneficial when outlining. I was sent a free tester in the mail and would probably buy another but it&#x27;s great that the regular cartridges fit into it and it&#x27;s not much more expensive than the regular Proglide handle.</li>
    <li> I have a really tough beard, and a really uneven face. This razor is awesome. I received it from Gillette and began using it right away. It is superb to any other razor that I have ever used. I used to have unshaven patches in the crevices and corners of my face, but not with this razor. The flexball makes it so very easy to reach the tough spots. Overall, a great razor.</li>
    <li> Wow! Opened up my new Fusion for my first shave with the new razor and couldn&#x27;t believe what I was feeling. A close shave with no stubble and a smooth face. No razor burn as the razor contours to the shape of your face. Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Thank you Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a sample product from Gillette to try for free.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;ve used this razor for about two weeks now.  It is definitely better than my other razor.  It remains in contact with my skin and I don&#x27;t have to make many of those funny faces to get a clean shave.  Additionally, I haven&#x27;t experienced that drag I had with my other razor.  The blades do cut cleaner and with little effort.  Even after a weekend of no shaving, there&#x27;s no problems with one pass across the chin; it really is a clean shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lubrastrip does seem to be helping with any dryness I used to have with my old razor.  I&#x27;m not sure how much, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as tight when I&#x27;m finished shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this razor.  The contact with your skin alone is enough to make me switch to this new razor.</li>
    <li> Absolutely incredible shave! Its like I have a custom made shave every-time!!! The razor itself is just the best, they are Gillette razors. But the flex ball just makes all the difference. Every curve and every move is just flawless. not to mention the handle is very... classy. pick one up for yourself or your lover, you&#x27;ll be glade you did.</li>
    <li> it gives a very close shave but the floating head takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan or electric razors so I always use manual.  Gillette is my brand of choice.  I recently received the razor as a demonstration product from Gillette and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance.  Not only was the razor comfortable and easy to use, but it cut my shaving time in half.  Usually I have to spend time on the hard to reach places but not with the flexball.  I am really happy that my fusion blades will go to good use.</li>
    <li> Given the chance to experience this thing was a delight. It contoured to every aspect of my face. Its was smooth gliding like a fine luxury vehicle... Worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent I received the product for review from the brand, NOT from BzzAgent.I just tried my GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR WITH FLEXBALL. I have been using Gillette Mach 3 razors for a ever.  This razor has a nice heft and the handle grip is superior to others I&#x27;ve used. I truly did not think that something as simple as a rotating head would make any difference but I have been proven wrong. Usually when I shave with non-electric razors I need to keep the strokes straight and avoid curves around my chin and jawline.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been convinced to switch, still it is a great product!</li>
    <li> I normally use a beard trimmer to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;, hardly ever going clean, since I dispise the rash and effort required using a conventional razor. I received a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology from the Gillette company to try out, and so I did.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: only has 1 blade included and they are expensive to buy more, and this is how they make money.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: clean shave without any rash, the first time used. only requires one pass because the flexball contours to my face easily. smooth and easy to use.</li>
    <li> best razor ive ever used! smooth on skin doesn&#x27;t clog up clean fresh shave everytime! Beats any other razor on the market today! if you haven&#x27;t tried I highly suggest you do! perfect no slip grip to it fits perfectly in your hand and just an over all awesome razor!</li>
    <li> After about 5 times using this blade I feel a slight difference. From my other Gillette blade. Seems to be a lot smother and a little closer shave. I think the rotating ball idea is a little bit of a gimmick I don&#x27;t feel it moving while shaving. But I&#x27;m still impressed</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette, I had a chance to try the new Flexball Handle. To say it simply, I love this razor. Razor burn and irritation has always prevented me from being as clean shaven as much as I would like. And although I initially thought the FlexBall Handle was an unnecessary gimmick, I was wrong. The Flexball allowed the razor to maintain more contact with my face. This allows me to make less passes which means less irritation. If you are like me and have had to skip shaving a day or two to control irritation, this razor may be for you too.</li>
    <li> I requested this as a vine product for my husband.  Honestly, the man generally uses a combination of two electric shavers with some of my razors and has never complained.  He has a beard year round (technically it would be a go-tee?) and likes to trim the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is a man of few words.  Basically, he told me he did like the blades and the flex ball movement.  He felt that it was easier to get closer to his skin for a much smoother shave.  He also did not experience any irritation.  Please keep in mind that because he is using it for more &amp;#34;touch up,&amp;#34; he is happy with it.  He&#x27;s not shaving his entire face...mostly using a down movement on each side.  Some people have mentioned its not easy to use with a gotee...but he&#x27;s been ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my opinion, it seems like an impressive razor.  It&#x27;s light in weight and attractive looking. The product page is amazing and answers pretty much any question you need answered.</li>
    <li> This is best razor ever...5 blades very close shave and the triming blade is a nice added touch...the flexball makes it so easy to shave it moves with my face...I recived this razor from gillette for a promotion and love it.</li>
    <li> Love this Razor! It gave such a close shave without drying out my skin. The only issue is the pricey tag on this razor and it&#x27;s cartridges. by far the best new razor I have tried. Being in the military, I go through a lot of razors...and nick my face a lot lol, but I would definitely recommend the Fusion Pro Glide to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free from Gillette. The razor, at first, was an outstanding razor. However, with further use I think it may just be because it was a brand new, sharp razor compared to what I was using the day before. While I haven&#x27;t any actual complaints about the razor, it is not anything new or fancy in a razor. The \\&quot;pivoting\\&quot; ball moves in such a way that it would never actually have to move that way on a man&#x27;s face (god help you if it did). The pivoting motion is gimmicky and has little to no practical application. I&#x27;ve tried the feature in \\&quot;trouble areas\\&quot; such as the top of my neck, around the edge of my jawline, and between my nose and upper lip, however, it has not made any pivoting moves that I felt gave it any more of an advantage over a regular Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor. Of course the style is what caught my eye. I like how it pivots and swivels and makes for a closer shave.</li>
    <li> This really is a great razor. It is very smooth and really does get a close shave. Has a nice weight to it and it I love its ease of use. I have been using Schick Quattro and I definately prefer this razor of that one. I have received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor from Braun. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I received this product from Gillette to provide a review of the product.  I have been using the original Proglide many years and have thoroughly enjoyed the clean shaves.  The new Proglide with Flexball has a smoother glide than the original and made me look at the blade face several times to see if there were a couple of extra razors.  It cuts through your facial hair with less force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bummer for me is that I find myself repeating strokes under and along my jaw line because the Flexball kicks in on big curves and tends to skip over some hairs.  My skin does not feel like it is being hacked at, however it does mean I have a couple of extra strokes at the same area.  I favor spending more time with a smoother razor than the alternative, but I would like to see the tension adjustable on the Flexball so that the consumer can dial in the right degree of flex for their face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with this product and won&#x27;t go back to the original Proglide.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it especialy with the flexball it seems like I get a closer shave with it</li>
    <li> I received this from Gillette to try and review here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I have used an electric razor for the last several years. Mainly because I&#x27;m cheap and figured I&#x27;d save money over the long haul as well as I felt the electric was quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I loved using this razor. My face hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth in years. It was quick, perhaps quicker than my electric because the Gillette did such a good job of getting every hair with one single stroke. I used to use Gillette products when I shaved with a razor before and I don&#x27;t remember it being this nice. I will be shaving this way, with this razor, for a while until I try something else. Bye Bye electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this opportunity to show my 10 year old son how to shave. I&#x27;m trying to jump the gun on the whole father son puberty discussion thing. I let him give it a go for his first shave ever. His opinion? He thought shaving was weird and didn&#x27;t like the shaving cream on his face. Who cares about a 10 year old&#x27;s opinion anyway?!?!</li>
    <li> Despite some bad reviews online (not at Amazon.com) I was reluctant to try this razor.  Upon receiving the razor I was intrigued by the movement yet still unsure of how it would improve on existing shave technology.  During my shave I was pleasantly surprised not by the Flexball technology but the quality and sharpness of the blades.  Gillette has come a long way in their ability to create blades that stay sharp for more than one shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m unsure if I will purchase more cartridges but for the next few shaves, I&#x27;m happy to use the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a good close shave and is really comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Gillette razors and own the fusion. I received this as a sample and I do notice a much smoother and improved shave. The razer and the 5 blades really cut close and also cut very efficiently. I think I just found my new favorite razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I have on this product is the replacement blades are a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> I recieved a free sample from the manufacturer. I was already a fusion user but the proglide took it to a new level! I had fewer missed spots on the first pass and it was a very comfortable shave. The old fusion blades are also compatible. It is worth having.</li>
    <li> After using the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor, I told myself I&#x27;d never buy a different brand of razor again! In fact, I threw away all my other razors! The ProGlide I received from Gillette allows the razor to conform to the terrain of a mans face by allowing the head of the blades to match my skin flawlessly.  The blades are spaced so hair contact is maximum while leaving minimal hairs behind. My skin was not irritated afterwards and felt smooth the entire day. It gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with a multi bladed razor. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone out there looking to improve the quality of their shave!</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me one of their new fusion Pro-glide w/ flex ball razors and one blade cartridge to try out. I love this razor!  I was using the original fusion razor until now, so I was already familiar with how close  the pro glide blades can shave, and how smooth my face feels when I&#x27;m done. The bonus that the new Flexball feature provides is the ability to flex and roll, keeping the blades in contact with my face as it shaves around the curves and contours on my face. I have gotten accustomed to needing to do a few passes on the sides of my face with other razors before I was able to get all areas shaved evenly, but with this razor, fusion pro glide w/ Flexball, I was pleasantly surprised when I went to make my second pass and realized that it wasn&#x27;t necessary, because the flex ball had kept the blades in contact covering every inch the first time.  Awesome razor!</li>
    <li> I just received this Razor for FREE!!!..it gives the closest shave that I have ever had &amp; I have tried a lot of razors. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with how smooth it glides over your face,,AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor as a sample from Gillette.This is the first razor I can seriously say has never nicked or cut me after several uses. The replicable blades don&#x27;t fall off and it leaves my skin soft. Very close shave with no bumps. Highly recomended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jefrey Mrakovich</li>
    <li> Great Razor! One Of The Best In Years! Love It And Would Recommend To To Everyone In Need Of A Razor. Light Weight And Very Smooth To The Skin Feels Like A Perfect Fit In My Hand.</li>
    <li> Received Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall from Gillette and was I surprised at the results. A nice close comfortable shave. Easily pivots the curves in my face. I am tossing other razors for Gillette ProGlide. Thank You Gillette</li>
    <li> Pro - any of the Gillette Fusion heads will work with it. Con - price of the replacement heads. Got this as a free try it sample from Gillette. It works. Really, folks how many blades do we really need? It shaves close yes, it is a hefty handle yes, is it really worth the price? Personal decision depending on your grooming budget and how often you shave. Amazon DOES have it at a good price as long as you are spending at least$25 on other stuff to get this shipped free.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used so far. Super close and smooth shave.  Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I was able to try this for free from Bzzagent and Gillette for a sample #Gotitfree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was shaving with it, I did not notice too much difference from other razors, pretty much the same feel. It did shave very well I just wish the top trimming razor was a little better as that one did not do much different from the old proglide. But after 2-3 days of no shaving I still look pretty clean! I usually have to shave daily. So I think it may have really done a great job and I am pretty darn happy about that!</li>
    <li> As a long-time satisfied user of the Gillette Fusion razor, I was happy to receive a demo of the new Fusion Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball from Gillette. Overall, I found the upgrade from the original Fusion to the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch to be quite significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary difference between the two razors is the introduction of the Flexball. At first look, I imagined this newfangled feature to be a marketing gimmick with little to no usefulness. It turns out, the shaving experience is much improved along the jawline and chin. The Flexball allows the razor to easily move in the proper direction to maintain contact with my skin, all while eliminating the need to contort my hand in several directions to make the transition from cheek to jawbone to neck. This improvement alone is quite stunning and significantly improves the ease of shaving along the most difficult areas of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other noticeable improvement I appreciated in this razor was the much smoother shaving experience. The blades on the Proglide do glide along my skin much smoother than the blades I was using with my Fusion. While I didn&#x27;t find the shave to be any closer with the Proglide vs. the Fusion, the ease at which the Proglide razor moved across my skin was a very nice improvement in creating a more comfortable shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is very comfortable and while I didn&#x27;t weigh it compared to my old Fusion handle, it seems to be much lighter and this helps make shaving easing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this new Fusion Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball is my new daily shaver.</li>
    <li> Awesome product with a lot of cool new features you just can&#x27;t find on any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a couple more for my parents and they love it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better give it a try!</li>
    <li> This razor should be considered the Rolls Royce of razors!!  I received this from the company for FREE and it was an amazing shaving experience!  Gillette Fusion Proglide was already the best razor on the market and it&#x27;s now even better with the swivel head!  Great razor!  Must buy!  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this razor it is great.  It works great with it&#x27;s five blades and swivel ball cap it gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  In closing I highly recommend this product to anyone who shaves.I almost forgot to mention I got this from the Gillette company and it is the perfect razor.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette fusion proglide with flexball from Gillette and I definitely like the feel of the razor and the shave. However I grow a beard and only shave my neck consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this razor would benefit someone who shaves their entire face more than me. The ball allows you to follow the contours of your face easier than most other razors. I did find the blades to be top of the line and produce a very close shave with little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the razor itself is what you would expect from Gillette and I could definitely see myself using this razor often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the master of shaving, but I am particular in which razors and accessories to use for it. Mind you, I don&#x27;t shave every single day, because well, my facial hair grows extremely slow - that and - I don&#x27;t like facial hair.    That&#x27;s not to say I should use the cheap knock-offs or cheap-in-quality selection - so I got this from Gillette.    I am incredibly impressed by how sharp and the number of razors I&#x27;m getting when going over. When shifting towards the ends of my chin, I noticed how much easier it is to turn my hand, yet still shaving off those under/side hairs. Not to mention when going under the chin / neck area, you don&#x27;t have to position your hand in such an awkward way, worrisome that you might clip yourself.    Yea, yea, I know, tons of you \\&quot;pros\\&quot; out there will gladly be able to tell me that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but it&#x27;s not as-if I\\&quot;m a nurse or a full-time shaver, here, so let&#x27;s not get carried away at how legit my complaints may be!    Overall impressions? Very high. But I have to say, Gilette&#x27;s disposable razors are also good, but if you&#x27;re looking for an extreme shave, this would be the route to go for now.</li>
    <li> I got this razor about a week ago now it is awesome!  Before getting this I was a part of the $1 shave club, but this razor is so much nicer.  It shaves like a warm knife through butter!  After using it for 3 days I purchased one for my father aW well!  also told a couple people from work to try it out.  It flows perfectly when shaving due to the pivoting head!  All in all 1 would strongly recommend this razor.  I received mine from Gillette directly!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a sample from Gillette and have used it 4 times so far.  The trackball technology works very well.  This razor glides over my jawline for a very smooth and painless shave.  It provides as close of a shave as the original Pro Glide, but glides much smoother of the jawline.  The one thing that I would like to see is that Gillette makes this razor as a power battery operated model.    After using this product now for 5 weeks, I have been a bit disappointed in the duration of the blades.  Before 3 weeks was up, the razor was irritating my skin.  After 3 weeks, the shave was no where near as close as it was.  The razor wears a lot quicker than the other ProGlide razors.  It seems that Gillette has compromised the integrety of the razor with the trackball technology.  For the price of the razor, it is very expensive to have to replace every 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using the gillette fusion proglide manual razor.This product is by far the best razor I have ever purchased. The Fusion ProGlide razor with new FlexBall Technology responds to contours.The tilting of the blade allows you to get to spots that usually you cannot get to in one simple motion and the blade is extremely smooth.The FlexBall Technology makes maximum contact with Thinner, finer blades.  This allows for less tug and pull on your skin. The razor virtually cuts every hair. It also has a Precision trimmer on back for accurate edging. It is also great on my sensitive skin. I would definitely purchase this razor again and highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I recently tied the Gillette Fusion Proglide when I picked one up because I was travelling and forgot my electric razor (a Braun, costing over $300).  For years I had been convinced that the electric shavers had caught up with the brades, and were definitely more convenient.  I thought that I was getting a really good shave, until I discovered the Proglide! After returning home, I performed my own test and boy was I shocked.  I shaved with my expensive Braun, and then immediately shaved with the Proglide.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  Five or six hours after shaving with the Proglide my beard feels like it did immediately after shaving with the electric.  That may be hard for you to believe because it was for me.  But trust me, it is real.  To be totally fair, I tried a competitive brand blade razor (that my son uses) and the shave I got was about equal to the electric.  No where near the Gillette.</li>
    <li> I am a man with sensitive skin. If I do not shave in the shower, it&#x27;s a guarantee that the skin on my post-shaven face will resemble that of a 13-year-old-acne-covered face, except mine is lit up with lovely, red razor bumps. This can be detrimental to a 23-year-old man&#x27;s ego as he is struggling to define himself as a young professional in the working world as well as solid dating material for single women (side note to every single woman: I have a diversified portfolio consisting of index funds, common stocks, cash, and real estate investments; I never skip leg day at the gym; and I don&#x27;t have any cavities). Okay so maybe I don&#x27;t have a diversified portfolio (yet), or any money for that matter, but still, I&#x27;m a man of integrity and cannot afford to look like my face is made of pizza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Gillette sent me the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor, my initial thought was: \\&quot;THIS BETTER NOT GIVE ME RAZOR BUMPS!\\&quot; But since I am a man of risk, I decided to test this razor several times in the shower as well as after showering. Below are 5 concise examples about my positive experience with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The FlexBall Handle Technology changed my life - no more must I fear shaving the difficult contours of my face such as my lower chin and neckline. It is technology like this, that saves people from becoming so frustrated with daily life that they are forced to turn to a life of terrorism.&lt;br /&gt;2. In the shower as well as out of the shower, the blades performed well. My skin was left feeling smooth thanks to the \\&quot;Enhanced Lubrastrip,\\&quot; and I had few spots on my face that I had to go back and re-shave compared to my Mach 3 Turbo blade that I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;3. I appreciated the extra sculpting blade on the back of the Proglide Silvertouch Razor - making a total of 6 blades. This blade was perfect for lining up my sideburns, neckline, and cutting smaller hairs below my nose.&lt;br /&gt;4. Silver is a cool color - Thank you Gillette and Tom Brady (I&#x27;m sure he had something to do with this, because he&#x27;s cool).&lt;br /&gt;5. NO RAZOR BUMPS! That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here to spread my joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 5 stars you ask? Simple: the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor has made me a believer. Smooth shave on difficult areas, no cuts, and most importantly, no razor bumps. I can shave with confidence knowing that I will not have to face the fear of having the same skin that I used to have back when I was a greasy, inconsiderate teenager who hated his parents. The technology that Gillette put into this razor gives me confidence that Gillette employees actually show up for work every day. Why can&#x27;t there be more companies like Gillette that make these crucial technological advances in our world? (I&#x27;m looking at you NASA). Thank you Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;My skin</li>
    <li> Gillette is a fantastic brand, I will always trust in their products because they give the smoothest shave I can get without having to go to a barber shop. I&#x27;ve seen the ads for this item, hoping it would be beneficial and decided to buy it and give it a whirl. Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right, but after using it over and over, I did not find any benefit from the flex ball at all. It didn&#x27;t help or respond to any of the contours of my face. It was like using any other regular manual razor from Gillette. The only benefit from this razor were the five blades.</li>
    <li> As a note, I received this product free for review from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I used a Gillette Fusion Power handle. With this new Flexball model, I was really impressed with the effects of the pivot action. The movement allowed me to easily get a much closer shave on my neckline than with my other razor. The keyword here being -&amp;#62; easier &amp;#60;-. The pivot action allows the blade to adjust to the contours of my neckline. I would note though that the pivot is attached to a plastic joint. It hasn&#x27;t happened for me but I am concerned that this may be an easy breaking point for the handle. The rest of the handle is metallic and I would have liked to see the pivoting joint made of metal as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this handle is very lightweight and comfortable to use. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good product, nice clean shave, doesn&#x27;t leave a burn, precise. Moving head is a gimmick though and I wouldn&#x27;t pay over $8.00. I received this razor free from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have always been loyal to Gillette, when I received this free razor I used it right away &amp; could feel the difference between this &amp; my power razor that I normally use. I had no cuts or clumping on the razor, very smooth &amp; easy to shave my face.</li>
    <li> My husband has a rough beard and sensitive skin. This razor works better than his Proglide and the blades he has fit both razors.</li>
    <li> This razor has the thinnest blades that Gillette has to offer to deliver a great shave that does not chafe me skin.  The rollerball glides across my face with ease and follows every contour of my face without missing an area because of the design.  I would recommend this razor to others that want a smooth shave and no cuts.  I received this razor from Gillette for trial purposes.</li>
    <li> This razor and handle is very thick and durable and has a razor that swivels on its base that can respond to the curves of your face for a very smooth shave.  It is infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers that make it easy to pass over an area multiple times while shaving with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried both of this plain razor and also the one with the vibrating button I prefer the one with the on button for the &amp;#34;power on-board battery&amp;#34; that does seem to be a  soothing shaving experience with the &amp;#34;Micropulses&amp;#34; they may be helping to reduce friction and increase razor glide, it does seem like a smoother shave but is hard to quantify. While this one is also a great product if you do not care to have a vibrating razor. The blade itself seems to be very razor sharp and good for multiple shaves depending on how big of a job your beard is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an outstanding razor system taking shaving to a new level, no complaints here, I was very impressed with the great shaving  experience.</li>
    <li> I received this product from Gillette in exchange for my honest, unbiased review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve primarily been a Gillette product user for my entire life for which I needed these types of product. For the past few years I have exclusively used the Gillette Mach 3 razor/blades for my shaving needs. I was excited to try this product to see what else Gillette had to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that overall I was disappointed with this product. The general feel of the razor was very bulky/heavy, and it was just not comfortable in my hand. It felt awkward trying to navigate this razor across my face, especially since the product is supposed to be designed to easily adapt to my facial contours. I was also less than impressed with the amount of tug and pull that I encountered while using this razor. The packaging boasts less tug and pull, but I did not find this to be the case. I had several instances of painful pulling and a few minor cuts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that saved this razor from a one or two star review was that this razor did what all razors should do, shave the face. Despite my negative comments above, this razor provided a close shave that left my face feeling at least as smooth as the Gillette Mach 3 to which I am accustomed. Although I encountered so much tugging and pulling I was pleasantly surprised at the close shave that I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, this razor is just average in my opinion. If your current razor doesn&#x27;t provide you with a satisfying close shave then you can definitely give this one a try. Just beware that despite the claims this razor does lead to some tugs and may not be the best for individuals with sensitive skin (which I have). This razor is also good for those who like a bulky handle, as this razor is quite long, wide, and heavy. Overall, the Gillette Fusion Proglide will provide a close shave, but watch out for a not so comfortable ride.</li>
    <li> I just got the Gillette Fusion Proglide Flexball and tried it immediately and was really surprised how it got the virtually every hair . Gave a very smooth shave with no cuts . Will def continue to use and would most def recommend to anyone that hasn&#x27;t tried it.</li>
    <li> I got to try this razor via Gillette and I have to say this is by far their best razor yet. I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors before such as the Fusion and Fusion Power but this razor exceeded those razors by far. First off, I never would have realized how important the Flexball technology would be until I tried it and found how it contoured with my face so perfectly that I couldn&#x27;t even feel the blades. Second, This razor is especially good for people with sensitive skin as your not dragging the razor across awkward curves and contours, you just let it glide across your skin. Finally,  this razor provides an incredibly close, smooth shave. After using it, I couldn&#x27;t feel any stubble or burn ANYWHERE. Definitely Gillette&#x27;s best razor so far.</li>
    <li> When the Fusion ProGlide arrived free in my mail from Gillette, I was unconvinced they could improve upon the Fusion line.  I am a fan of Gillette, they are the only brand I have trusted for at least the last ten years, but I thought they had reached the pinnacle with the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I sure dropped the \\&quot;ball\\&quot; on that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexball allows the razor to move across your face faster and with more contact then I imagined possible.  Never before has my neckline felt as smooth and been completed as quickly. It follows all the contours of your face to take off every hair and it turns like a sports car&lt;br /&gt;The weight in your hand feels substantial, and its backwards compatible! The new cartridges feature an improved lubrication strip, you can really get away with shaving with just a wet face. But it takes the left over Fusion blades you have in the drawer so its not like you wasted money on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get on the Ball</li>
    <li> I got this Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor for free from Gillette in exchange for my honest opinion about the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will start with the grip, it is much better then most of the other razors I have tried and the handle had some weight to it which I liked. The flexball makes it easy to go over the contours of my face as well as my chin and neck it left me with a clean smooth shave, I don&#x27;t have to go back over my face looking for spots I missed as much as I do with other shavers I have used. It glides over my skin without pulling or tugging so I didn&#x27;t have cuts or bumps after I shaved. There is less shaving cream build up so it made it easier and took less time to shave. I will be replacing my usual razor with this one. I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a painless close shave.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Gillette to evaluate. I like how the back-end of the razor blade is exposed so you can spray water on it to get the hair out easily. I grew a beard and mustache for a week to try it out. The blades washed out easily. However, the shave was not as close as my old Gillette Atra razor. I had to keep going over some spots.</li>
    <li> Liked the fact that you do not have to twist and turn the razor to get a close shave.  Awesome product Gillette!!</li>
    <li> Received this product from Gillette to try out, while i am a big fan of Gillette products, this one is good but does not &amp;#34;WoW&amp;#34; me.  The flex ball is supposed to rotate and turn to the curves of your face, as i use i notice that i have to go over jaw line and chin multiple times to get the job done.  I think this product is just as good or better with out the flex ball technology. The product does appear to be less durable than other Gillette razors, it seems that if you drop it, the swivel that holds the flex ball in place lets loose or breaks easily.  This does not thwart me away form Gillette products, i will continue to use their razors, but am looking forward to a new and improved model.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall for a few days now and I’m very happy with the smooth results. I received this razor as a special gift from Gillette, I shaved my head this morning and I do believe this razor has given me the best results of any razor to date.  I didn’t think that the FlexBall would really make much of a difference, but I could feel how I didn’t have to keep the razor straight upright as I went around my head, it just followed along and flexed perfectly with the curve cutting everything in its path. I would have liked a little more grip on the handle and some sort of case to clip it into or maybe a blade guard to protect the head.</li>
    <li> I just tried my GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR WITH FLEXBALL.  It is so easy to use and so smooth around the corner of my face.  I have always use Gillette blades int he past.  But this new design makes it so smoothly when shaving around my chin and neck.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who likes a really each clean close shave</li>
    <li> Where shaving is concerned there is no avoiding the need. Let go of one day, and one is well on their way to the shadow look. In my case, I do not have the requirement to let a beard grow because I start to develop a serious rash, so I must keep a very smooth shaved surface and apply and after shave touch of aveeno, which I discovered is the best for dry skin and vanishes any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball..., the daily staple of the shaving process, that together with the substantially expensive pro glide razors make the winning combination. I have been using mostly Gillette products for the better of a decade and more, and so far I have grown accustomed to using this particular shaver, which I guess makes me loyal to the brand. This newer development on the trustworthy Proglide series, is without a doubt a step on the right direction, without trying to say that is way much better to the previous model, it is slightly better, feels more manageable and somehow, even sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered that in my case, that the best possible approach to shaving with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball and its blades, is to combine it with an electric razor. Sometimes when I let go of shaving for a couple of day for whatever reasons I may have, I use the Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver in the shower. By doing it this way I take most of the larger part of the job, and I finish the job with this highly competent newer version of a very reliable method of shaving. I read somewhere that by spraying the blades of the fusion with glass cleaner it prolongs their usage, so after trying it I get to use the same blades for about 10 uses with no problem, sometimes a day or two more. Perhaps this works because of the electric razor helping to reduce the amount of work the Gillette Fusion is required to perform. Either way, I am very happy with the product, as I mentioned before, have been using it for a long time for it is the more convenient and effective method to shave without taking too much time to do it. I thank amazon for allowing me to try this amazing new design, which is with no doubt the newer and best in the lineup. 4.5 Stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of shaving. At all. I received one of these razors from Gillette and I have to say that this provided one of the better shaves I&#x27;ve had from this type of razor.  I sport a couple of days beard growth when I shave and the Fusion Proglide provided a smooth, close shave with minimal discomfort.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this razor 5 stars in the category of consumer-grade manual razors. I received one from the brand to try out and to give honest feedback. I really do think it follows contours of your face and I feel more confident that I&#x27;m not going to get any cuts. I use Gillette foam to go with it and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> For years, I used a Gillette sensor razor. Since I&#x27;ve had success with the Gillette name, I figured I&#x27;d try this out. The head has five blades and it glided quite gently. The flex ball made it a bit easier to get around the curves of my cheekbone and chin. I noticed a cleaner cut. I also noticed that rinsing the blades themselves was a lot easier as this thing cuts the hairs up much finer than my Gillette sensor did so less stuff getting caught between the blades. This has been a nice upgrade, glad I did it.</li>
    <li> This razor is exceptional. I have been a fan of Gillette but with this new flexball pivot head I am blown away. I have always had problems with razor burn. With this new razor I have had no problems what so ever. I would recommend this razor to anyone that is using a disposable and looking for a closer shave without  the irritation.</li>
    <li> I love that the head swivels back and forth. It allows for an easier shave without having to adjust your hand position on your face. The movement simplifies shaving in those hard to reach areas. The razor itself is the same quality I&#x27;m used to with my regular Gillette Fusion but the swivel motion makes all the difference. I&#x27;ve found my new razor.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Silver touch razor is a really good product for a close shave. Your won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Every time I see a new razor, I shake my head. Can they really innovate that much on a blade you drag across your face? And how many more blades can they fit on a razor head? That said, this gives a really nice shave. I&#x27;ve got a little scar on my cheek, just the tiniest bump, but I always manage to nick it. The flexball head goes neatly over it, leaving me with a cleaner shave and no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re content with your every day razor, this is not going to change your life forever. But it provides a darn nice shave, including in those spots where a cheaper razor misses or nicks you. If this is an issue for you, give this a try.</li>
    <li> I recently was given a free trial of this razor from Gillette. I have to say the pivot-ball works but not really necessary. I found it to be more in the way if you ask me because I didn&#x27;t really want the razor to move. It shaves just as well as my other fusion razors I&#x27;ve tried. The handle is really not great in the hand and I prefer previous Fusion handles. It still gets the job done and gets a clean shave so its good and why I give it 3 stars. It will all depend on the cost of the replacement blades if I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This razor is the new favorite in our house. The ball adds to the greatness of this razor. Thanks Gillette for the great new razor. We received this free from Gillette to try and will be buying in the future.</li>
    <li> I have very soft and sensitive skin, and this razor is perfect for my skin type!  The Lubrastrip at the top of the razor contains ingredients to soothe my skin immediately after the blades run over it. For me, this is a must-have for razors.  I like the feel of the thin, low cutting force blades, which gives me a close shave by cutting fast and smoothly, which minimized the tug on my skin when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FlexBall handle helps the razor to get to all the bumps and crevices of my face and neck when shaving, especially the part between my nose and lips, which I have a hard time shaving with other razors.  That&#x27;s also one of the most sensitive areas on my face, which did not feel any irritation after using the GIllette Fusion Proglide razor. Again, I thank the fine-edge blades and Lubrastrip on this razor for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product from Gillette for review.</li>
    <li> I received a Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology from Gillette to test.  I was quite pleased with the quality of this razor.  The Flexball seems to be the key to a very close shave in those hard to shave areas around the nose.  I like the thin blades and there was no after burn either.  I used this for about a month to really give it a good test and I would continue to use this razor.</li>
    <li> Not impressed by the new feature. Shaving on a regular basis with the regular Fusion. Did not see a big improvement. However, best manual razor on the market now. None of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried did as great of the job.</li>
    <li> Wow. I thought the regular Fusion ProGlide was a great razor, and no other razor could beat it; but boy was I wrong.  The new Fusion Proglide with FlexBall handle is awesome!  Just hearing the name wouldn&#x27;t make me think that just a different type of handle could really make any difference, but that&#x27;s certainly not the case.  This FlexBall handle improves upon the ProGlide drastically.  The handle allows for much better contact with the skin, and it is able to easily glide around all the contours of your face.  There&#x27;s no more need to go over the same spot multiple times so that it gets each individual hair.  Now it only takes seconds to achieve a nice, clean shave. So don&#x27;t wait! I would highly recommend using the new Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology!</li>
    <li> We received this for free to test for the manufacturer. After using this a few times we do like how it follows the curves of your face, but feel we still get a closer shave with the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin on my face and any attempt I&#x27;ve ever made at growing a beard made me look like my own evil twin. So I hate shaving ALMOST as much as I hate having facial hair.  I see people shave in movies and commercials, and the razor takes a nice, smooth glide across a smiling face that&#x27;s left smooth and perfect. I hate those faces. I hate them because I&#x27;ve always wanted that but it&#x27;s never seemed possible. Real people never have a shaving experience like that, least of all me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, until I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide. This razor does everything I want. With a new blade, it was gliding across my skin like there was no beard there to slow it down. There was no resistance, it didn&#x27;t pull. It didn&#x27;t give me red bumps or leave stray hairs. It was the smoothest and easiest shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. It is, quite simply, all I could ever want from a razor.</li>
    <li> Loved the way it moved with the different movements.  Excellent close shave. Was able to try it from BzzAgent.com</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette and can say it does a good job.  I prefer manual razors over electric because I think it gives a closer shave.  This razor is no different - close shave and easier to detail with than electric razors.  In my opinion, as long as you are using a razor that has refillable blades rather than the cheap disposable razors, you are more or less going to get the same results.  What does set this razor apart from other reusable razors on the market is the flexball technology.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how much of a difference it would make (kind of like when Nike started marketing Nike Shocks but they really just seemed the same as any other sneaker), but I can say that the flexball definitely makes for a different shaving experience.  At first it&#x27;s actually kind of weird because I&#x27;m not used to a the head of a razor responding so sensitively.  However, after a few minutes of shaving I got used to it and it&#x27;s pretty nice.  Kind of like having really bad shocks on your car that you&#x27;ve gotten so used to that when you get new shocks you&#x27;re surprised by how different your drive is.  Is my shave any different than it would be with another Gillette/Mach3 type razor? I don&#x27;t think so, but the shaving experience is definitely different and that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of razors, from DollarShaveClub, Kroger, Schick, and even Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only one that is consistently a better shave than Mach III.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also doesn&#x27;t clog up like ALL of the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is that it costs about twice what any discount brand does, and 50% more than most premium brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side, it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, nor shave off skin at the whisker roots.  It&#x27;s really comfortable and lasts through  a lot of beardage.</li>
    <li> As a note I did receive this as a sample.&lt;br /&gt;Initial impressions compared to my current fusion proglide:&lt;br /&gt;The grip is quite a bit nicer, the razor in general seems built a little better. The flexball technology they speak of is pretty much a low tension metal band that allows the head to easily flex while pulling it back into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears you can use the usual proglide blades with this razor, though they claim the one it comes with has improved properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the customary one side of the face with each razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old razor was not a fresh cartridge, but is not done yet.&lt;br /&gt;I did a one over with both, not backtracking to get a comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the shave the new proglide did seem easier, and I will admit I didn&#x27;t get as much build up of shaving cream. Probably due to their claim of channeling cream away better. Upon inspection afterward there was about half as much hair on the &#x27;new&#x27; side as the old, and the ones that were left were also shorter.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think the flexball would really do anything, but I heard it moving back into place after I did a finish-up shave, so it probably has some effect at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I would say if you want a new razor it&#x27;s a safe bet for your money. If you aren&#x27;t unhappy with what you have, picking up the new heads alone may be enough to improve the shave without the rest of the razor piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: As an update I will say when I have to have a clean shave(every weekend) I do find myself using this handle more often than my other proglide.</li>
    <li> Great Razor!! I always have trouble getting a close shave on my neck, with this new flexball technology I finally get a great all over all shave!!!</li>
    <li> A good razor. As good as any. Granted I have a beard and had to try it to the best of my ability. Not good for clean up touch up work, but I&#x27;m sure it works great for those babyfaced brethrens out there.</li>
    <li> This razor the Gillette Fusipn Proglide is the razor every man needs. I am one that my face gets cut everytime I shave, with the Gillette proglide it didn&#x27;t happen and I will never go back. The flexball really works to make sure the razor shaves where it needs to without cutting your face.</li>
    <li> I try not shave every day because of how my face feels when I do; it feels as if I&#x27;m shaving the skin off and not the hair. With this razor my skin feels different, in a good way. I normally am not picking to what products I use; but for my face I will be picking and this product is the right one for me.</li>
    <li> Closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor as a sample from the manufacturer. I&#x27;ve been using a subscription-type service for my razors for a couple of months, but I just cancelled the subscription because I&#x27;ve found my new favorite shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing blades aside, the flexball thing is really useful. I could hear the blade cartridge moving with the contours of my neck and jawline.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball on a trial offer and I love it.  I mainly use razors for shaving my head as I am &amp;#34;follically challenged&amp;#34;.  This is the best razor I have used for getting all the hard to reach places.  It is quicker to use and provides a smooth clean finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be using this razor for years to come.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Gillette to try out and give my honest opinion. This is a pretty nice razor for the money. I have used other 5 blade razors that cost more but did not give as good of a shave as this one. Im not sure that the Flexball has any real advantage but no disadvantage either. The price for the replacement blades are an important factor when I&#x27;m looking for a new razor and these are not out of hand in price. Overall a pretty good razor and good value.</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of this product from Gillette and am very impressed with the product.  I thought it was a little gimmicky at first but it provides a very smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t leave any bumps or irritation behind.  I would say this is the best razor I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> Had my wife throw away my other Razor!!!!! Didn&#x27;t pull my skin and leave razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;I got to try it for free, and I now I know what I will be sending my wife to go out and buy... more cartridges.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best razor ever. I will never buy another brand again. Where was this razor 20 years ago. If you want a good razor try this one.</li>
    <li> Seems like it works fairly well but the refills seem to be to expensive.....</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t used to the Flexball at first but I got used to it quickly. I generally shave every other day or so, and with this razor I&#x27;ve had to shave less than that. It was a much closer shave than I&#x27;m used to. I also noticed a quicker shave as well.</li>
    <li> great product. i&#x27;ve been using gillette&#x27;s razors for years, and this is the best yet.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Gillette for product testing and review. I normally use an electric razor but when I need a quick, super close shave I will use a standard razor much like this one. When I got this one, my first thought after opening the box was that it looked like more gimmicks and most changes were visual. Then I tried it and I was surprised. I have sensitive skin and will get a rash when I shave with blades like this. It wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad when I used the Flexball. The razor glides easily over your skin and the blades do a great job at cutting hair the first time over it. Next time I need a close shave for a special event or date I will definitely go for the Fusion Proglide Flexball. It is one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. I would recommend this razor to all my friends and family for sure.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a free trial to try the product.. I was very excited and looking forward to using it as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I received it in the mail, took it out of the package and set it into my razor tray that is built into my shower so that it would be ready to use that night! When that night arrived and I picked it up from the tray to use I looked down at it and noticed the white strip at the top of the blades had broken off which made it un-useable. I&#x27;m assuming based on the great reviews of this product that I must have received a defected item. Very disappointed as I was very excited to try this out! The design and build of it is very nice and heavy duty, also heavy in my hand which makes me believe that order than the piece that fell/broke off this razor would have lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> Great razor!!! Smooth shave, no razor bumps. My favorite new razor get the job done and more and good reasonable price. Also got this product from Gillette for free so was even better to sample it first but i will be purchasing it.</li>
    <li> It is very smooth at the beginning. If you have thick facial hair it can get caught up in the smaller spaced blades.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Very very smooth reaction to my skin....I have very sensitive skin and this does the job.  Did not get a knick once...Love the swivel head of the shaver.  Very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best razor I ever tried.  With the ball you will get the closest shave ever and not have to worry about getting and nicks or cuts.  The ball makes the razor contour to your face which in turn makes it so much easier to shave,  I think Gillette has a winner here, I know I am sold on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this review thing so here it goes.  Just like any other razor the quality of the shave is based on the quality of the blade.  That said this new flexball does keep me from getting those annoying cuts around my adam&#x27;s apple.  I guess it works like they say.  I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks and I&#x27;ll keep using it from now on.</li>
    <li> Received a razor from Gillette to try out and it worked as expected. Seemed like another gimmick to me because my shave was not markedly improved or more enjoyable. I use the dollar shave club regularly and I get just as good of a shave for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Prior to this month, I had invested 3 years into growing a mustache. As my daily appearance had started to become stale and predictable, and after tearing open my mail to reveal my free sample of the Gillette Fusion Proglide courtesy of Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., I decided to lather up. Now, I&#x27;m not what you&#x27;d call \\&quot;hygienic\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t often \\&quot;groom myself\\&quot;, and when I do, I don&#x27;t use a \\&quot;sanitary implement.\\&quot; So, you can imagine my surprise and delight upon touching this dream of a razor to my skin. The hair that so often pulled and tore from my scabby, pock-marked face was suddenly falling effortlessly to the porcelain basin below. It was as if my mustache had never been a part of me at all. It had merely hovered beside my Philtrum, occupying the space between myself and the world around me like a celestial muzzle.    So, in summation, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor thanks to the complimentary free product from the maker of Gillette.  I have shaved with this razor a couple of times since receiving it. The shave is truly close and I have not had any irritation at all! There have been razors that have cause irritation but this razor is great.  There are many pros to this razor... It gives a smooth shave, it glides easily over the face and round edges (the pivot ball is just great!), it is sturdy, it is solid grip.  I believe three blades would get just as good of a shave and it would cut down on size of the head. Or perhaps it is the blue piece in the bottom of the head. It could be thinner to make it easier to help reach the hairs under the nose right above the lip and perhaps any other hard to reach areas that may need grooming.  Overall it really is a great shaving tool and I do like it much more than any previous razor I have owned.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  Received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor free from Gillette.  At first I thought it was gimmicky, but it does an excellent job staying flat to your face.  Being a longtime user of the Gillette Fusion razors, I am happy to report that the company maintained the features that I have always liked and improved on them!  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Gillette Fusion brand before, and have been pleased with the results.  A good grip, clean shave, and the blades stay sharp for a good while.  This razor has great improvements - a ball that follows the contours of your face.  This is a great addition to an already great razor.  I had no nicks or cuts - just a clean shave every time.  It left me with a smooth, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette has a winner with the Fusion Proglide.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Great choice. Works great</li>
    <li> Better than the ProGlide sanz the Flex ball technology... No. I could not detect an appreciable difference.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the flexball technology helps the razor get to the spots your always miss.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s is good shaver easy to move on your face</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a sample to try out. I normally shave 2-3 times a week. Gillette Fusion is my normal go-to razor. Nothing really different in the shaver than other Gillettes, even with the ball. I will continue to use this razor but won&#x27;t be changing types, unless it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
    <li> Received this razor from Gillete to try out for free. Was very much pleased as this was the first product I was receiving for free to review.    Currently I am using  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor for the past year and a half and am quite please with the performance. So I wanted to experience this new technology which would up the game further.    The main feature which i like about Gillette blades is  Blade Stabilizer which maintains optimal blade spacing for comfort and also prevents the hair trimmed by the previous blade to spring back , hence gives a closer , smoother shave.    I have a french cut beard and the Precision trimmer at the back side of the razor blade really helps to trim the edges. So its a particular feature I look out for.    As for the new Flexball technology, I liked the movement of the razor cartridge sideways which helps in smoother shave of the contours of the neck. Previously I had to shave a spot twice or thrice so that the tiny hairs in the neck which i missed in the first try is taken care in the 2nd and 3rd attempt. But with Flexball technology that is not a problem anymore and I am able to chave at one whole swoop.    The only thing I have against this the Flexball socket is mounted on a channel which looks flimsy.    Also one though that came to my mind that I already have bought quite a few cartridges for my old Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor and would they fit in this new one. IT PERFECTLY DID.    Pictures of comparison of interchanging the cartridge can be seen in the links below    http://s28.postimg.org/xubket3gp/IMAG1081.jpg    http://s28.postimg.org/fhaz48szt/IMAG1082.jpg    http://s28.postimg.org/8uobb2bbd/IMAG1084.jpg     http://s28.postimg.org/jey8tnft5/IMAG1085.jpg     http://s28.postimg.org/5zb8477bd/IMAG1086.jpg     http://s28.postimg.org/igmh53rux/IMAG1087.jpg     http://s28.postimg.org/u70emhknd/IMAG1088.jpg</li>
    <li> My first Proglide was a trial sample from Gillette. I really like the shave I get from the Proglide flexball razor. I admit, it is a little disconcerting at first, watching the blades sway side to side on their own. However, that&#x27;s what makes it work so well. It is floating around the curves and contours of your face. I also like that Gillette included the single trimmer blade on the flexball cartridge because there is always those spots where the regular blades just quite get in close enough. The only downside I see with this razor is the cost of the replacement blades but all the companies have taken the approach that is where they will make the profits of the new razors they develop.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide is an amazing razorblade. It gets the rid of hairs in all those hard to reach places under the neck and chin. The flexball is increbible and helps get to the bottom of those hard to reach areas giving you a close smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Great product but it didn&#x27;t come with a platform so I have nowhere to store it.</li>
    <li> Gillette is awesome. Enough said!!!</li>
    <li> The product was great.  The Proglide provided a nice, smooth shave.  The shaver was one the best I have ever used and I have used many.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, shaves very well.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion Proglide.  I tried it out and think it&#x27;s a pretty nice razor.  I was afraid the five blades would be a little too much, but I used extra shaving cream.  Overall, I was able to shave confidently without any fear of nicks or stubble.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a improved razor over the old Proglide.  One thing that bothers me, Gillette has never said what chemicals are in the mosturizing &amp;#34;Lubrastrip&amp;#34; that is used on the Proglides.</li>
    <li> Goods are returned without cause, I didn&#x27;t see the goods</li>
    <li> Best razor on the market, in the price range. The pivoting head and trimming razor make shaving the hard to reach areas a breeze.</li>
    <li> Giving it 3 stars because it leaves some unshaved hair on the chin&#x27;s edge. I&#x27;m back to the earlier model of prolidge which works way better than this Flexball blade.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used so far. It&#x27;s really comfortable to the skin and I really recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how many times Gillette can reinvent the wheel, but they&#x27;ve done a pretty good job with this latest razor with disposable blades. Confession: I&#x27;m a chick who picked this because I&#x27;m sick to death of the junk razors they keep trying to foist on us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I love the weight of this and the grooves on the sides of the razor - it makes me feel very secure handling it, even with soapy hands and that was something I worried about with the head that pivots all over the place. That pivoting head does a GREAT job giving a very close, clean shave without having to go over areas twice, having to pull my skin around or risking nicks by pushing harder on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem to be longer-lasting/sharper than the comparable women&#x27;s razor but that&#x27;s not saying much. I haven&#x27;t needed to change it yet (after 3 weeks of twice-weekly use) but will have to soon. Popping the old head off and putting a new head on looks incredibly simple - push the orange button, it pops off, push the new one on, it&#x27;s done. I&#x27;m very happy with this and will definitely continue using it unless Gillette goes crazy and makes the replacement blades insanely expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. It&#x27;s great for your daily shaver or somebody with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. It will shave every contour of your face with ease. I will recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got a Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with a Flexball from Gillette.  I am a loyal Gillette razor user and will continue to be based on my experience with the Proglide razor with flexball handle technology. It provided a great shave and handles well. Was not expecting anything different of a razor with this product.</li>
    <li> Once again Gillette knocks it out of the park with the silvertouch. It is great that they came up with the movable head for this one. It cuts clean and close on the first swipe. No longer will you have to go back and hit the same area and feel the burn. The way that it hugs the contours of your face is as good as any razor on the market. Keep it up Gillette and I will be a long time user.  I received the razor from gillette</li>
    <li> Tried it and got one of the worst shaves ever, it was oainful</li>
    <li> I am not quite sure I would buy this.  When I pressed the release button, the razor head flew halfway across the room.</li>
    <li> I received Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette for free to try and it was on the ball. Definitely a step up from it&#x27;s predecessor and the extra flexibility of the razor reduces the burn and chances of cutting yourself around the contours of your face. Would definitely recommend trying this to see how you like it. I think a power version may be better just because it makes for less irritation. Only negative is the blades themselves and how quickly they can dull.</li>
    <li> great razor. smooth shave and i like gillette products a lot but I am not sure I would actually buy this without getting a free sample due to the cost.  I just don&#x27;t like paying a lot for razors and really not sure the flexball feature is worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve always enjoyed using Gillette Fusion Proglide razors. The flex ball is an interesting addition. I recently was given the chance to test the flex ball technology for Gillette. Turns out to be a decent improvement. More like an evolution, not something I would have upgraded to but not disappointed either.</li>
    <li> This razor is AMAZING!  I received one for free from BzzAgent, and I was pretty stoked because I&#x27;d been wanting to try one out since I first saw ads for it.  Sometimes the products I get sent are duds, but this one is the real deal.  I have shaved my face several times with this and the blades still aren&#x27;t dull, and I&#x27;ve barely nicked myself at all.  It gives a superb clean shave as well, and is easy to use around my goatee.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch razor from Gillette as part of a campaign.  I have been relatively satisfied with the performance.  The razor does angle well and can get to spots that are otherwise difficult to shave. I would not buy it over any razor however.  i tend to just purchase the cheapest razors I can.</li>
    <li> When I first received the Gillette Fusion Proglide with the Flexball I thought it was a great improvement. Rather than just adding another blade, Gillette actually provided a much needed enhancement to the non-electric razor.</li>
    <li> The razor is very flexible and the Flexball technology helps with shaving the contours of the face extremely well. The blades are sharp and provide an excellent shave without having to go over the same spot multiple times.</li>
    <li> We all love shiny objects that have some weight to them. like an ounce of silver. The Gillette Fusion Proglide has some nice weight in the handle that feels good in your hand, and it is shiny. My first shave was very smooth, the second shave was also very smooth and I did not notice any lack of sharpness in the blade. The third shave seemed as if the blade was dragging across my face. The shaves were acceptable except that i have a spot on my cheek that no razor has been able to shave to my satisfaction without going over this spot a few times, and it is with disappointment that I say the Gillette Fusion Proglide failed that test. If the razor would have been able to give me a smooth shave on every part of my face it would get my overall 100% approval, but as it missed the one spot on my face as all other razors did, it fails.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best razor I have used on my own face.  I liked the Gillette Fusion, but the swivel technology of this razor helps me get around the chin much easier.  This razor works well for me because I do not switch hands during my shave.  Gillette sent the razor to me for a try and after three uses I put my old Gillette Fusion in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great. I love it, the way it glides around the edges is amazing. Best razor I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
    <li> Just used the Proglide for the first time and was very impressed with how smooth and close the shave was.  The smaller profile blade made it easy to get to the tougher spots where larger blades have a difficult time getting to without a lot of extra effort and funny faces in the mirror.</li>
    <li> And I must say I&#x27;m pleased, I don&#x27;t use it everyday but every 3 or 4 days to shave my beared off and it does the job very well. I used it for about 5 times and its okay might need to replace blades again . but overall gillette keep them coming your razors always do the job right.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used! With my sensitive skin, I always have trouble around my chin bone, have to go over it more than once to get a good shave, with the way my hair grows... But with this razor, the ball just glides right around the bone, and I get a clean shave with one stroke! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch after seeing a commercial for it. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be amazing or special but it actually turned out to be pretty good. It honestly wasn&#x27;t much different than the original fusion razor that Gillette has but the moving feature was pretty good actually. Also, since I&#x27;ve been shaving for a while now I was use to moving my face when shaving so I didn&#x27;t really need the new technology that it offers. I do recommend it since it is a good razor and works just as well as others.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Fusion for free from Gillette to review, and I must admit I was a little skeptical when I first opened the package. I have used about every razor on the market, and they mostly seem the same. This one is not. So far, I haven&#x27;t been left bleeding to death from my face as I stand in the shower, yet it&#x27;s still giving me a close shave. The flexball actually does make a difference with contour, even in sensitive *turn your head and cough* areas. I am very satisfied with the performance so far, so now I just need to see how long it will last. I can usually only get about 10 good shaves from any razor worth it&#x27;s price, and I&#x27;m almost to 15 with this one without any decreased performance.</li>
    <li> I would like to start out with I received this to try out and give my opinion on this product from Bzzagent.  This is a really nice product and it works very well and gives a very close and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample from Gillette, I don&#x27;t have an amazon account so I&#x27;m using my wife&#x27;s. I liked the flexball because I felt like it helped the shaver contour to my face. No nicks, &amp; a closer shave than I&#x27;d been getting with other razors. I liked it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am still quite impressed with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle Technology. I have been testing it out, thanks to a free sample, from Gillette, for a few weeks now. I truly did not think that something as simple as a rotating head would make any difference but I have been proven wrong. Usually when I shave with non-electric razors I need to keep the strokes straight and avoid curves around my chin and jaw line. With this razor though I have been able to avoid concern of the blade not maintaining contact and been able to use less strokes with the razor to get a full, clean shave. Overall, I am very impressed with the way this razor has performed and would recommend it if you like non-powered razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Great quality from Gillette, Smooth stroke even when going around curves or changing directions, not a lot of pressure needed to cause the razor head to move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Non powered as I prefer the power razors to non powered, could allow even more rotation of the head</li>
    <li> I was asked by Gillette to try the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor with Flexball free.  It gave me the closest shave I have ever had by a hand held razor.  The handle has a firm weight to it that helps keep it in your hand while saving.  The flexball easily moved to the contours of my face without any effort.</li>
    <li> I got the product from Gillette for trying my hands on and \\&quot;Oh Boy!\\&quot; was my first reaction after seeing the product. What have they done with this new orange rotator kind of thing. Will this be in my control OR will move in any direction? I must admit that i was little scared when i used it for first time but it was an amazing experience. The new flexball really helped the razor smoothly take care of areas which were hard to shave earlier due to face structure. It was not jumping from one curve to another rather gliding smoothly. Only drawback i find (in comparison to the Power Fusion razor i use regularly) that my manual proglide razor had a much thinner hold in comparison and i had to really make an effort to hold it tight. Due to the battery inside a power razor, the grip was much better but in this one (manual version), my thumb really ached after completing the shave and may be it&#x27;s just because i never used manual version (even of Power Fusion Razor) and being a big guy i am used to a thicker grip. I would really like to try the power version of this razor as well which will help me make an apple to apple comparison.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m female and I tried this razor for shaving my bikini area. At first I thought the &amp;#34;flexball technology&amp;#34; was a gimmick - but it&#x27;s actually kinda nice. The head of the razor can swivel/tilt side-to-side in addition to back-and-forth.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it made it a little easier and safer to shave places I can&#x27;t see.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Razor is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  It feels really comfortable and gives me a constant shave.  The Flexball part gives me added precision to fix the sideburns to perfect length and width.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette to test out.  I&#x27;ve tried all of their razors, but always end up going back to the Mach3.  The Silvertouch was a pleasant surprise.  It allowed me to get a closer shave around the contours of my face than the Mach3.  I have also found that nicks are much smaller and less noticeable with the Silvertouch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Gillette razors for quite some time now, and honestly believe they are about the best available. I have since found several razors that work pretty much just as well--all for cheaper (sometimes quite a bit cheaper) than what a typical Proglide razor will cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I just thought I was ordering a regular Fusion Proglide razor...but no, this is the model that comes with the Flexball Handle. So what does the Flexball Handle actually DO? Good question. The razors have tilted backward &amp; forward to follow the contour of your face for literally at least a decade or more, right? The Flexball Handle essentially now allows it to curve not only up &amp; down, but now left &amp; right as well, giving your new razor unprecedented facial comfort and coverage. All this should translate into not only the best shave ever, but smoothest as well, right? In reality, I noticed absolutely ZERO difference in how close the razor shaved than my previous Proglide without the Flexball Handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me be clear: I still LOVE the Proglide, and firmly believe that if I have the choice of using the Gillette versus pretty much every model of personal shaver available, I&#x27;ll go with the Gillette pretty much every time (unless of course I cannot afford one, in which case I have 3 different and much cheaper models which I believe work easily 98% as good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, I LOVE the Proglide--but don&#x27;t see that the Flexball Handle works really any better than the regular model. Maybe that&#x27;s because the regular Proglide works so well, that the difference is purely subjective to each user, I&#x27;m not entirely certain to be honest. All I know is it works, and works well...but if the Flexball is more expensive, I cannot endorse paying more. If they are the same price as the regular Proglides, then no problem. Otherwise, I&#x27;d stick with the regular razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to plastic razors, so the first thing I noticed about the Gillette Fusion was the heavy metal handle.  It took a bit of time to get used to, but ultimately didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference.  The shave itself wasn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;ve been able to get with some razors, but it was decent enough for me to use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this razor was what I assume is the &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; part- the pivoting ball that connects the handle to the actual razor.  Instead of making it easier to follow contours, it just made me fee like I was shaving with a floppy razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was satisfied with the shave I got, but I don&#x27;t think this razor is anything special or worth paying too much for.</li>
    <li> This razor is great.  Received this to try from the company and it worked great.  It gives a very close shave. -- therefore increasing the time between shaves...that is great thing --- because  let&#x27;s face it...who likes to shave?  Also the swivel ball makes it easier to complete shaving in one stroke therefore reducing cuts and nicks.  The blade cartridges are expensive though but if you dry the blades after every use...you can increase the life of each cartridge!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this products. I went back to Schick Hydro 5 Blade. Gillette should put some money and time in R and D before they sale items.</li>
    <li> Great razor and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Best shave of my life. Sorry I waited so long to try a premium blade, but had been put off by the price.&lt;br /&gt;Actually works out better as the 25th shave with one of these blades is better than the first shave of the disposables.</li>
    <li> I have to say Gillette always amazes me with there new razors and this one has to be be far one of the best Manuel razors because the FlexBall handle it just gives the best shave and slides through the skin smoothly. (Thanks Gillette for sending me a free sample to try I really loved it!)</li>
    <li> This item is very much like another razor I recently reviewed (Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology With 2 Razor Blade Refills) in that they are the best razors my husband has ever used.  To me personally the other razor looks &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; which means absolutely nothing for its function, but I assumed it would work better than this one.  No, they both work equally as well.  The downside is that the refill razors are quite pricey, but that&#x27;s what you have to deal with if you want a close a shave as this gives you.  The price is definitely worth it because not only is the shave very close and extremely smooth, but it lasts much longer than regular razors.  My husband comes home from work after 11pm most days after shaving at 8:30am, and his face is still as smooth as ever.  With regular razors (cheap-o kinds) you can clearly feel stubble on his face by the end of the day.  Expensive, but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been a Gillete ProGlide user for about 2 years now. It has been my go to razor for all that time. The FlexBall handle really does bring it to a new level. During my time with the product, I was swapping between my old handle, and the new FlexBall handle. I noticed a significant improvement in my shave quality with the new handle. It shaved closer, in fewer passes than the old handle. One of the features that I was glad for is that it is compatible with all the old ProGlide razor heads - as a long time ProGlide user, I was happy to not have to switch to new heads. I would definitely recommend this product to people who prefer these style of shaving.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to review from Gillette, and it is Amazing. Love the new flexball technology. Smooth &amp; clean shave, I highly recommend this to mean and women alike!!!</li>
    <li> I just received the product this morning from Gillette and I have to say I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve used other Gillette razors in the past but this is by far my favorite. I no longer have to attack my facial hair from strange angles, the Proglide function does all the work for me. I&#x27;ve also noticed it takes about a minute off of how long it usually takes me to shave. It may not sound like a lot of time but it&#x27;s ideal if you&#x27;re in a rush. It also gives you a super smooth shave with very little effort. I would DEFINITELY recommend this product and have already told all of my roommates how awesome it is.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a wonderful product. I recommend it to all guys. It creates a very close shave, and is great for sensitive skin. The flexball makes it much easier to use, and it moves well with the lines of your face. I am very glad I was able to try this product thanks to Gillette and my trial offer.</li>
    <li> i have always been a fan of my old gillette fushion proglide razor and all other gillette products. when they came out with this product, i couldnt&#x27; wait to try it. i actually waited on shaving for a couple days to see how it would work on a longer beard. as soon as the package came from Gillette, i opened it and shaved. i couldn&#x27;t believe how close it got. i loved that i didn&#x27;t have to go back over the same spot to get closer. the power really does make this a close shave. i wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if i didn&#x27;t see it. i like it so much that i keep talking about it with everyone. i told my brothers and father about it and let my father use it. he went out and bought one. he couldn&#x27;t belive it. gillette has always been a great product, and i love how they just keep coming out with ways to make it better.i loved this razor i switched to this one and did not cut myself at all even in those hard to shave places on my neck and lips i love the way the razor pivots to go with the curves of my face and will be switching to this as my new razor of choice</li>
    <li> The razor was very sharp. I especially liked the lubricant strip with very little water  it did not require any shaving cream. It made it very easy to shave  with little water  in a convenient way. The pivoting head seems like a good idea the idea is better than the implementation  i could not notice any difference in the connecting to my face or gliding. The pivot does not move very much  the range of motion seems extremely limited. Good idea but poor implementation.  by the way  I got the Gillette Fusion free from Gillette.</li>
    <li> We received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor with Flexball free from Gillette to try it out and give feedback. and I&lt;br /&gt;We have tried different razors from different brands but feel the Flexball gives this razor a huge advantage.&lt;br /&gt;We were worried how the Flexball would affect the shave but actually found that it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;Rather shaving your head or face it actually gave a smoother shave and glided right over curved areas.&lt;br /&gt;Really impressed with it!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor I get an excellent shave from it also did some research and found out it lasts for 5 weeks and that is shaving everyday got mine free also at BzzAgent.com check it out so cool stuff and it&#x27;s free</li>
    <li> Overall this is a decent razor. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Gillette &amp; their products; however, lately it seems as though they (Gillette) has been reaching a bit to make new products. I shave 3-4 days per week...my head and face. I cannot justify paying extra money for something that has a minimal, at best, improvement over their previous model. The blades don&#x27;t last, and their products are ridiculously priced for the length of time they last. I will stick with my standard Fusion until something substantial is brought to the table with a more realistically priced product.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette.  It did a great job of following contours while applying pressure.  Gave a real close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology is Very recommended, Smooth shave!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product from Gillette for free. You get what you pay for, well I would of defiantly got my moneys worth on this razor, Its top of the line for  me, now if I can only keep it out of my  wife&#x27;s hands, but then again her legs are smooth n silky after using  Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology. Thank Gillette for given me the opportunity to try this. Terry in TN</li>
    <li> I have been using a gillette razor for over 15 years. I am still using the turbo. It has worked well for me these past years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide as a sample. I was not skeptical of the razor as Gillette makes a great razor. I was a little hesitant to try it because of how well I like my current razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did try the razor it did a great job The blades were sharp. The flex ball assists in keeping the blade to your face. It is not loose or stiff. It allows you to put enough pressure to make a smooth shave. I am impressed with this new razor and happy with the gillette brand. I would recommend this razor and a gillette razor as they make an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Gillette.This is the best razor I have ever used. I have been using it for a month now and I haven&#x27;t gotten a cut. Haven&#x27;t gotten razorburn or any irritation when using the razor. Takes care of problem areas nicely.</li>
    <li> I have used the Fusion ProGlide Razor for a few weeks and the this is the best razor that I have used in a long time. Normally, I use an electric shaver, but it doesn&#x27;t have the close shave that I have always desired. With the Fusion razor I am able to grip the comfortable handle that makes shaving safe and effective without any slippage. When I am done with my shave I feel as though I have gone to a professional barber for a close shave. Also, I have sensitive skin and I was worried that I would have some irritation from the shave, but I have not had any issues or problems. In the past few weeks I have barely used my electric razor. I think for now I will stick with this razor :-).</li>
    <li> this is the best razor I&#x27;ve used! I go a close shave in one stroke.</li>
    <li> Please note - I did receive this as a sample from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to only use an electric razor until I received this Gillette Fusion Proglide in the mail.  I am glad I gave it a try, and have fully made the switch to using this razor for every shave.  The blades cut cleaner and with little effort.  It is an easy and clean shave every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this razor to anyone that is looking for something that simply works!</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor which I received for free thanks to Gillette.  I have very sensitive skin so I generally hate shaving with a manual razor as my skin gets very irritated.  However, I found that irritation to be very minimal with this razor!  It was a smooth, close shave!!</li>
    <li> Every time Gillette comes out with a new razor, I&#x27;m a sucker to get the latest thing. This latest version gave me a smooth shave, as expected. What pleasantly surprised me was that I shaved in less time than usual. Because of the swivel, I ran over my skin once with the grain, once against, and was finished. The shave was smooth and close and I had no need to go over any area again. That saved a little time.</li>
    <li> I love this new razor, it feel so great in my hand and it rolls the way you need it to.  No hair are left behind!</li>
    <li> This razor was fun to use, gave a very close shave with no razor burn, and easy to clean out under running water (a problem with most multi-bladed razors.  This razor is fine for face, armpits or legs.  A great addition to the Gillette Family of razors.  No matter what you shave, you will do it with a smile on your face.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Silvertouch with Flexball razor as I&#x27;ve tried every shaving contraption known to man, short of using a sharp rock.  I was attracted to the claims of the new razor such as &amp;#34;maximum contact&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;gets virtually every hair.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve been impressed with Gillette products in the past and I&#x27;ve used many generations of their razors since the early 90s (Sensor, Mach 3, Fusion).  For the past few years I&#x27;ve used electric razors exclusively so I was eager to try a new wet shave system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is packaged in an easily read, and more importantly easily opened, package.  The perforated backing allowed for easy access to the product without requiring the jaws of life to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor handle is built well.  It seems sturdy and had the right amount of &amp;#34;heft.&amp;#34;  The Flexball pivots the razor head so it should always be flush against the skin.  It seems to do as advertised: maximizes contact.  The handle is covered with grips so dropping the razor or having it slip shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade cartridge is a 5 bladed design.  it has a moisturizing strip along the top and a rubber-type grip on the bottom to slightly stretch the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the shaving experience.  I used a shaving gel and found the shave to be comfortable.  The Silvertouch offered a close shave but I found that I had to attack my face in multiple directions in order to get every hair.  This could be due to my face not being used to wet shaving, as I&#x27;ve been using electrics for the past several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few shaves I did nick myself multiple times.  These were all minor and I attribute this to being out of practice with a manual razor.  As I got used to it, the nicks got less frequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I found it to be a quality razor and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I receive a Gillette Fusion Flexball Handle razor as a test for Gillette, the latest in their ever evolving line of razors.  As a long time use of their, I was really looking forward to trying their new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, the razor felt very nice.  The handle was comfortable to hold, with a decent weight to it.  The blade had the same sharp, quality blades I&#x27;ve come to expect from them.  But sadly, the flexball technology fell a little flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can and most likely will get a great shave with the razor.  The idea of a head that can pivot sounds good, but I found it didn&#x27;t actual work as well as I would have thought.  Maybe it&#x27;s how I shave, but I sometimes felt like I didn&#x27;t have as much control of the blade as I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried the razor once, so maybe it will take some getting used to.  But as of now, my thoughts are that it&#x27;s a quality razor, but not worth going out and changing what you have for.</li>
    <li> I have used many different &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; razors in my life, 3 blades, 4 blades, water activated gel, etc. I have to say I really love the FlexBall aspect of this razor. It contours to my face making shaving easier. The razor blades themselves are sharp and get a smooth shave without irritating my skin. I have used this razor daily and it is has made my shaving more pleasant, I do not worry about razor burn or cuts. I would highly recommend this razor because the FlexBsll innovation really makes a difference in my everyday routine.</li>
    <li> I really like the flexball technology. I have enjoyed a closer shave than historically with other brands / types of razors and am now a customer of this product line. Proglide is the way to go if you enjoy a close shave.</li>
    <li> I have used several disposable razors but this razor us by far my favorite I have used. I like the design of the razor and the handle is easy to hold. I really like the ball design of the razor head. This allows the razor to glide over my face easily and give me a close shave. This razor really conforms to the different creases and shapes of your face so you get an even and great shave. I have not had any problem with razor burn whole using this razor.  I got to try this razor free from Gillette and I am very impressed with it. I have found a new favorite razor!!</li>
    <li> This razor, like its battery powered counterpart, does not do a good job.  My husband describes it as frustrating to use because its head is too floppy and as a result it does not properly conform to your face.  He had to keep repositioning it in order to get a close shave, which is time consuming and unnecessary since there are so many razors out there that do a decent job.  He used this razor one and a half times, and then threw it away because it was so frustrating to use and did not give a proper shave.  I do not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This is another great addition to the Gillette line of razors. I have had a great experience with this one and the FlexBall technology. It really does what it says it does, adjusts to the contours of my face. It still gives me a close shave. This is a razor that will definitely keep me loyal to the Gillette brand. If you are looking for a reason to switch over from other brands or just need one to start out with, I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Gillette was kind enough to send me a sample of this razor to try. My current normal daily razor is the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, this razor delivers a very clean &amp; smooth shave. Just like all their products, the indicator strip gives you a very good idea of when it&#x27;s time to change the blade. As the indicator wears away you will notice a little razor burn and small cuts. But when you use it as indented, it results in a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, I actually miss the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34;feature of my normal razor. I never thought that feature actually worked but I really do think it helps as opposed to the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FlexBall technology seems to work as advertised but I didn&#x27;t always like it. I have a beard and while shaving around the beard I like to have straight lines. Well the FlexBall will sometimes flex and not give you the line you expected. If I was to keep using this razor I might need to figure out a better way to shave around my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is a great shave but I only gave it 4 stars because of the inconsistent lines when trying to shave around a beard/goatee.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for over a month and it is the best razor that I have ever used.  It has smooth cut without even using soap.  Gillette you have out done yourself.  I recommend this razor to everyone it is great!!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette to try out.  I&#x27;ve used many Gillette razors in the past and I generally like them.  The blade on this is as high quality as any other Gillette razor.  The alleged big deal with this razor is the FlexBall Handle Technology, which pretty much allows the razor to pivot to the contour of your face.  I didn&#x27;t find this feature helpful, however, and in fact it sometimes impeded my ability to shave efficiently, sometimes moving in a direction that I did not want it to.  I am much more a fan of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor (which I don&#x27;t think they sell anymore) -- it was a inflexible, battery-powered vibrating razor which was much more efficient than this pivoting FlexBall handle, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a free sample of the Fusion Proglide from Gillette to test and review for a few weeks now. I&#x27;ve long used Gillette products and have been pleased with most of them. This blade is also pretty good. First off, I liked the weight and feel of the razor in hand. It felt like it had good balance and was able to move around my face nimbly. The Flexball was the biggest technology change from past razors. It&#x27;s pretty good and I didn&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s movement too much, which I suppose is a good thing. In fact, I was thinking that the Flexball should&#x27;ve had more play, but I suppose it moves how it&#x27;s supposed to. The challenge with any razor is that the handle is cheap, but the blades are expensive. At least the blades can work across a few of the other models in the Gillette lines.</li>
    <li> I normally shave with a double edge safety razor, but Gillette sent me one of these to test drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is an interesting enhancement from previous versions. It seems gimmicky at first, but I believe it does help a bit with correcting minor flaws in angle. If it were correcting anything major, I would assume you&#x27;re shaving like a madman and shouldn&#x27;t rely on the Flexball to help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse facial hair. It&#x27;s not dense, but most razors have much trouble getting through it, even if shaving in the shower with lots of soaking in hot water. This razor is no exception. It felt like I was shaving with sandpaper -- very irritating. I didn&#x27;t end up with any major cuts, but it felt like my face was littered with small abrasions. An obvious step down from a double edge razor with Feather blades. I was shaving against the grain, as usual. It may behave differently going with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn trimmer on the opposite side did work rather well, however. It&#x27;s easy to see what you&#x27;re doing and it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t use it for my normal shaving routine. While I did end up with a close shave, the experience was not pleasant.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my husband to put to the test.  His experience was quite favorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very easy to use, ergonomically correct, well designed, and lightweight re-usable razor.  The packaging is also well designed-not something to be taken for granted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new addition of the The FLEX BALL allows the blade to gently have a lateral movement  and effortlessly \\&quot;swing\\&quot;  from side-to-side in addition to the usual back-and-forth \\&quot;pivoting\\&quot; motions of standard good razors out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this razor probably has its greatest application in routine, daily grooming of normal beard growth, removing simple stubble if you will.  We both  think that for a thick heavy beard, you may have more active control with the Gillette Track II shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both agree- this is a very gentle shaving experience . This was tested using various shaving creams and gels- (Gillette, Colgate, etc.)and  a great clean shave was readily achieved with just about all of them. The razor seem to function more smoothly using Gillette&#x27;s shaving cream. He did not experience any nicks or cuts-no need for cotton swabs here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this razor makes a daily nuisance job (for many) a whole lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!! Ok when I first got it I though crap, not one of those plastic Chinese finger traps that you cant open..... Nope opens from the back easily!!! I have been a MACH3 user since it came out in the market. Always had the plastic handles.... Just thought it was standard. When I first held this razor in my hands I thought &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; This has some weight to it and feels like a quality razor... My face has always been sensitive to new razors. I don&#x27;t know why, every time I use a razor for 6 months or more before I use a new one and even then I use it to shave an old pair of jeans first before I shave my face. With the Gillette Fusion Proglide I took it out and shave straight away. No rash, no cuts, just smooth shaving...felt great!!! Considering I had about a weeks worth of beard, I thought I would have hair stuck in the razor....Nope not at all.... I had to bang it on the sink once and I freaked out, I thought I was going to chip the sink... not used to having these great handles lol. This is a definite recommend from me. You will love this regular razors will never feel the same.</li>
    <li> So far the best razor I ever had. It shaves smoothly and great I&#x27;m planning to stick to this razor for a while I been having it for a week and is still as brand new hoping the best for it until it no longer a sharp shave. But Gillette good job its my favorite razor</li>
    <li> This razor is the best that I have ever used and it is worth twice what they ask for it. I was so impressed with it, that I asked my wife to try it on her legs. I know that goes against the man code, but I just could not keep it all to myself.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!!! Before trying this new razor by Gillette I was using the disposable Bic and this razor blows it away. You don&#x27;t evern feel like your shaving with this razor. It feels like your washing your face with a wet washcloth. The multiple blade doesn&#x27;t pull at your skin it seemlessly gives you the closest shave without even realizing it. Go out and get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> My boyfriend says: It holds to your face really well, so you don&#x27;t have to contort your face like an idiot when you shave. Good blade quality; he would like it better if it had power (like the proglide). But he likes it.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I have the power version as well. I received this free from Gillette, thanks for that. I have extremely thick facial hair and, even after I don&#x27;t shave for a few days, I can shave it all off in about 20 minutes. I particularly like the trimmer which allows me to shave my mustache off and get into hard-to-reach places on my neck. Not quite sure how much I believe in the flexball technology, but I suppose it works well for contours.</li>
    <li> This review has been a while coming because I wanted to make sure it REALLY worked. First off, I&#x27;m not a daily shaver. I like to keep my face a little scruffy, and usually use a beard trimmer, but when I need a clean shave I like to have a razor that can handle some stubble without getting snagged or needing me to start by shaving close with no guard on the beard trimmer. And the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch delivered in a huge way! Gillette sent me a free razor to try, and the very first time I used it the razor smoothly cut through the stubble and gave me a nice, clean, close shave. The intuitive design hugged the curves and bends of my chin and jaw great, too. And what&#x27;s more, the razor stayed sharp and effective the second, third, and fourth times I shaved with it after growing out some stubble again. I love this razor, and look forward to using it for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t sure if the Gillette Fusion would be a good match. Boy was I surprised! The flexball technology contours to your face allowing for a close, smooth shave with no nics, rub marks, or burns. Very pleased after first shave. The only negative with the razor is it&#x27;s a little heavy vs other razors I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette fusion Proglide as a product sample that was sent to me.  I liked the flexball handle and feel that it helped create a more smooth and comfortable shave.  The blades cleaned easily and handle grip was perfect.  I have used the product several times, and feel that it provides an overall  smooth, close, and even shave.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette to try and I&#x27;m sold. Works great, moves over all the bumps and curves with ease. Will be purchasing another in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will use again.</li>
    <li> Have seen a lot of different comments on this razor and I know P&amp;G put a lot of marketing dollars into it.  I like it, works great, especially around the neck area.  Hate the expense of the razors but if you shop around you will be able to find more reasonably priced blades.  If you have to shave, might as well do it as close and as comfortably as possible.</li>
    <li> I had best shaving experience with it. My skin gets super soft after using it. It shaves quite close to the skin. I have used Harry&#x27;s Razor as well. It is much better than it.</li>
