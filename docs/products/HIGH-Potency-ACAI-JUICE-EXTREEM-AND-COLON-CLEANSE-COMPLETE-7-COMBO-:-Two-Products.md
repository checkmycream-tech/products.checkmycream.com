      <li>I got me some love handles baby!</li>
      <li>No change in energy level - my metabolism heats up better on a cup of Market Spice tea!  </li>
      <li>and I can say for sure that these are good quality.  </li>
      <li>My doctor suggested that I take some kind of antixoidants along with drinking more water every day.   </li>
      <li>I love it when I find a nice deal.  </li>
      <li>I am much more \\&quot;regular\\&quot; since I have been taking the Colon cleanse.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>The product was received timely with a personal note expressing the vendor&#x27;s desire to provide excellent customer service.  </li>
      <li>Stay tuned, more reviews to come.</li>
      <li>I think it is an healthy product</li>
      <li>I have even change my dieat and went to the gym more.  </li>
      <li>I am losing weight but more importanly, I am being healty.</li>
      <li>I am losing weight but am even more focused on just eating healthy.   </li>
      <li>now I&#x27;ve doing better without the product then on the product.  </li>
      <li>i received my order on time - the price was right-i am eating better and my tummy seems flatter-only time will tell</li>
      <li>I will give it some more time.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
      <li>I bought 3 more bottles each.  </li>
      <li>The good thing is, I don&#x27;t feel jittery, I don&#x27;t have palpitations, as I am sensitive to any and all stimulants in most dietary supplement products.</li>
      <li>The Acai Juice does just fine all by its self.</li>
      <li>THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MENTION, BECAUSE I AM ALLERGIC TO PSYLLIUM HUSK.</li>
      <li>I thought that I would see a lot more out of this product, but quite frankly, nothing was good about it, except some additional vitamins added to my daily routine.</li>
      <li>I purchased these two products because I thought it would be useful to \\&quot;clean house\\&quot; after many years of refraining to do so.  </li>
      <li>I find that this is more economical and more intense than drinking the juice.  </li>
      <li>I hope to be more aware of what is sent, gracais.</li>
      <li>Want to feel clean?</li>
      <li>I have tried several over the years and this one is as good as the one I used to buy, before it was discontinued by another manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>After a week, I noticed that I felt I had a bit more energy and was a bit more regular which is noticeable when you keep track of these things.  </li>
      <li>I have heard many of the advertisements regarding the health benefits of acai berry juice extracts and also keeping a high amount of fiber in your diet.  </li>
      <li>I understand that buying the freeze dried version of the Acai berry is more potent with better results.</li>
      <li>One point in favor of this combo is that weather it does really work or not, this is the first time after so many years of tryng and failing that I am actually losing weight ( 22 lb in a little bit more than one month ) for good and feeling more energized.</li>
      <li>so it is 4 times more potent than the other Acai products out there.   </li>
      <li>I have followed the directions, and just for good measure cut my calories down to 1200 a day.  </li>
      <li>I was attracted by the price at first because it is a really good deal to get to try two products for so little money.  </li>
      <li>WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>I bought my first bottle to give it a try and nothing I did not even lost 1 pound.  </li>
      <li>More on the Colon Cleanse product later.</li>
      <li>First off, my 3 star rating is for the combo buy.</li>
      <li>I have a good diet and exercise program that I follow everyday</li>
      <li>but if you do not already have the determination to change your lifestyle it wont make any positive difference, so</li>
      <li>So little money for a nice health boost.</li>
      <li>I found that these two products were really gentle on my system.   </li>
      <li>No for real.</li>
      <li>I am very carefuly what I put in my body</li>
      <li>gentle on your system and doesn&#x27;t cause jitters.  </li>
      <li>I have more energy and am feeling healthier with less bloating.   </li>
      <li>Buying these individully would be a lot more expensive if you buy the reputable brands.   </li>
      <li>I take these every day and when I am not eating the best foods (fried foods or fatening foods) then at least the colon cleanse helps keep it from staying in my system too long where my body would aborb extra calories.  </li>
      <li>I get the product I bought, I bought the ACAI JUICE HIGH EXTREEM</li>
      <li>After just a week of taking the AJ every morning alone, WOW!</li>
      <li>It did make me use the bathroom more than usual, but no cleanse came out of it.  </li>
      <li>My wife told me before bed time the other night that my love handles were starting to disappear.</li>
      <li>The first week I tried following the instructions but took the capsules without eating and got a bit of a stomach ache which wasn&#x27;t a problem as I suspected this might be the case.  </li>
      <li>Like I said it is a healthy product, because it has a lot of antioxidant, but it is not a magic formula.</li>
      <li>My energy is actually higher than it has been in a while at this time of the day which is 12:25pm currently.</li>
      <li>and I am starting to feel positive effects.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old and have always had a problem with doing the do, do.  </li>
      <li>And Colon Cleanse COMPLETE # 7 COMBO, and sent me two are in Colon Clease and expiration date 08/2013.</li>
      <li>I tend not to be regular possibly because I take in so much fiber</li>
      <li>The Colon Cleanse is not need to get positive results as far as the cleanse part, for me at least.  </li>

<li> I bought this product because I wanted to have an extra bust of energy since I was already losing weight and exercising; however, it is not the miracle work described in other reviews that I read.</li>

<li> but as a lacto-ovo vegetarian by choice, I am usually prone to assist my system in any way possible in avoiding future problems with intestinal related issues.  </li>

<li> OTHER THEN THAT-</li>
<li> I am always willing to try something that is deemed \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; and have not been disappointed thus far for the price and speedy shipping to my location.  </li>
<li> I would raccomand it to everibody out there that need an extra bust of energy/motivation, but you have to work hard along with taking this product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for 3 months with no success.  </li>
<li> will fall down.</li>
<li> In fact prior to taking the products this morning I was feeling a little tired and sluggish wanting to go take a nap.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t have any negative effects, but no positive ones either.</li>
<li> I must say I was not entirely sure what to expect.</li>
<li> THIS SHOULD REVEAL ALL INGREDIENTS, AND I MEAN ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS.</li>
<li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t rank it lower, is that I think the Colon Cleanse has helped some on getting me \\&quot;regular.\\&quot;</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I took this product to my doctor and he said the colon cleanse was the same as a laxative and the acai juice was just a placebo</li>
    <li> i received my order on time - the price was right-i am eating better and my tummy seems flatter-only time will tell</li>
    <li> Well to start where is all these great reviews coming from?  I&#x27;ve been taking this product for 3 months with no success.  I&#x27;ve read all these great reviews saying they lost all these weights on the product.  I bought my first bottle to give it a try and nothing I did not even lost 1 pound.  I firgured I give it some more time, with all these great reviews I firgured I will give it some more time.  I bought 3 more bottles each.  Three acai and three colon cleanse.  I have not lost anything with this product I think all these great review is probably from the company (fraud).  I have even change my dieat and went to the gym more.  Ever since I have been off the product for about 2 weeks now I&#x27;ve doing better without the product then on the product.  I&#x27;ve actually lost a couple pounds.  Don&#x27;t be scammed!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this this product and took it as directed, and after 3 weeks, I lost no weight, and got bloated and constipated.  I have a good diet and exercise program that I follow everyday so I figured this could only give me the boost I needed.  I had to return the product but had no problem doing that when I called the company.    It may work for some, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased these products and have been taking them for close to 4 weeks.  I must say I was not entirely sure what to expect. Being a fair minded person, I have not notice any substantial weight loss , although I have not gained any either. I am much more \\&quot;regular\\&quot; since I have been taking the Colon cleanse. My energy level has improved however, I did change my diet a few weeks prior to taking this product. I have not decided whether to spend the money on an additional month or not, I want this product to work since I am limited to what I can do as far as physical workout due to my disability, I am not convinced it will start working just because I want it to.    Moester</li>
    <li> This is probably the best deal on Amazon for health products.   Buying these individully would be a lot more expensive if you buy the reputable brands.   I am very carefuly what I put in my body and I can say for sure that these are good quality.  The acai is a 4 to 1 extract so it is 4 times more potent than the other Acai products out there.   It has definitely helped me lose weight.  I travel a lot so I appreciate the extra energy boost but energy has never been a problem for me.  The colon cleanse product is none to glamorous in the sense that what colon cleanse product ever is HOWEVER,  this one works well for me.  I have tried several over the years and this one is as good as the one I used to buy, before it was discontinued by another manufacturer.  So little money for a nice health boost.</li>
    <li> gentle on your system and doesn&#x27;t cause jitters.  I find that this is more economical and more intense than drinking the juice.  Certified it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to have an extra bust of energy since I was already losing weight and exercising; however, it is not the miracle work described in other reviews that I read. I think it is an healthy product but if you do not already have the determination to change your lifestyle it wont make any positive difference, so what I am tryng to say is that yes, I am still losing weight and maybe this product helped me to do so, but do not count only on this if you want to lose weight. Like I said it is a healthy product, because it has a lot of antioxidant, but it is not a magic formula. One point in favor of this combo is that weather it does really work or not, this is the first time after so many years of tryng and failing that I am actually losing weight ( 22 lb in a little bit more than one month ) for good and feeling more energized. I would raccomand it to everibody out there that need an extra bust of energy/motivation, but you have to work hard along with taking this product.</li>
    <li> I have followed the directions, and just for good measure cut my calories down to 1200 a day.  No change in energy level - my metabolism heats up better on a cup of Market Spice tea!  No change in regularity, but then I didn&#x27;t have a problem.  I&#x27;ve lost two lbs in three weeks...from the diet, I&#x27;m sure.  Like they say, it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these two products for about six weeks, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my weight.  At the same time, I also started working out 3-4 times a week.  I thought the combination might help me lose weight faster, but to no avail.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t rank it lower, is that I think the Colon Cleanse has helped some on getting me \\&quot;regular.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> have been takin item as suggested and not seen any difference yet. maybe it just takes time</li>
    <li> I purchased these two products because I thought it would be useful to \\&quot;clean house\\&quot; after many years of refraining to do so.  I have heard many of the advertisements regarding the health benefits of acai berry juice extracts and also keeping a high amount of fiber in your diet.  I was by no means attempting to lose weight (5&#x27;10\\&quot; &amp; 150 lbs.) or anything but as a lacto-ovo vegetarian by choice, I am usually prone to assist my system in any way possible in avoiding future problems with intestinal related issues.  The first week I tried following the instructions but took the capsules without eating and got a bit of a stomach ache which wasn&#x27;t a problem as I suspected this might be the case.  After a week, I noticed that I felt I had a bit more energy and was a bit more regular which is noticeable when you keep track of these things.  I am always willing to try something that is deemed \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; and have not been disappointed thus far for the price and speedy shipping to my location.  As others have stated, there are no miracle drugs and this did what I thought it would do for my system.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love it when I find a nice deal.  These two products are a good buy.  The acai and colon cleanse seem to work well together.   I am losing weight but am even more focused on just eating healthy.   I take these every day and when I am not eating the best foods (fried foods or fatening foods) then at least the colon cleanse helps keep it from staying in my system too long where my body would aborb extra calories.  I am losing weight but more importanly, I am being healty.</li>
    <li> WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT I WAS CAREFUL TO CHECK FOR THE INGREDIENTS, AND DID NOT FIND ANY MENTION OF PSYLLIUM HUSK BEING ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MENTION, BECAUSE I AM ALLERGIC TO PSYLLIUM HUSK. SO, FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO PSYLLIUM HUSK, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I GAVE THIS PRODUCT ONE STAR BECAUSE IT ARRIVED ON TIME, BUT OTHER THEN THAT- NOTHING! INGREDIENTS FOR PRODUCTS LIKE THIS SHOULD REVEAL ALL INGREDIENTS, AND I MEAN ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS.</li>
    <li> I found both products ineffective.  I have been using for 3 weeks with no results.  My appetite was not controlled, no weight loss, and no change in irregularity. I don&#x27;t remember ever trying a product I was more disappointed in.</li>
    <li> I found that these two products were really gentle on my system.   It has increased my regularity and energy as well.  My doctor suggested that I take some kind of antixoidants along with drinking more water every day.   I did some reserach and learned that acai is a proven source for antioxidants so I think this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> First off, my 3 star rating is for the combo buy. The Colon Cleanse is not need to get positive results as far as the cleanse part, for me at least.  The Acai Juice does just fine all by its self. Took the CC for a week with no change in the #2 duties. After just a week of taking the AJ every morning alone, WOW! Now I know what its like to be regular! I&#x27;m 48 years old and have always had a problem with doing the do, do.  After 3 weeks of taking the AJ, same results and now I have to wear a belt or my work pants will fall down. My wife told me before bed time the other night that my love handles were starting to disappear. And let me tell you, I got me some love handles baby! As you can imagine, hearing her say that sounded really good! I understand that buying the freeze dried version of the Acai berry is more potent with better results. I&#x27;ve already ordered a bag of the deep purple powder to sprinkle on my morning yogurt.  Good luck to you and best wishes!</li>
    <li> I was attracted by the price at first because it is a really good deal to get to try two products for so little money.  I was very happy to see that they are working as good as I had hoped.    I have more energy and am feeling healthier with less bloating.   Acai is a great antioxidant so I plan to use it every day.  I have purchased these for my brother and sister as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, who has chronic constipation and he said he was happy so we will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I tried 30 days of these products, but they didn&#x27;t work for me.  I didn&#x27;t have any negative effects, but no positive ones either.</li>
    <li> I get the product I bought, I bought the ACAI JUICE HIGH EXTREEM And Colon Cleanse COMPLETE # 7 COMBO, and sent me two are in Colon Clease and expiration date 08/2013. I hope to be more aware of what is sent, gracais.</li>
    <li> The product was received timely with a personal note expressing the vendor&#x27;s desire to provide excellent customer service.  I have been using the product for about two weeks and I am starting to feel positive effects.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today from LifeSmart. I chose this product based on the reviews here on Amazon. Oh my goodness,  I didn&#x27;t realize until just a minute ago that I feel so wide eyed and bushy tailed. In fact prior to taking the products this morning I was feeling a little tired and sluggish wanting to go take a nap. No for real. This all may be in my head, but I don&#x27;t think so. My energy is actually higher than it has been in a while at this time of the day which is 12:25pm currently. I&#x27;m either looking for coffee or a snack of some sort to give me that mid-day boost. The good thing is, I don&#x27;t feel jittery, I don&#x27;t have palpitations, as I am sensitive to any and all stimulants in most dietary supplement products. This is only the 1st day after one capsule of the Acai Juice Extreme and I am expecting the energy boost to continue. The colon cleanse will take a minute I&#x27;m sure. I tend not to be regular possibly because I take in so much fiber so I need a good cleanse. More on the Colon Cleanse product later. I ordered the 30 day supply of each product just to see if I will like them.  I am impressed with how quickly I received my order and I suspect that I will order from LifeSmart in the future via Amazon.com. Stay tuned, more reviews to come.</li>
    <li> This product is not that great.  It did make me use the bathroom more than usual, but no cleanse came out of it.  I thought that I would see a lot more out of this product, but quite frankly, nothing was good about it, except some additional vitamins added to my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Want to feel clean? Here&#x27;s the product for you.  Great for getting rid of bloating before events. It is not a permanent weight loss solution.</li>
