### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>Removing scrub, my skin looks great!  </li>
      <li>wonderful cleansing cream!</li>
      <li>This is the best of all after I returned to Olay.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly with my skin.</li>
      <li>It works great on my skin (which is oily btw).</li>
      <li>This stuff works great for that.</li>
      <li>Got a great deal and the products came in time.</li>
      <li>and I think the Olay Skin Smoothing Scrub is just as good, and a lot cheaper.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good exfoliator, this is not the product for you</li>
      <li>Although, it doesn&#x27;t do good with fighting acne.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>One word: AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Great item, I use it nightly and a smooth cleanser in the morning.</li>
      <li>do I keep looking younger\\&quot;, which is always nice to hear.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for an exfoliator and love oil of olay products.  </li>
      <li>so I tried many products in protest that were not Olay.</li>
      <li>and i love their creams .</li>
      <li>And with the help of amazon.com - I can afford to splurge to buy more than my budget can allow me.  </li>
      <li>Again, I love it.</li>
      <li>eh, not my favorite.</li>
      <li>SHE USES IT DAILY AND IS VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE AND WILL PURCHASE MORE AS NEEDED.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This worked ok.  </li>
      <li>This product is okay for washing away oil on the face.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>...that this product is no longer available!  </li>
      <li>This is very good for deep cleansing.</li>
      <li>Creme scrub is gentlest but most refreshing mild scrub for my skin.</li>
      <li>I turned to Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub and I love that, works great.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use to have concern with (crow&#x27;s feet, fine lines on my cheeks and forehead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I searched for scrubs that would help with blackheads and fine lines, this came up.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for a product that will smooth out my skin before applying makeup.</li>
      <li>this scrub is much gentler than I would have liked.</li>
      <li>Has a fresh scent which was ok.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy that they are making something so similar again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m all that impressed with the results, however.  </li>
      <li>Does not feel clean after you rinse.  </li>
      <li>I love all of my OLAY products and highly recommend anyone to give it a try!</li>
      <li>my face was cleansed enough after using this, was lacking that fresh sense you get on your skin after a good wash.  </li>
      <li>... it will make fine lines and wrinkles more apparent.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty good, was hoping it was a little bit more abrasive.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 2 years and it never fails to impress me every time I use it!</li>
      <li>The Olay scrubs don&#x27;t dry out my skin, or irritate it either; just keeps it healthy, clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>After a couple months, I just got more blackhead breakouts and since the chemicals in this product seemed to remove any natural moisture my face would have (without a moisturizer)</li>
      <li>This would be one of Olay&#x27;s products that I&#x27;m not crazy about.  </li>
      <li>, it seemed to give a \\&quot;rapid aging\\&quot; affect, and my skin looked old and more wrinkly in areas</li>
      <li>.... but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty mild in my opinion.</li>
      <li>it is a very gentle exfoliator with creamy cleanser that leaves my 52 year old skin smooth and looking like peaches-and-cream!</li>
      <li>This has just the right amount of scrubbing particles.  </li>
      <li>Not that nice, much prefer st. ives or something similar.</li>
      <li>I like that this is a very gentle exfoliating face wash</li>
      <li>Its creamy and makes a good lather on your face with just a little.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It leaves your face smooth, soft and feeling refreshed and it seems to have erased some wrinkles too, with no skin irritation or redness.  </li>
      <li>i am not sure if this is a sexy product, but i know that i love this brand</li>
      <li>It was appealing for the price, and getting two bottles means it&#x27;ll last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>also love that it is offered for Subscribe and Save; this way I can get two tubes, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the local store being out of it when I need it.</li>
      <li>My oily face is clean and soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mild and can be used daily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had problem skin - large pores, breakouts...  </li>
      <li>scrubing for a certain amount of time).</li>
      <li>My skin type is pretty normal.</li>
      <li>The only thing I can say is that maybe over time it may smooth out skin</li>
      <li>I only gave it 4 stars because the product does not have detailed instructions on how to use (ie.</li>
      <li>how good they all are and for the value - I slowly started to order a handful of starter collection kit specifically for my face.  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin super soft and clear.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says, It smooths your skin and makes it soft.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t use it every day but more or less once a week.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to make the skin slightly smoother, but I think more grit might make it work a little better.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and works on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Any blemishes, it feels like it helps with the healing and prevent new ones developing.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Within the first week, my small acne bumps had gone flat and my skin looked more radiant and toned.</li>
      <li>and it is hard for me to find a face wash that can hydrate my skin without making my skin more oily.</li>
      <li>A gentle exfoliating cleanser that I use it daily.  </li>
      <li>Also leaves your skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and really like the way it cleanses my skin.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am afrocaribbean, and it completely refreshes my faces.</li>
      <li>Oddly enough, it seems to wash the face (and any makeup/dirt/residue) off better than Olay&#x27;s foaming cleanser, so I wound up using this everyday and to remove anything else I had put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then I found OLAY products and slowly but surely - it looks like it is working out and balancing my skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although my skin would feel clean, I guess I just don&#x27;t consider this to be much of a \\&quot;scrub\\&quot;, or at least not the scrub I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the only thing I will use on my face, and I have very sensitive</li>
      <li>After I towel dry it, it feels so soft,</li>
      <li>My skin can be typically oily and this really did not help with that.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth after washing unlike other skin cleansers that leave your skin dry and tight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product!  A gentle exfoliating cleanser that I use it daily.  It leaves your face smooth, soft and feeling refreshed and it seems to have erased some wrinkles too, with no skin irritation or redness.  At 67, I could use all the help I can get!  I recommend Olay Skin Smoothing Cream Scrub!  I do like this product.</li>
    <li> .... but it is worth it. I bought this as an alternative to neutrogena, which burns horribly when i use it.&lt;br /&gt;1. it cleanses thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;2. it doesnt burn.&lt;br /&gt;3. it doesnt make me feel as if i was walking through the sahara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am afrocaribbean, and it completely refreshes my faces.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problem skin - large pores, breakouts...  Since I started using the Olay Skin Smoothing Cream Scrub and the Olay Blackhead Removing scrub, my skin looks great!  It&#x27;s softer, smoother and younger looking skin - which I especially appreciate now that I&#x27;m 50.  I&#x27;ve had numerous comments of \\&quot;how do I keep looking younger\\&quot;, which is always nice to hear.  The Olay scrubs don&#x27;t dry out my skin, or irritate it either; just keeps it healthy, clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> Wal-Mart hasn&#x27;t been having these so I went online and ordered some. Got a great deal and the products came in time. It works great on my skin (which is oily btw). Any blemishes, it feels like it helps with the healing and prevent new ones developing. My skin feels smooth after washing unlike other skin cleansers that leave your skin dry and tight. Again, I love it. Works perfectly with my skin. People compliment my skin all the time!</li>
    <li> wonderful cleansing cream!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says, It smooths your skin and makes it soft. Although, it doesn&#x27;t do good with fighting acne.</li>
    <li> One word: AMAZING. Makes my skin super soft and clear. My skin type is pretty normal. Sometimes a little oiley in the summer but it gets dry every now and then in the winter. I have been using this product for 2 years and it never fails to impress me every time I use it!</li>
    <li> This face wash deserves each and every one of those five stars. I have combination acne prone skin and it is hard for me to find a face wash that can hydrate my skin without making my skin more oily. This definetly does the trick, it got rid of my dry patches AND improved my skin texture. It also evened out my red spots due to irratated skin. Within the first week, my small acne bumps had gone flat and my skin looked more radiant and toned. I will use this stuff forever!</li>
    <li> ...that this product is no longer available!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! it is a very gentle exfoliator with creamy cleanser that leaves my 52 year old skin smooth and looking like peaches-and-cream!</li>
    <li> I like the feeling that a face scrub gives me while I wash  This worked ok.  Didn&#x27;t feel like like my face was cleansed enough after using this, was lacking that fresh sense you get on your skin after a good wash.  My skin can be typically oily and this really did not help with that.  I turned to Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub and I love that, works great.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin but this product doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. It&#x27;s pretty heavily scented, which is usually a problem, but it seems to be gentle enough to use regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and really like the way it cleanses my skin.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good, was hoping it was a little bit more abrasive. It does seem to make the skin slightly smoother, but I think more grit might make it work a little better.</li>
    <li> This would be one of Olay&#x27;s products that I&#x27;m not crazy about.  I searched for scrubs that would help with blackheads and fine lines, this came up.  It was appealing for the price, and getting two bottles means it&#x27;ll last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m all that impressed with the results, however.  Oddly enough, it seems to wash the face (and any makeup/dirt/residue) off better than Olay&#x27;s foaming cleanser, so I wound up using this everyday and to remove anything else I had put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overtime, it seemed to stress my skin out and add to the problem it said it resolves.  Especially pay attention to the label- don&#x27;t wash your eye area with this... it will make fine lines and wrinkles more apparent.  After a couple months, I just got more blackhead breakouts and since the chemicals in this product seemed to remove any natural moisture my face would have (without a moisturizer), it seemed to give a \\&quot;rapid aging\\&quot; affect, and my skin looked old and more wrinkly in areas I didn&#x27;t use to have concern with (crow&#x27;s feet, fine lines on my cheeks and forehead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my skin would feel clean, I guess I just don&#x27;t consider this to be much of a \\&quot;scrub\\&quot;, or at least not the scrub I was looking for.  The radience/glowing appearance I get from sugar scrubs or peels is not the result I get with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my skin is too thin/weak/fragile for this product.</li>
    <li> This product is okay for washing away oil on the face. However, the beads are a little scratchy. I may choose another exfoliator with softer beads in the future.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t as functional as the online ads</li>
    <li> Great item, I use it nightly and a smooth cleanser in the morning.</li>
    <li> PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR MY WIFE.  SHE USES IT DAILY AND IS VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE AND WILL PURCHASE MORE AS NEEDED.</li>
    <li> This is very good for deep cleansing. It&#x27;s gentle and works on sensitive skin. I would recommend this for all skin types.</li>
    <li> Not that nice, much prefer st. ives or something similar.</li>
    <li> eh, not my favorite. It&#x27;s pretty mild in my opinion. Not much exfoliation action. If you&#x27;re looking for a good exfoliator, this is not the product for you</li>
    <li> Not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  Off the bat didn&#x27;t like it cause it doesn&#x27;t make any sort of lather at all.  So it just feels like you are smushing cream all over your face.  Does not feel clean after you rinse.  Feels like a residue on your face.  Scrub is not really a scrub at all.  Not exfoliating at all.  Has a fresh scent which was ok.  The only thing I can say is that maybe over time it may smooth out skin a bit cause it has beta-hydroxy acids in it but other than that I don&#x27;t get it.  not for me.</li>
    <li> After reading plenty of reviews about OLAY products  and how good they all are and for the value - I slowly started to order a handful of starter collection kit specifically for my face.  Since I was a kid, I have always suffered from some form of acne, zit and blackheads throughout the year.  My facial zones would be all screwed up because my forehead would be oily but my cheeks would be dry.  Then I found OLAY products and slowly but surely - it looks like it is working out and balancing my skin.  And with the help of amazon.com - I can afford to splurge to buy more than my budget can allow me.  Thank you amazon.com!  I love all of my OLAY products and highly recommend anyone to give it a try!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an exfoliator and love oil of olay products.  this scrub is much gentler than I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a very gentle exfoliating face wash, I don&#x27;t use it every day but more or less once a week.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like others have.</li>
    <li> I tried this product when I ran out of my Mary Kay TimeWise scrub and I think the Olay Skin Smoothing Scrub is just as good, and a lot cheaper. I have used this for over a year now and it&#x27;s the only thing I will use on my face, and I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it is offered for Subscribe and Save; this way I can get two tubes, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the local store being out of it when I need it. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have combination dry and oily skin and this does the trick to moisturize and exfoliate. It also helps remove my blackheads. I only gave it 4 stars because the product does not have detailed instructions on how to use (ie. scrubing for a certain amount of time).</li>
    <li> This has just the right amount of scrubbing particles.  It&#x27;s very mild and can be used daily.  It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> i am not sure if this is a sexy product, but i know that i love this brand and i love their creams .</li>
    <li> Creme scrub is gentlest but most refreshing mild scrub for my skin. Washes away makeup without leaving dry or rough feeling behind.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I was sad when Olay discontinued my face wash that had the witch hazel in it so I tried many products in protest that were not Olay. This is the best of all after I returned to Olay. I am so happy that they are making something so similar again. Thank you Olay. Its creamy and makes a good lather on your face with just a little. I love it. My oily face is clean and soft. After I towel dry it, it feels so soft, like I put face cream on it.</li>
    <li> I have combination of oily and dry skin. I have been looking for a product that will smooth out my skin before applying makeup. This stuff works great for that. Removes dead skin without leaving a nasty residue or a harsh feeling on your skin. Also leaves your skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
