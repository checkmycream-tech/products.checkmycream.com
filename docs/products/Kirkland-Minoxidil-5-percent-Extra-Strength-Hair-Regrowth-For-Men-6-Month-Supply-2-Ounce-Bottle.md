    <li> Very fast an reliable.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as always - it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> After 3 months, now the results are going up so good. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, while not all will see great or any results many due. I have had great results and find Amazon the best place to re-order from.</li>
    <li> with meopause came female baldness - I use the men&#x27;s strength once a day and it does help from loosing hair</li>
    <li> I bought this product after using Rogaine Foam to save money.  B ig mistate!  I have experienced dry patches on my scalp with of course causes unsightly dandruff.  The patches are white and very embarassing.  I have several bottles of this crap left and am going to throw it all out.  I am going back to Rogaine Foam!</li>
    <li> This product really works. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I had been applying this product twice a day. I noticed that my hair seemed to be shedding less and saw little baby hairs up front. The reason I did not give it 4 starts is because it made my hair itchy! Honestly, I could not stop scratching all day long. Another bummer is that it is really greasy. I think that all minoxidol liquids have that repution though, with the exception of the foam. Bottom line is that it DID work for me, but since I was not able to tolerate it, I am now going to purchase the foam and see if that helps.w</li>
    <li> This Product is the same than Rogaine. I have used both of them and got same results on lower costs.</li>
    <li> Good product, came on time</li>
    <li> I have seen no progress at all since using this product 7 to 8 months ago! I will not order this again.</li>
    <li> Hi, I have bought that product from amazon and heve been using it for 5 month ...what can I say: it works indeed !</li>
    <li> Quick correspondence very much,thank you!</li>
    <li> Seems to reduce or slow down hair lost.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.... almost 60 yrs. old, very full head of hair, no crown loss at all...</li>
    <li> It works as long as you keep using it.</li>
    <li> I am back to using this instead of the foam which turns to liquid after just a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> Awful. Causing extreme itching, drying, flaking, dandruff, and A LOT of hair fallout.</li>
    <li> My hair went down the drain.. :(</li>
    <li> Great would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Kirkland Minoxidil is compatible to Rogain. I am very pleased with this product, and it has surpassed my expectations. Once you go Kirkland Minoxidil, you&#x27;ll never go back to Rogain.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> the dropper in box was not sealed in cellophane bag. Called Kirkland. Was told it should have been sealed in cellaphane.Was box tampered &amp; returned after using some &amp; topping off with other oil? I&#x27;never know.</li>
    <li> Sadly it didnt work for me. The liquid was to watery and dried quickly. Save your money to buy rogaine.</li>
    <li> cant beat the price of liquid minox</li>
    <li> exaxtly what i was looking for</li>
    <li> 😍😍😍 perfect n fast shipping</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best!!!! rigth now i get more hair really works!!!!!!</li>
