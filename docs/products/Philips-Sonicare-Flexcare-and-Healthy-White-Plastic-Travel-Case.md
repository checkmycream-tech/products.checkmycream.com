<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not use this one because one came with the toothbrush.  Returning it was simple and easy</li>
    <li> I like that the unit can hold one toothbrush base with two toothbrush heads. However the size of the sonicare toothbrush bases are not necessarily universal, so the case doesn&#x27;t completely close tight.</li>
    <li> My HX6732 Healthy White came with this case. My son has the HX6311 Sonicare for kids brush. His brush fits perfectly in my case, so I will be buying him a case of his own shortly.</li>
    <li> So far this is working out really well for me. A perfect traveling case to be able to keep all of your things together. The holes in the back allow for the brush heads to dry even while packed away which I think is great and it feels sturdy enough. Have yet to try flying with it but looking forward to seeing how it holds up then.</li>
    <li> Travel case is well made and fits my Sonicare very well. Very durable. Will order a second one for my wife.</li>
    <li> Great exactly what I was looking for for my travel toothbrush</li>
    <li> Convenient way to carry my toothbrush and supplies while on vacation</li>
    <li> This case was exactly what I was looking for when I travel. It snaps closed and is hard plastic. I can wash it out and keep it clean so there is no bacteria build up. The holder for the tooth brush and the brush itself are held in place by little brackets so they don&#x27;t move around. I love it! It fits perfectly in to cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> Excellent case very compact &amp; keeps everything organized.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase!!!</li>
    <li> We bought a 2-set Sonicare but it only had 1 charger and 1 case...geez. This is a little pricey but you get what you pay for in terms of quality.</li>
    <li> No matter how I tried set my toothbrush in, it would not fit.  Yes, I know what type TB I have, and no, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Had to return it.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for. I have a Sonicare Healthy White toothbrush and it fits perfect. I like how there&#x27;s two separate slots for brush heads.</li>
    <li> Works well for traveling - everything fits and can continue to use electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great travel case for Sonicare toothbrush.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Does everything I needed it to</li>
    <li> My sonicare doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
    <li> I have purchased this toothbrush for everyone in my household. I loved the way it makes my teeth feel after brushing.  It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Sonicare toothbrush which came with this case. I travel a bit and always bring my electric toothbrush with me. This case is indispensable while traveling. It keeps your toothbrush safe from being crushed. It also contains any water in your toothbrush heads and also keeps the heads from being deformed.</li>
    <li> I thought it would have the case as pictured but it didn&#x27;t, so i bought a case that was available, but not the one for my toothbrush, so i had to taylor it to make it work for me. As allways Amazon helped out getting things resolved. The toothbrush is great best i have ever used.</li>
    <li> The handle and two heads with their brush covers fit.  It doesn&#x27;t rattle around when it&#x27;s closed.  What else do you want from this device?</li>
    <li> This case is simple and effective. It protects my Sonicare brush from whatever environment it happens to be in (backpack, airport suitcase, bathroom cupboard, etc.). The material is sturdy , has a very slick design and cleans easily. Overall, this is a great product. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Finally bought this and don&#x27;t have to stick my toothbrush in a toiletry bag. This keeps all nice and clean knowing that there isn&#x27;t grime on it will traveling. Bought one for my love too!</li>
    <li> The case is just a bit too small and bows out on the bottom end of the toothbrush. Other than that it&#x27;s very nice to have. But to fix it i just adjusted the bottom bracket using a pocket knife, now it works great.</li>
    <li> Not much to say,a Sonicare case just like it says!</li>
    <li> Great product! Very helpful if u travel a lot!! I love it</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! I like it better than Oral B&#x27;s electric toothbrush. My teeth feel cleaner when using the Sonic care.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my need</li>
    <li> Unsatisfactory - toothbrushes &amp; base did not fit in plastic travel case.  Please advise.Lucy Leclair</li>
    <li> This philips electronic toothbrush case fits my toothbrush exactly.  It&#x27;s the exact same make and model of the original case from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have never gotten a Thata Boy boy from a dentist until now. I moved and switched dentists. First visit my gums were bleeding and had other issues. The dentist recommended that I get the cheapest Sonicare ( the more expensive ones aren&#x27;t worth it he said). So i did. I have been using it for a year plus now. Gums don&#x27;t bleed, teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive....love it. Got one for my wife and my mom.</li>
    <li> Simple plastic cover for on the go, please note this is not a charging case. I bought it because I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my hard cover charging case day after day. Easy to clean!</li>
    <li> Perfect case for my healthy white sonicare.  Before I got this I had traveled with my sonicare thinking I had it safety packed in my carry on but it was still damaged.  This case protects it perfectly and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.</li>
    <li> Just right.  Not sure what more to say about it.  I like having a travelling case in which to carry the sonicare.  Believe it or not my dog chewed up my last one. lol.</li>
    <li> I had a case with a broken latch.  When I first purchased the set, I dropped the case with the toothbrush inside the case, breaking the latch.  When I stumbled upon the replacement on Amazon, even though it was pricey​, I purchased it.  Now I have a case and don&#x27;t have to close it with a rubber band.</li>
    <li> Very nice. With only one brush, room for a small tube of toothpaste, too.</li>
    <li> I already had one of these, but wished I had a second as my husband and I seem to be both traveling more often. Very sturdy, and convenient. Holds handle and 2 heads.</li>
    <li> Fits Sonicare brushes perfectly! I lost the travel case that came with my brush long ago, and I purchased this to keep my brush clean while at hotels. It works great!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this brush!!!! My teeth did whiten up quite a bit in the first  3 weeks..... Very pleased</li>
    <li> as advertised, fast ship worked well.</li>
    <li> Feels bulky. Expensive. Should be included with a purchase of any of the Sonicare brushes. Concerned about the longevity of the plastic hinge. It is a toss up between these and a plastic bag. The travel case keeps things neater and I use it frequently, but... I wish it were better and less expensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly as advertised and that can be a pleasant surprise.  I haven&#x27;t seen these in the store and thought it would be a traveling convenience.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent case to carry your Phillips toothbrush. The toothbrush fits perfectly in it and there is room for a small tube of toothpaste. I always use it when I travel and keep it in my carry on bag in case I need to brush my teeth after a meal. It is designed very well and shows where each component goes and which way it should be put in so you can easily close the case when you are done using the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> holds heads really well. Main unit moves around a bit.  Threw in some small bubble wrap to tighten things up</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the Healthywhite CAME with a case, so I ordered this unnecessarily. I&#x27;ll hang onto it in case the original gets a crack in it or something....</li>
    <li> So much better than a plastic bag.  Even fits another toothbrush, if you have a spouse that doesn&#x27;t use the Sonicare.  Fits my model number HX6530 just fine.</li>
    <li> As always - a great product!  Philips makes the best toothbrush on the market.  The carrying case is great for travel or just storage in the bathroom!</li>
    <li> Been looking for a travel case for my electric oral b toothbrush and couldn&#x27;t find anything that fit. Saw this Phillips Sonicare case and it fits perfectly. No more putting the toothbrush in a baggie to travel. Love it!</li>
    <li> It fit perfectly in the case</li>
    <li> been using it for three weeks and I do know I will never go back to anything else! I am so happy to get it recommended, and thanks to the fast delivery I am now &amp;#34;on another level of quality&amp;#34; in brushing my teeth</li>
    <li> The product was delivered right away after I ordered it. The case looks great and I found that my toothbrush fits very well in it.</li>
    <li> Have not use it for travel yet.  It is fairly study but light weight.  This is a consideration with todays weight limits on airlines..  The Sonicare fits well inside.  It will fit in my cosmetic bag also which is also in its favor.</li>
    <li> If you have a Sonicare toothbrush, you&#x27;re going to need one of these cases to take it with you on the road, for overnights, etc.  I wish that it had bigger holes so that it would more thoroughly dry out between uses, and I&#x27;d love it if there were space inside for a tube of toothpast...but these are relatively small issues for me, on the whole.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to tell you how I used to travel with my sonicare, but let&#x27;s just say that my bristles would be smooshed to the side and at times I would have to search for my cover. Not anymore! This case is great and can hold 2 brushes. No more smooshed bristles and I always know where my cap is.</li>
    <li> I bought this, used it for a few days, it vibrated my fillings loose and loosened a crown and other dental work, and I returned it.  The sonic vibration sounded like such a good idea to loosen placque, but it is just too agress and it even made the roots of my teeth ache, so I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered an Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush and works very, very well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling so that my toothbrush heads do not get destroyed or dirty. No more plastic bags!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash out and clean as well.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! My teeth have never felt cleaner or fresher. I wish I had bought one of these sooner!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush lasted less than a year--very disappointed and to trouble shoot the mechanical issues with it was also impossible.&lt;br /&gt;So it is now in the garbage...&lt;br /&gt;Not purchasing another one as this is my second one I have owned.</li>
    <li> Tight fit, but it all does go in. Pretty pricy, but it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s available to take on trips.</li>
    <li> Already tried it on a trip, my wife loved it.</li>
    <li> I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes line...it&#x27;s that simple!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and protects my toothbrush and brush heads. Wish I would have bought it sooner as it could have saved me some headaches.</li>
    <li> I WOULD like this product if it actually fit my sonicare essence toothbrush. Bought it thinking it would fit since the reviews said it would but it doesn&#x27;t. Will have to unfortunately return it.</li>
    <li> A complete necessity for traveling with the sonicare toothbrush.  The second space for an extra toothbrush head I find unnecessary, but it fits a travel sized toothpaste so I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice my toothbrush comes with one.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is going to charge me $5 to return, so better keep it.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare plastic travel case was exactly what I ordered and it came quickly...thanks!  So glad I didn&#x27;t have to order through a dentist!</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described.  Fits the electronic brush base perfectly with two spaces for brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought a Sonicare about 12 years ago, and have just had to replace it with this one.  I hope this one lasts 12 years also.</li>
    <li> Traveling with our Sonicare without a travel case is what damaged our first model.  This lightweight travel case compactly stores our handle and brushes allowing us to throw it in our toiletry bag without taking up a lot of room and no threat of being bent.</li>
    <li> I travel with my Soniccare frequently (in fact, frequently enough where I purchased two, one for use at home and one for use on the road).  This case has been invaluable.  It gets thrown around in my luggage and still looks brand new after 6+ months of usage.  I saw a few complaints about the latch, and that was probably my first concern when it arrived.  It does seem robust and I&#x27;m definitely not the kind of person that is always \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; with everything I travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Not much to say. It is well designed and works great. For longer trips with two people using the handle, it might be nice to have a place to put the charger as well.</li>
    <li> This case is perfect for my toothbrush.  I have the healthy white brush and as anyone that owns one knows they are not cheap.  It doesn&#x27;t move around in the case and everything including the brushes has a place and is protected. I keep the brush in the case at home as well as when I travel.  This is a perfect idea!!</li>
    <li> Yes, indeed, this will work perfect for my brushes and my tooth tool.  Keeps it safe, clean and was a lovely price too!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and needed. Really happy I purchased it. I&#x27;ve used it several times already and it&#x27;s been perfect for my sonicare healthy white toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Does what it is designed to do, holds the electric toothbrush and two heads and is compact enough for packing in luggage or carry on.</li>
    <li> Nice case, I use it every day so we shall see how long it holds up.</li>
    <li> It fit, does the job well but the plastic is really cheap and flimsy. I&#x27;m not sure how long will it last.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other 5 star reviewers were thinking, but this is in no way worth $16. It&#x27;s a hard plastic case designed to fit all the parts of a Sonicare toothbrush.  Okay, that&#x27;s great. HOWEVER, the hinge is so obviously going to break after a few months of regular use, I foresee myself keeping this thing closed with a rubber band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> I had spent some time searching for the exact case I wanted. After finding this, I&#x27;m still not sure why it was hard to find. This case is perfect for traveling. This beats having the toothbrush head become twisted and gross. Has capacity for two toothbrush heads and the full toothbrush handle. There is no spot for the wall charger part of my pro results Sonicare toothbrush. That will just have to stay in the toiletries bag. Also, it is a genuine Phillips product that is designed specifically for the toothbrush. At first, I was unsure that everything was going to fit, then just realized how tight of a fit it was because it was specifically for it.</li>
    <li> I can now safely pack my toothbrush in my luggage without worrying about it accidentally turning on. Works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit Sonicare 2 brush handle&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness the seller did not say that it would fit the Sonicare 2 but since since someone posted that all Sonicare handles are the same dimensions I thought it would work.&lt;br /&gt;Instead you have to really lean on the case to latch it and even then the bottom of the case still has a bit of a gap that allows things into the case, so really not that effective for tossing in my suitcase or purse.</li>
    <li> too small for my sonicare, although it was indicated that it fits my model</li>
    <li> i made the mistake of putting my sonicare inside a bag and it got damaged when handled in baggage claim.  so now the sonicare doesnt provide the same level of vibration.  i bought a new sonicare and always use the travel cAse now to protect it...</li>
    <li> I am on a trip right now and it is nice to have my toothbrush with me.</li>
    <li> The travel case makes it easy to stow your Sonicare in your bag</li>
    <li> I bought this because my toothbrush came with a soft travel cover, and the hard cover protects my toothbrush when I travel.</li>
    <li> Very good for camping</li>
    <li> Got a new Soniccare easy clean brush and needed something to carry it when I travel.  This fits the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> After having my Sonicare brush tumble out of a cabinet in our camper and break, this is a great protective device for traveling. No worries about breaking the tooth brush from falls or baggage handlers.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says it is.... fits my Sonicare perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a travel case for my toothbrush and this is perfect!  The handle and heads fit in perfectly and the case closes tight.  I like that the case is plastic so it can be kept clean.</li>
    <li> I love how this case holds the wand and the brush neatly!  It makes travel with it so easy and will make it hard for me to forget it.</li>
    <li> Original case. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The case does its job well. It easily stores the toothbrush along with two separate heads. Ive used on several different trips and have had zero issues. I can recommend this product for anyone needing a travel case for their Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, seems durable so far, protects the power from turning on accidentally, and the lozenge shape slips easily into any odd spot in my luggage.  A great addition to a wonderful toothbrush.</li>
    <li> A must buy with the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t snap closed well, easily attracts dirt and grime just in the bottom of a purse.</li>
    <li> I am now on my second travel case.  I travel for work at least 40 times per year for work and having my Sonicare with me is a luxury that really makes a difference.  Not only does this hold the toothbrush very securely but it holds two heads as well.  The only reason this is not a full 5/5 is because my first one broke.  The seam that holds the two sides together split down the middle.</li>
    <li> A little bulkier than expected but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Just like the picture shown.  Fast delivery and reasonable price. My son love the product.  Just in time for him to bring it to college.</li>
    <li> Nothing worth writing..good for travel to protect brush. White, plastic, fine. Give me a break nothing else to say about this!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I did  not read this as carefully as I should have and ended up with a plastic box for the price indicated.  I wanted to return it but, having to pay return postage, the cheapest way (UPS) was $14 so what a waste.  Next time I will read more carefully.</li>
    <li> I had been leaving my Sonicare at home on trips.  This makes it easy to stow in luggage and not worry about it breaking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two soft cases for my Sonicare toothbrush -the second because the first had gotten so ratty looking after several washes, I had to purchase another one.  This plastic case has solved the problem because it&#x27;s hard and can be cleaned easily.  I also like that I can store an extra brush inside.  At first I thought it may be bulky but it&#x27;s surprisingly not -fits right in my travel kit with ease.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one for some time. Bought one for my parents</li>
    <li> Does a great job and is very portable. Also, do not have to take charger for trips of a week or more.</li>
    <li> Overall a very good toothbrush. My teeth definitely feel clean after brushing. But it takes a little practice to get to the setting that you want while it&#x27;s in your mouth and that&#x27;s the only way to set it.</li>
    <li> I have the Sonicare EasyClean HX6511/50, but the description says it fits the Flexcare and Healthy White.  I called Sonicare, and they said each of these models is the same length.  My EasyClean will fit, although it moves around a little bit.  The latch on the case is just OK.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the case although wish they made one specifically for the EasyClean that was available for purchase separately (not bundled with the toothbrush).</li>
    <li> I wanted to tell everyone who reads these reviews that there is a small difference between the Healthy White travel case and the Flexcare travel case. If you go to the Philips&#x27;s website for buying parts, you will see there are two different hard plastic travel cases, one for the Health White and one for the Flexcare. They have different part numbers. I called Philips Sonicare to confirm this and they told me there is one hard plastic travel case for Healthy White model and another hard plastic travel case for the Flexcare.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after I bought a new sonicare and it did not come with a travel case. This case is so much better than the old sonicare travelcase and carries two heads as well.</li>
    <li> great item for travel</li>
    <li> Ordered, but returned. Nothing wrong. I just duplicated the order...nice case.</li>
    <li> For a frequent traveler who checks in luggage, it is a good thing to protect Sonicare tooth brush. I lost quite a few of  them due to rough handling of check in baggage.</li>
    <li> good case for traveling with.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I need.  When I moved from Las Vegas to Florida my Sonicare broke where the brush head attaches to.  Thank God Sonicare replaced it for free but I didnt want to go through that headache again and this case is exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Fits my toothbrush just fine. It is puzzling that these are so hard to find in stores. Decent price on Amazon though I wish I could have paid less. I got tired of carrying my $200 toothbrush in a ziploc baggy or in my toiletries case. I didn&#x27;t want it to break and this case protects it and it&#x27;s heads well.</li>
    <li> After buying a new sonicare I needed a new case. I am very happy with the case.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Tight fit, but it all does go in. Pretty pricy, but it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s available to take on trips.</li>
    <li> Living in a tent in the desert you dont want to leave you Sonicare out. Very convinient for transporting to restroom or to work and stores two heads. Love the product however when you see it you feel like it is way too over priced wouldve gave it 5 stars if it had been about $5 less.</li>
    <li> If you own a Phillips Sonicare and travel a lot, or even a little, this is a must have item for your toiletry kit.  I have had several Sonicares destroyed by baggage handlers.  This item fits the unit like a glove and protects it well.</li>
    <li> this was pushed as a bundle add-on.  it is a rip-off as the brush comes with one anyway and this one is not needed.</li>
    <li> This case holds my Sonicare Healthy White toothbrush and brush heads perfectly, and has holes to allow moisture to evaporate.  However, it should be included with the toothbrush in my opinion (and the price is a bit steep for a bit of molded plastic if you ask me).</li>
    <li> I returned it.  One came with the brush I ordered</li>
    <li> After breaking my sonicare toothbrush several times trying to travel with it, I purchased this travel case.  Now I know it&#x27;s tucked away securely in a sturdy case and I can take it anywhere without worry!  I should have bought it sooner!</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and as described. toothbrush parts fit safely &amp; securely so you don&#x27;t have to worry about anything breaking.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare Flexcare &amp; Healthy White Plastic Travel Case  Well worth the money to protect my toothbrush when travelling, which is why I bought this toothbrush and case in the first place, it is dual voltage.</li>
    <li> I was travelling with my machine in a baggie with the brushes. I finally ordered this case and I love it. It&#x27;s plenty large enough for the handle and two brushes but doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in the luggage. The charger travels separately.</li>
    <li> Very nice for traveling.  Holds two brushes and base or one brush and small tube of paste.  Yes I would recommend.</li>
    <li> If you travel, you should have this case. I love how it holds both my kids&#x27; brushes in a handy case.</li>
    <li> Great case, works well. Purchased from Genuine OEM Parts, an Amazon seller. This is the real deal, if you want the genuine case.</li>
    <li> It protects my electric toothbrush and even has room for the wife&#x27;s brush head, so we don&#x27;t need two cases.</li>
    <li> This hard case is a great improvement over the soft case I was previously using. It is more bulky though, so if space is a concern this may not be the right case for you.</li>
    <li> So far very happy very good good quality .I just to wait a little longer to see some results about whitening ny teeth</li>
    <li> Much lighter and a bit smaller than earlier versions. I really appreciate no longer having to wrap-up my brush in tissue anymore! Easy to pack. You will appreciate it!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and protects my toothbrush and brush heads. Wish I would have bought it sooner as it could have saved me some headaches.</li>
    <li> I love the case.  It will be going with me on my next trip.</li>
    <li> The Philips Plastic Travel Case for its Sonicare Flexcare &amp; Healthy White toothbrush is terrific for traveling, especially when it is packed in a carry-on with a lot of other stuff.  Very protective of the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as shown.  The sonicare toothbrush (once unassembled), fits comfortable into container and makes it easy for travel.  I&#x27;m hoping the plastic hinging lasts - it feels thin.</li>
    <li> Loved it, Matt as an older man.</li>
    <li> Great case for travels</li>
    <li> Good to keep easy clean but a little bit bigger and the quality is not as good like the diamond clean</li>
    <li> Works well and is very portable. I had one before but lost  it. It keeps my brush clean and safe.</li>
    <li> Fits my sonicare tooth brush and 2 head perfectly</li>
    <li> This is a slightly flimsy but practical case. It is odd that there is no space for a charger nor toothpaste, but two heads and the machine are fine. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last. I have only used it for one trip so far.</li>
    <li> As described - thank you!</li>
    <li> After just a few weeks of using it, my semi-annual dental check-up proved my teeth were definitely cleaner - less plaque- than usual.</li>
    <li> This is great for travel and keeps everything together and clean.  Kind of pricey for what it actually is (a plastic box), but works perfectly.</li>
    <li> although I wish there was a model that actually allowed you to keep the brush heads in place, this was really the only one I could find on the market at a decent price. Plus it was cheaper that the fabric velcro one I found on line that doesnt really have room for extra brrushes. Have traveled 3x so far and its held its place in extremely packed suitcase. Recommend this for travelors with the philips sonicare tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t quite close with the HX6211/30 2 Series handle, but it will latch.  It just bulges a little bit from the base.  It wasn&#x27;t advertised as working with this model, so I&#x27;m not complaining.  It is still a functional travel case.  Seems a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Love this travel case for my sonicare toothbrush.  It origionally came with a soft case, but would accidentally turn on when i traveled.  With this hard case I no longer have that issue and feel like it is much more protected.</li>
    <li> My sonicare was constantly turning on in my luggage when it was pressed against other items.  This case is perfect and keeps it safe!</li>
    <li> it works, i have a few, but we never use them when we travel.</li>
    <li> This is vast improvement over the big blue model designed for the larger/older series of Sonicare brush. It efficiently stores the motor and two brushes with plenty of venting to allow drying.  It&#x27;s very compact and high quality with a snap-on lock.  This is pretty much essential for your Sonicare Flexcare or Healthywhite brush.</li>
    <li> I now don&#x27;t have to worry that when I fly the tsa people are not fingering my toothbrush.  I also don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting broken. I hated to pay 20.00 but I wanted it. Not sure why they don&#x27;t include the case when you buy the toothbrush as i paid enough money for  the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Bought 7 months ago.  Working well and the teeth feel real clean and smooth!</li>
    <li> Tooth brush and brush fit perfectly in case and kept it clean and dry. Loved it!</li>
    <li> I like this item. I like it better than my soft carry case. The problem with my soft case was the ON button on the toothbrush always seemed to get pressed when I put it in the bag with all the other toiletries. This on prevents accidental running of the toothbrush. It stays closed, has small vent holes on back; though these won&#x27;t allow it to dry out in tropical climates so watch for possible mould growth. I can even fit my small tongue scraper and my flossing wand in there!</li>
    <li> Bought this to go with the Sonicare toothbrush that I bought a family member for a gift. Perfect fit! He loves his toothbrush and travel case!</li>
    <li> I do not like this product.  I bought it to carry my Sonicare and it did fit.  The case takes up too much room in the suitcase.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This item is shown with the toothbrush and I fully expected that the whole item be delivered.  As it is, my son for his birthday has received an EMPTY CASE.  This is not on!</li>
    <li> Basic cheap plastic case...that&#x27;s it.  Too much money for this case. Should be about $5.00&lt;br /&gt;Seems To fit everything, but I feel like I got screwed on this one.</li>
    <li> Perfectly simple case for use when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rear is vented, allowing for airflow to combat any remaining moisture in your brush, though I would always recommend drying the brush before casing.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, simply rinse under the hot water tap and dry thoroughly; my case still looks brand new after three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snap closure is solid, and does not feel as it would open inadvertently in one&#x27;s luggage. An excellent product in my submission.</li>
    <li> Great for both travel and keep my toothbrush sanitary.  It is kind of expensive for a plastic case, so I took off 1 star.</li>
    <li> It may sound a bit crazy to pay $20 for a basic plastic case for a toothbrush.  However, when the toothbrush is worth a $100 and the tips for the toothbrush cost $5 a pop and you travel as much as I do this case is well worth it.  It even has ventilation holes to allow the moisture to escape.</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth the best of anything.&lt;br /&gt;I brush my teeth manually and use this toothbrush both on most days</li>
    <li> The sensitive setting allows me to massage my gums,and allows me to clean better. The plastic carrying case is great for travel.</li>
