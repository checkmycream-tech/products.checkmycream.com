      <li>love this product; so much volumn</li>
      <li>It works beautifully with all the other products I like to use!  </li>
      <li>A quick way to give your hair a boost when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full style.</li>
      <li>After using Hair One Cleansing Conditioner (I try to never use shampoo), rinsing and squeezing dry with a micro-fiber towel, I used Smooth &#x27;N Shine Curl Activator Gel (the best curling get out there, imo) and diffused &#x27;til dry.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several years now and love it!</li>
      <li>Live in rural Oklahoma and no stores carry it so am happy to find it at this price.</li>
      <li>My experience has been that it performs EXACTLY as advertised and does exactly what it was designed to do!</li>
      <li>I love this product the only problem I have is after I made my order</li>
      <li>It never fails me.</li>
      <li>As for difficulty finding it, I found it here at Amazon and that works for me, I don&#x27;t always need to be able to find a product in my local store.  </li>
      <li>I have used it since it was first introduced on HSN some years ago.</li>
      <li>After a long wait for the product to arrive, it turned out to be fault of USPS&#x27; filings of a change of address--wife is completely satisfied with the Samy aerosol</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly but has several different textures, some parts curl great and others not so much.  </li>
      <li>If you pull your hair on top and roll with large rollers, you get loose, beachy waves.  </li>
      <li>My favorite use is to use it before bed and roll my hair loosely on those bendy rollers.  </li>
      <li>and I wear it curly, straight and wavy, depending on the season and occasion.  </li>
      <li>Very versatile product.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t get too much of that</li>
      <li>It REALLY works as stated...</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Thanks so much for your fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Did not really give much volume, and did not style as easy as shown on TV.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend Sammy&amp;#34;s Icing.  </li>
      <li>I love the way I can get the messy up hair style that I like.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is such a fun product.  </li>
      <li>Initially, I paid over $20 per 8 oz can for this, and STILL felt it was worth it.</li>
      <li>The price right now is only $6 for 8 oz.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to give volume and moisture to very thin hair.  </li>
      <li>works great, only takes a small amount for short hair</li>
      <li>This is another product that my wife says she cannot live without.</li>
      <li>It gives a nice soft fullness that isn&#x27;t sticky or hard.</li>
      <li>, it  is a boon for the busy woman, or man if he chooses.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use on wet or dry hair.  </li>
      <li>Need to really rub into your dry hair.</li>
      <li>Have short, naturally curly hair and like it &amp;#34;messed up&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>If you have short to medium hair, especially, if it&#x27;s thinning or limp, Icing will do the trick, but it&#x27;s important to use it properly.  </li>

<li> I wear my hair both long and short</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t bother with this unless you want sticky hair that is flat.  </li>
<li> In the morning you simply remove the rollers with no discomfort from sleeping with wet hair.  </li>
<li> but it makes my hair crunchy and flat and doesn&#x27;t give any life to my hair like the other product.</li>

<li> Use on dry hair and works like a dream!  </li>

<li> I discovered that on sundances site there was other spot that said if I bought 6 cans I could ha gotten cheaper</li>
<li> Not sticky or heavy in dry or humid weaher.</li>
<li> but they make your hair feel greasy and end of making my hair looked weighed down.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had flat thin hair,  I&#x27;ve tried other products</li>
<li> Normally, when the container is shaken, the product spray comes out foamy and icy cold.  </li>

<li> A little goes along way.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what to say if you have flat, thin hair and want to build volume,</li>
<li> makes my hair too stiff.</li>
<li> When I got my box it was very plain to see that they opened it and took one out.</li>
<li> the results on my hair are not good.</li>
<li> I have thin strands but lots of it</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this again, and was a little disappointed.</li>
<li> It works and does not leave your hair with a dirty hair feel so it does work.</li>
<li> I am crazy about Samy</li>
<li> The fragrance is terrible.</li>

    <li> This is a great product to give volume and moisture to very thin hair.  I love it and was happy to see that I could order through Amazon since my locals stores discontinued it.  I have used this product for years.</li>
    <li> Works well on short hair!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It was delivered as promised, right on time! Good seller, good product.</li>
    <li> This product did not perform as well as it was advertised.  Did not really give much volume, and did not style as easy as shown on TV.  I have short curly hair it&#x27;s a no brainer, I get just as good if not better results  with other products.  I like the ease of keeping my hair short, but wanted the volume this product was touting.  Didn&#x27;t get too much of that either.[[ASIN:B001F38ZVC Samy Icing - 8 oz.]]</li>
    <li> I am crazy about Samy Icing Instant Re-Styler! I have used it since it was first introduced on HSN some years ago. My experience has been that it performs EXACTLY as advertised and does exactly what it was designed to do! I love it! Initially, I paid over $20 per 8 oz can for this, and STILL felt it was worth it. So this is a very good buy. I could NOT do without this product! If you have short to medium hair, especially, if it&#x27;s thinning or limp, Icing will do the trick, but it&#x27;s important to use it properly.  Hope you are as pleased with this product as I have been!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know this product existed until it was given to me by a friend.  I love it!  I wear my hair both long and short and I wear it curly, straight and wavy, depending on the season and occasion.  My hair is naturally curly but has several different textures, some parts curl great and others not so much.  I have thin strands but lots of it so volume isn&#x27;t an issue.  After using Hair One Cleansing Conditioner (I try to never use shampoo), rinsing and squeezing dry with a micro-fiber towel, I used Smooth &#x27;N Shine Curl Activator Gel (the best curling get out there, imo) and diffused &#x27;til dry.  The parts that wouldn&#x27;t curl the way I wanted needed a bit of help and my hair was a bit fuzzy too.  I used this product on the spot that wouldn&#x27;t curl and scrunched and used my blow dryer w/diffuser on low/cool and the hair responded beautifully!  It curled up nicely and held.  I also used this in the fuzzy spots and it tamed them as well.  Anytime I have a trouble spot, this product works great!  It works beautifully with all the other products I like to use!  I had some Silk Therapy in my hair, which gives shine and smooths frizzies but can hinder the curl.  This product still worked great!  The price right now is only $6 for 8 oz. so that&#x27;s awesome too!  As for difficulty finding it, I found it here at Amazon and that works for me, I don&#x27;t always need to be able to find a product in my local store.  If I love it, I&#x27;ll gladly order it.  Overall, this product is really great!  You can perk up and repair your hair on the go, no tools required!  I don&#x27;t know what to say if you have flat, thin hair and want to build volume, since I don&#x27;t have that problem, I can&#x27;t say if the product will help.  If you want the benefits I have mentioned, I recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It makes your hair fuller and just easier to style.  I can use it when I blow out my hair or it helps when I scrunch it to make waves.  Very versatile product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this again, and was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> works great, only takes a small amount for short hair</li>
    <li> I love this product the only problem I have is after I made my order I discovered that on sundances site there was other spot that said if I bought 6 cans I could ha gotten cheaper I think sun dance or Amazon should have let me know this because I bought 5 cans  and paid  over &amp;79 dollars and I could have gotten 6 cans for alittle over 76 dollars. When I got my box it was very plain to see that they opened it and took one out. I feel like I was taken advantage of. Because I would be ordering this product again. Because the product a great</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product.  I solves that last minute need to be well coiffed problem.  Style and Go, it  is a boon for the busy woman, or man if he chooses.  It gives the appearance of a fuller head of hair. A bargain at any price.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with thin hair who wants volume and managability.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product I ordered 2 bottles!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU Amazon and Sundance Beauty Supply!</li>
    <li> I had used it in the past and was very upset that I could no longer find it in the stores.  So once I found it I was happy once again.&lt;br /&gt;It is just the product that I need to keep my short hair in place.  I love the way I can get the messy up hair style that I like.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for your fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It makes styling a breeze and adds shine and luster to my white hair. Live in rural Oklahoma and no stores carry it so am happy to find it at this price.</li>
    <li> This is such a fun product.  It REALLY works as stated...its a Re-styler!  My favorite use is to use it before bed and roll my hair loosely on those bendy rollers.  If you pull your hair on top and roll with large rollers, you get loose, beachy waves.  If you hold your hair at 90 degree angles all over with medium rollers, you get loose spirals.  Works with pin curls too.  In the morning you simply remove the rollers with no discomfort from sleeping with wet hair.  It creates style that lasts all day.  I wish this product was available by Prime.  The shipping is a bummer, but they no longer carry it in my small-town drug store and I&#x27;ve decided its a MUST-have!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend Sammy&amp;#34;s Icing.  Easy to use on wet or dry hair.  Great for a style refresh.  Not sticky or heavy in dry or humid weaher.</li>
    <li> To me it is the best re-styler on the market. It never fails me. Hope you continue to carry it since it is not in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Best product for thin fine hair!! It adds a lot of body.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years, couldn&#x27;t do without it.  Lots of styling, body and hold</li>
    <li> Product lives up to expectations.  However, I did Not receive the free gift that was to accompany it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this company&#x27;s other product Dry Icing putty/paste. I love it, but couldn&#x27;t find it.  Thought I&#x27;d try this instead but it makes my hair crunchy and flat and doesn&#x27;t give any life to my hair like the other product. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Great Product that works especially well for thinning hair.  I got it first as a sample somewhere and found it to be excellent.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores but did find it on Amazon and it arrived promptly and intact.  Definately something I will buy again.</li>
    <li> love this product; so much volumn</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this unless you want sticky hair that is flat.  The fragrance is terrible. It along with the dry icing jar is a big waste of money and didn&#x27;t give the desired results.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Use on dry hair and works like a dream!  Have short, naturally curly hair and like it &amp;#34;messed up&amp;#34;.  It even straightens it enough to hold.</li>
    <li> makes my hair too stiff.</li>
    <li> Works good on curly hair. Need to really rub into your dry hair. A little goes along way.</li>
    <li> A quick way to give your hair a boost when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full style. I have been using this product for several years now and love it!</li>
    <li> This is another product that my wife says she cannot live without. It makes her happy, so we&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
