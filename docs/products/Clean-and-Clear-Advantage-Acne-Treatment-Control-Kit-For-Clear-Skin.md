<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I washed my face and moisturized  everyday and it help deminish acne. But not dark spots</li>
    <li> I did see some changes after two weeks!</li>
    <li> I have mild acne and I tried this product for only a couple days and I had severe itchy red rings around my eyes</li>
    <li> I have Perioral Dermatitis and hoped that this would clear it coupled with my acne. As I continued to use this it not only made my skin feel greasy but made my acne and my condition worse. I really feel mixing the two chemicals is too much for my sensitive skin. Worst product I&#x27;ve ever used. I have heard using a benzoyl peroxide cleanser and light moisturizer is better.</li>
    <li> I think it made me breakout even worse. Also, the cleaner dries your face to the point it hurts. This product does not work at all!</li>
    <li> I have tried this product and I have to say it did not work for me in fact my face starts to get itchy. take my advice and search for (Aztec Secrets, Bentonite Clay)</li>
    <li> it works,but does not clear my face absolutely.maybe because i am asian</li>
    <li> Okay, i can say one thing. Clean and clear has good and bad products, you get what you get for $10 so please don&#x27;t expect much because this did not do much on my face at all, and ive been using it for a couple weeks now.</li>
    <li> I am 14 years old and i had bad acne on my forehead,nose,and chin. I started looking online and found this product.Everyone has different skin so sometimes the products that you buy may not work. Well i needed to loose my acne fast because im gonna be a freshman in high school. i would definately recommend this product to any of my friends and family. One thing you should know is that it does have a kinda of burning sensation to it after you use everything. It also doesnt work after one use that is totally bull crap but it DOES work after a few uses. One more thing i would say is to use it once a day for about a week and see how that goes then i use it twice a day. :) GREAT PRODUCT AND VERY FAST SHIPPING :)</li>
    <li> I love this product! Honestly, I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv and a lot of the other \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; acne control products out there and this is hands-down the best one I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I would definitely give this a try if you&#x27;re on the fence about it.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the best thing about this system is the price here on Amazon!  It&#x27;s 2/3 the price here online than it is in the big name pharmacies like CVS, Walgreens, DR and Rite Aid.  Throw in an even lower price if you subscribe and pay automatically and this is an amazing deal!</li>
    <li> My daughter has sensitive skin that dries out easily but is prone to breakouts on her forehead and nose area.  This is by far the best face wash we have found.  Due to her skin sensitivity she only uses the wash and not the lotion, otherwise she will have super dry skin that turns red.  This face wash clears up her skin within two days and we no longer have to have the doctor prescribe her medicine.  If you purchase from a local Wal-Mart or Target, it can cost $15 to $20 which I hated paying since she does not use the whole kit.  We tried different face washes over summer hoping for the same results without paying the price but her face started breaking out again.  I was so excited when I found it through Amazon for a great price!! Now we have it ordered through the auto ship and it&#x27;s under $11 with free shipping and comes to our door every 3 months!!! Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter said, no changes on her Acne after two weeks of usage. She made the choice to buy based on the package information.</li>
    <li> Grand daughter loves it and says it is doing as good as her friends using Pro Active which is considerably more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the subscription for it reduces the cost even further and is a good option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grand daughter recommends it heartily!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son, and he got very clear effect right after the first use and the results are sustainable if used regularly</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with a recommendation from my dermatologist.  So far its worked amazingly!! As the packaging states within 24 hours I saw an amazing improvement in my face.  I have adult onset acne, and this product works awesome at tackling it before it becomes something worse.  My one complaint, the face wash itself seems a little harsh.  So if you have sensitive skin, as I do, I would use sparingly.  I use on an every other to every third day basis and have seen GREAT improvements!!!&lt;br /&gt;For the price, ease of use, and RESULTS, this product can&#x27;t be beat!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive/oil skin and sometimes drying. This kit is ok because it won&#x27;t dry your skin like Proactiv, but it wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my skin.</li>
    <li> Clean and Clear works wonders for my face. I am an African American women that suffers from dark spots after my break outs. After using this product for a month I can defintely say I have seen improvement my dark spots are fading and now I am less reliant on make-up. I would recommdend this product. I gave it four not five stars because it didnt work as fast as i would like and they dont have something that exfoliates the skin in the kit,  but none the less this product is worth giving a try.</li>
    <li> Okay so this is not the product for me. When I wash my face at night and moisturize is and use the spot treatment, I wake up with RED, ITCHY and SWOLLEN parts of my face. That was the first night i used it. I decided to skip a day. The second use I woke up with RED, ITCHY and SWOLLEN parts of my face, and not only that...my face started to flake and so I&#x27;m guessing the product is burning my face. I mean when i use it to wash, it feels good. Has a nice cooling sensation. Moisturizer works well and smells nice. The spot treatment ive used alone before and it worked well (okay-ish) Smells nice. but could possibly make your skin red, itchy and swollen and you could possibly get burn. Try at your own risk!</li>
    <li> While the product did help with my acne, which was mild, it definitely dried out my face and primarily around the eyebrow area (got those nasty little flakes that resemble dandruff). So consider that when buying this product. Would definitely recommend it to people with oily skin!</li>
    <li> It works really good if you do it 3 times a day but sometimes i cant or i just forget. and it deosnt go good when your sun burnt. If you use it 3 times a day it works really good though</li>
    <li> I had once in awhile breakouts. Maybe every month. I was tired of that. I needed a acne system that would work. Pro active doesn&#x27;t work. my brother has worser acne and it didnt make a difference. So that was no good. I saw Clean and clear. Reasonable price, good reviews, I&#x27;ll try it. It worked. I love the little one (spot something)  It works so fast. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the only acne care system I can use on my face. I use it every day and it works great. The spot treatment is amazing as well. It takes care of problem areas over night. Will continue to keep using this product over and over.</li>
    <li> i remember when this came out a long while ago, i got it around the time it first came out and used it. after a week my skin look as if it was almost cleared up and i was happy till on further inspection. it flattens the pimples on your face and gives the illusion that your face is smooth and clear but they&#x27;re still there unfortunately. it gives off a very cooling sensation on your face but it never burned me like others have said on here in their reviews. it smelled nice for a acne kit and it looked pretty nice all together. i gave this product a couple of months for it to work and i guess i would say it did work but not the way i had hope it to. i would say this is a good starter kit to begin with, but find other products that most defiantly has a better spot treatment and use that with this. i know if i start using this it wont work since for some reason my skin gets use to things way too quickly and they stop working but if you dont have that problem then you&#x27;d be fine with this.</li>
    <li> I can admit that the lotion did make my skin soft, but everything else just appeared to do the opposite. When I first began using this I had light breakouts, but afterwards my skin got worse. I have to throw it away because it made my skin more damaged than it has ever been.</li>
    <li> I recently decided that I wanted to try a new facial cleanser because of some mild acne acting up. When using face wash, I&#x27;ve never considered myself to have \\&quot;sensitive skin.\\&quot; I regularly use salicylic acid in washes, and have never had an adverse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this wash for the first time about a week ago. The first time I used it, I absolutely loved it. I thought I had finally found my miracle acne cure. Pimples dried up and almost vanished overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... over the next few days, the skin on my face started to hurt. I really wish I stopped using the wash right then, but I was so happy my pimples were gone so I ignored the signs and kept using it. After about a week, my skin was so incredibly horrible, that I couldn&#x27;t even believe it. I am 19 years old, and I now have wrinkles around my eyes. The skin under my eyes was so chemically burnt, that I couldn&#x27;t even put \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; moisturizer on it without writhing in pain. It felt like I had a horrible sunburn all over my face, especially around my eyes. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve burnt off a few layers of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this product completely 2 days ago, and it seems as if my skin has aged 10 years. Now, I&#x27;m instead using \\&quot;Yes to carrots\\&quot; which uses 96% natural ingredients. (A friend recommended it when I told her about my horrible experience with Clean n Clear) I am slowly seeing improvements in my skin, but I think that the damage that Clean N Clear caused might be permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, PLEASE DO NOT use this product. The main ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, is actually illegal to use in many countries. Seriously, it&#x27;s so bad for you.</li>
    <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this product for my teenage daughter.  Her skin reacts to everything, sunscreen, lotions, makeup....so I was reluctant to let her try acne prevention cr&amp;egrave;mes, especially after seeing the long list of ingredients.  However,  she was struggling with acne so I thought we would give this a try.  It has proven effective with minimal problems.  She does cut back on using the lotion to every other day if her skin starts to dry out.</li>
    <li> I have tried Proactiv and Murad and Skin ID with no results. Clean and Clear Advantage actually worked!! The claim on the box really was true. It says you will see results in just one wash, and I did! I washed my face before bed and when I woke up my acne was less red and a little smaller and the skin that wasn&#x27;t currently affected was smoother and looked to sort of glow a little. Every day it looks better and better. I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a week once a day and my skin is almost cleared up! One more week and I am confident it will be clear. It is very easy to use. One bottle of wash, very gentle. One bottle of medicated lotion, also very gentle and smells good. Finally, one tube of spot treatment, this burns for a second but it&#x27;s worth it and only lasts a few seconds. Definitely worth getting and it&#x27;s not costly to use every day! I love this stuff so much!</li>
    <li> The system is nice, however it hasn&#x27;t cleared up my skin completely.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s taken care of about 40% of my blemishes.  The face wash is a cream and I prefer a gel or something with a little exfoliation.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry.  The lotion is a light lotion and moisturizers without being greasy.  The spot corrector seems to get rid of pimples but doesn&#x27;t prevent them from forming on my skin.  The products feel good on my skin, and they don&#x27;t dry me out, but they just don&#x27;t work for my skin type.</li>
    <li> The little tube, the spot treatment, can dry up a zit or just about anything red and puffy on your face overnight.  It really does a great job.  I was in need of a new tube so I picked up this set.  The little spot treatment gets the most use but I have integrated the other two into my regular regimen though.  These are fine products.</li>
    <li> This helped my face alot!  I really had a problem with keepin my skin clear n getting rid of my scars. This starte working the first day i got it. I am african american so my scars r really dark n these helped to make them go away. I doesnt break ma face out or anything!  If ur thinkin about getting it...stop...jus get it!!</li>
    <li> I have mild acne and to be honest, am in the habit of popping pimples. Well this not only cleared up my acne, but kept it away for, forever! I love it so much that even though i&#x27;m acne free, i still want to get it in case it comes back and the face wash really helps my skin (very oily)</li>
    <li> I really like the cleanser in this kit, it is the only cleanser that consistently works to keep my face relatively blemish free.  The lotion included is okay, although my face doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturized after I use it than with other moisturizers. The spot treatment I think helps get rid of blemishes, but for me it doesn&#x27;t clear them as quickly as the product description claims.</li>
    <li> Dark African American oily skin and acne prone. I started using this product on  Dec 24th and in 6 days my acne was reduced by 40% and my texture improved by 25%. I recommend this to anyone that can handle and doesn&#x27;t have sensitivity to benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. The cleanser has 10% active benzoyl and the moisturizer has 4% salicylic acid active</li>
    <li> The item was not what I expected.  I am going back to using proactive.  The items were not for my face type.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you why i gave 5 stars to this product because people always have misconception on reviews and myself one of them. I bought this product couple days back and tried out according to its directions on package. Its been 51 hours im using it and what i see is this is awesome, its works. It almost get rid of my 3 huge pimples by 90% in 51 hours. My usage is somewhat like this way, 1. Cleanse affected area with cleanser 2. put thin layer of salicylic acid on same. Perform these steps every 8 hours(my personal opinion)  and you will see huge difference. Make sure you don&#x27;t go out in  sun or where you can have a lots of dust. Hopefully, this helps you all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update you on spot treatment product soon as soon as i start using it. I havent started using it yet as i want to get rid of all pimples first and when it leaves dark spots(i&#x27;m brown skin).will start another application with Spot Treatment.</li>
    <li> Results of this product were just okay. Noticed a alight improvement in 2 weeks. To be fair, results are going to differ from person to person depending on face washing routine, diet, stress, etc.</li>
    <li> I literally saw a difference within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 27 years old and I have been struggling with acne since my middle school days.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a life saver. Within 24 hours my break outs had gone down on my chin! Within a week, there were no zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get them worst on my chin and this has really helped. I don&#x27;t find that this burns or over dries my skin. I always use all three products each time and I use them twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;If I forget just one time though, I will get a zit. I swear, it takes me one day to get them and three days to get rid of them. I have this problem most on weekends... get in late, forget to wash my face... get up late... forget to wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;So, in short, if you use it... it should work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin. My chin is very oily and my forehead is dry. I actually only wash the bottom of my face, then use the moisturizer mostly on the top of my face. Then I apply the on the spot to my entire chin and any problem areas.</li>
    <li> i have a few acne when i start using this...i thought it will work for me and review is good...so why not...the firs week seem working ...slowly but working....the 2nd week it get worse....im so upset after the other one theres a new one...it took so long to rid the dark marks i try to stick with it for longer time (like another 2 mo ths) and here i am still having terrible time with my acne...sigh:-(</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me! 😕</li>
    <li> I am 28 years old and frustrated to STILL get break outs well into adult hood.  Prior to trying this product I tried proactive with horrible results.  I stuck with the proactive for 8 weks because I wanted to give it time to work, but the breakouts only got worse in that time period.  I got fed up with the constant and unsightly break outs and ordered the Clean and Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit and am very happy that I did.  Within a week I saw a major change. I do have to stick to a routine of using it regularly or else risk getting a pimple or blackhead but overall am so happy with the results that I recently signed up for a subsription so it will be shipped to me automatically.  I think that maybe the combination of Benzo and Salicylic Acid is what works for me.  Every one has different skin and I totally get the frustration of investing time and money in a product only to be dissapointed.  This may or may not work for you, but for the price I think it is definately worth a try.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s possible that my facial breakout may not be acne. I have NEVER had acne and have been proudly blessed with clear skin but with this recent breakout that has persisted, I was desperate and had heard about Clean &amp; Clear products for years.... so both with curiosity and urgency, I gave it a try and unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say that I see ANY difference. I like the moisturizer best. I use the cleanser and sometimes, it burns a little but it&#x27;s fine. The small tube just dries out the area I apply to. I don&#x27;t really like the feeling it gives my skin and it certainly doesn&#x27;t do anything for the mysterious acne-looking spots. So I am a bit \\&quot;meh\\&quot; about this one..... I guess if you are certain you have acne, you may get better results!</li>
    <li> Love these products. It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my face clear.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and this kit does the job, i mean, it does leave my face without acne, but at the same time, the formula is strong and my face becomes dry and i find a hard time getting it soft again, so if you have dry or sensitive skin, i wouldnt recommend this product</li>
    <li> I had purchased this productat at local Walmart in the clearance isle thinking what the heck I&#x27;ve tried just about everything (my forhead was horable)! within 3 days of use it was dramatacly better! I&#x27;ve been usuing the product for a month now and only use it when i shower which are sadly far and few between because I have three very busy children (ages One, Three and Six) and am absoultly in love and recommend it to anyone that can&#x27;t or doesn&#x27;t have time for a daily usage and busy life it still works when not all the time :)</li>
    <li> As a physician, I wish that somehow I could be exempt from the common ailment of acne, but alas, I have had more than my fair share over the years.    I&#x27;m a big fan of this product (by the way, I am not affiliated in any way with the company).  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, especially the benzoyl peroxide containing cleanser.  It appears to me to be among the few, if not the only, over the counter product at a low price that contains this medicine.  It is the same medicine contained in the proactive products, at a fraction of the price.  In my opinion, it works very well, it&#x27;s safe, and it&#x27;s much less expensive than the alternatives.  I say this partly as a physician, but mostly as a happy product user, who finally has much less acne.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It works well for our teenagers.  I cannot find it cheaper anywhere.  I would recommend it for anyone with an acne problem.  It is worth a try!</li>
    <li> Yet another disappointing acne kit. Followed the instructions and used for over a month with no positive results. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different face cleaners and this one belongs in the \\&quot;OK\\&quot; file. I don&#x27;t have a burning sensation like other people say they have but I do feel a tightness on my skin. It does not clear the blackheads around my nose  nor does it really clean my chin area well either. I have trouble spots on my chin that I thought this would help but it did not. I would not recommend this to a friend nor would I think about purchasing it again once this runs out.</li>
    <li> He is still breaking out on his face but not as bad as before.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this for my occasional breakouts of a few pimples, Nothing major. Well I try it and it literally made me break out like I never had before. Once I stopped using it, things went back to normal. I gave it two stars because it does give you a clean feeling when using it.</li>
    <li> I get occasional acne and I have not found a product to prevent new breakouts until now! I will say that I rotate this product with another cleanser as I feel it does not remove my makeup as good. However, I can say I&#x27;ve been virtually break out free since I started using this regularly. My sister has also had similar results. I love this product line!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only thing that has ever worked on my 16-yr daughter.  We have tried many products, but this stuff really does work.  Try it once a day for the first week, as it will dry out your skin, but once you&#x27;re used to it (according to said teenager), you can use it twice daily.</li>
    <li> It works wonders! and it smells great, keeps your skin soft, it&#x27;s not expensive at all.  It&#x27;s smaller than it looks but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> At first it looked like it was working but it looks as if it is giving my face more of a break out then normal. But they are not as noticeable unless i have been jogging or running around, all you need is a light amount of make up to cover them up and your good, but it does help with the big ones the ones that hurt that it</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working, at least for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best acne treatment I&#x27;ve found! I can usually see a difference in just a 12 hour period.</li>
    <li> I used this once a day for the first two days, as the package suggests, then I moved up to twice a day. I noticed a difference pretty quickly, and even now that I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and went back to once a day, I still see an improvement, especially with my blackheads. My nose and the area around it looks like brand new skin. I still get acne here and there, but I know that would go away if I was more diligent with using the product.</li>
    <li> Been using for 4 weeks. Though my skin is clearer, it just hasn&#x27;t seemed to control my moderate adult acne like  I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years and I love it. I have occasional mild acne and this works perfect at keeping it away. I have noticed other reviewers saying it dried their skin or made their acne worse. This is why it says right on the package to start out using the cleanser every other day and work your way up to everyday if you have sensitive skin. It is also a complete regimen. You CANNOT use this and then use other acne products at the same time. Doing so will of course dry your skin out(common sense people). So if you can read directions and you have some common sense, this is a great skin care regimen for occasional to mild acne. If you have severe or cystic acne, this will probably not do much for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this set mainly for the spot treatment, but everything in the set had great results. These products work amazingly well!</li>
    <li> Im 30 and have had acne since i was a teenager i got to the point where i stopped wrrying or caring about it but i saw this on sale and gave it a try 2weeks later my girl came home from vacation and was surprised to see how well the cream has worked we decided to name it miracle cream lol .........it really works</li>
    <li> Good system. I have mild acne, and this keeps it under control. It&#x27;s no miracle worker, but with it my face is pretty smooth and not oily. If I use the cleanser more than once a day or without the moisturizer my face gets itchy and dry, so use as directed. The spot treatment is really great, and within two days a huge angry pimple will be gone.</li>
    <li> excelent product, i used this for mi acne and worked great, this one was for my 12 year old that has acne , but with this she improved in 2 days and  her face cleared in about a week</li>
    <li> It has cleared up most of my acne within a week. I&#x27;ve also noticed some fading of old scars on my face.</li>
    <li> it does not work, the face stay with the oile and this is simply a waste of money just because at leaft that is requiret for the review</li>
    <li> I would most defiantly recommend this product to those who have been struggling with acne. this product works fast. I would recommend wearing sun screen (as always) in the morning after washing face. Thank you for the previous review that convinced me to buy this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> The only thing out of these products that worked for me was the spot treatment. It doesn&#x27;t help my oily skin clear up very much</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturizer is about the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out more&lt;br /&gt;- Spot treatment does work, and is nice for treating throughout the day because it sinks in and is clear (popped pimple paste by C&amp;C is also great but you have to use it only at night)&lt;br /&gt;- Cleanser has benzoyl peroxide, but moisturizer/spot treament are salicylic acid, which I think, works better as a combination rather than just one or the other in a treatment regimen.&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way - I generally only buy a new kit every 6 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The cleanser isn&#x27;t sold separately :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still suffer from acne breakouts even in my late 20s. I&#x27;ve been using this kit for about 6-7 years now, and I give it 4 stars because it generally works for me, but I don&#x27;t use as directed on the box -  if I did, I&#x27;m pretty sure my face would *not* be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin - that means my chin and nose is oily, and my forehead is dry. This also tends to change with the weather - more dry in winter, more oily in summer. This kit has a solution for both the oily and the dry parts, which is why I still use it. However, the key, I&#x27;ve found, for my combo skin, is not to use the products on all parts of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cleanser on only the oily parts of my face (chin), and don&#x27;t bother to put moisturizer on those parts. On the dry parts (forehead), I don&#x27;t usually use the cleanser but will use the moisturizer after a shower. This changes a little bit from summer to winter... sometimes I&#x27;ll use the facial cleanser on my whole face in the hotter months of the summer, and/or forego the cleanser completely in the colder part of the winter and instead use the moisturizer on my whole face instead. I try to listen to my skin as the seasons change - you should too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now. It definitely helps with redness, but I&#x27;m still getting the same old acne (as in the tiny bumps) I&#x27;ve been getting. Not sure I&#x27;ll try it again but I&#x27;ll at least wait to make that decision when I run out completely.</li>
    <li> This worked really well for a few weeks then my face started to breakout again. This was my second time using this product. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> All three products are effective and well priced.  Best thing I&#x27;ve found for adult acne.</li>
    <li> I never really had acne but I just wanted to brighten up my skin a bit and get rid of the few pimples I had. 3 weeks in and my face is noticably brighter. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used proactive in the past with no luck. I am a 28 year old woman and this is by far the best acne face wash I slave ever used. My skin was clear right away and has stayed clear ever since. I will definitely buy thus agaib!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter. She was very pleased. I noticed results in her skin in just a few days!! I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Better pricing than in the pharmacy stores.  it does work if you use it 2 times a day and consistently thereafter or the pimples will come back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 20s and have been using this for about 1 month, I&#x27;ve had minor breakouts occasionally for many years, but it&#x27;s been getting a little worse the past couple of months, and this product was highly regarded, so I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the face wash and moisturizer every morning, the spot treatment once or twice during the day, and then a facial astringent and the moisturizer again every evening. It has made no difference at all, and might even be making things worse. I&#x27;m getting breakouts a couple times a week, and they last about a week, so it&#x27;s been a constant problem for the past month with no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may work for some, but it absolutely is not working for me. I&#x27;ll note that I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with dry skin on my face, as some have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3 months later, using the products daily, zero change. This product is doing absolutely nothing (except maybe making things worse). No overall reduction, no healing of existing acne, and no prevention of new acne. Waste of time and money for me. Maybe I&#x27;ll stop using the product and see if that improves things.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I know certain acne products work differently for everyone, but this one is my all time favorite. I didn&#x27;t even wait until bedtime to wash my face! Nothing gets AND keeps my face bump free like C&amp;C.</li>
    <li> Seems like it helped in the beginning but then, like so many other products, lost efficacy.</li>
    <li> I was going threw bad acne and i don&#x27;t have alot of money so i bought this the day i used it was ok the smell was kind of strong also i wake up my face was looking good and clear the pimps was small/tiny but my face was feeling itchy and weeks later it break out Bad! i never buy this again nope not for people with bad acne or sensitive skin or dry</li>
    <li> Did not make a noticable difference in clearing up my adult acne. But, I must say that it did not over dry my skin and it has a pleasant fragrance. I ended up going to see a dermatologist for prescription medications that gave me a much better result. The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> It made my skin super oily and greasy and it gave me a bunch of zits :( so i was expecting clear skin and ended up with the worst skin I ever had so I give this a thumbs down I use clearasil and it works perfectly for me a whole lot better not a blemish in sight</li>
    <li> Fast delivery good product.</li>
    <li> Was much of a difference after i used for sometime.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I will definitely buy again when I run out. Try not to skip a day or you will get a few breakouts.</li>
    <li> I like to use this for myself. I feel well after use it for months.&lt;br /&gt;maybe u should take a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 26 and have suffered from acne since age 12. When I got older,  it turned mild but when I moved to Japan my face took a turn for the worst.  I picked this up at the bx on base and noticed a difference in hours.  I use it twice a day and have only used it for two days.  My face is a lot clearer and it is event improving dark spots from old acne.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like it and I don&#x27;t like it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t stop my breakouts at all, but it helped to reduce the size and length of the breakouts. Although, since I am admittedly a pimple picker, I find that if I pick my face, my breakouts are worse, like more red and patchy than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin IS softer, like it stated, but my face is still pretty oily even with the occasional dryness I get after first applying it. The scent is a little medicated, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and I don&#x27;t think it lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash is really refreshing. Although, all of my face towels have been bleached because of this, but that&#x27;s honestly not a huge issue for me (just stating that for ppl who would care to know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need to exfoliate every week or every other week because I feel like it builds up a tad bit even with daily washing as instructed. I like the moisturizer, it feels really nice, I just wish it controlled my oil better. (I use a bit of aquaphor for dry spots). The spot treatment works great if used over night only (for me at least). Using it during the day just makes my skin oily. I don&#x27;t recommend using the spot treatment under makeup since it&#x27;s a little thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it didn&#x27;t eliminate my breakouts, but it did help control them and keep them calm (when I wasn&#x27;t picking my face).</li>
    <li> Thank you I am going to use this!!!! It was super fast!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and I will buy again. THanks</li>
    <li> I like it a lot!! It&#x27;s really clearing up my face</li>
    <li> I am so happy I went trough with this product!  Love it!! I received my package yesterday and I used it right when I got home from school the next morning and there wasn&#x27;t anymore acne forming, no dark marks, and no redness. My face isn&#x27;t that bad, maybe one or two but still i love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless otc acne kits, face washes, creams, lotions, etc and this one was no different. It did absolutely nothing for my acne. I guess it just was not powerful enough. I have oily, sensitive acne prone skin if that helps.</li>
    <li> i have had acne for years until i have tried this product. works better then proactive without a doubt. it only took 2 months to get a clear face with this product when used properly</li>
    <li> just seems like regular stuff.. good thing it wasn&#x27;t too expensive.. i paid $15 for the kit... i do like the touch up stuff though.. (step 3) and lotion is pretty nice.. i still have acne though and i&#x27;m 23</li>
    <li> I bought this set because it was cheap and had great reviews. I am already using it for two weeks, twice a day. I cannot say it has an amazing result, actually I even had a couple of breakouts, but they did last for shorter time than usual. I do not have extremely severe problems, I can cover everything with foundation, but I just wanted a clean face and I think this product does not work though.</li>
    <li> MY son prefers to use Clean and clear Acne Control, he says it works just as good as proactive that cost way to much, he highly  recommends this product.</li>
    <li> cleared my terrible acne.</li>
    <li> i don&#x60;t like to write a lot but all what i can say it&#x60;s worth it and it works really great&lt;br /&gt;i would say even overnight treatment :)</li>
    <li> The first two days ,the results were amazing,but then it started to break me out.I only had acne in my forehead but after using this it spread all over my face,it was fine but now its SEVERE I mean SEVERE acne.So when I stopped  and  most of it disappeared,then came back soooo...</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin soo smooth and I love the tingely clean feeling you get, and the smell is so fresh and amazing!! The little tube of zit zapper stuff is my favorite!!</li>
    <li> excellent products, very effective for controlling acne in boys</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best acne kit i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> This product did not work! It make me break out with a day! Do not purchase. It will be a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Best product in clearing acne!</li>
    <li> I love clean and clear products! This acne kit really helps keep my skin clear. The tingly sensation is great! The only thing i noticed is when i first used this, i used it twice a day and I did notice my skin was just becoming a bit to dry. I now use this acne kit only about 3 days a week in rotation with my clean and clear deep action cream cleanser and it&#x27;s keeping my skin relatively clear! If you don&#x27;t want to purchase the whole kit and spend as much money you can get the clean and clear continuous control cleanser with the clean and clear advantage acne moisturizer. which is like the exact same thing. 10% benzoyl peroxide cleanser. Hope this helped! Thank you clean and clear!</li>
    <li> Okay, so life has ummm blessed me with acne from youth to adulthood, and over the years if they make it, I&#x27;ve tried it, including proactive, which did in fact work, but sadly turned my face into flakey sandpaper...every time i stray, I return to johnson and johnsons clean and clear brand...this set works! I think it&#x27;s just as good as the proactive but gentler for my sensetive skin. I&#x27;d recommend the clean and clear line for anyone who has suffered from mild to somewhat agressive acne...I cannot speak to the efficacy of this product on extreme/severe acne as I haven&#x27;t (knock on wood) experienced that. That being said, I highly recommend this line.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for over two years and my skin has never looked better.  The product contains benzoyl peroxide which is the only ingredient that works on my face.  I hope this produc never gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> The spotting treatment only thing I see improved  My skin.&amp; clear them out . the other two things not really.  But It&#x27;s okay. 3.5 stars I guess</li>
    <li> After a few weeks using it i have seen some changes not like WOW beacuse i didnt really have a bad acne problem, just a few from time to time but it has helped a lot</li>
    <li> proactiv uses a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide face wash, this uses 10%  benzoyl peroxide in the face wash. My only gripe is that the 2% sulfuric acid doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger tube. More effective then proactiv for me.</li>
    <li> It is very fast. I use it every day.  the price is reasonable.  all in all, it is worth to buy it</li>
    <li> It is very good item I used for my acne face. It is very useful.I do not use it everyday. I just use it when I have some acne on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for myself 11 months ago and now they are still sort of new, because they don&#x27;t do anything improvement! and for this price I expected some effects..So don&#x27;t recommend. and if you wanna try, suggest buy individual or smaller volume first and then decide.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 1/1/2014&lt;br /&gt;I discontinued using this product because it did not help my acne. I used it for about 3 months, within the first couple of weeks of using this product I noticed the pimples were reduced in size, but it never eliminated the acne. I still favor this product over Proactiv, but it never helped get rid of my acne just helped control it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this kit in desperation to get rid of my acne on my face and chest. Within two weeks, the acne on my chest completely cleared up and my face breakouts decreased in size. I tried other products and it doesn&#x27;t compare at all. I love the way the face wash tingles (like peppermint) and makes my skin feel so smooth and clean. It&#x27;s very simple to use and the best thing is you only need to use this product once a day. I&#x27;ve had amazing results and intend on using this product forever.</li>
    <li> looking for something that will not dry out the skin and leave mark behind well this is not it but this is good for bring out the acne thats under the skin so if you have acne this will help but will dry you out and leave the marks behind good luck</li>
    <li> I just started using it three days ago and i already see a difference. It reduces redness within the second day and really shrinks new pimples. After using twice a day each time you use it, your face feels so fresh and you can feel it attacking those pimples instantly. With this rate of success i can expect wonderful results by next week.!</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast and the product was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This product has a cleanser with benzoyl peroxide and then moisturizer lotion with salicylic acid but all other products say to do opposite and have salicylic acid as cleanser. Literally if you google it that&#x27;s what Google says. So far after a week no results</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone skin. And I can never find something that can clear up my skin. ALTHOUGH, this product only worked for me when i used it with my daily regime, with other products as well. I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in the first use as everyone said they saw. It took a little while for it to kick in and finally start clearing my face. The cleanser is so fresh, and smells great! But your face gets pretty dry afterwards. So i use the moisturizer, or sometimes my usual daily moisturizer. Now, for the spot treatment. I just squirt a tiny little bit on my finger and massage it all over my face, and i see better results with that instead of dotting it on problem areas, but do whatever works for you.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this kit is pretty good. It has helped me reach a clearer complexion, which i adore!</li>
    <li> I have mild adult acne.  I used Proactive for years.  It worked well for me, but it became too expensive.  I used the Walmart brand of Proactive for awhile.  It worked every bit as well as Proactive for a LOT less money, but I was not always finding it on the shelf when I needed it.  I tried Neutrogena Acne Stress Power Cream Wash.  I like this product, but my breakouts seemed to be getting worse.  I decided I need a stronger acne control product, so I purchased the Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit.  I&#x27;ve used it for less than one week now.  Love the smell.  The cleanser is nice - not really thrilled with the way the moisturizer makes your skin feel.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results.  My skin started itching.  The itching got worse today, and it burns a little.  The skin under my eyes is very puffy and I feel &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; in the tongue and throat area.  The itching just started yesterday, the tongue and throat thing today, and I didn&#x27;t really realize what was happening until I looked up the adverse side effects.  Guess I need to find something new.  I might go back to the Walmart version of Proactive.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want to jinx it but yes it is clearing up my acne. I&#x27;m going to tell you how acne products work,  fit&#x27;s they lift all the dirt from the skin and all the pimples underneath ( so might cause pimples on the first week or so). But then it clear it up. .</li>
    <li> This really worked to improve my acne. I used it everyday until it ran out and I really saw a difference within 2 weeks. Like everything else you go through the purgatory stage which sucks but once you get through that you can really notice a difference. If you get anything out of this set the spot treatment is amazing. Overall I highly suggest this product!</li>
    <li> I rated this one star because they say they should start working in two days.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 3 weeks and saw no changes at all!&lt;br /&gt;I wish i could return it but Amazon didn&#x27;t allow it because it&#x27;s flammable and that may be dangerous.</li>
    <li> It works for the acne on my face and I&#x27;m using it everyday. It&#x27;s a good choice. I recommend it if you also have the acne problem.</li>
    <li> I had a bad acne problem until I started using this product, I used to put a lot of foundation on to cover up my acne, I have had this problem almost all my life, I even used proactive all it did was dry the crap out of my face, this product works and I only use this on my face! buy this if you want to get ride of acne!</li>
    <li> First of all I have very oily skin..so this review might be good if you have my skin type. This product did its work and did not do its work at the same time, becuse I still have acne but its not as bad as it was before i started using this product. So i guess it helped a litle bit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day for about a month. I finally feel like it is working pretty well. I have had really bad acne on my chin and cheekbones for years. I have used Proactive, Cetaphil, and Velocity from Mary Kay. This product has worked better than all three of the others. In the first few weeks I was still getting acne all over my chin, but a pimple would disappear after only a day or two, as opposed to before where a pimple would likely remain for almost a week. I did have my same problem of as soon as one pimple disappears another one pops up. However, after using all three steps twice a day, every day, for four weeks my skin is clear. If I do feel a pimple developing it does seem to disappear the next day. I find that this product does not dry out my skin; although, I do use Clean and Clear Morning Glow moisturizer as well. Also, I still have enough of the product for it to last another month. So, this is about a two month supply. Overall, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The only good thing I can say about this was that it was gentle on my skin and didn&#x27;t overly dry it out. However it did nothing for break outs.</li>
    <li> If you use it according to the instructions, it really works.&lt;br /&gt;I am really satisfied with my purchase, I think it just need you continue the healing process.</li>
    <li> Un excelente producto, lastima que en mi pais es dificil de conseguir! lo recomiendo totalmente, llego a tiempo y en excelente calidad.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use the cleanser but the spot treatment worked really well. I don&#x27;t think the lotion did anything, but I didn&#x27;t use it that much either. I just had picture day the other day and I used the night before. The next day it faded a little. It usually takes about a week of constant care for a perfect set of skin. Overall, it was pretty good.</li>
    <li> It sometimes works, it sometimes doesn&#x27;t, my face will clear in one spot, and break out in another, it pisses me off</li>
    <li> I just purchased this kit at Walmart for $16.97.  My daughter hasn&#x27;t tried it yet, so I will update this review later. I just wanted to share for now that this is a very competitive price for this product.</li>
    <li> I used Proactive and this is by far superior to me anyways. It keeps my face clean and clear. Its much cheaper as well. If your looking for a great product to clear and keep yur face clear from breakouts without drying it out this is for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s makes my face pell an maybe it&#x27;s just my face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had persistant acne, although not severe, but I was tired of always having acne. I started using the three step program in late January. At first I was over using step 1 and underusing the other steps, within one week it look like my skin was gonna come off from all the dryness. But since I realized that was the issue,I started using step 1 only once a week,  its been the only product thats given such good results. My face is clear most of the time, grant it acne still appears once in a while but nothing like before and with a few applications of step 3, the acne is gone in a day or two. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinda of cream/face wash to get rid of my acne and it never worked. But after all the reviews on this I decided to try it and only after a day or two my acne scars are starting to fade!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 year old. She loves it. Keeps the acne at bay during the teen years. It is not as abrasive to the skin as some of the acne treatment systems out on the market. I keep buying it over and over. The set is ideal as it is perfectly portioned. I recommend for you teen.</li>
    <li> Product reduces the pimple.. but leaves the red marks on your face..</li>
    <li> ook so when i first try this kit i wasn&#x27;t sure it was gonna work but after about 2 weeks of using all three products i started to see a change in the amount of pimples in my face,they weren&#x27;t completely gone but my face looked a lot better.the cleanser tingles like it has peppermint in it ,now at first i didn&#x27;t like that at all,but i got used to it after 3 days as i wanted to give this kit a proper chance.the moisturizer on the other hand i really like it&#x27;s moisturizing with out being greasey and it doesn&#x27;t look oily on so it&#x27;s fine for the summer months plus i feel like it really does what it says .the spot treatment worked great i would put it on on any new pimple i saw at night and by the afternoon the next day it was almost gone.all in all this isn&#x27;t the best but it works for the price .in total i used this kit for 2 months.</li>
    <li> Dried me out hardcore and caused massive redness, my face looked worse after starting this product than it did before I used it. Some products just aren&#x27;t for everybody.</li>
    <li> I love this product and this brand. It&#x27;s basically the only thing I can use on my face. My face is so sensitive to products, I can&#x27;t use certain make ups, lip gloss, chap-stick, no sunscreen, no eyeshadow or pencil with red dye, nothing. But this is really safe for my skin it works, really well too.</li>
    <li> I have for some reason been breaking out more than usually so I tried this because of what people wrote about it but this product SUCKS for me. Idk if it&#x27;s my acne or the product but my acne is the worst it has ever been in my life! In middle school I didn&#x27;t  fully understand that I had to wash my face so I broke out like crazy but after I graduated high school and did right by my skin,i have yet to have 100% clear skin but it&#x27;s WAY better then from middle school. So here I am still looking for that 100% my face is clear product and this IS NOT IT! When I breakout I get I usually get like 6 really big pimples on my cheeks and some times little ones on my forehead but with this i get small to medium pimples running down my cheeks and all under my chin(which I have never had before) and really big pimples on my forehead and hairline. I&#x27;m not a wasteful person so I have been trying to hurry up and finish this product but it&#x27;s making my skin worst.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Made my skin red, irritated, and flaky after just a few uses!</li>
    <li> This product is great. my face is super oily and this does help reduce the oiliness. Thankful that i tried this and it actually works. I use twice a day.</li>
    <li> My daughter had terrible acne for two years and we have tried everything, especially going to Dermatologists.  After using this product for two weeks, my daughter&#x27;s face has certainly improved and her self-confidence has improved as well.</li>
    <li> high amounts of stress produce break outs, now that i don&#x27;t have acne i have one less thing to worry about, im going to prom soon, cant wait to show up with clear skin</li>
    <li> I used to have horrible breakouts and I had tried everything. Then I got this and my acne is COMPLETELY GONE. I don&#x27;t have much to say other than get it!</li>
    <li> Best product for acne in the market really helped!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am seeing fast results. This product leaves the skin smooth after product has been washed. It does not dry out the skin. The spots are diminishing faster than I thought they would. Great product and fast results.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product before because i know how quick it works which is usually within a day. i will buy again when i run out :)</li>
    <li> I have to say that i buy just the cleansner (the taller one) thats like the first thing to do (i buy it seperate)(just the cleanser) and i have to say that i have no acne i just have pimples but not much, and i used in the T-zone after cleaning my face with another cleansner i use it and i dont really notice a different i think that its just like a second cleanser that you use so i really dont recommended it for skin that dont have any acne</li>
    <li> Bought this for someone and it hasn&#x27;t been doing anything to them,don&#x27;t waster your money..can I get money back or something here? I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I bought this product from walgreen&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a great experience with this acne medicine.  The the first treatment  (the one you wash off)  is extremely powerful  recommend  to use it while taking or after a shower. Must put on the moisturizer as it will remove a lot of oil and in case you do not have oily skin. Only use the spot treatment  (the smallest one) on a pimple or whitehead you need to get rid of. Do not apply everywhere. Just use it on a certain pimple  or whitehead. Works very well I do not have oily skin but I guess people who review it badly didn&#x27;t use the lotion correctly. All I know it works for me.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t sell this in stores anymore and they need too!!!! This is the only stuff I use to clear up my skin!! I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in here. But I love it!! This is the only cleaner I use for my face!! I use a sea salt scrub along with it I love it</li>
    <li> When my teen uses this product as indicated, it really clears his blemishes.  The trick is (as with many teens), getting him to use it religiously...  The small tube of blemish treatment is 2%, so it really clears the pimples over night!</li>
    <li> MY FACE IS GETTING SO CLEAN I NEVER THOUGHT IS WOULD HAPPEN. IT WAS WAY CHEAPER THEN THE STORE. THANKS</li>
    <li> Does not work like it states and I wash my face twice a day and use the product as stated on label</li>
    <li> If I could give it less than one star I would. My face is, what can only be described as, burnt. Its red raw and itchy.  So swollen and sore.</li>
    <li> I have only used this two days now and I love the way it makes my skin feel. It smells wonderful, and best part it works! Now my skin isn&#x27;t too bad. I have mild acne, but it really does the job. Helps to clean and keep my skin from freaking out. Now this is only after day two but, I can tell you, I am definitely looking forward to washing my face this eve. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I will most definitely be reordering this when my supply runs out. Affordable and effective!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully face looks amazing</li>
    <li> I Love this product! Wouldn&#x27;t use any other. if you puts forth the effort you&#x27;ll see the results of this!</li>
    <li> Okay, here&#x27;s my little story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since the age of 12 (I&#x27;m now 18), and I&#x27;ve been on everything for it, even Accutane, which cleared me up but only for a year until it came back in full force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this kit since last month, and last week I added persa-5 gel to my regimin, and let me say, this is fantastic! BUT you have to STICK WITH IT AND MOISTURIZE! This is very drying but as long as you stick with it IT WILL WORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Been using these for a very long time and I&#x27;ve rarely had a break out!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best acne control kits I have ever used, mainly because this is the only one that has consistently worked after a few years of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I want to note that is that there is never enough of the moisturizer which I think is the best part of this kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of OTC face washes and was always left feeling so-so about them. I bought this three day&#x27;s ago and almost all my acne is gone. It&#x27;s even reduced the size of my cystic acne, which I never had until I got pregnant. As of right now, I love this stuff and cannot wait to wash my face! My skin actually feels CLEAN even after applying the other two treatments. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go to a dermatologist! So far, this stuff is working and I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Short and Simple,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my wife and she says she noticed the difference within 24 hours. Each cream has a purpose and they last for a while, give it a try.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately,  this product is going to expire next month.</li>
    <li> It  didn&#x27;t clear up any acne on my face. It just made my face extremely dry.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after readying some of the reviews . It does work reducing the size of the pimples , however , it burned my skin . My acne looked like mosquito bites  , it was horrible .  If you have sensitive skin just stay away from this product .</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work I want a refund now!!!!&#x27;mm</li>
    <li> really happy wen it came in the mail but ive used it everyday for the past week anda half and im stillgetting breakouts i used the product correctly by directions so this stuff just doesnt work o by the way it gives u really red skin after use too! smh chargin people 27 bux for crap! :/</li>
    <li> Worked well I never breakout</li>
    <li> I had moderate acne and the combination of these 3 products completely cleared up my acne in two months. During the first week or two my skin peeled and a lot of skin would flake off while shaving. Now i can use this product in the morning and at night with no problems. The only downside is that my face will get sun burnt very easily, but this was expected before starting this product. Definitely would recommend for moderate acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clean &amp; Clear products for a while but never this one. I decided to use the spot treatment on a pimple that was forming. It stung a little going on, but I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it. I actually thought oh hey, feel it work. Until the next morning when I woke up with what looks like a burn on my face. Mmhmm. The pimple is gone and in it&#x27;s place is a nice burn mark. It&#x27;s extremely sore and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to leave a scar. So yeah. I would NOT recommend this product whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to everyone that has acne problems.  I know that there is Proactiv, but that product did not work for me.  I started getting occasional boils on my face.  Boils are patches of blood in the pores that grow to maybe 3 centimeters.  Once I stopped using Proactiv the boils disappeared.  This product is just as good and Neutrogena and Loreal.  I recommend this brand.  it works for me and I don&#x27;t need proactiv.</li>
    <li> I have used them all, this is the best on the market! Trust me! I highly recommend this for people with dry skin because it has a wonderful moisturizing cream you can put on after u was your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 14 and I suffer with acne. Mild.. But I still would like to get rid of it. This stuff sucks. I spent my birthday money on it and I totally regret it. Honestly it&#x27;s a waste of money, and it doesn&#x27;t do anything. From a teen to someone who wants to get rid of acne it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. it just takes some time and the pimples are gone</li>
    <li> This really does help your skin. I&#x27;ve had this product less than a week and I see a significant difference. It has a reasonable price and the packaging is cute, well if you love packaging like me.</li>
    <li> My face is sensitive to these stuff now.</li>
    <li> I always buy this product and stick to it because it really clears up my face good. I tried other products and also Pro Active but I felt they weren&#x27;t getting the job done enough and this product does because I have really oily skin. Also this system works good with my clay mask that I use twice a week so Im very happy with Clean and Clear and love their 3 step set.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s only been a good week but I&#x27;m feeling it&#x27;s working, I have less break outs. now to get rid of my dark spots, any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I love this product. But be careful mine was missing the cleanser. Only the lotion and spot treatment came get I paid for all 3. I would recommend picking this set up from a store rather than buying on here.</li>
