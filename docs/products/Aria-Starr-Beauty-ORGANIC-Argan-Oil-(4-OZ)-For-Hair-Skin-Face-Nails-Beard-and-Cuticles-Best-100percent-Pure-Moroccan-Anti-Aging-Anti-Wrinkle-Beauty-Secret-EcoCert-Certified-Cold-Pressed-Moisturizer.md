<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have never used an oil on my face and didn&#x27;t know what to expect except that I needed more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful unscented oil that makes my skin so soft when I wake up in the am.  I have seen other&lt;br /&gt;types advertised that are far more expensive, but I am perfectly happy with this one.</li>
    <li> I just started using it on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair and because of your company&#x27;s insight of all the beneficial uses this oil can do, I&#x27;ll be using it for many other things. I already started using it on my lips, because really, who doesn&#x27;t want soft lips. So thank you and please continue sending other useful information about this product.</li>
    <li> Just received order exactly as promised-only used once but I love Argan Oil so far this seems perfect no smell and not mixed with any other ingredients which was what I was looking for. I use it on my hair and nails and sometimes my skin when I am very dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this , faithfully for about a week. I see no difference in my skin :(</li>
    <li> I really like this oil.  I ordered it for my skin, and I do like it on my face and neck.  It feels smooth without being oily.  I read the information about it, and it was suggested to use it on the hair to protect against the damages that blow drying can cause.  It works great for hair also. I am about 60 percent gray, by my natural color, and the texture of the gray hair is very dry.  With the argon oil it feels and looks like the rest of my hair without being oily.  Warning, only use a little on the ends, or it can be really oily! This one little jar will go a long way.</li>
    <li> I really like this product so far. Feels good to use something on my hair that is organic, all natural and nourishing. I just started using it so don&#x27;t have long term results yet. But so far it&#x27;s great. And the service from the manufacturer was excellent.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff.  Would be even better if it had a pump or sprayer.  thanks</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different oils for my face and this is by far the most silkiest, non-greasy, well absorbed oil I have found. Have already ordered another bottle.</li>
    <li> Thank you good fast service as described love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil after reading about it, and I am glad that I did. I live in AZ, and the dry climate is very tough on my skin, especially the skin on my face. I just could not seem to find any kind of natural cream that was strong enough. My skin would soak up even coconut oil, and I couldn&#x27;t even tell that I had used it. Within days of using this oil, the skin on my face is smooth and supple once again, and I don&#x27;t even have to use that much. It really a great product, and a great deal. I do not need anything else!</li>
    <li> Great for your hair. Mix it with other products and you&#x27;ll have a great shampoo or conditioner.</li>
    <li> I just started using it and I like its feel on my skin.  I can&#x27;t comment beyond that at this point.</li>
    <li> I have been using it a few weeks now, for my hair and my face. I already see an improvement in my skin and I am very pleased. I just went through a very cold winter in the Northeast and my skin was extremely dry! I used many different kinds of moisturizers and nothing helped. I am very happy with the results after using the argan oil just for over a week. I also use it in my hair and it keeps it frizz free as well as adding much needed moisture so my hair is shiny and manageable. I also LOVE the price of this argan oil. I have used more expensive ones in the past but will continue to purchase the Aria Starr argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for making such a great product and not inflating the price.</li>
    <li> This oil seems as good as the sample of the very expensive oil I tried.  There is virtually no odor, it goes on smoothly and is absorbed into my skin quickly. I love what it does for my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my very dry cuticles. I can see immediate improvement. I will continue and try the other applications for dry skin</li>
    <li> I bought it for my hair, but have found myself using it more on my face, under my daily sunscreen.  It gives a dewy, non-greasy effect.  On the hair, use only 2-3 drops on the ends only.  The effect is a professionally styled, piecey look.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this oil for my face. Leaves my face looking healthy and dewy</li>
    <li> The product works perfectly as described.. Much happy with the result..😊</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exactly as described and the e-mail the seller sends afterwords for the multiple uses for this product was very helpful. Would recommend to anyone who is considering using this product!</li>
    <li> Second time ordering.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, light oil. I bought it to use on my keratined hair and it works well. It absorbs quickly, smooths the dry ends and does not make my hair greasy. It is also nice to rub into dry hands as it absorbs quickly without leaving hands slimy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who likes using natural oil on their hair.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a few days, but I&#x27;ll write what I&#x27;ve experienced so far. It&#x27;s thicker than the Josie Maran brand of Argan oil. It&#x27;s got a weird fragrance kind of medicine like but it goes away after a little while. It doesn&#x27;t break me out yet... but it is thick &amp; hard to distribute on my face.</li>
    <li> One of the best products in the world for your skin.  It is not sticky and your skin feels so smooth.  Love this Argan Oil</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it for my hair and it is the best hair product that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this product; it has really helps to keep my skin moist and soft.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s everything I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brand of Argan Oil ;  this by far is the best!!!!! It is lightweight yet highly moisturizing, and disappears into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this each night along with my normal moisturizer and it has been great! I can tell that my skin looks softer and well taken care of after using this. Sometimes I can use it alone as my nighttime moisturizer. I tried using it during the day but I have oily prone skin to begin with and I felt super shiny by noon if I added this to my morning routine. This did not break me out and I am prone to get hormonal/stress related acne.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Better than chemical-based skin creams. :)</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Argan Oil, the first worked so well and I am just at the very bottom of the first bottle. I use it on my whole body and hair.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil keeps face skin, fresh, clean and elastic, great Organic Product.</li>
    <li> I have always had extremely dry patches of skin on my cheeks and dry frizzy hair. Nothing I have ever used has worked for either of these problem areas until now.  One use of this WONDERFUL Argon Oil and my skin has been hydrated--Dry areas have started to disappear.  Two uses on my dry hair and I no longer have frizziness!  I am amazed!!!  I would definitely recommend this product!!!  LOVE IT!  Will definitely continue to use!</li>
    <li> Love it! Feels good on my dry skin and under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this oil very much and will order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Amazing. Works very well</li>
    <li> Love it, I use very little drops to moisturize my face and neck before I go to bed ... it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Virgin Argan Oil for a week now, and it has cured the raggedy cuticles I always have from doing yard work. I can see an improvement in my nails already. It also helps keep my fingertips from getting rough and just the small excess from doing my nails works as an excellent hand lotion. I use it for this purpose three times a day. The Argan Oil has also taken care of the rough ends on my hair. The hair care products I had been using dropped their price  - and dropped argan oil from their ingredients. A friend convinced me that 100% argan oil would do a much better job, and she was right.</li>
    <li> Been using as my night routine and I can see the difference! Was using a more expensive brand, but bought this for the value, and so happy I did! I see results with this one rather than the other brand. I mix a few drops with my Egyptian Magic cream after cleansing, and in the a.m. my skin is so soft and smooth. The tiny red bumps on my cheeks and the recent acne scars I have seem to be fading away as well! Mix a drop in your foundation too, and your skin will look radiant!  Not too fond of the smell, but I can deal with it. It&#x27;s worth every penny!  Love u Amazon!</li>
    <li> I liked another brand a lot better than this one</li>
    <li> Works on the first use.</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil, and this Argan Oil is no exception.  Very high quality and great packaging!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Bought this product instead of Josie Maran Argan oil, wasn&#x27;t disappointed, will purchase again&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product is the holly grail for fine frizzy hair. I absolutely love it. It does not weigh my hair down, and stays frizz free all day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way this product makes my hair feel. I only needed a few drops and my hair felt moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> Have received product. Am using it. Have not had enough time to actually see it&#x27;s results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working great - I use it on my skin, hair and nails.  I really love this product.</li>
    <li> Works well on my face and in my hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I like this oil for my face, but honestly won&#x27;t buy again because of the horrible smell.  Thankfully, the smell goes away quickly.  My skin is so soft and supple after using.  But I will be looking for another that doesn&#x27;t smell so badly.  Seller was very courteous and accommodating.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS ORGANIC ARGAN OIL!!!  Very nice....not oily I use it on my face after cleansing and on my hair it creates such a wonderful sheen and is wonderful for my dry hands!! &amp;quot;I love this argan oil and it does wonders for my hair and skin!!! &amp;quot; I will ONLY purchase it from Aria Starr Beauty.....a great company to do business with!!  &amp;quot;Thank you Aria!</li>
    <li> I used it in my hair and hands. My skin is very soft.</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast shipping! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good for everything skin,hair, face! Pretty neat and natural</li>
    <li> The argon oil is great for face and nails, would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this oil! Very happy with this purchase and the communication from the company.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love the Argan Oil, it feels amazing on my skin and hands. Gives my hair a nice sheen. Will order again!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using argan oil on my skin.  I was nervous adding oil to my face because I have had problems with blackheads my whole life.  I&#x27;ve been using it approximately one week and so far I love it.  It absorbs to a nongreasy, healthy glow &amp; my face is extremely soft.  I also applied a small amount to my hair &amp; it is very soft with a high shine.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> better than you can expected!</li>
    <li> Aria Starr Beauty Argan Oil is simply the best. I&#x27;ve use various products from Sephora, Macy&#x27;s, down to Walgreens and Safeway and you&#x27;ll never buy those moisturizing products again after using the Argan Oil from Aria Starr Beauty.</li>
    <li> Fantastic argan oil that my skin just absorbs almost instantly. So far it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s keeping my skin from peeling or cracking with this wintry weather.</li>
    <li> One of the best argan oil i&#x27;ve ever bought , since i&#x27;m half Morrocan and i already know how Argan oil should be like</li>
    <li> Very happy with this, I use it in my face before make up and for my dry hair as well. The product works wonders. I will purchase this again and again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to really rate it. So far I like it. It doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and that is good. I like it around my eyes before bed.</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oil for about two weeks instead of facial lotion and body lotion. It appears to work better at keeping my skin hydrated and it is also fast absorbing. It also doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or leave a heavy build up like lotion usually do. I am hook on this oil and you can use it from head to toe. Its the s***!!!</li>
    <li> The moisturizing result from this product is wonderful.  It is a small container, thus does not take up room on a night stand.</li>
    <li> Great for everday use</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin hair and nails improved in less than a week. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> The Argan oil absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and leaves my skin soft. I have been using as a face moisturizer and it works as well or better than more expensive products which are not 100% natural. It felt good on my lips too.  I&#x27;ve used some on my hair as well but can&#x27;t say yet how helpful that was.</li>
    <li> I love it. It make my hair soft and not fizzy any more.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil. It is thick but I like it that way because it works awesome. I love the nutty smell. It is fabulous. I highly recommend. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for several months and it has improved the feel and appearance of my skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product!! I read reviews before purchasing it and they are accurate. This oil is very light weight and can be used for multiple purposes. I bought it because I have dermatitis on my head and it was flaring up badly. I don&#x27;t like to use the prescription shampoo&#x27;s because they smell terrible and are full of chemicals that are harsh on my hair. I have only had the product since Friday (5 days) but, it&#x27;s helped dramatically in that short amount of time. I have been rubbing small amount onto my scalp after my morning shower and a little more than that at night before I go to bed. The dermatitis has calmed down, it barely itches now and all the red patches that started to form on my face by my hair line have diminished. I definitely recommend this to others who have the same problem!</li>
    <li> I found this oil to be amazing.  It took consistency, but after regular use I love it!  I am in my 60s and I live in a very arid area and it left my skin soft and supple.  After putting it on my face, I also used a bit to shine my hair.  The best part is it is organic and without fragrance.  (I am very sensitive to fragrances.)</li>
    <li> Great oil . I&#x27;m more than satisfied :) Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Love the oil. It is not greasy which is amazing since it is oil.. I love it.  Arrived when I expected it too.</li>
    <li> After using my first bottle of this, I will not be without it. My nephew has psoriasis all over his body. After about eight days of Argon oil use, it was gone!! For myself, I have very dry skin. Using just a few drops of this all over my body, my skin is so soft now. If I could give it ten stars I would. I&#x27;m not a paid person writing this either. Just a very satisfied user of this product. Hope this helps someone decide. Debbie</li>
    <li> it was the best thing for my hair my hair was dry and course and I use that a few times and my hair looks like a million bucks</li>
    <li> This seems to be a really high quality argan oil.  I like that it has no greasy feel, it just leaves your skin smooth and soft.  I like how much they care about your satisfaction.  I&#x27;m really pleased and plan to reorder.</li>
    <li> I love using on my face and hair.</li>
    <li> Delightful from the first use.</li>
    <li> Very soft and good for face.</li>
    <li> I bought it to put in hair during the winter months but started putting mixing it with my face moisturizer and WOW...my skin is really soft and clear.  This stuff is nice.  I have REALLY sensitive skin and was pleasantly surprised how I didn&#x27;t react negatively to it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic oil.  High quality and useful for a variety of purposes.  As the cold pours into the Pacific Northwest, I tend to get dry skin on my face and hands.  This oil has done a great job of keeping my skin highly moisturized without having a greasy or clogging feeling.  My wife also uses it on her hair and nails and gets great results.  I would highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> The Virgin Argan Oil from Aria feels wonderful on my skin.  It makes my face smooth and soft.  I use it alone and also add a little to my other face creams.  I can see a difference.  I have rough patch on my arm and it has helped soften it up and make it look better.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Oil works great for my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with thin frizzy hair for awhile now, and once i used this oil my hair is so soft and shiny! My hair feels so much healthier i am so impressed. The only thing is that the price is a bit expensive but it&#x27;s all worth it!</li>
    <li> Good quality. It soaks in the skin very easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling you&#x27;d expect from an oil.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations  for relief of psoriasis rash</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! It is a great value and came very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this for a face moisturizer.  Very clean and makes my face feel so smooth.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I used it as an oil treatment for my hair with some olive oil and it repaired a lot of my dryness and brittleness from my ends. Fantastic product will purchase again</li>
    <li> I love it. Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Ok oil. Broke my face out. Used it in hair and needed up greasy and then to dry after being in my hair for a bit.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;Came quickly as promised. Great product. Came in dark glass bottle which is awesome because I know that the oil is protected from sun damage. I had been buying acures argan oil but it comes in a clear glass and the oil seems thicker than and tinted to me. Took forever to absorb. This is by far a better product.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works great and I received it so fast!! Thank you will be ordering again!!</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this argan oil!!! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted !! Shipment was quick and the company even checked to see if I was happy with my order !!!</li>
    <li> I bought it for some one else but she said she love it</li>
    <li> I love this oil! Works great with my daughter&#x27;s curly hair to tame the curls and less frizz. Works best right out of the shower or after wetting the hair down.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil on my face and hair and I love it.  I have never put oil on my face before and I was surprised that I did not feel greasy and was not shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long curly hair and need to mix the oil with some leave-in conditioner for my hair . The oil alone did a pretty good job, but the conditioner mix is the best. Plus it cuts down on costs because my hair needs like half a dropper full of the oil when I don&#x27;t mix it.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT, FEEL LIGHT, MY HAIR IS SO RICH &amp; HEALTHY AFTER USING</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  My scalp no longer itches and my hair always feels refreshed especially applying Argan oil to my hair right after my shower.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Works great on my dry hair and hands. Pleased!</li>
    <li> Compared to the Josie Maran bottle of argan oil I just finished, this brand is thinner and has a stronger smell and may take some getting used to. After researching facts about 100% Argan oil properties; the oil color, packaging and smell, this brand pretty much nails it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is exactly as advertised and it is perfect. The consistency of argan oil, in my opinion, seems to be like that of coconut oil, but thicker. It&#x27;s thick, but not greasy, and absorbs really well into skin, leaving it soft and smooth. I&#x27;m a huge love of coconut oil and wanted to give argan oil a try and I really honestly have to say that argan oil is becoming my first choice in oils really quickly. :)</li>
    <li> Great oil.  Everyone needs it for your hair and face</li>
    <li> Great Oil! I use this on my dry winter face and it soaks right in leaving my skin feeling so good! I will try it on my hair as well! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Awesome it&#x27;s great for your face, not greasy. Wish I had found it sooner!</li>
    <li> I received the Argan oil and was a little skeptical because a lot of products promise wonderful results,but none have ever stood behind their word,except yours. I bought it mostly for my hair, it&#x27;s dry and frizzy because of coloring and heat tools. So I thought I would put it to the test, i showered- shampooed and conditioned,towel dried and applied a few drops of the oil. I was going to apply my other products and changed my mind. I started to blow dry my hair and immediately noticed my hair was softer and more manageable. It had this soft,light, healthy appearance. I thought it was just me that noticed till I met a few friends for dinner who complimented me on my hair and asked if I had been to a salon. I now love my hair and its appearance. I am 100% happy with the results! Thank you for this product&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Love that it is pure organic argan oil vs a blend!!!</li>
    <li> this has the most awful smell, as if it&#x27;s gone bad. Returned</li>
    <li> Love this. I have only used for a few days and I love the difference my skin feels! Worth The Price!</li>
    <li> I have spent a fortune on anti-aging face creams with limited results. In addition, I&#x27;m sensitive to the perfumes and additives in many products. I spent alot of time researching argan oil and was happy to find 100% organic with no additives. I have been using argan oil daily for less than a month, and am already seeing positive results with reduction in fine lines on my face and a softer appearance. It has little odor and absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s also been great to use on dry winter skin with no greasy feel. A couple drops have been great to tame processed hair.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a very trusted health aware friend.  I always am skeptical of products and the claims they make, but this one has been spot on.  Being 100% I checked out the label and decided it was worth a try.  It&#x27;s the one&#x27;s that aren&#x27;t truly 100% and that skimp on the real stuff to save money you stay away from.  I use this on my skin when it&#x27;s dry and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel at all.  I also use it on my hair when I wash it if I don&#x27;t want to use a hot tool to straighten or curl it.  It takes any frizz or fly aways right out and leaves my hair shiny without a greasy look or feel.  I highly recommend anyone use this if they don&#x27;t like using to much heat on their hair every time they wash it.  Your hair will than you!!  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Love it! works great on my hair, face and body. I have gray hair and just a small amount on my wet hair keeps my hair from getting frizzy and gives it a good shine. I also use it as my facial moisturizer. Smooths out my skin and by using it daily I have fewer fine lines, especially on my neck. Able to get it for a much lower price than buying from a drug store and this is a much better product.</li>
    <li> I have the most tickest and frizziest hair ever! And let&#x27;s say it simply works! I had tried allllll kinds of products but literally no use! It always took me around 2 to 3 hours to straighten my hair but now with the help of Argan Oil, I do it in 45 minutes. After taking a shower I use some drops and massage my scalp, and i will have shiny curls for the whole day. I can fix my hair in every style that I wish very easily. Also my husband&#x27;s toe was a little bit dried out and flaky I used Argan oil and it looks just fine :)</li>
    <li> No odor which was excellent. Great for skin.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. Exactly what i wanted and excellent quality. Order went smoothly and shipped much quicker than projected.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin so soft. I have to use more than 3-4 drops, more like 6-8, but that usually covers my face, neck and  tops of my hands. My hands are extremely dry due to washing them all the time, as I am a nurse. Sometimes I use a bit more for my hands, but it works well. Thank you, and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my face, body and nails. Not long enough to really say whether it&#x27;s working, so I&#x27;ll follow up later.</li>
    <li> light and great and makes skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> it good i use as a moisturizer.but it doesn&#x27;t makes any difference</li>
    <li> It caused a little bit of redness at first but it maybe because I applied it directly to my skin. I love it though, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on my face &amp; it is quickly absorbed. Love how smooth &amp; soft my skin feels.Tried it on my scalp. For years I have tried everything for dandruff &amp; nothing seems to work. I am already seeing my dandruff go away!</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is everything they say it is,  and does everything the company claims. Mild, nearly invisible smell (no fragrance). Comes in a dark glass bottle with a glass dropper so nothing gets wasted,  and you never touch the contents of the bottle with anything. Also,  there is a safety seal on the bottle. Not a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;  product, extremely high quality...worth the price (a little bit goes a long way!) I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Just started to use this product, was using another brand that was more expensive so my opinion is just in the beginning stages. Be sure to use a drop or two to find out how well it absorbs into your skin. I was using a lighter formular of argan oil. We will see in a couple of weeks what works better for me. So far, it&#x27;s all good.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast and that pleased me. The price is a good bargain for the size bottle I received. Stay tuned. Thanks AriaStarrBeauty!</li>
    <li> very fine quality, not too greasy. Absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!  It has really tamed my flyaway hair without making it oily. Love that I can use it on my skin too!</li>
    <li> This oil feel amazing! No oily residue on your skin once absorbed. I am very happy with this oil and will happly repurchase as needed :)</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to. I have used it for smoothing flyaway hairs and moisturizing nail beds and cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if the bottle had a squirting top rather than a dropper top.</li>
    <li> Odd consistency, doesn&#x27;t seem pure and smells awful.</li>
    <li> I tried the Argan Oil and LOVE IT....I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw before my eyes when putting&lt;br /&gt;it on my skin. I saw immediate results.  Not greasy but smooth and soft and the look lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on the back of my hands as well as my face.  It gave my hands a smooth polished finish.&lt;br /&gt;As for my face, it left a soft  healthy glow. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works well to give my greying hair some texture, softness, and shine. I also use it on my face at night. I have used other oils that contained argan—but this is the first pure product. And it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love. It initially has an off putting smell but it is quickly absorbed and the smell dissipates. My face is soft and glowing! It also works really well to make my hair soft and shiny. I can&#x27;t  compare this to other brands of argan oil because I&#x27;ve never used it previously but I&#x27;m so impressed with this brand I think I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be looking anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product but think I will really like it. It goes on smoothly and makes the areas around my eyes feel nice. I use it on my hair, and it really tames my frizzies. There is no miracle to make wrinkles go away in an instant, and hair texture is what it is, but nice product in the fight against them!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  This is my go to Argan oil. I won&#x27;t by any other brand.</li>
    <li> Soften my hair! I love this product!</li>
    <li> I use it as a daily moisturizer for my face and really like it.  It takes only a few drops to cover my entire face and the moisturizing effect lasts all day.  It also appears to be decreasing the wrinkles on my forehead.  I&#x27;ve added a few drops to my body lotion but probably haven&#x27;t used it long enough, yet, to notice any effects from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the medicine dropper because that makes it easy to control the amount you are using.  I&#x27;ve purchased a second bottle but haven&#x27;t begun using it, yet.  One bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Love!  Would order again!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Josie maran Argan oil which is like $18 for not even half of this one. I loved it but pricey. Saw this on Amazon and bought it since I was running out of my JM. Love it!!! So much cheaper and works great for my dry spots on my face. It&#x27;s very light and not as thick as JM. Definitely recommend :) will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry skin and dry hair.</li>
    <li> Worked beyond my expectations! My hair is now soft and curly...didn.t have to use the new curlers I just bought....not greasy...liquid gold in a bottle! Thank you...will buy again! A+ product, exemplary customer service!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. I love it!</li>
    <li> I saw a noticeable difference after a day!</li>
    <li> not impressive;  will not reorder</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I use it daily. Light weight, applies well and mixes great with essential oils. I spray it on me. Works great with my small pump sprayer.</li>
    <li> I am an older female and my hair gets dry, and I wanted to use an all natural product on my hair.  Though many hair products are using Argan oil now, it seems the amount of oil used is small, and the product is generally loaded with perfumes and sometimes chemicals.  So I was thrilled to find this 100% organic pure Argan oil.  When my hair is wet, I message 2 drops of Argan oil into my hair and the results are excellent.  My hair is softer, shinier, not dry and not greasy or oily in appearance.  Wonderful, cost effect product, since a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used this product.  I love it.  It is non-greasy and my skin feel so good after using it.  I also use it on my hair.  Thanks.  lj</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months now and love it. I was initially worried that it would end up costing a lot more than regular lotion because it&#x27;s a small bottle, but you only use a few drops at a time so it lasts a long time. The smell takes a little getting used to because it&#x27;s organic and all natural. It has a woody sort of smell that isn&#x27;t the best but you get used to it. I&#x27;d prefer that over artificial smells created with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks more supple and has acquired a healthy glow since using argan oil. I have naturally oily skin so I was concerned it would  make my skin greasy or break out. My skin has stayed clear and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2/16/17 I have now been using this product for a couple years and am still in love with it. It is my miracle product. I&#x27;m in my late twenties and my friends are starting to complain about crows feet developing around their eyes and scoff because my eyes show no hints of fine lines. I attribute it to using the argan oil. I use it every night on my face, eyes, and neck. it&#x27;s never irritated the delicate skin around my eyes. This really is liquid gold!</li>
    <li> Although I am still experimenting with using the oil, I must say I have been totally satisfied with all variations of uses.  Where I have applied the oil, the skin or lips are soft, and I am expecting greater results with long-term use.</li>
    <li> Excellent for hair. Excellent for face, cleared my pimples after first application. Odor is not the most pleasant.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This product is easily as good as Josie Maran; smaller bottle but the cost is substantially less.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I use it for my hair and it made my hair shinier than ever! Love it</li>
    <li> I had just received this product and am very pleased.  It absorbs quickly and does not leave you all shiny. I worked it in from root to tip of my hair and it left it soft. Definitely going to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and would highly recommend it to anyone interested!</li>
    <li> Pure oil.  Nice bottle and dropper.  Not much more can be said than that...  I purchased this product at a reduced cost.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like this versatile Argan Oil. I especially appreciated receiving an e-mail from the seller, in advance of the product arriving, explaining it&#x27;s many uses. Well done!</li>
    <li> Great product! Originally bought with the intent of just using it on my skin &amp; nails, but ended up trying it on my hair, as well - &amp; it&#x27;s unbelievable. Been using it under my moisturizer and its made my skin super soft. On my hair it&#x27;s totally eliminated the frizz that happens this time of year in our Houston climate. Good price &amp; super fast delivery. Also excellent customer service - as they follow-up on your satisfaction and really seem to care about their customers. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This argan oil is lightweight. Truly virgin, no additives. Nice clean earthy aroma. Gives my hair an amazing shine after flat ironing. So Silky! I mix a few drops into my hair colour before applying and into my wei east face serum. Love it mixed into my hair mask and deep conditioners.</li>
    <li> It smells good. I use it for skin, and hair. It is smooth.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is indistinguishable from the brand I had been using and the delivery system is much better.  It&#x27;s good to compare and I was pleased with the results.  I put a couple of drops on the back of my hand from both kinds.  They both smelled the same and spread the same.  They were both easy to massage in and both were absorbed into my hand the same leaving it feeling beautifully soft and moisturized.  Both are organic, imported from Morocco and bottled in the US.  In other words, I could see absolutely no difference in the brands.&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil really does a lovely job on its own for multiple purposes, plus I mix it into my recipe for a moisturizing cream.  Paying but a fraction the cost of the expensive brand is obviously a great deal.  Given the even match, the thing that made this brand stand out was that the dropper in the bottle is much better.  Each time I extracted some oil, I got a full dropper from this brand where the other only filled about a quarter full even if I fully squeezed the top.  There is plenty in the bottle so that’s not the problem.  The other brand’s dropper just isn’t very effective. Once extracted from the bottle, I could wait for a drop or two to drip from each dropper or squeeze a bit to deliver how much I wanted more quickly, however with this brand that amount could be a lot more.  That matters when I am applying it to my head and hair for a deep moisturizing treatment since I can finish the job far more quickly.  It also matters when I’m making my cream since I get a consistent amount from the dropper quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this brand.  I’ll be rebuying as needed.</li>
    <li> THIS ARGAN OIL IS THE GREATEST STUFF.I USE IT EVERYWHERE ON MY BODY IT TAKES THE PLACE OF MULTIPLE PRODUCTS .THIS WILL BE A REGULAR IN MY BEAUTY ROUTINE.</li>
    <li> It does everything you claim it does and I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great value. Because of the price I feel I can use it for more than just my face and have put it on the ends of my hair and mixed a few drops into my hand lotion. Be aware! A little goes quite a long way. The first time I used it I put a half a dropper full onto my face and some of it just sat on my skin. The next time I used about 3 drops and spread it all over my face and neck and it absorbed very well.</li>
    <li> Awesome oil not greasy at all!!!! Love the company, my order was received 2 days before the delivery date.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been using this as moisturizer on my face during pregnancy and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan oil in the past with good results, but selected this product because it has no fragrance (I have a sensitivity to strong scents that come with most products of this type).  My main use for this oil is for my dry hair and nails, and after a week of use, I can tell a difference (especially in my hair which is thick, dry and pretty wild).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a small issue with shipping. The first bottle that I received had the cap misthreaded and some of the oil leaked out in delivery. This supplier sent a new bottle right away and it was at my door in two days.  Stuff happens, but it&#x27;s good to know that the supplier is responsive.</li>
    <li> I really love it, it really left my skin beautiful :D (face and hands oh! and hair)</li>
    <li> Good quality oil. I used it on my face and I had no breakouts or skin problems. Will recommend this for people who want to use natural skin products only.</li>
    <li> I like this product...although I&#x27;ve had other Argan oils that were much thicker than this brand but I have no complaints. Its lightweight and good for my hair and skin</li>
    <li> dry skin, and dry hair - this is it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is great, I have a really dry forehead, even when I put lotion and primer before make up it doesn&#x27;t do squat. this stuff is amazing, leaves my skin looking fresh and dewy, and my skin on my forehead is less dry! I also put it on the ends of my hair at night, and wash my hair in the morning! you can also do this after you shower, put it on the ends and blow dry your hair. this stuff is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I received a nice, informative email from the seller after I ordered this. I appreciated that. It arrived on time, and even though I have only had time to use it once, I really love this. It left a nice healthy glow on my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. It does smell a little &amp;#34;grassy&amp;#34; but I added a few drops of my favorite essential oil (grapefruit) and it was wonderful.  I even rub the excess, after using it in my hair, on my face and hands and  they are so soft.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t noticed anything after 2 months</li>
    <li> I have used it twice since I received it but it works great.  I am happy with the result.  I thought it would be heavy and greasy but it is not.  It is very light and my hair is very manageable (it does not go flat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try it on my skin as you suggested.&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use your product.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love, love, love this oil from this company...so much so that I ordered another bottle a few days later! I&#x27;m 65-ish and it does wonders for my hair (smooth and shiny!) and my skin. And organic!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I had temporary eczema on my face and I tried raw shea butter and other natural products but nothing worked. I started using this 100% Pure Argan Oil and it cleared in a week. It also has a luxurious feel on the skin. I&#x27;m definitely getting more.</li>
    <li> A fantastic product, I had a nasty scrape on my hip which was not healing well at all, but as soon as I started using this oil it healed up perfectly with almost no scarring whatsoever. I use it on my hair too to prevent breakage (I have bleach highlights) and encourage growth. Love love love it, and the customer service from Aria Starr has been excellent too.</li>
    <li> Argan oil arrived on time and as described  I have used it for several days and am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> It is positively wonderful! My skin is very happy.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Great vendor.</li>
    <li> Argon Oil is the most awesome product everalso can be used on your cuticles and nails. My dry peeling cuticles will never split and bleed again. One drop is all it takes, and it leaves your nails looking clear healthy and youthful. I’ll never have to get my nails done again. They look as if they were manicured. Bags under your eyes and dark rings from lack of sleep; it seems it works on that too. Like I said a general cure all. I’ll have to get back with everyone on how it works on my hair. It works so awesome on my baggy eyes, stretch marks, and wrinkles that I almost guarantee that it will work great on my hair. I am so happy and the have a guarantee that it will work. You&#x27;re protected By their one year, No Questions Asked Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee, even If You Return the Bottle Empty. Your Satisfaction Is Our #1 Priority</li>
    <li> This oil claimed to lighten dark spots on skin, and I was skeptical.  I received it one day ago, and tried it on the back of one of my hands, putting one drop on my skin and rubbing it in.  I did this three times in one day.  I am amazed and pleasantly surprised to see it lives up to its claims.  After one day of use, the dark spots on that hand are lighter, and some of the smaller spots actually disappeared!  The skin appears less wrinkled and more nourished, brighter and lighter.  Definitely more youthful looking.  I will start using this oil on my crows feet and neck next.  Maybe the &#x27;fountain of youth&#x27; has been found with this stuff.  The only thing slightly negative is the aroma, but it is not strong and dissipates quickly.  But I am glad that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t add any artificial substances to make the smell better.  I would rather use it as is, being 100 percent pure oil.  Thank you for this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Great oil and great price. I just started using this on my four year olds hair, with hopes to help it grow thicker and faster... stay tuned!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  When I was younger I could never use lotions on my face because they would cause to me break out. So my skin was never moisturized for years.  Now that i&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s I have fine lines around my eyes, crows feet and smile lines around my mouth. My face and hands  look dry and unhealthy.  I saw this on Amazon while I was looking for facial care.  It got good reviews and I&#x27;m VERY happy with it.  It is an oil but since my face isn&#x27;t oily now it doesn&#x27;t cause a break out.  My lips have been a little cracked from my lipstick and this is gone with one overnight use. I use it before I put on my lipstick and it adds a bit of shine and doesn&#x27;t cause the lipstick to bleed.  I also tried on my chest for those fine lines I guess from laying on your side at night.  Totally smooth and almost gone after 2 nights.  It hasn&#x27;t helped for the wrinkles around my eyes yet.  Not sure if it will but the smile lines are not as deep and A LOT less noticeable.  I&#x27;m very impressed with how an oil can improve the look of my skin.  This will definitely be part of my morning and night routine.  I just take the dropper and slide it on different parts of my face, rub it in and rub my hands together to soften them too.  Try it.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be impressed.  If you&#x27;re not happy with it pass it along.  It will last a long time and I&#x27;m sure someone will see good results.</li>
    <li> This has worked great on my face! No breakouts and it really moisturizes my skin in this horrible winter weather. It also is not very expensive! It works great on my &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; hair also but I have to be careful to just put it on my dry ends and not anywhere else, my scalp is oily. The company was also very communicative and wanted me to be happy. They asked if I would write a review since I left positive feedback on their store page.</li>
    <li> Being as I have very sensitive, very dry skin, which breaks out easily, I have clearly had a hard to,e finding anything as a decent moisturizer for my face. A friend suggested I use Argan Oil, so I bought this on a whim and I am beyond glad I did. This is the perfect moisturizer for my sensitive skin and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
    <li> I never thought about applying anything to my hair. My hair stylist said I should be cautious of taking care of my hair. The oil definitely make my hair shines and feel light weight.</li>
    <li> I love the oil so far.  Right now I&#x27;m using it as a carrier oil to mix with my essential oil for my face.  I look forward to trying the other suggestions that were for use that were sent.  Fast ship and excellent packaging.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Great price. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair and my face and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> Good quality at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;love this thing... use it on my face, mixed with m lotion after shaving... my face has never been happier&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My bottle smells absolutely rancid, like butter or milk that has turned.Disgusting and completely unusable. Have to assume there are just some bad batches because there&#x27;s no way anyone could be OK with this smell, therefore positive reviewers cannot have a product that smells like mine does.</li>
    <li> I really like this product so far.  it seems to really be helping out the dry ends on my hair.  It also is good to put on my skin at night before bed- seems to absorb quickly.</li>
    <li> Item arrived fast and even better than described! I love it! Makes my skin very soft and also makes it look nice. It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t leave oil residue on my hands and face. It absorbs very quickly. It works really well on my hair too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works to regrow hair, been using it for 2 weeks. I&#x27;ll keep everyone posted.</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS DISGUSTING WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> Very good product I like to use a tiny bit on the ends of my hair  and my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried other Argan oils that I like better. I guess ii is just trail and error. I have tried stuff that I love that other hate ect..&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try for the price point.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin REALLY REALLY smooth and soft... Use this after washing my face and using witch hazel as a toner. I just use 1-3 drops and apply it with my finger tips. I follow it with sunscreen during the day.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel really softt</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great experience. Nice product. Not too oily and I have oily skin. I mix it with my lotion and works great!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Not sure if product is pure, has a slight fish odor.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil I use it on my hair, face and body</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my dry, acne prone skin. I use a prescription retin-a for acne, which leaves my face dry, irritated, and prone to burning in the sun. Whenever I use my moisturizer with SPF (aveeno), my face is too dry, but if I use another moisturizer with it I end up looking like a grease ball. A friend of mine who is a dermatologist recommended this to me, assuring me that it is non-comedogenic and therefor should not cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face in the morning, I put about 3 drops into my hands and then gently pat it onto my face, focusing on the dryer areas. I wait a few minutes for it to soak in, and then add my SPF on top. My skin is soft, moisturized, and matte. I never thought it was possible! I also pat it around my eyes at night instead of an eye cream. I wish I would have found this long ago.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Just got it today. Seems like a great product. Arrived promptly. Nice little dropper type glass bottle. Made my skin visibly softer and seemed to erase dryness.  No odor. Will continue to evaluate.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my dry skin after using my skin felet soft and supple</li>
    <li> Better than advertised. Easy to use--and not much needed per application. The eye dropper is a good idea.  Notice the difference--Great results on my hair, skin, nails. Will buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and Excellent Customer Service.Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love love love this products!!!! thank you so much for selling such great product!! i use it for me and my sons curly hair. his hair used to tangle so bad but ever since I put them after he takes shower, his hair is so smooth and very soft!! so is mine! i would totally recommend this to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Great product! Feels good on the skin and I am sure does good too.&lt;br /&gt;ThaNK YOU.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for less than a week and it has really made a difference in the texture of my hair. It feels much softer and is much more shiny. I am also using this in place of a facial moisturizer and this doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy on my skin</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. I&#x27;ve tried all different amounts all tiny amounts and no matter, but not matter how small- it left my hair with such a thick oil residue that I have had to rewash it each time I used it!  I&#x27;ve tried it 4 different times decreasing the amount each time. The last and final time was tonight. I used about 1/2 a pea in size. I have used various Argan oils for years and I love Argan oil, so It&#x27;s not that I am a novice and using too much. All Argan oils I&#x27;ve used prior to this have been great and good quality, but not this one. It leaves an oily residue that needed to be washed out. My hair felt aweful. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just started using it so i can only comment on the moisturizing benefits of it. i am using this everyday as my facial moisturizer and i use it on my cuticles and on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the oil, I have a very rough dry spot on the edges of my nose that not even the best lotions could help...I saw that this oil moisturises the skin really well so I gave it a shot and wow am I glad I did, I was skeptical at first because of the bad reviews, but now after three days of applying it the dry patch is gone completely and I don&#x27;t have to apply anymore, and it&#x27;s been helping with my facial skin since I got a sunburn I&#x27;ve applied a drop to each zone and I can feel it smoothing my skin out without any rough patches. P.S. I&#x27;ve tried it on my hair too with only two drops every day after a shower, my hair feels so smooth and it looks healthier. VERY SATISFIED.</li>
    <li> This is great! So many uses. I have used it at night and used it under my makeup. I am going to order a new bottle today.</li>
    <li> Did improve my hair within a week of using it!</li>
    <li> Great product and wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> This product is great. The oil helps to moisturize skin but it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling that normal oil has.&lt;br /&gt;It is the nice size, not too big, and not to small. It would last for probably a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;I am content with the product.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived very quick as well!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve applied it directly to my face and hair, and I&#x27;ve also added a few drops to my lotions. My skin feels smoother and my acne scars are fading even after just 2 weeks of regular application.</li>
    <li> Great oil, absorbs quicly and leaves your skin soft and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I love this! My skin and my hair feel so much better when I use this oil</li>
    <li> I am a returning customer- and still loving this product!! I now use this product on my preggo belly, as well as my face, arms, legs, hair, etc. Since becoming pregnant, I&#x27;ve been increasingly dry and this helps TONS!!! Plus, I don&#x27;t want to use anything scented or chemically enhanced on my body, so this is perfect!! My Dr. is pleased I&#x27;m using this product rather then the typical Palmers lotion for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, its excellent</li>
    <li> I truely love it. This is the first argan oil product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks. On my hair, I&#x27;d immediately noticed how soft and silky my it became. It&#x27;s also less brittle. I have very long, thick, wavy hair so I tend to collect a significant amount of hair after conditioning. Since using this argan oil, I&#x27;ve noticed the amount of hair collected is less (I still need to use conditioner though). I use about 15 drops in my hair every other washing. Using 5 drops at a time after towel drying, I rub it into my palms and tossle it into my hair (first finger combing while my head is back, then 5 more drops while my head is leaned forward, then another 5 drops working it the hair while it&#x27;s laying on my head like cousin &amp;#34;It&amp;#34;.) By this time, it&#x27;s been worked into my hands &amp; fingertips, so I haven&#x27;t had to use my cuticle oil. I&#x27;ve also started using it as a moisterizer. It&#x27;s been terribly dry this winter and the skin around my face got chaffed after blowing my nose so often. I&#x27;ve used my daily facial moisterizer and it was still flakey. After one use of the argan oil, the roughness around my nose went away. It&#x27;s got a very slight scent. I&#x27;ve got oily skin so every instinct was telling me not to put more oil on my face, but this is remarkable. The oil absorbs well and no heaviness at all. So ever since, I&#x27;ve been using it as a night moisterizer after I remove my makeup. Haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes with the issues under my eyes, but have only been using it there for about a week (I have fine lines and somewhat dark circles). I also use a drop daily for my chapped lips. This oil has healed my lips faster than any balms I&#x27;ve used. Even makes my lipstick feel less dry (applied after oil is well absorbed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also purchased a bottle for my husband as beard oil. He uses about 7 drops as he&#x27;s got a very long goatee and whatever&#x27;s left on his palms he rubs all over his face. He normally doesn&#x27;t use facial moisterizer and he&#x27;s amazed at how &amp;#34;not dry&amp;#34; his face is this winter. He&#x27;d also noticed that when he pulls on his goatee, there&#x27;s also less breakage there. He almost never uses any kind of products whatsoever, but this has converted him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a fantastic product.s amazed at how &amp;#34;not dry&amp;#34; his face is this winter. He&#x27;d also noticed that when he pulls on his goatee, there&#x27;s also less breakage there. He almost never uses any kind of products whatsoever, but this has converted him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This is good oil. I use a bit for my hair and love the way it feels and looks. Not greasy or weighed down. Helps keep my hair straighter longer when I flat iron it. I don&#x27;t apply it before flat ironing. Just a small amount after I&#x27;ve flat ironed.</li>
    <li> Good product and my GF has been using it. It seeems to be working and has reduced ger frizz considerably.</li>
    <li> I love this! I bought it with intention of using it in my hair, I now use it everywhere. I have replaced my face cream with it. It feels amazing on my skin, light, not oily. I have extremely sensitive skin and everything makes my face break out, but this product actually seems to soothe my skin and my acne is disappearing! love love love.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have purchase this.  I have been using it as a moisturizer on my face and also in a leave in conditioner for my hair.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I just started using this oil &amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34; and I am amazed of its result. My hair looks so full with just 2 to 3 drops of organ oil after I shampooed and towel dried my hair. All should try this oil, it is perfect because it&#x27;s pure, no drop of chemical in it. It is one of the safest oil everyone must in the house. Honestly, I love this oil, I am planning to buy more soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Really appreciated the email with recommended uses for and benefits of Argan Oil, too.  Shipped very quickly.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I must admit I was skeptical at first.  As a diabetic, my skin is extremely dry. This winter it has been dry, red, flaky and bumpy- so much so that I cannot wear makeup other than mascara. I&#x27;ve tried countless moisterizers that didn&#x27;t help or exacerbated my problems.  This oil was a god send. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and noticed my redness was gone within the first 24 hours.  The bumps have diminished as has the flakiness. My skin is beginning to look healthy again and my skin is starting to glow.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, 3 drops, and it rubs in well. Once in the morning and again before bed.  Remember it is a dry oil so it doesn&#x27;t slather like lotion, but I haven&#x27;t had any issue with massaging it into my skin. I feel like this small bottle will last me a while.  Some reviews noted a bad scent but I haven&#x27;t noticed it.  There is a scent if you hold the bottle to your nose but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hopeful that my skin will continue to improve with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 8/3/16 - I no longer use this.  My face broke out after a month of use.</li>
    <li> Oil is very thin and drips out of eye dropper, I hope this is the real Argan oil! Other that I have purchased was much thicker and did not drip out of the eye dropper.</li>
    <li> OMGosh... This is fantastic .. It is not oily at all - it goes on like a light powder .. I definitely would notice if it were oily as I have Italian complexion  that can get oily on its own ... noticed a difference in fine lines  ... This was my first purchase &amp;amp; will be buying it again &amp;amp; have already recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week now in my homemade dog shampoo as well as straight out of the bottle for my own lips, cuticles, face &amp; hair. I live in the desert where dry skin &amp; chapped lips seem to be the norm--even several hours after applying to my lips they still feel moisturized and soft. I really love this oil and the price is just right. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Works but it really stinks in my opinion so I don&#x27;t really feel like putting it on.</li>
    <li> Fast, good packaging and great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with the product you gave me. I will be buying more and more products like this. It was such a good investment &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Out of three brands of Argan oil I&#x27;ve tried this brand has the best scent.  Unless I&#x27;m wrong that means it&#x27;s from virgin pressings of the Argan nut.  Keep up the quality, Aria Starr, and I&#x27;ll keep buying.</li>
    <li> My skin is smoother and looks more hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  Extremely moisturizing, not heavy nor does it leave an oily residue.  It absorbs into your thirsty skin.</li>
    <li> Being a woman of a certain &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; I was looking for something that would help with the wrinkles in the skin of my arms and also something I could use as a face moisturizer.  This oil worked wonders.  I saw a difference in my arms within the first two applications of the oil.  This will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; oil in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed. This oil seems to stay on the surface of my skin. It does not seem to absorb well and my hands look as bad as before it was used. I can use other lotions/oils/creams that work much better than this. I won&#x27;t reorder and I think these reviews are a bit iffy. There should never be several per day or every other day, even for the best products with many, many reviews. That&#x27;s seems contrived to me.</li>
    <li> This oil feels wonderful on my skin and hair. I just started using it, so I don&#x27;t feel comfortable giving it 5 stars yet, but so far, absolutely no complaints! I was looking for something to keep my terribly dry locks and cheeks a bit more moisturized in these brutal winter months. This is doing the trick!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for a week, but I love what it does for my hair in terms of smoothing out the fly-aways and frizz after blow drying. The oil creates an instant shine, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair look overly oily. The smell of the oil is subtle and the best part is that I only need to use 2-4 drops for my very long hair. I was concerned that I would go through the bottle quickly because it is only 1 oz, but because of the quality of the oil you only need a few drops. Worth the investment and glad that I didn&#x27;t sacrifice quality for a more affordable argan oil option.</li>
    <li> I was pretty terrified to try argan oil, but I&#x27;d tried all kinds of moisturizers for my face and I still had periods of very oily and very dry and flakey skin. I am acne prone and so any sort of &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; makes me want to run for the hills. When I first used this product, I instantly loved the light feel and woodsy smell. I began by putting it directly on my face after letting my benzoyl peroxide sit for about 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve since started mixing a 3-4 drops with my normal day and night moisturizers, as well as, mixing 1-2 drops with my eye cream in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results (with 1 month of use):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so much smoother and my pores are a lot smaller. I can tell that my skin is brighter and healthier looking and just glows. I actually have experienced LESS breakouts and my skin has been more even, without period of being very oily or very dry. I&#x27;ve since started using a few drops in the ends of my hair before work and it really softens it and doesn&#x27;t look greasy or oily, like coconut oil (in my experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned that the RIGHT type of oil can really balance your skin and help control the sebum that causes so much trouble with your skin.</li>
    <li> I have replaced my moisturizer and some of my hair conditioner with Argan oil and have been really happy with the results.  I use it as a stand-alone hair conditioner, add it to my hair conditioner and use 2-3 drops on my skin.  After I shower, I put it on my skin as a moisturizer and the dryness of the oil does not leave me feeling as oily as my regular lotion.  I can&#x27;t say that this oil is life-changing as some articles would have you believe, but it&#x27;s working great so far.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;Oh my goodness!  I read your email last night before I went to bed and thought I would try a few of your recommendations. I am amazed with the results I achieved with just the first use.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I did was took the dropper and lubricated my scalp and massaged for about 10 minutes. My hair is chemically relaxed, naturally silver and I have a blunt cut that is just above my shoulder. By the way, I&#x27;ve been using argan oil products (with other added oils) for months now and find them to be helpful, but not PURE ORGANIC argan oil. I knew my intent was to retouch my hair today, so I left the oil on all night. When I brushed my hair this morning it looked like I had just had it done and my scalp felt great.  While my scalp was moisturized, my hair was not excessively oily. Normally, I would &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; my scalp with Vaseline prior to relaxer application to minimize irritation but didn&#x27;t see the need today.  I had no irritation during the relaxer process and after washing my hair I used about a dropper full and massaged it throughout my hair prior to blow drying and flat ironing. I could go on and on, but my hair looks even better than it normally does. This product is a keeper and I will be reordering.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to do my nails and I&#x27;ve already massaged the oil into my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me when I tell you I rarely write reviews but couldn&#x27;t pass up an opportunity to let you know I&#x27;m already hooked&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good &amp; i haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I had used argan oil before but had ordered it from another distributor.  This is just as good as the other.  I mostly use this for my hair which is long and tends to be dry as I use color on it.  Argan oil is the answer to the dryness problem.  My hair is shiny and easy to comb through.  My hairdresser tells me it is in good condition. Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I love this! I use argan oil in my homemade deep conditioners, after I wash my face at night,  and even as a cuticle oil. I&#x27;m not sure how I stumbled across this brand but I&#x27;m awfully glad I did.</li>
    <li> This product works great for hair.  I frequently color my  hair and it&#x27;s long, so it&#x27;s prone to dryness. Just put a few drops in your damp hair (preferably closer to the ends). It works great as a detangler.  A little goes a long way. I also have bad eczema and I am surprised that I am not allergic to Argan Oil.....  because I&#x27;m allergic to everything (even my son&#x27;s baby soap).  It dries fast and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  I will definitely buy more .</li>
    <li> Great product and a wonderful vendor! My hair has never felt better!</li>
    <li> This oil has really benefited my hair. I started getting compliments the first time I used it! I also use it post shower on my legs and works well for my skin as well.</li>
    <li> Great to use after shampoo!  I also put some on at night on my face.  I found out that the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; fragrance is because it is all organic and the smell goes away almost immediately once applied</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks of putting in this oil in my hair and I can already see a dramatic change in my hair! Looks so much healthier and shinier!  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love how it works with my hair and my hands..:)</li>
    <li> Only been using it for a 10 days or so. But my hair is looking shiny and healthy. Very non-greasy and barely any smell so you can apply it right after washing.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, although it does have a slightly bitter smell. It absorbs SUPER quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it for your face (like I do), then I HIGHLY recommend following these steps:&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse your face and neck area with your usual cleanser, and pat dry. DO NOT USE SERUMS OR MOISTURIZERS YET!&lt;br /&gt;Take 2-3 drops of Vitamin C and rub between your palms. Pat this all over your face and let dry.&lt;br /&gt;Take 2-3 drops of the Argan Oil and rub between your palms. Pat this all over your face also, and let it absorb into your skin. If it hasn&#x27;t absorbed into your skin all the way within 5 minutes, massage it in until there&#x27;s none left. After you&#x27;ve done this, you&#x27;re ready to do your makeup or head out the door. Your skin will thank you for this!!! I have really bad acne scars, and this routine is really helping a lot with diminishing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this for your hair, I suggest putting it in while your hair is still damp so that it can absorb it better, and so that it doesn&#x27;t look and feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Works well. I really like the way my hair feels after using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING...I am not a youngster and this has diminished some of my deeper wrinkles to nearly non existent in just a few weeks!!! My skin is greatly improved and am now starting to use it on my hands too...will continues to explore its uses on nails and hair also.  But until my entire exploration is done, I suggest you BUY THIS PRODUCT....IT WORKS better than I expected.</li>
    <li> For some unknown reason (I have an appointment with a skin care specialist ) I&#x27;ve been waking up with dry, flaky skin on my nose... used several moisturizers that were effective.... for about a minute! Using the Argan Oil once before bedtime and once in the morning leaves my skin looking great... but if I miss one session, the flaky skin returns. Like I said, I&#x27;m still in the research phase but so far I&#x27;m a true believer in this oil.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from my flaky areas, I use it on my entire face since it&#x27;s my understanding that it supposedly evens skin tone. Fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;And this side note: it seemed to heal my damaged cuticles overnight... which was pretty cool to witness.</li>
    <li> We love the argan oil. My husband&#x27;s thick and frizzy hair is looking great! Will purchase again.Thank you!</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is beneficial to my skin from head to toe. After I started using it my face, throat arms, body legs and my feet are so smooth and soft. No more dry skin. The bottom of my feet were so dry and flaky, now with the used of this virgin Argan oil at least twice a day (after shower and before bed) my feet are now smooth. I have no more problems putting on my stockings and knee highs anymore. After a week I already felt the difference it makes with my skin. I have used other moisturizing creams before and this Argan oil is the best. I will be ordering more for my supply.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I use it for my skin and hair....great moisterizer for both!</li>
    <li> I have very long color treated hair which is dry at the ends but oily towards the roots.  This is BY FAR the BEST Organic Argan Oil that I have found that smooths the ends of my hair without creating extra oil in my hair.  There really isn&#x27;t a scent so I feel comfortable using the excess that I have left on my hands for my face.  What a wonder that has done for my skin.  It has helped moisturized my skin as well as give me a dewy glow once I have applied my foundation.  I now have a product that I can use in more than one way and I am now SOLD !!!!</li>
    <li> I read the great reviews about Argan oil and was curious about it. I have tried and used many natural oils on my skin for many years, including coconut oil, Vit E, A,C, olive oils and others, and they are all are good and I use them in mixtures on the rest of my body. I find all store bought facial moisturizers and body lotions have to many unwanted additives and have never really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or natural ones have not been very impressive on my skin. I am lucky to have always had very good skin, even after years of suntanning and not really using any protection. I have combination skin on my face, and my skin did not seem like any product I put on it, most were too greasy and pore clogging, even causing some minor outbreaks - so I stopped using anything for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have added on some years, I started trying different moisturizers and skin products. Some were okay, others were too heavy and none really seemed to do anything except add grease to my face and created blackheads. Everyone seemed to have their favorites and I tried just about everything, including some expensive brands that I saw no benefits for the money spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently read many positive comments about Virgin Argan oil. So a few weeks ago I ordered some.  I have been using many natural oil combinations, such as Vitamin E, C, A, coconut and olive oils on my face and body.  I must say I really likes the way this Virgin Argan Oil makes the skin on my face look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I was showing some a rosacea like redness around my nasal area for many months. I am not really fair skinned, but slightly olive. Since using the Virgin Argan oil, the redness has gone away from around my nose.  This oil is very light and absorbs quickly into my skin, leaving a fresh hydrated glow to my skin. It does not look greasy, and yet maintains the glow for hours, unlike other oils I use which take more time to absorb, and leave a greasier film on my face.  I like this oil a lot and will continue to order it. I am so glad I tried it. I don&#x27;t have to search anymore.ce.  I like this oil a lot and will continue to order it. I am so glad I tried it. I don&#x27;t have to search anymore.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. No damage to the package or product. I ordered this item from Aria StarrBeauty.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I bought this for skin care but I found that I prefer Rose Hip oil. Nothing particularly wrong with Argan oil...just not for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased argon oil after reading the many benefits to skin and hair.  This product is obsorbed quickly on skin and does not feel sticky.  It feels wonderful!  Will buy again from AriaStarrBeauty</li>
    <li> I suspect this facility doesnot follow sanitary practices. I found a dead spider inside the dropper. It was probably in there before the oil. It is really well preserved!! Now do i dare use it? Especially as a preganant woman looking to buy an honest product!?</li>
    <li> Great product. I have dealt with skin breakouts on my face into my adult life and this is the first skincare product that has worked effectively.</li>
    <li> Took good care of my hair prone to breakages easily. I felt that my hair could grow longer without being weighed down. Is not greasy and very light.</li>
    <li> Great product, slight smell after application but that goes away.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great price!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product!! I love the way it leaves my hair, shiny and not frizzy! Is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.  I have been using a much more expensive brand and compared the 2 and they are the same.  This does have a very slight woodsy smell, I guess from the argan nut, but for the price and the same benefits of the expensive one, I am overlooking it.  I use Argan Oil every day, twice a day, on my face, neck, hair and hands. The transformation is amazing and my hair always looks like a came out of a salon.</li>
    <li> My skin has always been on the dry side( hands/feet crack)  for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for something to help . I&#x27;ve tried so many over the counter grocery store/pharmacy lotions/potions over the years and euqally doctor presriptions too . Nothing has helped ! They either just make it worse,no better, rubs right off, too greasy..........it&#x27;s no wonder because when you read the book long list of questionable ingrediants........I think .....how can all this stuff possibly be good for me with no idea of what most of it is, where it came from or how it was processed ? ? When you keep trying the same thing over and over and nothing gets better ...... IT&#x27;s TIME FOR A CHANGE ! I started looking on Amazon/reading reviews looking for something that had a very short list of HEALTHY CERTIFIED ORGANIC INGREDIANTS to help my dry skin problem and found this virgin Argan Oil by Aria Starr and ordered .It arrived promptly and I started using it immediatly. Although I haven&#x27;t been using it that long , I&#x27;ve noticed a postive difference right away . A small amount goes a long way, even though it&#x27;s an oil when you rub it in your skin (body, face, my feet /hands, hair) it feels like it&#x27;s really being deeply absorbed and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy but baby soft and lasts throughout the day, then the night when I put some more on before bed . You DON&#x27;T have to just keep slathering it on all the time like the other questionable quote skin products I have bought over the years . I&#x27;m really feeling positive about this Argan Oil and most importantly my skin is improving already, from feeling constantly dry all the time to feeling moist, feeling so vey soft throughout the day/night and looking much more healthy already . Something I have&#x27;nt felt or seen for far too many years . So far , SO GOOD ! I took pictures before I stared using and will take after pictures in intervals as I continue using and give you an update in a month or two but I am definately pleased with my purchase and would recomend it to others !😀urchase and would recomend it to others !😀</li>
    <li> After trying several different types of argan oil, I have to say I like this one the best. I have a friend who had some precancerous spots on her face that the dermatologist scraped off. When she told me, I had just been to the hairdresser who told me about the many uses of argan oil. I bought some from her because it was supposedly pure. (Turns out it wasn&#x27;t) i wanted my friend to try using some to help heal the marks the dermatologist had left on her face, but she insisted that she wanted pure, organic argan oil only. So I looked online at Amazon.com. We kept looking until we found this oil, then I ordered it for her because I would get it fast with Prime. I also ordered a bottle for myself. It arrived and I took it to her the same day. Yesterday when Ii saw her, her face looked perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad she insisted on not using the more expensive, scented argan oil I had bought at the hairdressers. I&#x27;ll use that up, but from now on, I&#x27;ll be buying this really PURE argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best, and after doing some research online, I know that using argan oil is actually beneficial to the environment. The trees roots go deep and are helpful in holding back the desert. It also helps empower the women on the region who extract the seeds from the fruit. The fruit itself feeds the livestock. In other words, this is a product where everybody wins. So much better than red palm oil which is destroying habitat. I can use this without any guilt. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> its ok...i didnt see any difference even after 3 weeks..</li>
    <li> The Virgin Argan Oil product is working very well for me. I use it on my face and neck to keep my skin moist and healthy. I also mix it with my lotion to use on my body especially my hands and feet. I tried it on the dry ends of my hair to keep it shiny and had good results. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product 3 times now. One very key point, these oils are not all the same, in spite of their similar description (100% organic Argan oil). Purchased elsewhere and found it too oily, hence I went back to this product because 3 small drops are perfect on the face, even with very oily skin like mine.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> After 4 days of applying twice a day, I noticed some of the defined lines in my forhead had dissipated.</li>
    <li> Product came as advertised.</li>
    <li> I use two drops usually with some Jojobo oil at night. i love the combination for my skin. It absorbs fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel overly oily or sticky at night.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I had to order a second bottle because I went through the first one so fast. I use it for my hair and skin mostly. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this Argan oil. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face 2x a day. In the morning I like to moisten a cotton ball with my astringent and then I add 2 drops of Argan oil on top of that and I found it then spreads nice and evenly on my face and just feels like a nice light layer of moisture before putting on makeup.  My skin looks and feels wonderful and my Bare Minerals powder foundation goes on top of it just fine. At night after cleansing I use 2-3 drops on my fingers rubbed together and then pat around on my face.  I&#x27;m excited because I have had no breakouts at all since using Argan oil and even though I&#x27;m 54, I usually have a pimple or two trying to plague me. One day I tried my previous face moisturizer because I was curious to make a comparison. Results were that the Argan oil wins hands down for a much better look and feel to my skin. Also love it for my lips before applying lipstick, and for my hands and feet. Rub 6-7 drops well onto your feet and cover with socks for a little while. It soaks in after awhile and is not greasy. Feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! I thought the advised 2-3 drops were too later for my long hair so I put 6 drops and it made my hair really oily so good to know you really only need 2-3 drops which will make the product last longer.  I also tried it on my face and surprisingly it was absorbed right away with no oily feeling.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it with my nails too!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil.  Love to use it, makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I am relatively new to using oil instead of regular moisturizer but I have to say that I love it! Im almost 30 and have struggled with acne since my teens. I&#x27;m going to give it a good amount of time to see how it helps with that but my skin feels soft and smooth so it&#x27;s a good start. I&#x27;ve been using it in my hair as well and it&#x27;s definitely helping my long curly hair be soft and de frizzed. I read that some people dislike the smell of argon oil but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;d rather something pure like this product then somethig with added fragrances.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product many times. Use twice daily with moisturizer &amp; highly recommend. Wonderful for face, hands, nails and hair.</li>
    <li> The oil is wonderful and tones down strong essential oils beautifully.  When used for skin application, it is very easy to apply and one does not need to use too much to reap the benefits of Argan oil.  I love it and also learned that it can be used on my face and neck mixed with essential oils beneficial for skin care.  I have used Aria Starr&#x27;s Argan Oil for over one year now and I love it! There are several different ways to use the oil and I like to use it on my hair and face. I mix Argan Oil with other essential oils for maximum benefit.</li>
    <li> Very good product, light not heavy on Hair or skin.</li>
    <li> Works well for softening skin.</li>
    <li> I love it very comparable to Josie Maran&#x27;s  which I have been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my skin especially my face, my cuticles.  It does wonders for your hair and it&#x27;s 100% natural.... you can&#x27;t go wrong with it</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this Argan oil because it is fragrance and colorant free. Since I use it as a hot oil treatment for my hair, I don&#x27;t need any unnecessary perfumes clashing with my shampoo. It is a lovely thick oil, organic from Morocco, and excellent as a conditioner for hair and nails. If you&#x27;ve never used Argan oil to help maintain a mani-pedi you are in for a treat. Your cuticles will look flawless! Excellent quality. A+</li>
    <li> Second bottle I have bought of this oil. I use it for makeup remover and facial moisturizer, and use a tiny bit in my hair. Very pleased with it. A great product to use especially if you are allergic to most products containing fragrance and other chemicals!</li>
    <li> Exactly as it states. I&#x27;m happy!!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now. I use it as a moisturizer overnight and I wake up with fresh skin. Absolutely love it. I&#x27;m purchasing another for my mom.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> What a great product for my hair... Loveeeee it!!</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil made my crazy static hair turn into soft and shiny hair which I could manage beautifully without having all that static.  A great find!!!</li>
    <li> Just received the oil and used it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;It is very smooth not greasy. My face and body absorba it very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my hair, and had no idea it could be used on your skin. My skin is very dry, and after using it on my face at night, my face is not as dry. I have just started to use a flat iron, and this product was recommended to stop my hair from drying out. It&#x27;s to soon to know if it works for my hair. My hair is normally in good condition.</li>
    <li> package arrived within a few days, way ahead of the estimated arrival date given. After reading some reviews, I was afraid the argan oil would smell, but it absolutely did not. After a few days, there is less facial fine lines and my hair is &amp;#34;fluffier&amp; not weighed down like after using conditioners. This bottle will last a long time, but I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The sellers are very adamant that you will enjoy this product</li>
    <li> works very well as a moisturizer.  it keeps my skin soft all through winter and it works wonderfully well as an eye make up remover.  it smells a little rancid.  but i am not sure what argan oil supposed to smell like.</li>
    <li> Before my Argan Oil even arrived, I received an email from Aria, the founder of Aria Starr Beauty letting know some of the best ways to use the oil. That kind of service is rare, and really special. So far, using the oil makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the argan oil for a few days, but liking it a lot so far.  A couple drops is what I&#x27;ve been using for face moisturizer morning and night and I love the feeling.  My face isn&#x27;t oily and makeup goes on well and stays on.  No oily feeling during the day. It&#x27;s winter in Iowa, which means dry, dry air and I like how the oil is keeping my face moisturizered all day.  Also like using it on my hands and I like the nutty, natural smell.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair, dry hands, face, neck, arms, feet - you get the idea.  Love it and am ordering more so I have a few on hand.  Not greasy and my skin and hair feel great for a few days after applying. A few drops go a long way.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known  about Argan Oil sooner. I have salt and pepper hair and the gray hair is stiff, dry and uncontrollable. This product tames it right down. It just takes 2 or 3 drops ( my hair is short )  for it to work. It seems to nourish my hair too. You have to be careful and not use too much or it will look oily but just a little works wonders on my hair. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin yet. My purpose of getting it was for my hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Goes on easy. Doesn&#x27;t smell too strong. Creates a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry cuticles due to thyroid disease and have tried so many things to try to keep them from scaling and bleeding.  After just a few days using this product they look normal again.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Good Product. Recommended</li>
    <li> Wow, so much better than the Argan oil PRODUCTS. Soft smooth hair, its a non-greasy miracle.  Will buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Aria Starr Organic Argan Oil for a long time and reordered. It is great for skin, however, I find it a little bit too sticky for hair. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> I really like this argan oil : ) it works great !!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. Not only was it shipped fast but the company even sent an email with other ways to use Argan Oil which I did not know about. The best thing I can say about this product is that it has no scent. I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> Good price.... excellent product.... it is one of my ongoing product needs and it  has topped my last 2 buys from different brands..</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my nails but strangely it seems to dry them out.  I do love it on my skin though!</li>
    <li> It might dry out your skin if you have sensitive skin in the beginning to adapt this new product. But it worked great after that ! I use it for my eyes mainly because it helps to smoothen and strengthen the eyelashes and brighten up my eyes.</li>
    <li> So far absolutey dreamy, feels so good on the skin and my face which has gone cray the past few months, must be changing as i age, looked dewey and soft for  the first time in ever! I cant wait to see what continued use will bring.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and terrific delivery.</li>
    <li> - &amp;#34;Having read the benefits of the Argon oil and having several recipes for lotions calling for this oil, I researched the customer comments on Amazon and placed my order. It is a larger size but knew I would use it regularly. I love the fact that it has the dropper. Makes it so much easier. Also the company sent me some recommendations for its use. So far, I am very pleased with my purchase!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The only issue I have with this brand is that the oil smells rancid. It is not the nutty smell I am used to from the oil I used to bring from Morocco. I am using it anyway and havent had any skin reaction, but will not buy it next time.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have incredibly, ridiculously sensitive skin. Coconut oil caused me to break out like crazy, so I decided to give argan a try. I&#x27;ve noticed that after a few uses my face is clearing up, but this oil is just so drying that I cannot stick with it. I also find I have to use a ton to remove my makeup. I do however love how gentle it is on the eyes! If you&#x27;ve used coconut oil and gotten it in your eyes, you&#x27;ll understand how amazing this stuff is too remove eye makeup! I do think this can be a great oil for people who are not prone to dry skin, but for me it just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I was looking for something to put more shine back into my hair and this seems to works very nicely. The way I use it is to put several drops mixed into my volumizers (I use two different kinds from Aveda) while it&#x27;s still in my palms, rub them all together and work it into my damp hair all over with my fingers, then blow dry like usual. Works like a charm. 😊</li>
    <li> Hydrates the dry ends of my hair.  I also put some in my toner and face moisturizer.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is amazing, I used the Acure one for a long time and it was fine but this one has a much smoother texture and absorbs faster into my skin. When I wake up my skin is incredibly soft!!</li>
    <li> Have used the oil for approximately one week and very happy with the product. Excellent for the skin. Package arrived on time, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin so soft love it I will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would help with the eczema but I certainly didn&#x27;t expect such drastic positive results! Both my 22 year old and 8 yr old used it on their hands, which are always red and itchy no matter what they use. By morning both of them were so excited to see that their hands were clear and soft! We only wish we had found this product sooner!!!</li>
    <li> Great product that has a lot of uses. I love that it&#x27;s 100% ECO Certified Organic For Hair, Skin, Face &amp; Nails -I use it on my face, cuticles, my dry frizzy hair, and my daughters dry scalp. The only negative is that I&#x27;m not fond of the smell.</li>
    <li> only used this product about 4 days but can already tell the difference in how my skin looks and feels.  I have always had oily skin up until about 4 or 5 mos ago when it suddenly began to dry up.  I have had roseacea for about 10 years, but have only experienced the redness, and now I am having large red patches and pimples, read the reviews and saw that this would help with that. Also have alot of flkiness.  Started a natural skin care regimen but kit did not include a moisturizer.  So I opted to try this, and Im really loving the way it works for me.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I have grey hair that likes to stick out like a halo. This keeps it all in place.</li>
    <li> I am using this as a added supplement for my hair and I love it! Does not leave it greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Love to add a few drops to my moisturizer, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling</li>
    <li> This is an absolute steal for the amount of product you get. And it works great!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have combination skin and add two drops to my finger tips and apply to my face and it has literally made my fave look more youthful and has given my a glow (not to be mistaken for oil )</li>
    <li> Do you have to rinse out your hair or can u leave it in</li>
    <li> Love this argan oil! It made my skin softer, silkier and smoother immediately on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no smell, which was great - I have used rose hip oil in the past and while I love it, it did have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;This seems very fresh and soft to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks better in just a few days. Thanks for this product!</li>
    <li> The oil works beautifully on both my wild hair and ageing skin!! I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Love argan oil!  I use it in my daughter&#x27;s hair and on my skin.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every night for about a week and am very pleased with the results.  I use it over my moisturizer and then on my hands and nails.  It absorbs in quickly without any oily feel.  I have also tried it on my hair to smooth frizz.  And it leaves it shiny and smooth.  A little goes a long way.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> When I tell you how wonderful this product is. I have used other brands of Argon oil, bought in cosmetic aisles, for about a year now. I&#x27;ve never noticed any visible results. I have dry skin, very dry skin, looks like alligator hide on my arms. My legs are covered with dry flakey skin that looks like dandruff. I should put those sentences in past tense, as the situation has corrected by applying Aria Starr ORGANIC Argon Oil. The absolutely amazing thing is the improvement was visible on the second application. I wish I had pictures to show the difference, it happened so quickly that I was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the oil was the fresh, clean scent. The second was the light viscosity of the oil; third, rapid absorption upon application. On the second application(next day) my arms started to peel, or slough, dead skin. When finished rubbing my arms I could see fresh, healthy looking skin again. Wow!</li>
    <li> I love this oil it is very light weight super silky very moisturizing makes my skin soft and luminous and just a couple drops tames my flyaways and splitends my nails also have not been peeling as much after using applying this oil to hands at night before bed</li>
    <li> I really like this oil!  It goes on easily with the dropper and you only need a small amount to go a long way.  I have used it on a surgical scar and it is helping it to heal and stay supple.  It also does great for your hands and nails.  I do use it in my hair about once a week and it keeps my hair soft and silky.  It helps to keep the &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; hairs in place and your hands get the treatment when you are placing it in your hair!  It comes beautifully packaged in a box with a safety seal so that  it doesn&#x27;t leak.  I have begun using the oil as part of my daily routine and I can tell a big difference in my hands which I wash all the time.  A little goes a long way and this bottle will last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week but this Argan Oil is great! I use it under my eyes and on my hands for a smooth, soft look.</li>
    <li> Great oil, really does what it says. I have had no acne at all! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer as well! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> will never purchase again!!!</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about this product and the customer service I received as well. I use it on my face under my make up and my skin feels as good in the evening as it does in the morning. I also use it on my nails and cuticles. The product arrived on SUNDAY, un heard of... and Aria sent me an e-mail thanking me for my order and giving me ideas and tips on using the oil. Will I buy this product again?? YES Will I buy it from Aria? ABSOLUTELY.</li>
    <li> My husband and I started using Argan Oil on our extremely dry hands due to the harsh winter we have experienced. We have found Argan Oil provides moisture and healing to our dry, scaly skin in a way lotion and creams have not been able to do. A few drops of Argan Oil provides a lot of coverage.</li>
    <li> My nails, face, the skin on the rest of my body are responding so well.  At seventy-six is wonderful not to have brittle nails and dry skin.  Oh by the way my hair is shinny and thick now too.  I guess you would say I am quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am delighted that I discovered this product.  I purchased it primarily for my skin and nails but also use it occasionally on my hair for added shine.  It is excellent quality and I would highly recommend this product.  Above average service from this seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased for making moisturizers and body butters.  Appears to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> There are do many Argan Oil available in the market, and so far, this brand gave me the best results! Not only it moisturizes my skin, it soothes my face too! It also softens the tips of my hair and my split ends are gone! :) This is a must have :)</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have ordered this item from this seller at least three times.</li>
    <li> Great product and the people have wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> My skin was getting very dry from being in the pool 4 days a week.  I heard about arGan oil on one of the shopping channels but found it here for a fraction of the price.  My skin softened up miraculously in about 10 days. I now use a few drops in my hair for shine and on my cuticles as well.  Wonderful luxurious feel on your skin.  I am a convert.</li>
    <li> I brush a few drops into my hair between shampoos before I set it or use a heated round brush.  A drop goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love it! The smell is so natural and just as advertised, it does not leave a greasy feeling whatsoever. It is so soft and absorbent. I use it on my hair and face and the results are perfect.</li>
    <li> Thanks for following up with and sorry for the late response. I really like the product for nails and body but yet to start on here .</li>
    <li> The oil is always great to have. I primarily use it on my hair. The bottle came nicely wrapped and boxed but the dropper was broken non the less. I put the oil in a small spray bottle that had held body oil.</li>
    <li> I have only been using for a few days, but my hair is soft and shiny!!! I have a lot of hair that is wavy. I recently cut my hair from shoulder length to at my ears and it was a little unruly until I started to use this product. Now, my hair lays so nicely when I blow dry it and it is very nice to the touch.</li>
    <li> So far I love the Argan oil! It is affordable, and I&#x27;ve been using on my skin so far, but plan on using on my cuticles, hair, etc. My skin feels softer already and that fact encourages me to keep using it. I ordered two extra bottles to keep upstairs and downstairs so I can use after washing my hands, face, etc.  I&#x27;m impressed with the company also - they communicate to be sure you are liking the product, send tips on how to use, and respond to inquiries very quickly/ I&#x27;m so glad I found these folks; I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Argan oil, have tried some samples from a different company, but the other company I tried was SO EXPENSIVE that I didn&#x27;t want to even get started on something I couldn&#x27;t afford.  Aria Starr Beauty IS affordable, and it&#x27;s 100% pure Argan oil. That works for me!  THANK YOU Aria Starr for making this possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update in 2016 -&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars - &amp;#34;Love this stuff. This is the 4th bottle I&#x27;ve purchased--appreciate the reasonable price &amp; this company is great to work with. The argan oil soaks into my skin, does NOT make it greasy, and it lasts forever it seems like. I will continue using this for a long time to come. Thanks Aria Starr - I appreciate the price, and the ease of working with your company.</li>
    <li> Love this Argan Oil I use it on my dry skin and it softens it for me again. I love to use it on my dry hair more than anything and I have seen a big change my hair doesn&#x27;t look as dry and brittle as it did before.</li>
    <li> Have only used a couple of weeks now, and only at night before bed. It has seemed to make my skin soft and smooth, and maybe see a bit of plumping. It absorbs quickly. Like the price and the dropper bottle.</li>
    <li> sucks, I&#x27;m allergic.  I&#x27;ve never been allergic to the Argan Oil I&#x27;ve bought in health food stores.  You must use some &amp;#34;special chemical additives&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;whatever, I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil of all I have tried.  It is not greasy feeling on the skin but creates a smooth cover for my very dry aging skin, and seems to protect me  from windburn and chafe as I work outdoors.  This is also the first I&#x27;ve tried which doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause acne, which has been a big problem with other oils I have tried.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve used it on my face in my dry areas and no more flaky skin. My son had terrible dryness of the scalp and nothing I was trying was working. I put some Argan Oil on his scalp, rubbed it in and left it in overnight. The next morning we washed his hair and by-by dry scalp!!! I used it on my hair after shampooing instead of conditioner. Took care of the fly aways. My only complaint is that I wash my hair about twice a week and it did leave my hair limp by day 3 so I would only recommend this if you wash your hair daily. I highly recommend this product! Can&#x27;t wait to see what else it will work on!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and Aria Star Beauty has excellent customer service</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing oil EVER!!! I love it! I was using expensive moisturizers before this, but they aren&#x27;t nearly as effective as Argan Oil. I noticed a huge difference in less than a week.</li>
    <li> I have purchased and  been using this product  for the past five days . I was pleasantly surprised how fast it absorb into my skin leaving it feeling  soft and non greasy. The mild woodsy scent disappear within 30 seconds.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for something to help with the dry skin around my nose and eyebrows without breaking me out. This was the answer! It just takes one small drop to condition my face without leaving it greasy or breaking me out!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try pure Argan oil since most of the over the counter &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; contain silicon. I have been using it for a few days now and have noticed a difference in my hair. Living in the deep south, the humidity is awful but this is taming the frizz. I originally bought it to help my nails. That&#x27;s going to take a longer time to show results...so the experiment goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/14/15 I am using my 3rd bottle of Aria Starr Argan Oil. It is fabulous for my hair. It has turned coarse as more gray comes in and this tames it VERY well! It hasn&#x27;t done much for my nails unfortunately. I still have dry and ridged nails. So, it must be something else going on. As a facial oil, it has done wonders for my skin. I absolutely will keep ordering this oil. Great product!</li>
    <li> It is amazing. I have very oily skin, I was afraid to put oil on to my face but guess what, it helped my face so much!!! I feel like i have a natural glow now. I also put this on the ends of my hair after i get out of the shower and my hair feels and looks fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I rub it on my cuticles on my fingers after my face and hair and my nails look great as well!! I will be purchasing this product again in the future!!!!!!!!! Highly suggest this product(: WORTH MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Five Stars all the time!!!! This really is a liquid gold and I am the number one fan of this product. I will never run out of this oil.</li>
    <li> This is first time I&#x27;ve ever used argan oil and I&#x27;m trying this on my hair, face and skin. For hair I use this because I&#x27;m trying the no shampoo method and I read that this oil is good to keep the hair soft and less frizzy. So far I only used 3 drops to the entire hair (I have curly big and long hair so 3 drops didn&#x27;t seem sufficient but I&#x27;m trying to follow the direction and see how it goes (it&#x27;s only been a week), so far I like how my hair looks after applying but after few hours the frizziness comes back but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;On face, I used it as moisturizer and also for acne. As moisturizer it works ok, the face does feel oily but after couple of hours of using. I&#x27;m not sure about acne though because I applied this on my acne and it has not yet disappeared but when I applied it on a spot which just started to swell and looked like going to be an acne, the next day it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;I also applied this on skin where I have dark post post eczema/psoriasis, I&#x27;m still keeping an eye if there&#x27;s any difference after applying this product.&lt;br /&gt;So far, it seems like a good product. I am not bothered with the smell at all, seems like going to last forever. I like that it is small size so that I can carry it for travel but I&#x27;m a little bit worried if the bottle breaks because it comes in a glass bottle.</li>
    <li> Great packaging, good value</li>
    <li> This works as well as the vitamin E oil I was using and is a bit less greasy.  However, I have super dry skin that just drinks it up so it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  For that reason, I have to go back to the cheaper vitamin E oil.  This is a very good product, though, especially if your skin doesn&#x27;t need as much of it.</li>
    <li> I use a very small amount so very economical, goes on smoothly and soaks in quickly leaving skin smooth and silky.  I no longer use traditional moisturizers which cause clogged pores and breakouts.  My skin looks better than it ever has.</li>
    <li> I love my Argan oil.  My skin is very dry and no cream can do what this oil has done so far. Another benefit is, that it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Only 2-3 drops are needed for the whole face. I will start using it even for my neck.  My face is starting to loose some fine wrinkles, my neck has to follow!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  The small bottle is always in my purse kit. In the gym, it is so easy. After my shower I use it on my face, neck and my hair. Easy and I feel great. My hair shines and have a bounce.</li>
    <li> Very good product! I love how my skin feels. Thank you</li>
    <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Suitable for hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distinctive products&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> My hair feels softer and healthier with a few drops of this product over the past week. Also using at night as an eye treatment and it does not make my skin break out or too oily. An incredible deal and I will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks. I like that it is light weight and a little goes a long way.  I add a few drops to my face moisturizer at night and my skin looks refreshed in the morning. I have some acne and although I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes with that yet, it does help with dryness from my face meds and my complexion seems more even.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil a few years now in my hair. I&#x27;m a black woman living in Colorado so moisture is key for me and this product not only gives my curls shine, but my nails are already improving.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
    <li> I like it!! It gives your skin a dewy glow and lasts all day.....I apply on my face and body....</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel amazing.  I don&#x27;t want to be without this.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product so far. I use it in my hair and with my facial regimen.</li>
    <li> This was a good deal on argan oil, I paid over $30 in the past. I am really excited to try it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great oil for skin - I use it on my face along with other essential oils and am glad to have organic oils to use rather than chemical-based moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t know until I use longer.</li>
    <li> Great product, I bought as an add in item. Seemed like a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week now. I use a few drops every night on my hair and a couple in the morning. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference how soft my hair is now and it feels healthier. It does make my hair pretty greasy if I use too much during the day</li>
    <li> This is an awesome oil! It&#x27;s a bright, clear, pale straw-colored clean oil with a very mild, almost-not-there fresh scent. The dropper bottle is easy to use and the oil seems like it&#x27;s high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried argan oil, I put a number of drops on one arm, and initially was not too happy because it left my arm feeling slightly oily for a long time. I wiped the excess off and it was fine. Later that night, I noticed the skin of that arm was deliciously soft. Smooth, pettable soft. *Perfect* soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since decided that the oiliness was my fault; I simply used too much. That&#x27;s great, because this is an expensive luxury oil and if a few drops will cover a large area, that&#x27;s perfect. My next discovery: after getting out of the shower, while your skin is still slightly damp, apply some argan oil. It will help retain some of that moisture, and the damp will help you spread a small amount of oil more easily. It made my skin feel amazing. Dare I suggest this treatment if you have a romantic evening planned?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> Works just as well but much cheaper than what I was using before.</li>
    <li> You wont believe how using Argan oil has transformed my hair routine. I have very coarse and frizzy hair. Before use of this I had to set my hair every time I wash it. But now i just apply few drops of it when my hair is wet and TADA, it eliminates frizz completely. It is good to use before blow dry too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reduced my usage of multiple products and more over its natural.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I can use it to replace my evening lotion. It&#x27;s also wonderful for dry hair, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great customer service.! This product is one of the finest that I have used. I tend to use it during the summer to keep my skin soft. Do not hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use a drop of this, a drop of Jojoba and mix them in with my Naturals Tumeric Plus C Enlighten Serum. It&#x27;s great!There are so many different uses for oils. I was apprehensive to try them out because of my already problematic skin, but it turns out i was stripping everything away and my skin was going into overdrive trying to replace it.</li>
    <li> This oil is an affordable substitute to the Josie Maran Argan oil I used to use. The smell is a bit earthy, but fades quickly.</li>
    <li> My mom suggested I try argan oil.  She tried it and it made her hair super soft. Now l will tell you, I was not expecting much in way of results. I am one of those people who change the color of my hair on a regular basis so my hair is super damaged; but hey I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try this.  My hair loves it!  You can&#x27;t even tell my hair is damaged at all. I have even had people tell me how soft my hair looks! Oh! And my hands love it too! I have recommended this to all my friends!</li>
    <li> This argon oil is wonderful, leaves ur skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> It is a 1 oz bottle so it is on the small sisde, glad to see it is in a brown glass bottle and not plastic.&lt;br /&gt;It smells and feels like argan oil, we use it for our hair and nails.  I&#x27;m seeing reviews about it fading age spots and all I can say is what????  To do that, you want Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, etc but don&#x27;t buy argan oil for that purpose, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, my favorite use is adding a dropperful to my hair after washing and conditioning, working it in and a quick rinse out.  Does wonders for dry or frizzy hair.  I also like rubbing it into my feet at night and putting on cotton socks, it absorbs nicely into the skin after a shower.</li>
    <li> It does not feel like what people describe Argan oil to be. I used it on my hair, it made my hair stiff and hard. Is this real? or mixed with something?</li>
    <li> This product is excellent value. As per information provided by the supplier, it has multiple uses. One is to thin out concealer which is too thick for more subtle application.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair! Small amount added to wet hair and brush through, keeps my hair from frizzing! I have long hair(to my waist).</li>
    <li> Will always go back to Aria Starr for my Organic Argon oil.  It is far superior to any I have tried, and the customer service is awesome!</li>
    <li> I have been using this liberally on my face for awhile now and my skin looks more alive and vibrant. I have some flaking skin , but I think it is just  shedding off the old and bringing in the new cells.  I ordered another bottle   &amp; will continue using it. Hoping it just keeps getting better. I have been using  it on my cuticles and the backs of my hands.  I can see a real improvement!     I also use coconut oil on my skin. I am 64.</li>
    <li> Hydrates very well. Not greasy at all. Mild scent. I will definitely repurchase this.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Very happy, will definitely order again. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great Product.  All the Beauty Supply shops here in town (5 in all), don&#x27;t carry Organic 100% Argan Oil.  Great product (well what&#x27;s left, I dropped the bottle and it dumped most of it on the floor), but I do love the way it feels on my face and in my hair.  Once I found out that Moroccan Oil (blue and white box) has silicone in it, I stopped using it and went in search of pure 100% Argan Oil.  This one is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with how quickly I got the product.  And Aria wrote a note on all the different ways to use the oil. Smart business woman!</li>
    <li> Was delivered fast! Smells good and works great!</li>
    <li> Love the product, hoping now it works it&#x27;s magic. The skin absorbs the oil nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue .</li>
    <li> The product is amazing. I use it on my face hair im adding to hand and body creams for massages. The skin is very soft and smooth but not oily. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works great on hair and nails..a little goes a long way.  Unfortunately, it plugs my pores, so cannot use it as a facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like this oil.  I like MOSTLY that it has no fragrance to conflict with other fragrances I may be wearing.  There is no fragrance so that I can sleep at night without a smell from the oil.  It is light and does not stay greasy like most oils  One thing I have learned that is not positive, is that one cannot get it in or near the eyes. I know it was my error, but,  I wish there was a warning on the bottle.  I accidently touched my eye and it was unpleasant, but I know  my fault.  I love it on my skin overnight and wake up with beautiful skin.  I put some on my hair when it seems dry and it looks beautiful.  I will buy this again, rather than spend hundreds of other oils that do the same thing!</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m use to using Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil I thought I&#x27;d give this company&#x27;s argan oil a try. I chose this argan oil because of the great price and it&#x27;s 100% pure. Now granted I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long I did notice a nice luster to my hair. I like to add some to my ends for protection and tiny bit to my scalp. The owner told me to try adding this product to freshly washed hair too so I&#x27;m going to definitely try that and see if it helps. There is a nutty smell to this product just as it is stated on the site. So if you are looking for a good alternative to Josie&#x27;s argan oil this is a good one!</li>
    <li> Great as massage oil and gets absorbed by the skin relatively well. Not the best one I&#x27;ve ever used, but easily the second best.</li>
    <li> Love the 100% pure argan oil. I can&#x27;t stand the stuff at the stores that are heavily fragranced and barely any argan oil. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it smells.</li>
    <li> My hair is shinier with this (100% Argan oil) than the HSI Professional Argan oil (additional ingredients). I&#x27;ve only used this one once, but it helped a lot to get the frizzy hairs to calm down. This plus flat iron - makes a real difference. Price was good, too. Seems like a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the personalized service. I feel fortunate to have found an organic source of this oil. I will reorder. If you are thinking of trying argan oil, this is the one to try.</li>
    <li> i am an admitted skin care junkie, I&#x27;ve always taken very good care ofy skin. But as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve suffered through some terrible hormonal breakouts, so I decided to try fighting oil with oil. This stuff cleared up my face in 2 days!  I use it at night after washing and toning my face. It goes on so nicely, blends right into my skin, and it makes my skin so soft, and blemish free!  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Works great! As intended. Don&#x27;t use too much because it is a heavy based product. Use a little and then add more as you please. Gets hair silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it on my skin, nails and hair! It leaves my skin looking so full of life and not dull as your skin does as you get older.&lt;br /&gt;I find Aragon oil is being added to many beauty products for a lot of extra money! I feel why spend all that extra money when you can buy the best ingredient by itself!</li>
    <li> This oil feels great on my skin. It appears to penetrate deeply and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I used it for two weeks, several times a day and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have had allergic reactions to some skin products and this is soothing on my skin and makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
    <li> I bought 3 different Argan oil from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;And the winner is.... this!&lt;br /&gt;This Argan oil feels more supple and pure.&lt;br /&gt;Thicker liquid than other brands.&lt;br /&gt;I trust this product, because I compared to other brands and this product makes my skin moisture and heal.</li>
    <li> Great product, good alternative to Josie Moran.  It&#x27;s less expensive than Josie&#x27;s product.  It has a bit if an aroma, but it smells very earthy and natural. The smell does not bother me. My skin has a nice healthy glow after application. It is not greasy at all. I was concerned because I had been using Josie&#x27;s light argon oil.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> this argan oil is amazing. it absorbs into the skin without looking greasy. it helps to heal dry cracked skin almost overnight. i love this product,  much better than other argan oil brands that ive purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use it for everything! I use a drop to add to the ends of my hair to keep them healthy. I use a drop on each hand every night, to keep them soft and it is wonderful on cuticles. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Everything and more. This product is what your hair needs!</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY REVIEW. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS ARGAN OIL. THE VERY FIRST TIME I USED IT I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR. I ALSO USED IT ON MY SKIN AND IT WAS SO SOFT. THIS IS 100% PURE SO YOU ONLY NEED A FEW DROPS. AWESOME PRODUCT. TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
    <li> Great product at a Super price!  This is an awesome help for aging skin!</li>
    <li> product was okay. used it for my hair didn&#x27;t leave it oily but didn&#x27;t do much for freezy hair</li>
    <li> I used the Argan Oil on both my skin and my hair and both have given me successful results. My skin has never felt softer and my hair has never felt healthier. The one issue I have with it is that washing it out of my hair was a bit more time consuming than other products I have used in the past. Other than this, I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and I&#x27;m pleased with it. When it arrived I noticed the oil was thinner in consistency then a previous oil I had been using. I did notice it has an odd smell I can&#x27;t really place. It is not a nutty smell to me at all, but the funny thing is it only smells when I&#x27;m smelling it directly from the bottle. When I apply it to my face I do not smell anything. I use the oil mainly under my eyes and on my forehead at night, on my hands for dryness during the day and occasionally on the ends of my hair after I shampoo. A little goes a very long way. One or two drops is all I use for all applications. If you apply to much in your hair it will look greasy. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great Product just as described. I am really enjoying using. I also thought the value was good.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality, very efficient product that has a great effect on skin and hair. A couple of drops keep my hair from being frizzy. And in terms of my face, it is a very efficient one step approach. IT&#x27;s counterintuitive if you&#x27;re used to using a lot of abrasive scrubs, because you think you need to abuse your skin in order to clean it, but you actually don&#x27;t. It feels good and does a great job. You wash your face with it and that&#x27;s pretty much it. If you carry one product around with you, I suggest AriaStarr&#x27;s argan oil.</li>
    <li> The item arrived before estimated arrival date, always a plus! I&#x27;ve used it on my skin and nails. I want to try on my hair next. It is very moisturizing. I also received an email from the seller regarding different ways to use it, and an offer to answer any questions. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This product is just amazing! It literally does as it states and is absorbed into the skin almost immediately! My hair feels so nice and I&#x27;ve literally only used it twice! I typically never use any harmful products on my hair and I&#x27;ve never dyed it so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d see much of a result seeing as my hair&#x27;s already pretty healthy. I&#x27;ve always heard how great argon oil is and for this price for PURE Organic argon oil?.. It&#x27;s a steal! Highly recommend and will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage son to help heal acne and to add moisture to his skin after using drying out acne washes. Seems to help and smells good.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair (I&#x27;m black with curly hair). To be fair, yeah, it may give a little shine but it does not give enough nor does it make my hair feel any softer or moisturized. I recommend using Agadir&#x27;s Argan Oil Treatment because it works wonders for my kind of hair - you can get softer hair, moisturized and all, and some nice waves! I recently got my second bottle from CVS (I don&#x27;t trust the online one because the conditioner sucked but that&#x27;s another story). To sum this thing up, I have used this Virgin Argan Oil Crap product for about 3 months, and I don&#x27;t like it one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and don&#x27;t let the 100% Pure Organic PREMIUM QUALITY :0 ohhh sooo goood  info. get you. Nobody really cares if the product doesn&#x27;t help your hair!</li>
    <li> The seller emailed me several ways I could use the product! I&#x27;m excited to try all of them! So far it has made a huge difference in the moisture and healthy appearance of my hair. In love with this oil!</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  I was struggling with dry summer hair, but after just a few uses, I feel so much better.  I will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product  used on a surgical scar</li>
    <li> An organic and very good quality Argan oil for the price, as compared to high-end products</li>
    <li> I am using it exclusively on my nails. I have cracked and wrinkled thumbnails from an unknown cause. I have been massaging in the Argan Oil perhaps 10 times a day and already I notice a big difference. The nails have not split as before and just look better. It has only been 8 days and I am impressed. I will now try it on my skin too.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This was a gift for my mom who has very dry hair from perms. Worked well for her. Good price. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the seller and the product! Will definitely be buying this wonderful argan oil from Aria Starr Beauty again and again :-)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I use it for my skin and hair.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference it has made.  Just today my husband commented on how soft my hair looked and felt.</li>
    <li> This oil mixes well with other hair oils!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday on my face and hair, it has noticeably reduced fine lines around my eyes and lips area I will purchase again,</li>
    <li> Skin is feeling very soft!!  Scars are diminishing.</li>
    <li> This product is super good, leaves my hair auprr shiny yet doesn&#x27;t feel greasy! I use it as part as a hot oil treatment or my itself to finish the look. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> The reason I gave you 4 stars is because of your follow up system.  Seems like good customer service even though I won&#x27;t have the product in my hands til mid June!  If you would like to follow up with me then I&#x27;d be glad to review the oil.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the commercial version of Moroccan since I was in the US last year and while it does work well I don&#x27;t like using chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;So there you go.  Thanks.  Lezley</li>
    <li> Love at first touch/rub... Awesome for my face &amp; hair! Leaves my face feeling fresh &amp; soft!</li>
    <li> The Aria Starr Argan Oil is 100% pure and organic. This Argan Oil can be used all over the body as it is pure and organic. My daughters use it on their hair to bring luster to the dry ends. I like to use it on my elbows. It helps to bring life back into the dry skin on the elbows. I rub it into my elbows prior to going to bed.  It does absorb well into the skin, so there is no worry regarding getting the sheets oily.</li>
    <li> I had heard about Argan oil and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a week, but I believe this will be a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me.  Great for nails, hair and face.  And it takes just a teeny-tiny bit to do wonders.  Glad to have discovered it.  I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s, live in the desert and appreciate the quick impact from this oil.</li>
    <li> Product is of great quality. Received an email detailing the many benefits of the product and found it most useful. I use the oil in my hair, on my face and cuticles.  Repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Love this product, a little goes a long way.  I use it twice a day and keeps skin moist without an oily finish.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing without clogging pores. Great for my dry skin. Leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Goes on skin very smoothly and no greasy residue. First time user. Very impressed. Had tried another brand that was very runny and unfortunately I  not remove dropper from jar without wasting Argan oil as it would drip as soon as dropper was lifted from bottle. AriaStarrBeauty brand Argan oil is thicker and purer.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a week.  The long winter has made my skin very dry and have noticed many more wrinkles.  So far this is working great.  Already have a more radiant skin and moisturized look and feel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to try as an alternative to a more expensive brand.  I have been using it on my face/neck at night time and applying it on my hair in the mornings.  Putting it in my hair has made a big difference - it looks healthier, smoother and counteracts the dryness caused by blowdrying my hair everyday.  Argan oil is an oil so expect that your skin will &#x27;look and feel&#x27; shiny - this is the reason why I apply it at night time instead of daytime.  So far it&#x27;s been great.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I use it for moisturizing my face and the skin becomes soft. I also tried for my hands but it is not so effective. It is pure argan oil. Like it very much</li>
    <li> Amazing my hair is finally soo soft</li>
    <li> Works like argon oil. I bought my first bottle in Morocco 2 years ago and have been using it as a face moisturizer ever since!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Rarely do I find a product that does exactly what it says, so far this one does.  My hair looks and feels shiny and soft.  This product is a oil, but it is not oily.  It is very light and wonderful for the face and body too.  I will order again in the near future and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil for my nails and hair and have been using it daily for 3 days now. I can already see a huge difference in shine and manageability of my hair. The cuticles of my nails are softer already. I would recommend this product to everybody.</li>
    <li> It smells like cow poop. Honestly.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;Great product &amp; great distributor of it as they followed up my order with an email that included various ways to use the product. Would definitely recommend the product and the distributor.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin, so in the winter time the cold wind can be pretty harsh on my face. I have tried various hydrating lotions that contain high water content and are not heavy like a cream or butter, and haven&#x27;t been successful. So far the Argan oil is perfect - it leaves my face well moisturized and soft but not oily.</li>
    <li> Works great. The price is amazing.</li>
    <li> Love my skin using this product. It&#x27;s summertime and it&#x27;s not as oily as other types of oils</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m inlove with this Argan Oil. It&#x27;s wonderfully nourishing, smoothing, soothing, hydrating, plumping, calming, healing - bliss in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I understand why this stuff is dubbed &#x27;liquid gold&#x27;. The Moroccans have known the beauty and dietary secrets of these amazing little Argan kernels for centuries past; they even drizzle the oil on their couscous, pasta and breads.&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally dry skin and this oil soaks into my skin well and leaves my skin feeling soothed and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well being in a bottle, for skin. I use it any time of the night or day, when my skin needs some deep and pure moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this Argan Oil as a promotional sample, to test and to then share my objective opinion on.</li>
    <li> This particular Argan OIl makes your skin glow and your hair shine. Great Product! I would recommend it and purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on mine and my toddlers curly hair after every wash. I use it mostly on the ends and it adds shine and tames the hair without making it heavy or greasy. A little of it goes a long way as well. Really love this product!</li>
    <li> This review is going to be informational:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The founder Aria emailed me about my experience with this product. I said &amp;#34;I have been a little disappointed in that it feels greasy on my skin contrary to what I read in reviews. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to soften my hair as people commented.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what she wrote back:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please allow me to address your concerns:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greasy Skin:  With Argan Oil, a little goes a long way.  So, maybe try using less (1 drop is more than enough) and massage into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft Hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s our recommended uses for hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For short hair:  1-2 drops&lt;br /&gt;medium hair: 2-3 drops&lt;br /&gt;long hair: 3-4 drops&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our recommended use is after a thorough wash.  Apply the drops onto the palm of your hand and rub both palms together and then comb through with your fingers (do not pat on) and massage into your hair while your hair is still wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aria was extremely gracious and generous with her time, feedback, care and concern. She really wants people to have a great experience.</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this Argan oil my hair is healthier, nourished and soft. I love it and I will continue purchasing it, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product and how it absorbs so nicely without any oily residue.  Would buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This oil works beautifully and I appreciated the email with extra ideas for their product. My friend who recommended this loves it, and now so do I.</li>
    <li> Perfect conditioning and neat product. I use it primarily on my face; it is not like your typical oil, it absorbs rather quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a strong odor. The scent of the oil is very subtle which is great for sensitive nose like me. Looking forward to this product results.</li>
    <li> Great product but only used the recommended amount or it will be really oily.  But other than that it works grear. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to start! I&#x27;m in love! I saw an improvement on my skin from the first day I put this on:-) I put  a few drops of this and some organic vitamin c serum and ooohhh my goodness! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I will be ordering again and again and again! thank you so much for making this amazing organic beauty oil! I used it on my face my hand&#x27;s my hair and love the results. I have only been using for about a week and all I can say is wow:-) this will be  a part of my beauty regimen from now on:-) one more thing I need to mention, I think I was using more than just a few drops at the begening. it didn&#x27;t hurt me or anything but I have learned that a little goes a long way there is no need to use so much:-) Love it! oh and shipping time was awesome fast and very nicely packed. 100% satisfied customer here:-)</li>
    <li> I have been using Josie Maran oil, but decided to try this one because it is a great amount for the price. The texture is a little different than Josie Maran, but it dries the same and my skin feels great. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the argan oil for about two weeks.  I&#x27;ve ben using it on my face instead of my usual night cream and I&#x27;ve noticed a big improvement in the lines in my forehead and those annoying &#x27;apostrophe&#x27; marks around my mouth.</li>
    <li> Great product. Im a guy and I don&#x27;t like to use lotions and oils. This stuff soaks right into your skin so you don&#x27;t feel oily at all. I use it on my dry hair and face. It is pure, without synthetic fragrance, and has a nice earthy smell. I received an email from the owner of the company checking in to see if I like the product; that isn&#x27;t something that happens ... ever. She obviously cares about her product/company and your satisfaction. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing.  I&#x27;m able to wear my hear curly without frizz for the first time.  And it leave your hair shiny.  I&#x27;m trying it on my nails next to see if it will help repair them.  You need so little of the oil that a little is going to go a long way.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve had in a long time. The oil isn&#x27;t completly... &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;. It applies smoothly and soaks into the skin in a few minutes. It&#x27;s nice and leaves my face feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get this product, make sure you only use a few drops to start out with to experiment how much you&#x27;ll need for your face or wherever you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
    <li> I use Argan oil on my skin and nails. This brand is affordable and the quality is as good as the oils you find in overpriced spas and stores.</li>
    <li> not very impressed with the product. i got it based on the customer reviews. used it on my cuticles and it was ok. i could have used the normal coconut oil i had at home for the same results. and i read articles that argan oil is good for the face skin but this particular product gave me more acne. i had not applied much also. took a week break and tried again, got more acne on my face. So i decided to use this oil for my hands n knee and just finish the bottle. i would probable try a different brand of argan oil next. i am giving extra points for the packing and the bottle itself.</li>
    <li> Pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Totally LOVE this product. I use it on my face &amp; have already recommended it to others. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Argan products, I like this best.  Will continue to purchase this seller&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of argan oil, and this is my new favorite! It has a really nice consistency and doesn&#x27;t have the somewhat unpleasant fragrance I&#x27;ve noticed in the other brands. Plus, the customer service is outstanding! They follow up on your purchase, provide suggestions on how to use the product, and personally answer any questions you may have. I use argan oil on my face and hair. Now, at age 60, I don&#x27;t expect a fountain of youth from any product, but it does give my skin a nice glow, and it tames the frizzies on my wavy hair. Plus, I know I&#x27;m putting something safe and healthful on my skin - unlike a lot of products that are loaded with all kinds of bizarre chemicals. In short, I highly recommend this brand of argan oil and would purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Just what I was looking for and performs as expected. I use it on my hair, nails and even dry spots on my face. Not too much though - a little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> It made hair extremely greasy. I only put a little in and I didn&#x27;t even put it on my roots and it was still really oily almost helmet like. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again. :/</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. I have tried it on my skin and hair and love the way it makes them both feel!</li>
    <li> Non greasy, easy to use. Great value</li>
    <li> My daughter says she has not had enough time to tell how well it works. Sorry.</li>
    <li> great stuff. very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the quality of the argan oil.  My skin just soaks it right up and it keeps my skin soft and moist.  Very pleased with my purchase, will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Smells weird and have to slant the dropper to keep the oil from leaking out but works wonders.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is amazing! It is the perfect day/night moisturizer for my face and it smells great. I put a few drops in my hair and it makes it so shiny and smooth! I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Ahh love Argan oil! Way cheaper than buying the Josie maran from sephora...</li>
    <li> Argan oil is all the rage for your body and your hair. Nice that it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I find it great for my extra dry skin and scalp. It is also great for your hair.</li>
    <li> I start use it in my hair it works great. Ilove the  way my hair feels  3/28/15 Mary Lee Parker</li>
    <li> I am vary pleased with this product I have vary sensitive skin and was looking for a moisturizer that would not turn my face fire engine red this argon oil has done the job it doesn&#x27;t even make me breakout I will be ordering more soon for family members who are also in desperate need of gentile effective moisture</li>
    <li> Love it on my face, feels awesome</li>
    <li> Great oil for skin and scalp! Nongreasy!</li>
    <li> Performs as described. I have thick, dry hair, and this is especially apparent when I shampoo and condition my beautiful locks. For a guy, I tend to pull my hair back in a man-bum/ponytail, and after a shampoo, I&#x27;m likely to have frizzies everywhere and I look like a mess. After a few drops in my hands (usually 4, I found 2 drops to require just more use) I rub the oil in my hair and promptly brush it again. It de-emphasizes the volume of my hair and gives it nice healthy sheen. This oil is completely unscented.</li>
    <li> When I remember to use this oil at night before I go to bed on my cuticles I can really notice a difference the next day~~ and when I use it 2-3 nights in arow I can totally see a marked improvement.  My problem is just remembering to do it!! Thank you for this product... (-:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a moisturizer for my preggo mommy dry skin....love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  Absorbs quickly without a greasy residue, works equally well on my hair or my skin with any artificial perfumed scent.  Great price for a quality argan oil</li>
    <li> fast shipping. great product. little to no scent. non greasy. moisturizes my hair and skin. best help for my rosacea redness and blemishes. i&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is fantastic.  I highly recommend it. My skin looks and feels 100% better.  I was afraid it would be too heavy to use in warm weather to the contrary.</li>
    <li> First, the argan oil came super fast, as promised. I also loved that the seller sent me an email prior to receiving the oil giving me lots of suggestions on all the ways to use it. Great seller. The oil is great quality and I am loving my hair using it. You only need a couple of drops and it makes a difference. My hair is soft and shiny. (too much and it gets a little heavy)</li>
    <li> Used twice and it makes my hair feel less dry and thicker</li>
    <li> Had my doubts about putting oil on my face but I was proved wrong! This oil is absorbed and non greasy .I only put around eyes and forhead before bed. So far, my skin in those areas feels amazingly soft . I also mixed a tiny drop with my foundation and was able to spread it flawlessly. I am almost a senior citizen...wished I found this years ago.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this oil it is really really that good I love it and I hope the quality continues to be excellent so I can be a customer for life!  My face looks better since I have been using it.  I suffer from break outs and since I have been using it I do not have any breakouts except for a few blackheads but that is also going away.  that was my initial reason for buying it and the fact that I love using it in my hair right after I get out of the shower.  I also have eczema around my fingers and it has stopped my eczema from breaking out!  I will continue to buy this product as long as the quality continues to be excellent.</li>
    <li> This is so great.  Works so well on my face.  After two months I am already starting to see the results.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product, along with eating more healthy, my skin seems to me more tight and not as loose as before.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week now. Prior to that I use regular Vaseline or any other hair product for my bald head. I needed a product that wouldn&#x27;t clog my pours and make me feel sticky at the same time whenever I step out in the hot or cold weather. So I decided to try this product after doing some research and love it. it doesn&#x27;t clog your pours, nor does it leave you greasy when applied to your skin. The product does have very mild smell that wears off in once the air hits it. I use this product for my face bald head and hands. Since using this product I&#x27;ve notice that my beard is softer and looks healthier (Rick Ross Look). I&#x27;ve also notice that my scalp is not dry and less dandruff. Its a really great product and i would suggest buying it and trying it for you self. I will be ordering a few more bottles of this product since my daughters have gotten their hands on it and see that is works for their hair too :) I case readers are wondering, I am an African american male in early 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Highly recommend!!!! Two thumbs up. Very pleased all around. Thank you. I will be ordering more for gifts as well as for myself.</li>
    <li> Very good product. My mother and I are enjoying this oil greatly.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to soften my beard but products sold through the &amp;#34;Name Brand&amp;#34; companies were too expensive and loaded with chemicals. After some research, I discovered Argan Oil. This particular brand is exactly what I needed. Just a few drops softens my beard and mustache and lasts through most of the day. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face in place of moisturizer and have used it on my hair and it&#x27;s wonderful. I have dry skin and have never been able to find a moisturizer that I like (too heavy, too greasy, or not enough moisture). Argan Oil is the answer. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and leaves my skin soft all day. The smell is kind of weird but goes away quickly. I have even used this on my 4-year-old daughter&#x27;s face when she had some dry patches and it worked well without irritating her sensitive skin. I also use this on my hair, on the ends, between haircuts to keep my hair looking shiny. I will definitely buy this again once my bottle runs out (which will take a while as a little goes a long way).</li>
    <li> I just bought it!!! I hope it works!!! I&#x27;m using morning and night!!! I will see it does work!!!! Hopeless !!!!</li>
    <li> What a pleasant surprise to get an email from the seller that not only to thank me for making the purchase but to teach me how to use the product. Email was titled:&lt;br /&gt;9 Ways To Benefit From Your New Argan Oil Purchase From Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used what is called Argan oil purchased in the store. The first time I tried this I noticed it was vastly superior.&lt;br /&gt;One drop goes a long way. And it&#x27;s silky to the touch,  and absorbs so quickly, amazing. And thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;for putting an eye dropper in the bottle, because it&#x27;s not going to be wasted that way and so much simpler to add&lt;br /&gt;to other products to enhance them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just started using it so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s healed dry patches or anything yet but on first impression, I&#x27;m impressed and&lt;br /&gt;glad I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll come back later on and let you know how well it worked for me, but I&#x27;m thinking it will work well indeed.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is really fantastic. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I received this order very quickly and my hair and skin are about to very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just begun to use the product but it appears to be just what I was looking for to moisturize my very dry skin.  The seller was courteous and prompt and I will definitely order the product again.</li>
    <li> Thicker than it seems.....soaks into hair well</li>
    <li> Love the argon oil. Great moisture for my dry, curly hair and also great for nighttime skin routine. Do you sell in a larger bottle? I will run out soon!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair and skin feel so soft! I love that it is organic! Will buy more! Thank you so much for such a great product!</li>
    <li> First of all it&#x27;s organic second, I love this product for my curly hair.  I leave it in overnight for deep conditioning.  I also use it to tame frizzy hair. It is  a really nice face oil, it leaves my skin feeling really smooth not greasy. A little drop goes a long way.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have had the aria starr organic argan oil for almost two full weeks i can  say  i have used it once a day since I&#x27;ve had it for my cuticles and hands they are now softer than when i first started using the argan oil it keeps my cuticles and hands  moisturize i will buy this product again</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a moisturizer for my face. 3 years ago I developed adult acne and I have tried everything except oil... I mean who in there right mind would put oil on top of acne right...Oh how wrong I was to think that and how right I was to make this purchase. from the first time I started using it I did not break out with any new pimples and in about 2 weeks I noticed my face started clearing up along with the wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes becoming less noticeable. I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> got the product on time&lt;br /&gt;works just fine as of now! no complaints&lt;br /&gt;I am using it for my hair</li>
    <li> love this product it feels great&lt;br /&gt;had some breakout on my chest that nothing had  made better but this oil has almost made it dissapear&lt;br /&gt;very happy</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown, received promotly.  Quality is high and tightly packaged , so no leaking . Perfect for my homemade skincare.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent customer service.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The Argan oil is a good product,  but because of the overwhelming odor,  I will only use it on my skin at night. As much as I love olives, I can&#x27;t stand smelling like them on my skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;I going to try adding a essential oil to see If it will mask the brine smell. Otherwise,  the company and customer service was excellent.</li>
    <li> So far, I have enjoyed this product. The oil really helped in moisturizing a lot of dry spots on my face from cleaning it too much :)</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of another well known and expensive brand of argon oil, this oil is not OVER-PROCESSED pure Argon oil, especially if it s first press would have a slight scent (not unplesant at all) when you apply it to your skin,I mainly use it as a facial moisturizer, it not only blends beautifully but absorbs into the skin without feeling oily. After a few minutes you skin feels beautifully  soft.  So happy I tried it, this will be my new brand of Argan Oil</li>
    <li> I am going through a phase right now where I&#x27;m allergic to everything; so many products make me itch. I tried this because I have dry, thin hair and I like to use a leave-in conditioner. I use this when I get out of the shower, and so far, I have had good results. It makes my hair soft, and it&#x27;s so not greasy. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which works for me!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing but a little heavy It takes a while for it to be absorbed into the skin</li>
    <li> I will be making sure I don&#x27;t run out of this product. It is great.&lt;br /&gt;I have long and fine hair which gets very dry and full of static in winter heating and summer air conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;When I wash my hair I put a few drops of the oil on my hands then rub it into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;When it dries it is smooth and thick with no ends flying out and looks to be in a lot better condition.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Doesn&#x27;t smell amazing but it gets the job done and is very nourishing. I use it all over and every night.</li>
    <li> this is okay if mixed with shampoo, and makes a great facial</li>
    <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service, on time, good package</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a daily moisturizer for my face and haven&#x27;t had any problems. Leaves my face feeling moisturized, not greasy, and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or negative effects!</li>
    <li> I have been using Argon oil for years now to repair my hair from heat damage, and have been happy with the results.  I finally read the ingredient list on the brand that I had bought at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store and found that it was not pure argon oil at all, so was excited to find this product.  I have continued to use this on my hair, sometimes mixing a dime to quarter size droplet of oil with my hair cream before I flat iron or blow dry my hair.  I have also started to use a small drop and smooth it on to my face and neck after cleansing before going to bed.  I am impressed with how much healthier my hair seems and how soft my face and hands now feel.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to know whether it is helping the fine lines and wrinkles on my 61 year old face.  My hair tends to be very dry and is naturally curly, between the Virgin Argon oil, and L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCreme Sulfate-free Moisture system Cleansing Conditioner (think similar to Wen&#x27;s cleansing conditioner, but much cheaper) and my new Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium 2&amp;#34; Ionic Rotating Hot Air Brush I am finally very happy with my very hard to manage hair.  My hair is the healthiest it has been in a long time.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is wonderful.  I have dry patches on my face and other parts of my body that I intend to use this.  It is not greasy or oily.  Has a clean feel and no smell.</li>
    <li> Great natural product. I use for skin and hair and have been satisfied.</li>
    <li> i really can&#x27;t say anything about it it&#x27;s super super amazing and i can tell the result come very fast,&lt;br /&gt; i use it when i wake up and before i sleep i would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a bright face and shining hair this is the right oil to try believe me it&#x27;s worth the money you spend.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a good argan oil to use as a moisturizer and this is fabulous. It arrived quickly and in good condition, and you really get so much for your money in comparison to others! Great service, great product. Anyone who complains about the smell has probably never smelled argan oil before.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT I  LOVE IT ... I USE IT FOR MY EYE WRINKLES AND I FOUND AGAIN MY ELASTIC AND YOUNG LOOK. Thank you so much i love it...</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I use it on my face as a moisturizer. It absorbs nicely without any oily residue, and my skin feels soft all day long. It does have a faint smell, but it quickly dissipates. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Extremely good, makes hair feel real strong.Pretty satisfied! !</li>
    <li> I bought this after doing some research on oil-based cleansing routines. And I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it as a makeup remover and a facial moisturizer for the past two weeks and I&#x27;ve already noticed results. My skin looks AMAZING and super healthy. I love it and will absolutely purchase again and recommend to everyone. I think it&#x27;s important to support a small business with such a great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other argan oil, so I don&#x27;t really have a basis for comparison, but I think this oil does a great job of softening and moisturing the skin.  I use it daily and have noticed that it really does make my skin softer and clearer. Sometimes I even use it on my hands--you only need a few drops-- and it does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several people have commented on the smell.  It does have a very slight, almost nutty smell, but so do most natural, unrefined oils and butters (like shea butter or coconut oil).  I certainly didn&#x27;t find it offensive or irritating like lots of other products I&#x27;ve used.  The price is very good and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil and has helped my thirsty hair :)</li>
    <li> I have been using the oil to moisturize my face before i put on lotion. My skin has been feeling great! I highly recommend trying. Its also a really good price for the quality of oil.</li>
    <li> I will not tell you Iook 30 because I&#x27;m 66. However my skin is becoming so smooth and the creases are not as noticeable. The redness in my skin is lighten. I now wear powder makeup and it covers. No more heavy mask. Great product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, she loves it.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of Argan oil and I tried to do my research by reviewing comments about other sellers.  One common concerned seemed to be the proliferation of products that appeared to be either adulterated or came poorly packaged. This was NOT at ALL the case with Aria Starr Beauty Argan oil!  It was securely packaged and has that slight &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell that I&#x27;ve learned is associated with true/pure Argan oil.  I have no doubts that what she supplies is the real thing!!  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks now and love the way it absorbs quickly and  doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  I&#x27;m currently using a few drops on my hair before bed at night - just massaging it in - and I&#x27;ve already noticed a more silky and less dry improvement in my hair!  I&#x27;ve also started to rub a little onto my cuticles just before bed as well and can tell that there is definitely an improvement in both how &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; my nails look and they don&#x27;t seem to be splitting as much!  I&#x27;m looking forward to this for the winter time when I get small cracks at the corners of my fingernails and I&#x27;m confident this will be PERFECT for this!  When I walk into the bedroom during the day, I&#x27;ve put a drop or so on my legs and it has clearly reduced some of the flaking my poor dry skin there seems to be prone to!  I&#x27;ve even started to put a drop or so on my face at night when I&#x27;m using my other products...  I&#x27;m 50+ years old and figured I can use all the help I can get!  It DOESN&#x27;T make my face feel greasy and even though I&#x27;m prone to adult acne breakouts this has NOT been increased with the use of the oil and in fact seems to have improved it somewhat! What was so helpful was the personalized contact the seller (Aria herself!) had with me throughout this process as well as the follow-up she provides - even with a list of suggestions for use!  I&#x27;ve sent a link to many of my friends about Aria&#x27;s oil and my daughter in law is going to try it on a particularly stubborn diaper rash on one ofmy grandbabies to see if it helps - Stay tuned for an update on this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my Argan oil!!! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and the fine lines and even some of the deeper lines are not as noticeable.  I&#x27;ve never had such a noticeable improvement with anything I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I will definitely refer this to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER used this on her hair and loved it! It felt very soft and rich.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Leaves my skin super soft. I only wished they would put a pump on the bottle instead of a dropper.</li>
    <li> Product as described. I use on hair and it absorbs well and leaves hair shiny. It absorbs well in the skin when I put few drops in moisturizer. Has a light scent you won&#x27;t even notice after a while.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Argan Oil.  I have only used it on my hair and it has done wonders.  I apply 4-5 drops while it is wet and it drys looking and feeling great.  I&#x27;ll have to try other things with it now.  ;)</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with Aria Starr Argan Oil.  I found the scent to be rather neutral, it absorbed nicely into my skin, and gave me the moisturizing results that I desired.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Argon oil on my hair. Makes it shiny, soft and very manageable where it had been frizzy and fly away. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Before buying this first bottle, I did a lot of my usual research, and I found this product to be exceptional in its purity. I discovered the best way for me to use the Argan Oil was to combine it, as Aria Starr suggested, with other products to enhance them. I use it to enhance my products for my face, body and hair. And I am very happy with the noticeable positive results. I will buy another from this Seller.</li>
    <li> Love the product has done wonders to my cuticles</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it under my eyes only noticing it leaves my skin extremely soft with no oily residue and once on my hair. My hair is very thick and has a mind of its own. I used on dropper full and ran it through my problem areas and there wasn&#x27;t even as close to as much frizz as usual and wasn&#x27;t oily at all. I highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> increased the frizziness of my hair . no added value and use only 2 drops as written on the bottle is not enough neither for hair nor for skin . for skin the oil doesn&#x27;t spread easily absorbed fast but leaves you hand dry as if u didn&#x27;t use any thing</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my cousin for her daughters hair. Already its softer and more hydrated.</li>
    <li> great argan oil.  have tried many and this is one of the nicest.  smell, purity, etc!</li>
    <li> for my sons rash&lt;br /&gt;we tried so many doctor medicines ,won&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;this is herbal and works</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is beneficial to my skin from head to toe.  After I started using it my face, throat arms, body legs and my feet are so smooth and soft.  No more dry skin.  The bottom of my feet were so dry and flaky, now with the used of this virgin Argan oil at least twice a day (after shower and before bed) my feet are now smooth.  I have no more problems putting on my stockings and knee highs anymore. After a week  I already felt the difference it makes with my skin.  I have used other moisturizing creams before and this Argan oil is the best.  I will be ordering more for my supply.</li>
    <li> My skin feels much softer and smoother using this oil. I think it is good for dry skin as the oil absorbers into the skin without being oily.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Really awesome product! Only have been using it for 1 week but already my skin &amp; hair just look healthier. Live this product!</li>
    <li> i am the happiest woman now!  Thank you for this miraculous product and the rapid service in sending it to me!  I am very impressed and grateful!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! Randomly selected from amazon and it is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been mixing with Doterra Myrrh essential oil for my skin and my hands feel like a baby&#x27;s skin now!! LOVE</li>
    <li> A skin care consultant recommended I buy some Argan oil, but didn&#x27;t recommend brands.  I did some Amazon research and wound up buying this product.  Immediately after purchasing I received an email give me 9 useful tips for this - which I thought was fantastic.  I responded to the email thanking them and got a reply to that - so the seller is very communicative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving the Argan oil so far.  I use a few drops in my hair, my lotion, and have been putting a few drops on my face at night when I go to bed.  A little goes a long way and the eye dropper is perfect for this use.  I am definitely a fan!</li>
    <li> This argan oil is wonderful!! It absorbs very quickly into my skin and cuticles.  My skin/cuticles stay moisturized for a good 24 hours!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my cuticles and they&#x27;ve never looked better! So soft and smooth; a wonderful change from the roughness I was dealing with before.</li>
    <li> I love the oil. I use it for my hair, my hands which is very dry, my nails that is very britle. It works very well. I love love love it. I will buy again &amp; again &amp; will recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Very Nice!  High quality Argan Oil that has many uses.  The price is very good and Amazon delivered it quickly as usual.  I will re-order!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Really love this oil.  I have tried several different argan oils and I found this one to be the best.  It made such a difference in my hair.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This oil is quickly absorbed and practically odorless.  I am using it as an ingredient to make lip balm and hand lotion for my own use.  I suffer from allergies to commercial cosmetics of all kinds.  Argan oil is perfect for my needs.  I really like it.  Thank you for your prompt delivery and follow up.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time on my face, body and hair and I like it! If you are considering trying it, I would recommend that you do. Truly the dropper is an added convenience.</li>
    <li> I love this .  I swim almost  4/5 times a week.  The chlorine dries my hair and nails.  The oil bring them back to life.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Nightly, I use it on and around my eyes - very soothing.  It also helps my eyelashes grow.  I also use it on my cuticles once a week.  I have recommended this product.</li>
    <li> I have never used this type of oil before. So far I really like it. I have only used it on my skin but it seems to be very moisturizing. My youngest son had some eczema spots on him and I have put this on him a few times and already see a difference in the dryness. I&#x27;m anxiously waiting to try this on my frizzy hair. Great price as well!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, and the water provided at my quarters in Alaska is very hard.  Standard shampoo &amp; conditioners do NOT work, leaving hair dull and icky with lots of build up.  I started using using baking soda and apple cider vinegar instead, which vastly improved the situation, but I still longed for a little more moisture.  Olive oil...Coconut oil...Jojoba oil...  All fell short for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil has turned out to be the perfect final ingredient in my hair care regimen.  I apply some to the ends of my hair and brush it through.  I&#x27;ve even given up using styling products, as this helps my curls show and maintain nicely.  Other oils were too heavy and left my hair feeling greasy and attracting the dust up here, but the argan is nice and light, but effective.  I am very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my regular body lotion isn&#x27;t cutting it for my hands, elbows, or knees I rub on some argan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not to die for, but it&#x27;s still very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and subtle, and to me the benefits far outweigh this factor.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil for hair, body, and skin. I put a drop in my hand with my facial moisturizer and mix it together, my face is smooth all day, not falky or dry. Love it!</li>
    <li> When I first used this Argan Oil, it had a slight rancid smell. I don&#x27;t know if its the smell of Argan oil in general or if I got a bad product. Either way, I continue to use this product on the ends of my hair when I get out of the shower (sort of like a leave in conditioner). It leaves my hair shiny &amp; soft and gets rid of split ends. This product is definitely worth the current price.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. I have dry, sensitive, acneic skin the spring and summer, and VERY dry, sensitive, acneic skin in the fall and winter. I have had this skin type for 17 years (I&#x27;m 30) and tend to get what I deemed to be hormonal acne under my chin. I have tried every product under the sun: cleaners, toners, moisturizers, creams, lotions, salves. I&#x27;ve tried all-natural concoctions and stuff made in labs, and everything has either dried my skin, made me greasy, and/or clogged my pores. I&#x27;ve eliminated dairy, gluten, sugar, and caffeine from my diet to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the fix for my almost TWENTY YEAR skin nightmare has been to use nothing at all except water and this argan oil. When I wake up I gently blot my face with a cool, wet washcloth. Later on, while in the (not too hot) shower, I use a facecloth to gently wipe my face, transferring any oil from my t-zone to dryer areas. While my face is damp, I apply two drops (will probably use 3 in the winter) of argan oil to me hands and gently massage into my face. Once out of the shower I will apply (with a q-tip) extra argan oil to areas that are looking rough or dry (or to a pimple). If during the day I sweat a bit, I just use a clean cool washcloth to blot and refresh. I rinse my face with lukewarm water before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems simple but this routine has reduced my breakouts by 95 percent in only 2 weeks. More importantly my skin looks healthier and less rough. This oil heals pimples and I swear is reducing scarring. I will never be without this product!</li>
    <li> Great product. Bought to use on my face. Not greasy, just light and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Seller asked me to rate this item... I did open and use a little to compare products. The scent is just as described. Obviously, I am already a believer of argon oil, as this is my 5th bottle (1st of this brand). I first started using Josie Maran&#x27;s 100% argon oil, then I found another comparable brand at Whole Foods, then I found this brand on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Great price!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing this product. I am extremely satisfied and plan to continue purchasing from this seller. I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking \\&quot;pure\\&quot; argan oil. My only negative is that it comes only in one size. Overall, I am extremely satisfied. This product is everything it&#x27;s advertised as.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to put in a hair cream for a client. I started to use it on my own hair and I really like it. The item was shipped quickly and it&#x27;s  very user friendly.</li>
    <li> This is the worst argan oil there is! The smell is so bad. And its sticky and extremely greasy. This seller must have been getting friends to write their reviews because the oil is not what it seems to be. I have used better Argan oil and this is the worst! Please do not be fooled by buying this horrible product. You will only be trying to get a refund like myself</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil and to be honest it didn&#x27;t work out that great for me :( :( :( I really had high hopes for it. It does moisturize and everything it just didn&#x27;t help my skin. I have tried other Argan oils and have worked I just don&#x27;t know what happen with this product. I know it has worked for others and they love it. I might give it another try in the future.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;Great product! Very happy with Aria Starr Beauty Organic Argan Oil. This is the second Time I ordered this oil. It is wonderful for my dry skin because it does not leave oily residue on skin surface, instead it sinks into skin. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great quality at an excellent price</li>
    <li> I love how soft argan oil makes my skin and hair! This product has so many uses, including soothing and treating sunburn. keep in mind that this particular brand is 100% pure argan oil, so a little goes a long way. I highly recommend this product to anyone--your skin and hair will thank you for it!</li>
    <li> This, honest to goodness, solved my acne and acne scars. Though, yes, my acne scars havent completely disappeared yet but they have undeniably lessened both in color and size. Ever since I started using this, I also have stopped developing new acne especially cystic ones. I mean come on, this has been a hidden gem for me and I sincerely thank God for the discovery of this product because I have tried numerous products to no avail. Who knew that something labeled &#x27;oil&#x27; and acne would cross out each other? Amazing.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;I am loving this so far! I use it nightly on my face with my Vitamin C and Retinol serums. It makes my skin really soft. I did use it on my hair a few times and found it to get too oily, but it&#x27;s been great for my face.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Is great!! I just used for 5 days and I can see and feel the difference ...my face looks great :-) i just want to know if I can use this. When I go to the beach or is not safe for my face . Thanks again. Cece♡♡</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in top of my moisturizer at night and in the morning my skin is super soft. I have normal/combo skin with mild acne (that is finally under control), and this oil doesn&#x27;t irritate not cause breakouts. Tip: a little but goes a looong way, you only need 3-4 drops to cover your face, so keep that in mind when considering the price.</li>
    <li> I love oil for moisturizing.  I try different ones, but always go back to Argan Oil for an all night moisturizer.  Works for me!</li>
    <li> thank you for  the interest on knowing if this product is working for me, your customer service is excellent, I started using it three days ago and love it so far, my skin is very difficult and I get break outs very easily and for that reason I don&#x27;t use many products, I have a dry wrinkle/sensitive skin type (not a good combination) hopefully this will be it !</li>
    <li> Really helps calm my daughter excema.</li>
    <li> This is amazing oil. I use it for my skin and hair and must say, it is way better than the more expensive brands. I love it and will continue to buy this oil! Not to mention, it was in my mailbox the very next day!</li>
    <li> I love the silky feel of the oil. I purchased it because I&#x27;m have a peeling, splitting problem with my nails, but it&#x27;s good for everything! I put it on my lips, throat, elbows, and my dry, cracking feet. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 4 days, but I can see the difference in my nails and feet already!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it---good product, quick delivery, and good results. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
    <li> Small but mighty they say. This small bottle of argan oil packs a big punch. Don&#x27;t be fooled by other larger size bottle. They are all diluted and not pure. This is the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonder and absorbs quickly. Fresh scent and I love it!</li>
    <li> I got this mainly for my hair. I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for about 5 years. First red and then purple, but I have gotten bored of the purple. So last month I dyed it pink. All the bleach baths (4 of them) and toning had damaged my hair. It&#x27;s not horrible but my hair feels really thin and the ends are falling out. Being so thin it frizzes out a lot. And I can&#x27;t use heat on it since it might burn my hair. So I&#x27;ve been looking for an oil to help repair the damage and moisturize my hair. I have tried argan oil before but it&#x27;s the ones I get in the grocery store that have other chemicals added on. So this time I want to spoil my hair and get the good stuff. This product is 100% argan oil...nothing else added on. And I have to say that I&#x27;m loving it. I&#x27;m not sure I like the smell but that a minor detail. It tames my frizz and moisturizes my hair. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s repairing my hair yet. But overall I love it for my hair...... and then this came with a bonus. Meaning not only is it helping my hair but I can also use on my face and body. I use it on dry spots like and elbows and knees. it&#x27;s light enough for my face. I use it at night so that it get absorbing all the way. By morning my face feels so soft and full of life. It&#x27;s a great way to prep for makeup. I mean my makeup has never looked better. This stuff is my holy grail.  That&#x27;s how much I love it with all that ways I can use it. And the customer service I get was beyond what I was expecting.  I usually don&#x27;t write review here on amazon. But with all the love they have given I had to give back.  So to whoever wrote me those emails thank you so much for being so awesome and caring with your customers.</li>
    <li> works but not as well as i thought it should</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I use it for my hair and it is more plyable and not dry.  It doesn&#x27;t break off when I brush.</li>
    <li> Lots of outstanding reviews about the wonders that this product does for hair... I did not get those results. I tried using a little just on the ends, I noticed no difference in shine or softness. I tried using a little more. Still no improvement on shine or split ends. I used even more and got greasy chunks from where I first put my hands on my hair. I have never had greasy ENDS until applying this product. I have used oils before but they were not organic nor 100% _____ oil so I wanted to try something purer. I did, however, like the results from putting it on my face. I get an oily T-zone and dry cheeks so I started by putting it on just my cheeks. It really helped with redness and of course the dryness. Then I read that argan oil actually decreases the body&#x27;s oil production so I started putting it on my whole face. Not a lot, just a thin layer after getting out of the shower. While it hasn&#x27;t cut out all oiliness, I do feel like the nose and forehead don&#x27;t get quite as shiny as they did before. A bit pricey to just be using on my face, but I like the results so I don&#x27;t feel like my purchase was a waste. Not sure if I&#x27;d buy this brand again though...</li>
    <li> Argan oil is my go-to moisturizer, and I love this oil!  I urge you to try it out.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, it goes right into your skin very easily.  And this one is a great, price, too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is pure, one hundred percent organic, coldpressed argon oil. That is my favorite and it is what I buy. This product is the very best price for the very best amount. I am delighted and love this product .  I will look to this company for other things as well.</li>
    <li> I fell in love after the first use. My face feels soft and silky. This bottle is awesome! I will order more when needed. So I&#x27;ve ordered more. And I still love it! I&#x27;ve ordered an second bottle for me and one for my sister because she noticed the results and wanted to know which kind I was using. She has used it for a few days And has told me when I reorder to reorder her some when we run out! This is the best bottle to own. I don&#x27;t even use moisturizer anymore it&#x27;s the nice.</li>
    <li> it is a great great product, i love it...</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it on my skin, hair, face, cuticles, everywhere! It&#x27;s not oily or greasy. A light feeling oil.  I have dry skin that breaks out if not properly moisturized. This oil is great!</li>
    <li> I bought your product because my scalp was itchy and I saw and article in The Good Houskeeping magazine and they recommended I try Argan Oil. I have used it only once and I can tell there is improvement. However, I need to try it several times to be certain it is helping.</li>
    <li> Only been using product for 2 weeks and already my hair is looking more improved. Less dry and looks healthier.</li>
    <li> These folks are amazing!! when they got my order they sent me a very nice list of things to do with the oil. after I got the oil they sent me an email checking to see that everything was ok. PLUS. the oil is wonderful and actually performs as advertized!I am a double fan!</li>
    <li> It proves what it promises: shiny, stronger hair with immediate results. It also helps with a dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product, but I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far. I use it at night after I put on moisturizer - on areas prone to wrinkles. Also, I recently had foot surgery and now that I&#x27;m 3 weeks out, I am using it on my incision site to keep the healing area soft and supple.</li>
    <li> The product was well package and is exactly as the item that I ordered.  The shipping was super fast.  I used it right away in the morning and at night and it does not leave my skin oily.  It works really well with my moisturizer.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Wish it&#x27;s in a larger container with a pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> Totally great for reviving dry hair both as is or as a heat protector.  Best product by far that I have ever used for my hair.  Takes a bit of experimenting to figure out just how much to use, but once you figure it out hair is very light and not greasy at all. Feels like nothing is in my hair.  Product has no detectable smell and is not greasy at all as long as you don&#x27;t use more than you need.  Throwing out all my frizz products and heat protector products - this is far, far superior.  An immediate and very noticeable change in my hair with the first use - super soft, sleek and not weighed down.</li>
    <li> It works great on my body and hair but the couple times I tried using it on my face it made me break out like crazy. I would not use it on my face again but definitely hair and body! Arrived on time as well.</li>
    <li> It was everything I had hoped. My hair looks great.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it as a facial moisturizer, hair polisher, and even on my lips when they become chapped. I love how versatile this oil is. In addition, it is non greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin. My skin is glowing after just using for two weeks. I really love this oil.</li>
    <li> My hair is so shiny and wavy, no more flakes! Astonishing oil.</li>
    <li> Delivery was super fast, packaging was superior, and the price was very reasonable. Used it on my hair as an overnight treatment and it is quite soft this morning, and also used it on my nails but it&#x27;s too soon to write a review.  However, I have used it on my skin each day since it arrived and it is wonderful. I can already see results on the creases in my forehead, as they are diminished in depth and appearance.  I will order this Argan Oil again and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome - arrived really quickly and feels really nice</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price. I use this in my hair and my skin. It leaves my skin so soft and my hair very moisturized and much healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this stuff on just about every area of my body from my hair, feet, and cuticles, to hands and elbows. Great stuff and very versatile. Light fragrance, not too bad.</li>
    <li> Smells like olive oil and it probably is the texture is just the same. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> i use this as my only moisturizer on my face.  my skin is dry, and this does not leave me oily.</li>
    <li> This argon oil is unscented (very important to me!) and dispenses using a glass dropper, which I also like very much! This keeps the oil sanitary and allows  me to only dispense a few drops at a time - which is all I need to make my hair shiny, and this also eliminates waste. Great product!</li>
    <li> This oil is very nice and I love it! I have been unusually dry this winter and my DermOrganic lotion which I love too has needed a boost. I put some lotion in my hand with a few drops of Virgin Argan Oil and rub my hands together and apply. It is the best way to apply the oil after a shower! It goes on so smooth and my skin has greatly improved already! I also use a few drops added to my DO masque after shampooing my hair and my hair is cotton ball soft. Oh my, its a keeper!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love this product and with the dropper it is much easier to use than just a regular open bottle with a screw cap.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Aria Starr&#x27;s Argan Oil is simply the best. This is an amazing product that immediately soothes the skin and hair. I was so impressed that within two weeks, I have ordered another bottle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small 1oz bottle of argan oil witha handy dropper. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use this stuff again, because it&#x27;s too smelly and greasy, weighing down my hair. Whether I go curly or straight, I&#x27;d prefer to use something else. If you like argan oil, make sure you understand the size for the price.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  This is a very nice Argan oil.  We use it in our DIY skin/hair care balms and oils.  It is exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I thought that this product made my hair greasy but it is great on my hands and nails. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy but it is still moisturized.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this Argan oil. It&#x27;s really pungent. I had to return it because it smelled like meat and sweat to me.</li>
    <li> Happy to have this product in the household. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I love every type of argan oil so I decided to get some for my mom I like that is 100% pure.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on damaged hair.</li>
    <li> First try with pure argan oil and am happy with it.  Leaves my dry skin very soft and smooth.  Great for nail cuticle area and rough skins areas.</li>
    <li> i have to tell you that i was a little surprised that this oil was not a &amp;#34;dry oil&amp;#34; like i thought it was going to be but, after a few minutes it absorbed and made my skin feel wonderful.  i used it for the first time this morning on my arms and face.  they feel WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> Magical product! My hair changed dramatically after just two application.  Please continue producing this amazing product.  I&#x27;m ready to place my next order.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...it works great. Wish itnlasted longer but having nice beautiful long hair has a price. I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to keep my hair looking good. :)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product!  I received it 2 days after ordering.  Very speedy shipping!  I love that it is 100% Argan Oil.  I put it on my face in the morning and at night and my face is very soft and smooth.  i also put it in my thick frizzy hair and it tames it and makes it soft.  I am very happy with this Argan Oil and will be recommending it to everyone!  :)</li>
    <li> my skin feel very soft and smooth. I love using this on my feet at night with some socks on you will have very soft feet when you wake up.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;This product is wonderful, exactly what I wanted, ordered, and it came on the day that they said it would arrive. Since using this product on my hands and massaging into my cuticles every night at bedtime, my nails are starting to grow and the tips of my hands where the nail and skin meet are not splitting. I will absolutely order this product from this company again.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My skin is super soft after using this for only a few days. I have not used it long enough to see a huge difference, but I like the results so far.</li>
    <li> I know argan oil is a great oil. It was the reason I purchase it. I haven&#x27;t use a pure argan oil yet. I have yet to use this one I purchase but I know argan oil is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using another bottle of argan oil but from another brand. It&#x27;s work well. I trust this one will as well.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is very light and almost scentless.  It comes in a bottle with dropper which makes it very easy to use.  For my short hair, just one drop does wonders.  I gave it only 4 stars because it is a little pricey.  As another reviewer mentioned, I wish a bigger size was available.  This company also has great customer service.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil - it makes such a difference!  Use on face, neck, hair, hands, and feet.  It&#x27;s much more economical than oodles of products on the market - filled w/ junk ingredients - go natural is my plan - you should too - this stuff is amazing !</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this due to the product being an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;m glad I did. This product soaks into the skin fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; residue behind. This product seems to be clearing my skin of impurities too. I&#x27;ve used this on the ends of my hair and my hair seems softer. I would highly recommend this product to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair so soft! I love it. I&#x27;m buying more when I need it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Argan oil for about 2 weeks and I am very happy with this product.  Even after only a week, I was able to see a difference in my facial skin condition.  My skin is softer and more radiant looking.  Also, very good for my cubicles.  I would not hesitate to recommend this product and I plan to continue using.</li>
    <li> I love the argon oil! I love how pure it is and the fact that it&#x27;s organic! The people selling this are a family business and super friendly to customers! I got an email almost right after purchasing letting me know about 9 different ways that I could use the oil. I use the oil every night for my hair, which was one of the things recommended, and I&#x27;m going to start using some of the other ways as well. It&#x27;s a great product, came very quickly, and had great customer service. Would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> keeps my hair super moist. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I even use it on my lips which are always parched from the Arizona sun, softens and it seems to make lip color last longer.  Wish you made it in a lip balm.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!!!!  Every bit as good as a much higher oil I have used in the past.  This is a keeper!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing amount of Argan Oil for the price! I&#x27;m incredibly happy with my purchase, its exactly like the high end brand that you either have to purchase at Sephora or on QVC. Absorbs well into the skin, softens the rough patches and fine lines around my eyes, I love using it on the ends of my colored hair, I also add a few drops to my day and night cream.</li>
    <li> Arrived  on time and the price was good.  Use it on a regular basis and it works.</li>
    <li> Great product for my skin. I use it nightly before i go to bed. Everything i had hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> I just started using the oil on my face as a moisturizer and I love it!  After it gets absorbed in my skin it feels soft and dewy all day.  My makeup has no trouble staying on either. Also my skin is oily to begin with but I haven&#x27;t had any issues using oil as a moisturizer. It does have a distinct olive smell to me but it does go away after a couple of minutes. I use it on my hair and nails as well.</li>
    <li> received an amazing discount on this with AMZ review trader. Works amazing on hair and skin.. also smells GREAT!!</li>
    <li> Grat product for hair and face</li>
    <li> This product is the BOMB! I can&#x27;t say enough good about it! If you are looking for something to moisturize EVERYTHING this is it. It is so soothing on my face and vanishes quickly so my face never looks nor feels oily, just smooth and soft. Great for hands, feet, legs. No unpleasant smell, and what slight scent it has dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> came quickly - well packaged - good oil! It only takes a little so an ounce lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil! This has no icky smell like some of the other argan oils I have tried before. It&#x27;s light and absorbs pretty fast. I love using it in my hair because I have a curly, frizzy mane. I also use it at night as my last step to seal in all of my skincare routine. Love it!</li>
    <li> This has been a wonderful, easy, addition to my beauty routine. I add a few drops to my morning moisturizer and a few more to my night cream and my skin glows. I haven&#x27;t had the horrible dry patches I did before and my skin feels so supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this to help soften the skin on a healing pimple and it works wonderfully. I think it even helps it to heal faster.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived super fast!</li>
    <li> I use argan oil on my hair and love it!  My typically frizzy hair is so soft and not frizzy at all.  I&#x27;m so glad I gave this product a try.  Will purchase more!</li>
    <li> I appreciate that this argan oil is almost fragrance-less! It absorbs into my skin rather quickly too and doesn&#x27;t have the greasy feel after application. I will surely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Lovee it!! Product arrived on time andi&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now I could already tell the difference on my skin. It makes my skin looks clearer and smoother. I would definitely recommend this oil to anyone!</li>
    <li> My skin feels not only nourished but healed. My split ends are healing and my hair is shinier than ever. I would absolutely recommend this product. 5 stars easy.</li>
    <li> I have been using argan oil for about 2 years and it has improved my hair a lot.  I changed brands to this one and it works just as good as my other 100% pure argan oil. delivery was quick (but then again Im a prime member)</li>
    <li> Once received, I used Argan Oil in place of the coconut oil I normally use. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement over what I already use, which is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Horrible. This stunk like petroleum. This stunk like cooking oil. Waste of money DONT BUY</li>
    <li> Received a helpful email from the seller that outlined various uses of Argan Oil. Really softens my hair and makes my skin glow. Happy with my purchase. Great customer service! Wonderful experience!</li>
    <li> Love it! Plus shipped really fast. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this argon oil!  A little goes along way, really, just a little. I started using it on my nails/cuticles and they are strong, long and very nice.  I now use a LITTLE bit in my hair and really like the results-shiny and not frizzy.  Have not tried it on my face, but my hands and arms are very smooth and supple now.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed. May need some more time to use,</li>
    <li> Just as good as the expensive brands!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I found one I like just a tiny bit better, but I would not feel bad if this was the only option. It is a really good oil</li>
    <li> OMG This product is amazing!!So far i&#x27;ve used it on my hair, I used to have split ends and dry hair.You see the changes the first time you use it!i&#x27;ve been using it for a week and i don&#x27;t see any split ends!!!!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This oil is runnier than I expected, I&#x27;ll just go back to my regular Moroccan argan oil</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with dry skin since moving to Denver, Co. I have tried a million moisturizers and nothing helped until now. This Argan oil is amazing. I use 2-3 drops in my night serum and I have notice a huge difference. I have extremely sensative skin and this has not bothered it at all. I highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used a few drops on my hair and hands, an it softened without a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product! I will definitely buy it again...</li>
    <li> Really amazing oil, though this is the first time I have tried Argan Oil, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.  It helps in aliening skin problems, some that I have had for many years, are starting to heal up, so very thankful for very special oil.</li>
    <li> It softens skin, cuticles, good for hair....an overall challenge to expensive cosmetics..long time user with desired results</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working well and I mix it with other oils to use all over my body from head to toe...</li>
    <li> Great product, thank you.</li>
    <li> Works great in my hair adds shine and helps control frizz. I also like to use a little on my face to make it soft. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! It&#x27;s light and absorbs fast but the moisture lasts all day until you actually wash your face. It even keeps my face soft in the winter when usual I apply some sort by cream. The moment you put this oil on your skin, it will feel soft as velvet and smooth as silk. And for those particular about smell: it has a slightly nutty aroma which subsides after absorption. Your face, hair, body will not stink or anything.</li>
    <li> I Have been using this awesome argan oil for about a week now, and the results are off the chain!!!! My skin looks 10 years younger, I have received compliments on my skin.  I love this Argan oil, and I will buy again!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> On time. Great price. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> There are a lot of different sellers of Argan oil out there, I chose this one because it seemed to be a good mix of value and quality. It&#x27;s amazing for use on frizz as well as dry skin and facial cleansing.</li>
    <li> So far so good! The product is working great.</li>
    <li> It is really good!! We can use it for face, hair and body.  It absorbed well and is not oily at all. There is no smell. Easy to use. I love it. but it is small bottle.</li>
    <li> I recieved it quickly but the smell does seem a little rancid.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Just got it three days ago and loving it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Just started using product. So far, really liking it...</li>
    <li> This stuff is liquid gold</li>
    <li> Dear Person in charge .. thank you for your follow up ... I have been ill and have not have the opportunity of using Argan oil yet, however, I have heard wonderful recommendations from friends, so I am sure I will be happy.  Thank you for your consideration and interest in my satisfaction with your product ... that consideration and good representation makes a happy customer, who will continue to purchase your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With appreciation,&lt;br /&gt;Lynn</li>
    <li> Really enjoying shiny, more manageable hair with the argan oil! I use 3 drops on wet hair and finger-comb through. Sometimes an additional drop or two rubbed briskly in palms and then applied to straight, fly-away hair. Really helps with shine and frizzies</li>
    <li> I only had the oil for a couple of days and I already see a tremendous difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks healthier and best of all it controls my frizz. Plus you cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have done many reviews on what kind of Argan Oil is best and this reaches all of the criteria.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, and such a nice price compared to other organic argan oils. It has made my hair so soft without the greasy feel, and is also balancing out my oily skin as well! I was EXTREMELY hesitant about putting oil on my oily skin, so I did a little research and found out that putting 100% pure argan oil on any skin type would help balance out your skin instead of make your skin too oily. So I took a leap of faith and put it on my skin before I went to bed instead of my night cream, and I surprisingly woke up with super soft skin! The only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is the smell of the oil. It isn&#x27;t pleasant, but since the oil absorbs into your skin quickly,the smell quickly disappears as well. The product also got to my house extremely quickly; my bottle arrived a whole week before the estimated delivery time and I payed standard shipping!</li>
    <li> Aria, thank you for your follow up. Got your product in the mail 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt; ago, and its on my face!  I love argan oil; it helps my rosacea, and keeps&lt;br /&gt; me from taking antibiotics all the time. It keeps my skin looking great!  I&lt;br /&gt; am 61, and people think I am 45! I sure like that! Argan is a miracle&lt;br /&gt; product.  I will order my next bottle from you again. Thank you so very&lt;br /&gt; much for your excellent service.</li>
    <li> Great quality, generous size, and so affordable at a fraction of the price leading name brand. I have used a few pricy ones and this one is just as nice. Fast shipping and great cusotmer service.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical. This makes my skin so soft. I use it as a leave in hair conditioner with great success. I&#x27;m allergic to everything and I have had no bad reaction to this product. There is no smell to speak of and it rubs in quickly. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> bought it as a gift. My friend seems to like it</li>
    <li> I usually  use Maracuja  oil on my face, but wanted to try Argan oil. It&#x27;s light, lighter than Maracuja, absorb good, but this oil gave me break outs. Which Maracuja never does.Will use it for the body and hands.</li>
    <li> I see the difference and love the feel of my hair!!</li>
    <li> The primary reason I bought this argan oil was because I wanted a moisturizer for my skin that wouldn&#x27;t clog me. Anything with silicone: such as dimitheicone, which is in nearly all lotions clogs my pores and exacerbates my current acne. I found out that argan oil ranks as 0 on the comedogenic scale, which is pretty rare, even the much praised jojoba oil can be between 0-2. Argan oil is pretty easy to apply, basically scent-less, and absorbs into my skin fast. It&#x27;s been a week of using it daily and my skin is becoming  more supple and plump, wrinkles are very hard to see, and for the first my acne is genuinely clearing up and I finally have hope that that I&#x27;ll be totally clear within another week or so. This stuff is not the cheapest but it has worked like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have had mild to medium acne ever since junior high and now I&#x27;m 23. My skin type is dry, certainly not anymore though, it just looks normal and healthy, something I&#x27;ve not had since I was a little kid and had that flawless kid skin.</li>
    <li> Love it. It goes on light and smooth and gives me a beautiful subtle glow. The first day I wore it received a compliment from my boss on how radiant my skin looked.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at a good price.</li>
    <li> So far, the oil seems to work well.  It absorbs into my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a quality product! It&#x27;s nice on my skin and makes my hair great, absorbs right in.&lt;br /&gt;You should know however, as I did not at the time of purchase, that argan oil does smell like garbage juice. It fades really fast, but still, I was expecting something nice and medicinal-smelling, like tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is a great product.  Excellent moisturizer and no greasy residue. Thank you for a reasonably priced and very effective organic argan oil.</li>
    <li> This oil is great!  My face looks smoother and it feels very soft.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve been using this on my skin and hair during the winter with great results.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great oil!</li>
    <li> This is a great product which I use for face, body and hair. It makes a great Christmas gift and stocking stuffer. I highly recommend this oil!</li>
    <li> Just got the product. Used it once as a moisturizer. Best product i&#x27;ve ever used for my face, this 100% pure Argan Oil created a beautiful glow that was not oily or greasy and lasted all day long. I would highly recommend this product. It beats all other high-end products i&#x27;ve tried and best of all it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> I use one drop of this occasionally to tame hair flyaways. Don&#x27;t use too much; even three drops will make my hair a little greasy. One or two drops are sufficient. At the rate I&#x27;m using it, this small bottle will last me a very long time -- much longer than the various plastic bottles and jars of hair product I&#x27;ve used for the same purpose in the past.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of Argan Oil.  I use it for my face, hands, and hair.  I am an older retired woman who wants her skin to remain as young as possible.  The Argan oil is the only product I use on my face and neck now.  I had hard little bumps on my neck and after using the oil for several weeks the bumps are completely gone.  My skin is soft and my wrinkles are less prevalent.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love Argan Oil I pretty much bath in the stuff, but who can afford Josie Maron?  Not me!  This is as good.  It&#x27;s cold pressed 100% organic and made with the right stuff.  I also love how it has that natural nutty smell, no perfumes.  If you are looking for the good stuff at a great price this is it.</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff. So much cheaper and more pure than expensive brands like Josie Maran. The smell takes a little getting used to, kinda smells like olives. But it absorbs pretty quickly and the smell goes away. Leaves skin dewy and moisturized and can&#x27;t tell for sure yet but I think it&#x27;s helping with any acne.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough but based on what I&#x27;m experiencing now I like how light and non greasy the oil is. Also it makes my face feel soft. The smell isn&#x27;t that strong imo. Very light and earthy smelling to me which I really like. The downside is I wish it&#x27;s in a bigger bottle. I would like to use it all over my body.</li>
    <li> A gift that the recipient is delighted with😄.  Thank you for this  great product!  Price incomparable as a bonus and quality is the same as  when sold for three times the price.</li>
    <li> I usually use Jose Maran&#x27;s products (I love them), but this virgin argan oil is very similar to her infinity intense oil.  This price is just as great, yet it is infinitely less expensive.  I will definitely be a returning customer. This oil is a miracle worker on anyone&#x27;s face - especially those of us just on this side of 50.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  It&#x27;s wonderful for skin texture, discoloration, wrinkles, hydration and just feels good.  I would advise only using one or two drops per side of your face until you know how fast the oil is absorbed in your particular skin.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Product arrive very quick but it&#x27;s useless it drips a lot when used on areas its a very small bottle not worth the price I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this o anyone</li>
    <li> pleasant aroma and non greasy, will apply as suggested by the owner and know I will get good results.</li>
    <li> Great product, conscientious seller</li>
    <li> i ordered this product for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face before I apply foundation powder. I love the way it makes my skin feel and look. I also use it on my scalp/hair as a pre-shampoo oil treatment, and after I&#x27;ve flat ironed my hair, I use it to seal my ends (I have ethnic hair).</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try after reading about the benefits or Argan oil in a health magazine and was convinced after reading the reviews of this product. I used to use Neutrogena oil free moisturizer and found this to be a great alternative that may actually slow down those fine lines around my eyes in addition to moisturizing. It&#x27;s also helped tame my reddish/ ruddy complexion. It absorbs right away so can follow up with liquid foundation makeup within a couple minutes. I even used it on a bad burn on my finger when the burn got to that itchy part of the healing stage. Although in a glass apothecary dropper bottle, very neatly and securely packaged.  Super happy and great customer service follow up after purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this oil and will be ordering again from this company. Its 100% pure Argan oil and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.  A little is all you need to moisturize your face. 3 or 4 drops will do it.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fuzzy and dry after I wash it. I drop a little of virgin argan oil  in my palm and gently apply on my hair.  It is magic!</li>
    <li> I bought this and have been using it on my face every morning and at night before bed. It really hydrates my skin, and smooths it out. I bought this hoping to minimize dry skin, and to help even out the tone and any wrinkles under my eye area. I will continue to use this every day.</li>
    <li> I have only been using Argan Oil on my face and neck for a few days and already they feel softer and look brighter.  I have never been able to find a face moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my face break out but that&#x27;s not the case with Argan Oil  My face is smooth and blemish free!</li>
    <li> I like using this instead of heavy creams because it is so much lighter and you use so little. It feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> This has been a great product. I have generally dry skin and I use it on my face morning and evening. It is smooth and soft with no breakouts. I feel like my skin is much better than before with lotions. I also use it on my hair and it makes it soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the&lt;br /&gt;Product for a week but so far am very pleased. Its a great light moisturizer. I am literally using it everywhere...face, hands, great on cuticles,feet &amp; hair. I wake up and my skin feels hydrated. Love the way it feels on my face. I have been using it under my reg moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I made the switch from coconut oil to his because coconut oil was too thin and my skin would still get flaky.  This oil smells smoky, like cigarette ashes sometimes; gross! but sometimes it just smells crisp and plastic-y.  I drip 4 drops into the palm of my dry hands and then apply to my face about twice a day, definitely after a shower.  I like it more than coconut oil because it&#x27;s thick but really hasn&#x27;t done anything amazing for my skin- in terms of a recent acne scar and redness.  I may try 100% argan oil from another brand.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I added it to my conditioner and face cream, and it&#x27;s absolutely magic.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, your skin really absorbs it well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. It has also been the best for my split ends, though it leaves them a little greasy when I put it on it later just makes my hair so silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> very awesome product works great</li>
    <li> I have tried many different &amp;#34;100% pure&amp;#34; argan oils for the past a few years.  But, this one is by far the very best argan oil on the market.  I am from Japan where having good skin is extremely important.  This particular argan oil is the only one that I am 100% satisfied.  Argan oil is indeed good for you, but we need to know which argan oil has the highest quality.  I highly recommend this one!  You will be endlessly pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product thank you</li>
    <li> I use this oil every day. I am 40, and still break out and am prone to redness. I put a couple of drops of argon oil in with my moisturizer and it makes my skin glow.  My redness and breakouts have reduced dramatically. I will never stop using this oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality!  Packaging and delivery perfect. I wholeheartedly recommend this source for Aryan oil.</li>
    <li> seems to be working fine after only a week- im using for hair and face. the company contacts you to see if you haev questions, thought that was cool</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. No smell which is great . I use this regularly. No more dry scalp and it is a light oil that leaves no residue , isn&#x27;t heavy, and it helps control frizz. I love it! It&#x27;s perfect !</li>
    <li> great product and reasonably priced. I use it in combination of castor oil and vitamin E oils for my brows, hair and skin care. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I love Argan oil as an overall great beauty product. I have spent much more on other brand names and find there is no need to. I bought this one for a great travel size. This is a great one!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great for my face and hair.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. A little goes a long way. I would definitely purchase this oil again.</li>
    <li> product arrived quickly, was nicely packaged.  I have only been using the oil for a couple of weeks but already love it, am sure I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> Great oil to put on skin. It is easily absorbed into the skin and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy unlike some other natural moisturizers like coconut oil and Shea butter.</li>
    <li> I have been using it as a facial moisturizer and it feels great, not greasy like coconut oil.  I prefer it to coconut oil for my face.</li>
    <li> BEST OIL you can add to your regiment at night - stick to vegan cleansers it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> This is great pure argan oil. It made my hair so soft and shiny without weighing it down</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product so far has been great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product except smells like cow urine.</li>
    <li> terrific product - although I spilled it early on</li>
    <li> I stopped using face lotion a year ago! I have acne prone skin and I started researching on more natural methods since the only thing my face would not break out to was clean and clear products. After researching on what to use instead of lotion and other nasty synthetic things on my face, I found Argan oil to be beneficial to my skin type and I made the switch and have never looked back. Since then I have NOT had any break outs and I have not had even a pimple! It&#x27;s amazing! I also use it under make up and it does not leave your face oily all you need is a few drops and you are good to go. This specific product is not USDA organic as it shows in the picture or at least it&#x27;s not on the actual product the USDA organic label but it is of really good quality I have gone through 2 and have been extremely satisfied!! It says it&#x27;s organic on the bottle and so far it&#x27;s of really good quality.</li>
    <li> excellent product, thanks!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil. Very light and has no smell but you can tell it makes a difference on your skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect would buy again</li>
    <li> Fantastic.. use this instead of face lotion</li>
    <li> After using it for less than a week I can already feel softer skin &amp; less dryness on my face.  I would definitely recommend this product to people who want baby soft skin.  I will review later to let you know if it helps with the pimples I have been getting over the last few years.</li>
    <li> Amazing customer service! The Argan oil is amazing and will purchase more in the near future. Thank you for the email with helpful info on the oil and how to use. Again, I am amazed at your great service. Thank you!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is quality argan oil that wonderfully moisturizes my face, scalp, and skin.</li>
    <li> I THINK I like it? I just got it today but the smell is what I&#x27;m unsure of. It smells almost like manure. I read online to avoid argan oil that smells like manure because it may have passed through a goat&#x27;s intestines? I certainly hope I&#x27;m not rubbing that on my face.</li>
    <li> This is amazing oil. I used just one time but my skin became shiny. It is very good for maintaining moisture on my face.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I thought it works as well as Josie Maran&#x27;s product and half the cost!  Will buy more!</li>
    <li> Got to say--I bought it so I could use it in my hair but I saw the reviews that it could be used to help with breakouts. I tried it on&lt;br /&gt;a pimple and it dried it up. I have oily skin but the product absorbs quickly and it goes very smoothly on the skin.</li>
    <li> i have very dry skin and have tried several products for my face. either too greasy or not enough moisture and would have to reapply during day. I put this on my face in the morning after cleansing and it is non greasy and hydrates my skin all day. love it</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results useing the Argan oil. I intended to use it for my scalp and hair, but, also enjoy useing it for my face. It absorbs in my skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out. I&#x27;m 70 years old and finds it helps soften wrinkles too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Thanks great product make hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and thank you for the excellent service.  I purchased it for a beard oil concoction that I dreamed up.  It works great for that, however, I found that it&#x27;s one of the best products I have ever used for dry winter skin.  I will be ordering more.  Thanks again</li>
    <li> I am using this product for my hands since they get so dry and cracked (especially in the winter).&lt;br /&gt;A hairdresser friend of mine told me to use Argan Oil. I am very happy with the oil. Once I rub&lt;br /&gt;it in there is NO oily feel...I work with paper so I can&#x27;t have oily hands.</li>
    <li> I got my argan oil awhile back and I have been testing it out and really enjoying it! I&#x27;ve been using it in my hair and also to moisturize my face and I must say I have no complaints. The dropper makes it super easy to apply and control how much comes out so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! :) Customer service is also really great as well.I will definitely repurchase if I run out but it seems to last a really long time since a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It works good!  It&#x27;s not what I thought but I added it to other products and it works good. Works great with hair products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I use it at night after cleansing my face in the place of a heavier night cream/moisturizer, and my skin has never felt better. It is SO much smoother, and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in the number of fine lines that I have under and around my eyes. It&#x27;s really hard to describe all the effects that it has on my skin, but it just LOOKS so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I was super impressed with was the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. I usually wake up and touch my face, and I can just feel how oily it is, but the morning after I first used this stuff, my skin wasn&#x27;t oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone, even people with super oily skin like mine, and I think it would be awesome for people who have dry skin. I didn&#x27;t really think that my skin needed anything else, but it has noticeably improved the condition of my skin.</li>
    <li> Got cheaper brands for the same oil. It works well. I have curly hair which always seems rough and have a lot of small broken bits flying around. This gives a little more shine that lasts than any other product I have used which is better than nothing. Don&#x27;t know if there are long lasting benefits. On the body it works as good as any other oil. Traditionally we use sesame oil for the body so I don&#x27;t find much of a difference except that this costs a bomb.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I recommend it to anyone who wants their skin to look youthful! I will keep purchasing the Virgin Argan Oil!</li>
    <li> I had a chance to use this product after receiving it a couple of weeks ago. It is very light and left my hair feeling very moisterized. I will definately order this product again. Packaging was very good too!</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the intentions of using it on my hair, I have since found that it is a great product to use on my face! A little goes a lot way, even with my thick, curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using for a week, but this will be one product I continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Glad I found this stuff. It works wonders on my hair! We recently moved to a new city, and our water is highly chlorinated, so I needed some extra help aside from conditioner. I refuse to wash my hair only once or twice a week because I workout often and this stuff brought life back into my hair! It&#x27;s soft and beautiful again!</li>
    <li> Love it - using it all over!</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is the purest I have ever smelled. It has a delightful yet not at all strong or overpowering nutty smell. I have been using it almost everyday for about 2-3 weeks now and my hair has never been so healthy and shiny before. Even if I forget one day my hair still remains shiny. A little goes a long way, usually I just mix a few drops in with some conditioner and it keeps my curly hair moisturized and silky all day.  Additionally, I rub the remaining oil on my face and it is never greasy but my skin has a very healthy glow. This Argan oil is the highest quality I have ever seen. Additionally, the customer service of this company is really superior as I had a problem with the shipping due to the fault of amazon and the owner contacted me personally and ensured the matter was rectified as well as followed up a week later to ensure I not only received my merchandise but genuinely wanted to know if I was pleased with the product and gave me useful other ways to use the pure Argan oil which have been very beneficial. This made the whole experience quite pleasant and I will definitely purchase again and regularly as well as refer any friends or family to this specific product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Just as described and works great, great packaging! My hair is super soft now, I saw a difference after just one day of using it :)</li>
    <li> Love it as a facial and body moisturizer. It worked best on my husband&#x27;s dry cracked heels/feet. I bought it for my hair, but be careful only use 1 drop!</li>
    <li> Love this argon oil!  Used a small amount on my hair after washing and conditioning - then did a roller set. My hair had an added sheen and felt so good when dried. My relaxed hair often feels dry after I first wash it, but not with this argon oil!</li>
    <li> I initially bought this for my face but when I put this on, it burs my face,!! So I started to use on my hair, it actually made my hair really greasy so I had to wash my hair again. So I tried again to put it on my hair really really small amount but still the same. don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> My winter skin is thankful to this oil!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I use it as a beard conditioner and general moisturizer. A few drops is all it takes. So much more economical to use this instead of products that cost as much but only use a fraction of the amount of argan and make up the difference with grape seed oil or some other lower quality filler. This stuff absorbs quickly so I never have to worry about looking greasy. Turned my wife onto it and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> im not sure yet if its made a huge difference. im on the second bottle. I will probable continue to use it because of the reviews I have read.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality of oil . Works very well on all skin types including mine which is pretty oil. Can&#x27;t do without it!!!</li>
    <li> Very good but bottle is very small.</li>
    <li> OMG! I got my order from the ups man a little over two hours ago. I immediately opened the package and put 4 drops of this oil on my hair and brushed it through. No more crunchy dry ends! This morning I washed, air dried, and flat ironed my hair and I had what has become normal dry ends. Two hours after using this product and the ends of my hair are silky smooth and soft! This stuff it amazing, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom.  She has been using it for a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve noticed a wonderful difference in her hair, it looks much healthier and fuller, plus it smells amazing! She absolutely loves the oil. I will definitely be buying a another bottle when it finishes.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;This oil has saved my skin this winter. Much more moisturizing than cocount oil and it helps clear acne too. Double bonus!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Works great for hair...</li>
    <li> This hasn&#x27;t done any miracles but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> I ordered my product (aragan oil) and it shipped quicker then predicted, once I received my order I was pleasantly greeted by an email from the owner asking how I liked the product. I used it for a few days and the oil works very well, it absorbed quickly and is a great carrier oil for other products however I did not enjoy the smell of virgin organic aragan oil. I expressed my concerns with the owner through via email and was blow away with how polite and informative she was, I was also issued a refund without even having to ask. In my opinion I think this is a fantastic company to order from I wish the sold more products because of how well I was treated. I would highly recommend this company and can assure you through my personal experience you will be very impressed. Thank you very much I apprecieate the courtesy and understanding thank you for setting an example and expectation for company&#x27;s alike.    Mandy</li>
    <li> Beautiful oil! Very nice quality and packaging.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ordering from Aria Starr and so far i&#x27;m in love. I received the item on time and started using it right away. This is my first time using Argan oil but I swear I can see a difference already. I will be ordering more of Aria Starr&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. It arrived on time and also they are very gentle and kind. I liked very much. I will definitely buy more to send to my mother in Brazil.</li>
    <li> absolutely the best Argan oil that I have used.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil for a fair price. Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> The only Argan oil I will ever buy again.  I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for years and this is th best quality one I have ever purchased.  Thank you !</li>
    <li> I dont use in my hair because it makes it greasy. I do use on my face though. It absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily at all...</li>
    <li> This works great on my scalp, it is soothing and moisturizing. The eye dropper makes application a breeze.</li>
    <li> Lovely product! This oil doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy and my skin glows better than it ever has. I also love how it absorbs so easily into my skin. I even wear it under my makeup to moisturize because I have very dry skin. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this all natural oil.  It is very nice with a very light smell.  I put this on my damp hair everyday after I get out of the shower and it does not weigh it down or leave a build up.  It helps to tame the frizzies and it makes your hair supper soft.  A little bit will go a very long way.  I also use this on my nails daily to help moisturize the skin around my nails and my actual nails.  It does not stay greasy for a long time either.  I will be purchasing some more of this when I am out.  I am very happy I was able to review for a promotion and this is my new favorite beauty oil.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! My face is soft as a babies skin! I have ordered it twice and will continue to buy it when I run out! Thank you for an awesome product!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Use it on everything!</li>
    <li> Oil seems like it a good product. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really review. The only thing I do not care for is the smell.....although it dissipates quite quickly. I use it on my face and in my hair.</li>
    <li> I basically  purchased  this  product  to  rehab  the  skin  around  my  ankles. I  received  considerable  damage  from  the  sun  while  golfing.  This  repair  will  take  a  very  long  time.  The  skin  will  probably  never  return  to  total  normal, but  I  would  like  as  much  repair  as possible.  I  am  70  yrs  of  age,  and  I  am  attempting  to  prevent  terrible  &#x27;looking&#x27;  skin  as  I  get older.  It is  a  work  in  progress.  I  have  used  it  on my  face  a  few  times and  have  liked  it.  It  has very  nice  weight  to  it,  but  is  not  greasy.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s include silicon???</li>
    <li> Like the price and consistency. I bought an oil fragrance to add a more pleasant smell</li>
    <li> This is awesome. My hair feels great!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I tried it the same night I bought it and it made a world of difference in my hair :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful product!  And great company!  They offer beauty tips and follow-up when you make a purchase.  Not only do you receive the oil but you also receive an education.  I highly recommend this product and this company!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite argan oil of the ones I&#x27;ve used so far; it&#x27;s light and quick to absorb (much more so than some others I&#x27;ve tried—maybe they weren&#x27;t as quite as &amp;#34;100% pure&amp;#34; as they claimed—and, my favorite thing about this particular brand, it has a very mild &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; aroma, rather than the rather unpleasant pungence of unfiltered or single-filtered oils. Even though they don&#x27;t explicitly say how it&#x27;s filtered, I have to guess it&#x27;s the triple-filtered variety. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than most, but if you&#x27;re putting it on your face, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use a little in my shampoo and my face wash every day.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best!!!! Have used it on skin and hair and it&#x27;s amazing. Skin will absorb it within 2-3 minutes leaving no greasy after effect.</li>
    <li> I was amazed how quickly I received the oil after I placed the order.  I love how soft my skin feels after I apply it and when I wake in the morning.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Soaks right in to hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and was looking for something to replace coconut oil which wasn&#x27;t doing much, ave this was pretty much the same for me, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, it pretty much sits on top of my skin because it&#x27;s thin like coconut oil, it didn&#x27;t really penetrate and moisturize.</li>
    <li> It works great when you use it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and the many ways you can us it. Use it on a very dry skin or a few drops in the wet hair after hair wash is works whenever you use it and you can find new ways to do so.</li>
    <li> The oil works great. It really moisturizes well. The only thing is that it smells kind of strange. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product for a good price.</li>
    <li> Just received, but really like the results so far .</li>
    <li> Very lightweight on the skin compared to other face oils I&#x27;ve used. Does not make me break out and leaves my skin nourished and super soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It leaves my skin very moisturizer and I really like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil.  I have tried other argan oils and they left my face feeling oily.  Not this oil. It soaks in and my skin feels so soft.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> Great smell, good price.  I loved that there was a dropper as I am using it to add into a Shea butter hair oil.</li>
    <li> Very surprised at the high quality of this product. The price is also exceptional.  Thank you for everything, I will most certainly be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Great for skin and hair.  Especially great for winter skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. My eye lids were dry and I tried different products but of no use. But after using Argan for just more than a week and see a good improvement. Even my hair fall has reduced and it looks healthier.</li>
    <li> It absorbs into skin and hair and does not leave it greasy.  Has a very pleasant; light fragrance.</li>
    <li> I only use this for my skin and it&#x27;s been great so far. I use it after my derma roller and when my hands get super dry from the cold weather. I have nothing bad to say about the argan oil itself, but the picture was quite deceitful as another reviewer mentioned. The picture is stretched to make the bottle look wider, so please be aware of that. I knew what to expect already after reading the description, since I have serums in the same sized bottles. Another thing, although not really a huge problem, is the dropper. Right when you lift it out of the bottle the oil will just start dripping whether or not your squeeze it, so do be careful when you first use it. I was surprised when I first used it and lost a good amount from the dropper. Other than that, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased and would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!!!!!!  I finally found a pure argan oil product... so many claim to be and have added &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; in it.  This is the real deal and it works fantastic on my hair, I can use it on my face, and it instantly relieves dry skin.  I was also really pleased with the price for the volume... I have paid a lot more for far inferior product.  All in all.... I have found a definite keeper.</li>
    <li> good product. fast shipping. good price</li>
    <li> Excellent product. 100 percent pure unlike other cheaper &#x27;pure&#x27; products. For less than 20 dollars found a solution to my 8 month old daughters eczema that was on her face. Within a week her cheeks are skin toned again and not irritated and that was just with 2 drops a day!</li>
    <li> Works well but thought bottle would be bigger.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I put it on before bed at night a couple of times this past week and I wake up the next day with a clear, hydrated, fresh face.  It will take me awhile to get through the bottle, but I will definitely be saving your contact information and reaching out to you in the future for my next bottle.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a few days. Thewinter has made my skin very dry it helping me to hidtate my skin. So far this is working great. Already have a more radiant skin and in my treatment hair ...i working very well!!recomended</li>
    <li> Best product for the skin, leaves it perfect soft and radiant. I wear it every morning and at night and have had the best results!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry cuticles that are always cracked and peeling. I put this oil on them and now they look great! I also put it on my face and beard and it looks, feels, and smells wonderful! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product, reasonable price and eco friendly!</li>
    <li> Terrific product, have been using on my hair for a while.  Did not know until this order that it could be used on other parts of the body.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really notice results. But after about 2 weeks I noticed the difference in my skin and hair. Much more softer. I also put it on my eye brows to grow them out and it does wonders!! Your skin absorbs it like water. Does not leave it greasy, oily, etc I&#x27;ll be buying again!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair and skin look amazing. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased this. Loving how soft it makes my skin feel, especially on my face which is normally very sensitive. It also makes my hair very shiny. But because my hair is so fine I don&#x27;t need a lot, I have been just gently running my hands through the ends of my hair with whatever is left on them after applying a drop or two to my face. Really potent stuff, any more than that is too much! I&#x27;m incredibly pleased with the quality And will purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> i love it so fast shipping and the quality is perfect</li>
    <li> great stuff for the beard</li>
    <li> Working wonders on my hair which is old and dry.  3 drops on damp hair, which I blow dry, and it is looking healthier every day.</li>
    <li> Argon oil has so many uses. I&#x27;ve used it on my face sparingly as well as on my nails and hands&lt;br /&gt;In such bitterly cold weather my face is protected. I use it under makeup and after cleansing my face at night. The on thing I don&#x27;t like is its slightly unpleasant scent, which not strong and does not last. I guess it&#x27;s a trade off worth making. A this could last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I use it everywhere It makes u soft goes into your skin fast better than any lotions</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - Wonderful oil! The package was timely and the bottle arrived safely. Great seller.&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff, I use it to soften my coarse hair and as a facial moisturizer. Love the way it feels and smells.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair and skin super soft! It also makes my facial skin glow, look supple and younger. No really. My eye area seems less wrinkled.. I&#x27;m only 31 but still. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but I do have long, thick hair &amp; use it for both face (daily) and hair (every other day)and it hasn&#x27;t been emptied yet (plus my toddler took it and spilled a lot and there&#x27;s still some) It doesn&#x27;t really smell wonderful OR bad. It&#x27;s neutral. Love it. Will be a regular customer of this Argan oil. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great for my dry skin during the winter and I use it before bed around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love the Argan oil. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell.  Did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair, but it has a lot more uses.  I have been using it on my face at night and it has cleared up some persistent blemishes and fine lines.  I have very sensitive skin, but this oil hasn&#x27;t caused any reactions.  I only takes a little, so it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow this stuff feels amazing I use it for my face at night and it really dose good it&#x27;s not all greasy so it&#x27;s lovely</li>
    <li> It makes my hands and nails super soft, and shiny like I just got a manicure. I also use one drop on my face and hair. My skin is soft and I have less blemishes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything on my course, dry hair &amp; skin but this argan oil out performs the most expensive brands.  Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Argan oil is one of my go to items for everyday hair styling. This brand is my new favorite. It doesnt have a strong odor and also leaves my skin feeling baby soft. When using any argan oil on your hair, I recommend using a very small amount so it creates the perfect amount of shine and softness but doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy. Just a few drops is all I use on my longer than shoulder length hair. While the bottle may seem small, it will last a very long time with proper use.</li>
    <li> I have problems with dry, itchy scalp, started using this oil and not only does it help with my scalp, it leaves my hair soft and shiny! My friend has psoriasis on her head, we are going to try the oil on it also, will follow up after we determine if it helps that. Oh and by the way, customer service is fantastic</li>
    <li> Gift for sister. She said it works great.</li>
    <li> I have, or should I say had, Keratosis Pilaris pretty severely on the backs of my arms and legs, and moderately on my hips. I have used lotions, creams, and moisturizing oils, ranging from Aveeno eczema cream to shea/cocoa butter to coconut oil. Nothing, not one of them has even come close to how quickly this Argan oil has cleared it up! I am shocked. I never thought I would have smooth skin again. It was manageable before, but now it is almost 100% gone. And it takes very little, maybe 5-6 drops per area, and because your skin absorbs this oil quickly, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or get all over your clothes. I would recommend this to anyone dealing with this skin condition. I wish I had taken before and after photos with a time stamp on it to show how quickly this helped. Less than a week and I went from embarrassing angry red bumps to smooth skin. I will be buying this again when it runs out. Great product and affordable too.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer for hair and nails</li>
    <li> My hair feels so nice after using this product. It shinier, smoother and feels as though it has more elasticity. I love the way it smells and goes on so easily. It absorbs quickly and leaves my ends not looking so raggedy.</li>
    <li> easy to use. and this stuff truly makes my hair look amazing. i have naturally wavy frizzy course hair and alot of products either dont work or make my hair look way too greasy. this does not make it greasy and it works. this is my first argan oil product i have used and now i think i have found the product for my hair. considering my hair is long i try my best to keep it healthy and not be too harsh on it and this doesnt seem to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received this item to review for me honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I love Amazon but rarely do I take the time to leave a review/feedback.  I have to leave a review for this.  I purchased this from Amazon On August 2, 2014. I just ordered a new bottle because I only have have about 25% left.  I ordered this because I am a Black, 43 year old female, with thinning hair. Thinning hair is genetic and getting my hair to grow....challenge.  Anywho, before I started using this, my hair was slightly below my ear-- not touching my shoulders.  Now my hair is pass my shoulders and about 3/4-1 inch from my armpit! My beautician was stunned! My hair is growing longer.  I just need something to help make it fuller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try the new bottle on my skin and nails!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, it leaves my hair softer and more moisturized than it has ever been before. With this organic oil, a little truly does go a long way. I can definitely see myself adding this Argan Oil to my daily skin and hair routine. To make matters even better, the company selling this product is courteous and even sent me an email with tips on how to get the most and best results with the product and offered a full refund had I not been satisfied. Great customer service and great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I use it all over.</li>
    <li> Very nice for skin n hair.</li>
    <li> Great for thick hair. Made my styling regime easier and kept my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
    <li> I just start using it.So far I like it</li>
    <li> While this is a phenomal product I would not buy again. I bought it for hair purpose, not body, my daughters hair. Works amazingly. But it only lasted no more than 2 weeks, &amp; I only my used 1 to 2 full drops every other day. U really don&#x27;t get a lot or product in this tiny bottle. Too expensive to keep buying every 2 weeks. So lol stick to what I was using before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;ve used it on my face and I like how quickly it was absorbed, not greasy at all. It does have a bit of an earthy smell but nothing that is noticeable.</li>
    <li> My fashionable teenage niece recommended Moroccan Oil to make my hair shiny and look better. I went for this instead. It does make my hair look healthier and more bouncy. Not quite as slick and shiny as I was thinking but it&#x27;s great. I have mid-neck length fine hair and one drop (without putting pressure on the dropper) is plenty. I rub it in wet hair before combing it out and blow drying. I expect the bottle will last about a year. It has zero scent, which is a huge bonus for me. This particular bottle is nice because of the dropper. I expect I&#x27;d have trouble pouring such a small amount.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help with eczema I have on my face. It did help some, but it didn&#x27;t totally disappear.  For a face,body, and nail moisturizer it works great.</li>
    <li> Awesome oil.  The wife and are making our own balms and such. Company likes to email and makes sure they are applying good products. Thanks Aria Star!</li>
    <li> I love it. I had dry skin on both sides above my nose and it&#x27;s all cleared up after using argan oil twice a day.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is amazing!  Before I started using this, my hair was frizzy and poofy.  Now it&#x27;s sleek and smooth!</li>
    <li> Product as described &amp; arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I love it! It smells pleasant and is not at all greasy after you put it on like some other oils I&#x27;ve tried in the past. It makes my shin feel like silk. I also put a bit on the ends of my hair and it feels so soft. It&#x27;s really the best oil I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m a product nut!</li>
    <li> I love this product, thank you so much.</li>
    <li> WOW!! my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft since I was a small child! But not just the softness of my hair is better, the quality of my hair is too! can you say NO more split ends!! I sure can! and considering my daily regimen includes using the flat iron or curler thats saying a lot. but i&#x27;m noticing that the more I use it the less i&#x27;m relying my heat tools to fix my locks. i&#x27;m actually starting to like my natural tresses! :O and if anyone knows me, my natural hair is a mixture of super tight curls, waves, and some straight pieces mixed in. That&#x27;s a lot going on at once but this Argan oil keeps it under control and at a nice wavy state that looks like i&#x27;ve spent all morning on it! This oil isn&#x27;t full of processed chemicals that strip my hair of the good stuff which is a total added bonus!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It absorbs quickly aND really moisturizes the skin I love it!</li>
    <li> Very good quality product! I use it for face and hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan Oil for almost a year. I am impressed with the efficacy of this brand over others I have purchased.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Excellent price</li>
    <li> Loved the oil - I have some rosacea and it helped with the first application.  My skin is smooth and soft without being greasy.  I will continue to use this product. Too bad I left my lid open and dropped my first bottle all over my carpet.</li>
    <li> My nails already feel stronger and my skin is so moisturized since I&#x27;ve been using this oil! No complaints whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Rancid! Stunk really bad.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;so far i have used this product for three days on my hair and the results are good so far. I can tell my hair has become alot silky smooth. Definitely will be purchasing another one after i finish this bottle.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my face, hands, hair, lips, feet, and this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever had!!!</li>
    <li> So far so good.ive been using this on my dry flaky forehead . Worked within one day. Been using 2 drops morning and night.Makes your face feel so soft and is absorbed very quickly.</li>
    <li> Working out well so far. Using it as beard oil. Haven&#x27;t seen a huge increase in softness, but I think it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Only just started using and learning how much to use. It is easy to overdo so don&#x27;t use more than a few drops, even for hair. Can&#x27;t wait to see long term results.</li>
    <li> The packaging is very nice - however, it has an odor that smells almost rancid to me. I think I saw somewhere that another person thought so, too.</li>
    <li> I have been reading a lot about argan oil and how it is produced in Morrocco.  The nuts are shelled by hand and then they are cold pressed, also by hand.  This is why so many products that claim they have argan oil in have very small amounts.  I&#x27;ve been looking for pure argan oil and decided on this brand because I have a vitamin c serum from them that I love.&lt;br /&gt;The uses for this are unlimited really.  It can be used as moisturizer, cuticle oil for nail growth, fixing cracked heals, frizz control and split end moisturizer.  I have put a few drops into my rose water toner and moisturize that way.  When I remove my nail polish I put it on my nails to rejuvenate them after the remover and polish.  This is a really good brand, so I feel confident that argan oil is pure.  It has worked very well for me and it&#x27;s one of my favorite products in my beauty regimen. I was lucky enough to purchase this product at discount so that I could provide my honest opinion. I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> already showing a difference in balancing my combination skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now and I am totally in love with it. I bought it to bring life back to my hands and was so impressed I now use it on my face, neck and knees. The small bottle is easy to travel with as it does not leak. I will be purchasing the larger bottle. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Love the moisture it gives to my hair and face.</li>
    <li> Very good oil. Absorbs easily. Not greasy. Use on over processed hair to get it more back to normal.</li>
    <li> Great cust service and I love this brand of argan oil.</li>
    <li> Awesome product... Makes my hair silky looking... Would definitely try</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning, now that I let my hair go to a White, I no longer color my hair. Due to years of dying and frosting my hair. My scalp has become very, very dry. I use ARGAN Oil just before I wash my hair and rub into the scalp. My hair has become much more heaver. I will continue to use ARGAN OIL.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, as is the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became addicted to using argan oil instead of moisturizing lotion after getting a small sample bottle of[[ASIN:B001DJ9JJU Josie Maran Argan Oil 1.7 oz]]from Sephora. My skin has never looked so good! But my wallet was not looking so great, as a 1.7 ounce bottle is $48 there. They claim their product has no additives, but comparing the smell of this to the Josie Maran, and that brand clearly has some sort of scent added to it, as this has a more natural earthy (not as nice) smell, but it dissipates quickly upon putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell there is absolutely no difference between this and the expensive Josie Maran brand. This works just as well for my skin, and is a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> After receiving a sample of the Josie Maran Argan Oil from Sephora, I knew that I needed to add argan oil to my regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put off by the cost of the Josie Maran I went to search for a dupe of it. This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thicker, but that can be fixed by diluting it with a little water. Same amazing results for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the product and will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Make my hair soft.  Love it</li>
    <li> This is lovely and, thankfully, has no scent.  I was considering the argan oil on QVC, but I wanted to try a small size first.  I started using a shampoo with argan oil a few months ago.  At my last haircut, the stylist asked what I was using to make my hair so shiny.  I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her it was shampoo with argan oil from the 99 cent store.  This oil is reasonably priced and is a good addition to my skin/hair care routine.  A warning about using this oil on the hair: put only one drop on your hands and rub them together.  Finger comb your hair with your oiled hands. If you have long hair, you may need two drops, but be careful or you&#x27;ll wind up washing your hair again!</li>
    <li> Love it! Absorbs quickly. Can see a difference in just a few days. Bought two more bottles for my friends!</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes my skin soft &amp; moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is an authentic high quality Argan oil at a very affordable price. It starts and ends with Excellent customer service! It begins with an email thanking you for your purchase and letting you know it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s way. It includes complete directions for use and even helpful and informative tips so you can achieve the most results and also ideas for other uses you may not have known about. The product is packaged in a box and comes sealed in a brown glass bottle with an easy to read label that provides you with ALL the information you need, including the manufacturer date, shelf life and lot number. The oil is kinda a cloudy pale yellow with a faint but quickly dissipating scent (hard to describe) it&#x27;s lightweight, silky smooth and absorbs quickly! You will receive a follow up email asking how you like it and to ensure you are 100% satisfied and if you have any questions. If you ever need to contact them, they respond very quickly! EXCELLENT EVERYTHING! Definitely will repurchase!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Argan oil for 1 week now and I love it. I have eczema on my face around my eyebrows and under my eyes. I also have extremely dry skin and sensitive skin. I already noticed that my eczema has improved. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is oily. The product absorbs very well and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I love this argon oil. It is 100% pure and feels great on my hair and skin!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is a great product--have been using it for dry skin--I&#x27;m accustomed to Moroccan oil but this is great--it must be a derivative of the same&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I started using this at night as a moisturizer after I shaved. I can&#x27;t say enough about how much this oil helped my complexion. It instantly removed razor burn and left my face with a clear and smooth complexion. I&#x27;ll keep buying this oil no doubt about it.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair and face feels 👍</li>
    <li> I love argan oil, but have found that I&#x27;m using too much on my hair (wet) and it looks oily after one day. I love the feel and the texture of my hair though. I will keep experimenting with the amount.</li>
    <li> Good quality Argan Oil for hair and body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a little over a week but I honestly love it already.  It has replaced my facial moisturizer for morning and night (I mix two drops with a pump of my vitamin C serum) and it will also replace my Moroccan Oil hair treatment once my bottle has been used up!  I really think this will be changing my skin for good.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it works on my face during the summer months, but since it does not create even the slightest bit of greasy feeling now, I think it&#x27;ll be just as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for selling a quality product at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> so far I have used this for my hair, my cuticles and my face.  I love the way it incorporates quickly with no greasy residue. Being odorless, it doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> nice product, shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I have only used this Argan Oil for about 1 week, but I Love it.  My hair is SO much softer. I have very dry, course, frizzy hair, that requires leave in conditioner, and hair gel, just to be manageable. I hope that with Argan Oil I eventually will not need to use hair gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. I have been using it less than a week only but I notice thinning of my keloid and facial age spot.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, IT SEEMS AS IF IT WOULD BE GREASY BUT IT IS NOT, GOES ON EASILY LEAVES YOUR FACE LOOKING REFRESHED.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> I bought this for an itchy scalp. My scalp typically gets dry and flakey during the transition from summer to fall. I applied the oil to my scalp in the evening and washed it the next morning and my scalp is 100 times better! No itching! I have washed it another time since applying the oil and still no itching. So much better to use this natural oil than the chemical dandruff shampoo I have used in years past.</li>
    <li> perfect for everything</li>
    <li> I was nervous at first that I would go through the oil so quickly since it is only a 1 oz bottle, but if you&#x27;re using the oil on your face, you only need a couple drops. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and it seems to work a lot better for me than coconut oil did.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! !</li>
    <li> Great oil for hair or face. I bought for my face and I love the way it leaves it soft and hydrate looking.</li>
    <li> I add this to a mixture of shea butter, castor oil and peppermint as a hair moisturizer and skin conditioner.  It is what it is - Argan Oil :)</li>
    <li> Seller sent me a wonderful list of uses...very helpful and I&#x27;ll order more in the future!&amp;#34; This is such a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent price and quick delivery. What really makes this standout us the amazing customer service I got from Aria!! I&#x27;ll be a repeat buyer for sure!!!!! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> This argon oil is wonderful. This has been very beneficial for my hair and skin. All I need is 4 drops to help smooth out my short hairstyle. I like to use it before I blow dry my hair. Aria Starr was kind enough to e-mail me and ask how I liked her product. I was able to ask a couple of questions. She answered me the very next day. This has also been great to use with pure essential oils. I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate it. I am so happy that I bought this product. I&#x27;m going to buy more for sure. This oil is awesome!</li>
    <li> With this dry weather in California, I&#x27;ve had extremely dry skin around my cuticles and knuckles.  Within minutes of massaging the oil into these areas, my skin was noticeably smooth and soft.  My wife uses this oil to moisturize her face and is pleased with how smooth it makes her complexion especially before she applies any makeup.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff for the beard and skin. I wish I had discovered this product a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use this product.  It has a lot of great uses.  So far I&#x27;ve used it on skin and hair and it does seem to hydrate as well as improve both and it&#x27;s nice to have one product you can put on your face and hair and not worry about one not being good for the other.  I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about this product from others and the company seems to be EXTREMELY nice and attentive to our response and questions.  I really love that with companies.  It inspires me to encourage others to buy from the same source to get the same quality service and support.  Win-win!</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan Oil for a long time now and I am very pleased to have found that your prices fit my budget compared to other sites. Thanks a bunch very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing, I use it everyday on my face after I shower and when I wake up the next morning my face is soo soft and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores or leaves your skin all greasy it&#x27;s perfect I think it may even be erasing my acne scars!!</li>
    <li> Best beauty product under $20. Moisturizes, soothes redness - even calmed my skin after an intensive retinol treatment! Prefer to Josie Maran, at 1/4 the price.</li>
    <li> I am 48 years old and am tired of paying hundreds of dollars on face cream.  I read about its anti-wrinkle, anti-oxidant beauty secret and said let me give it a try.  Now I do not have wrinkles, but I want to try to prevent them as long as possible without spending a lot of money.  So I have been using the product for 3 weeks now.  I rub it on my face and my hands in the morning and night.  My skin is smoother and softer , especially my hands.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product will definitely purchase again.  I have used another brand on my hair for years but it was not suitable for my face.  This is perfect.  My skin feels so soft and no breakouts.  The price is reasonable too.  Absorbs perfectly.  A winner all the way!</li>
    <li> I researched uses and benefits of Argan oil after reading an article about it. I purchased this item to hopefully help dry brittle split ends. After using Argan oil for a few weeks, I could see a difference and my hair stylist commented on it at my next haircut. My hair is shiny and healthy looking now and the split ends are almost gone. I would recommend this product and I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have hypothyroidism and extremely dry skin. It has helped so much!</li>
    <li> Oil works and feels great! Kinda has a wired smell tho.</li>
    <li> So light and perfect. I will be ordering more after the new year. Glad that I found this product!</li>
    <li> Good product, Been using it for a while but why did the price triple !!!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the oil is fragrance free but I&#x27;ve used other Argan oil that&#x27;s not as greasy. I thought it would be smoother and absorb into the skin better without feeling so greasy. Little disappointing.</li>
    <li> Well priced.  Excellent quality.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I ever used!</li>
    <li> Gives zero frizz to my thick, coarse, loosely curly and partly wavy hair!&lt;br /&gt;Finally something works for me. I used around 12 drops though, I guess 8-10 drops will work perfect for my shoulder length hair!</li>
    <li> This is my first Argan Oil adventure, so I really do not have anything to compare the quality of this particular brand against.  All I know is it feels amazing on my skin.  After only a week I am already noticing an improvement in the texture of my skin.  I ended up with a lot of skin damage this summer and my poor hands looked like they had turned to leather.  Just a drip on each a day morning and night and I&#x27;m already impressed with the results!  I had been using shea butter for MONTHS with no change until I added in this happy little dropper full of magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this product on my face.  I am amazed with how quickly it is absorbed and how nice it feels even with makeup on.  Great undereye moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to put on my face before I go to bed due to my dry skin. I love it. Does its job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m diggin&#x27; it. Works well on my beard, scalp and dry hands. Non greasy! My wife has a very dry scalp during the winter months and it seems to be helping her as well.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed - The size of the bottle is miniscule compared to what is pictured.  It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture shown - Looks like they stretched and altered it in photshop to make it look wayyyy bigger than it really is.  I really don&#x27;t appreciate being deceived and to me this crosses the line of deceptive advertising.</li>
    <li> *Strong bad ordor*&lt;br /&gt;I love Argan oil, I have been using it for almost 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;I re-ordered Pura d or 4 Oz cuzip I loved it so much,&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this one to carry it in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;I was gonna use it instead of hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;But what happened.&lt;br /&gt;It has strong bad ordor.&lt;br /&gt;It actually smells really bad.  Yucky...&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use it unless I want to be smell bad....&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;the know if its only my item, Cuz ithe has great review</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I keep this oil on my head after bath and I don&#x27;t get migraines any more.</li>
    <li> The seal was not secured to bottle the top came off without having to break the plastic seal.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. :) That&#x27;s always important to me as I do not like waiting for products too long. As for quality I like what I have seen so far (mind you I received it few days ago). It makes hair smooth and looking healthier. I liked the price too and got an extra bottle for my mom.</li>
    <li> Have used other brands of Argan Oil and find this brand to be better. Smells good and skin and hair definitely improved in less than a week. Add it to my leave-in hair conditioner and notice fullness and shine. Add it to my skin moisturizer and see a glow and feel softer skin, both of which make you look better. Love it.</li>
    <li> This product feels great on your skin.  I am acne prone and usually I would think oil would make me break out but it hasn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil.it works miracles for the skin and hair.</li>
    <li> This virgin argan oil has been great! I add it to my lotions, or to my nails after a manicure. It seems like a high quality product. It has a nice fruity and slightly nutty scent to it. The best part is that a little goes a long way, and this bottle will last for a long time!</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;Argan oil came on time product as described on Amazon. The seller sent me an email with 9 ways to use the oil and the benefits of the oil. The oil had no fullers or perfumes. So far I&#x27;m happy with the Oil. I use with my hair products, rub it into my hands, nails and feet.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on my face, very smooth and soothing.</li>
    <li> High quality product, just what I was looking for, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I really like the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> Kind of a small bottle, I did use it on my face for awhile but I have switched to using a vitamin C serum. I still use the Argan Oil in my hair though. It does great to smooth out curls.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product.  So far all it&#x27;s done is make me break out.  No noticeable .</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I have used it on my hands, face and hair. It works great on the dry ends of my curly hair. If gives my hair a nice shine and helps with the driness.</li>
    <li> smells great and feels great on skin</li>
    <li> The smell is ungodly and it smells like manure</li>
    <li> Great product and wonderful support from the seller - they sent me tips on how to use the oil as well.  It really makes your skin feel soft and not greasy - and it&#x27;s great to use for frizzy or dry hair. It calms it down and keeps it shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Seller contacted me for follow up and offered many ways to use the product. Some things I had not thought of and were a good idea. Try this product and use this seller. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair look longer and healthier.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, and I already see a drastic reduction in split ends.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my hair. After a few uses, I&#x27;ve found that it does a great job at moisturizing and sealing my ends while not weighing them down. I&#x27;ll use a few drops on damp hair before drying and styling. A little goes a long way! I haven&#x27;t tried other argan oil products to compare, but I LOVE that it is free of additives and chemicals, unlike other hair serums I&#x27;ve used in the past. And, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which I like.</li>
    <li> I just received this, so I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time using it yet. I have used it on my face,hands and body and I like the fact that it is not greasy or oily.  It absorbs quickly and is not overly scented with perfumes.  It is very natural and earthy.  Quick shipping too!</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long to try this?! Don&#x27;t wait any longer! I apply daily with two drops of carrot seed EO and love the smooth soft face that I am experiencing!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product!! It is high quality, I love that fact that it is organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this with my lotion on my legs. I use about 1/2 a tincture or even just a few drops and mix with my daily lotion. This stuff just soaks up in your skin and is the best moisturizer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making such a great product, I will be buying more once this runs out :)</li>
    <li> I use this on both my hair and my skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed the really fine lines on my face are looking less noticeable since I&#x27;ve started putting this on before bed.  I also put this in my hair before I blow dry and my naturally dry, kind of frizzy hair, is looking smoother than ever.  I don&#x27;t even have to use a straightener some days!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Faint smokey smell which quickly dissipates. I use this on my super sensitive and dry skin, especially my face. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Will reorder come winter time. This bottle is a great size for a great price.</li>
    <li> Much pleased with this product. I am THRILLED I can use around my eyes which is wonderful considering everything causes eye irritation for me, which means I normally go without, which causes wrinkles. I use on face, neck and eye area. It has eased the dryness of my skin; feels soothed and looks much improved immediately. The crepeiness around my eyes smoothed out instantly. Seriously. Perhaps this is a miracle oil? I appreciate that it comes in an amber glass bottle and not plastic. The dropper works well. I will be buying again. I wish I knew about this argan oil a long time ago--I think of the wrinkles I could have abated when they were forming...tisk tisk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Aria.</li>
    <li> I beklieve coconut oil would have the same effect as the argan oil.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in good condition. It makes my skin my skin feel good, and to have a slight glow.</li>
    <li> Have tried others and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Eh, not working for me as well as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It is perfect for my face, feet, hands, elbows.....everywhere.</li>
    <li> Very good customer service....product arrived in time and well packed&lt;br /&gt;So far I like the oil a lot.its not greasy....I am actually going to order more since I am using it for my face ,nails,feet and used on my grand baby&#x27;s mosquito bite....thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and can already see a huge improvement! A little drop of this stuff goes a long way which is awesome because I have very thick, coarse, curly hair. My frizz is under control, and my ends look much nicer! I will definitely restock once I&#x27;m out!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this when opening it up, simply by the reviews, the emails I received from the company ensuring my satisfaction with the product and giving me tips on how to use the argan oil, which made me more excited cuz now I have my boyfriend using it on his beard lol. I love it! Definitely a must have</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend for his beard. It works fine but it has a bad smell to it. It wouldn&#x27;t make a difference if it was for other areas of the body but, its on his face so it is bothersome.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the argon oil.  I have 3 different skin disorders on my face but the argon oil helps hold in moisture&lt;br /&gt;without irritating my skin.  I was also pleased with the price.  Thanks for your personal communications.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS ONLY 2 OUNCES, USUALLY GET 4....MY MISTAKE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but so far it has worked pretty well taming the frizz out of my hair. Pleased with the product so far</li>
    <li> Oil penetrates skin, leaves no residue. As a 70+ female, my skin looks dewy and in such a short time. I have several health problems and my skin really needed help.  Please keep product at the same quality, do not change ingredients and I will highly recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Simply stated, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I am &amp;#34;above 50&amp;#34; years of age, and I live in Colorado.  Needless to say, this Winter has been cold and my house and my climate are both VERY dry.  After using this oil, my face is now my friend!  Even my daughter can&#x27;t believe the difference in her face (after I admitted I was using a different product) and shared it with her!  In another part of the country, this is a great base oil.  In my part of the country, this is a great face-friendly oil.  P.S., my hair loves it, too.  I&#x27;m so glad I found your Company on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great for taming dry ends and putting the shine back in my hair.  I discovered that I must use less than other Argan Oil products or my hair gets greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this argon oil for less than a week on my bumpy(eczema), easily irritated skin. So far I have had no negative reaction and my skin feels softer! It&#x27;s even helped the sun caused wrinkles and damage I&#x27;ve started to develop on my chest.  It has a faint scent but it&#x27;s not perfumey and is easy to use with the included dropper. I am very glad that I found out about this miracle oil!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It leaves my skin soft</li>
    <li> This seller must have been getting friends to write their reviews because the oil is not what it seems to be, this is the worst argan oil, it&#x27;s sticky and extremely greasy for my face and hair. I have used better argan oil and this is the worst! Please do not waste your money on this product. Is not what I expected, I was fooled by all the reviews!!</li>
    <li> Great product as described and follow up customer service is helpful and responsive</li>
    <li> Love it this product :))</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Virgin Argan Oil and I&#x27;m loving it. I recently transitioned back to my natural state of hair - no more harsh chemicals - and heard of Argan oil being a good product to use. It is light, and non-greasy and makes my hair even softer than it already is and adds a nice shine as well. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying its other uses as well, such as on my skin, etc. . .  The product was delivered quickly and nicely packaged. I give this product and merchant five stars!!</li>
    <li> Thanks for a wonderful addition to my other oils.</li>
    <li> see my previous review. it is the best Argan oil that is multipurpose</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and packaged perfectly. A very positive experience thanks!</li>
    <li> After using this  oil for a week i noticed a smooth n soft skin. It helped to combat my dryness,but it made my skin little sensitive.</li>
    <li> Did masks on hair. After that hair feels good.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Josie Maran Argon Oil.  Excellent value and works just the same !!  thank you for making it affordable !!  Will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This argon oil is great! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. The product came on time. I would buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! My hair feels great!!! My nails look awesome!!! and i put it on my face after my hair and my face is clearing up(: my face produces so much oil... putting this argan oil on is helping keep my face soft(:</li>
    <li> I have super thick kind of long hair, and this argan oil makes it feel less heavy and softer! I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Can;t go wrong with it being organic. I am using as a base oil in my face serum.</li>
    <li> My baby has cradle cap and super dry skin and this oil has made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> Great cheaper alternative to the argan oil I usually buy at sephora.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I am very happy with it. My hair feels and look amazing. I used it on my skin and it is very nice as well. I am pleased with the product.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great value! Makes my skin dewy and radiant.</li>
    <li> wonderful product!!!  I use it everyday and love the results!</li>
    <li> In love with this product! I used to use coconut oil but I love how argan oil is quickly absorbed in my skin. I&#x27;m heartbroken because the top wasn&#x27;t screwed on like I thought I had it &amp; now most of it is on the floor ),: (totally my fault). I&#x27;m looking for to my next delivery. Hopefully it gets here fast!</li>
    <li> This is a quality Argan Oil. I use it on my face and as one of the ingredients in my homemade hair strengthening oil. The product arrived on time and was packaged very well. I highly recommend.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Smaller bottle than i expected but it says only use 2 drops and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty awesome! My hair is long(ish) I used two drops and it was A LOT. So next time I&#x27;ll try just one :)</li>
    <li> Great product, my husband needed an oil for his beard/hair clippers but we didn&#x27;t want to buy the nasty chemical oil, so we looked for an alternative. I found this one and purchased it, and it works really well. It is very earth-friendly too.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Argan Oil has many uses too. I applied it to my just processed dry hair and it was instantly repaired...so soft and shiny. I also put it on my skin and it was absorbed quickly with no oily feel just beautiful healthy skin. I am going to recommend it to my friends and family. Now I know what all the excitement is about!</li>
    <li> MY SKIN LOVES ARGAN OIL I RECOMMEND A LOT</li>
    <li> I love Argan oil.I use in my hair and skin.absorbs fast and leaves my skin so soft.my hair is shiny.not  greasy. Love using it!</li>
    <li> Timely delivery and well packaged.  Just what I expected!.  Good job.</li>
    <li> Not than same as other brands of argan oil. This is a watered down version and I wasted my money on 2 bottles</li>
    <li> So far, I love it. I&#x27;m trying to get rid of all the &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products that are anything other than simple and straightforward. This works for hair, nails, face, scalp and other placed I haven&#x27;t thought of yet.</li>
    <li> This oil is great!  I only need a couple of drops for my hair.  Also, it does NOT smell like some other products.  That is the best part since I am allergic to heavy perfumey smells.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care this product. There is no nice woody smell like the last one i had. Not silky either. Feels greasy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for something natural to help with my skin concerns, so I wanted to give some time for my skin to really adjust to the product before I sent a review. I tried using argan oil for my skin in the past (Josie Maran), and I really wanted to be wowed since it was talked up to be a &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34;. I did not see significant difference in my skin, especially for the steep price, so I stopped using it. It was also too oily which also scared me away from using it even more. It has been about two years since I last used the product but I wanted to give it another chance. I decided to turn to Amazon for some other alternatives. I came across the Aria Starr product and was intrigued by the affordable price and the promise of it being completely natural product. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and I am very happy with the results so far. I use it at night before bed and I wake up glowing, not greasy. My makeup applies flawlessly and I do not get oily during the day. I also used to be an avid foundation user, but now all I use is a BB primer which I could never use before without feeling like I needed more coverage. I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but I wanted great skin that I could show off in its most natural form, with no makeup at all. Aria Starr has definitely given me those results! I never review products as I am very hard to please, but this definitely deserves a review. Its affordable, and it works even better than products sold at high end department stores, so I will definitely continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite argan oil! You only have to use a tiny bit on the ends for smooth hair so it lasts a long time. Be careful about over doing it because it can make your hair look greasy if you use too much. I have dry hair and have found that a large drop is plenty.</li>
    <li> Today is the first day I used this Argan Oil and I am in love! I used 2-3 drops on my face and on my nails, I have to say it is some powerful stuff! Just a couple drops is all you need for everything. It&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it. It makes my face have a beautiful glow and already made my nails so soft. If you want a powerful, all natural Argan oil at a good price, I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love it!  I&#x27;ve only had this for 4 days, but already people have said that my skin glows.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Have been using this for about 2 weeks, once a day, and so far my skin has cleared up noticeably. Not sure if it&#x27;s because I switched foundations, or the argan oil, but so far no complaints!</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this product. I bought this originally for my hair then I  read reviews of people using on face. There were hundreds of reviews of people with oily skin applying it to face and loved what it did to their skin. Wow, this stuff is awsome on face as well as hair. I&#x27;m 45 and my skin has been looking awful even thought I use professional products to control oil and blackheads and clogged pores. We I gave it a try using just a little and couldn&#x27;t believe  how well it worked on my face. My pores are smaller and not as clogged. I bought this product along with jojoba oil by leven rose. Love both these products. I use both on my hair and face everyday. So glad for the people who submitted reviews for using this product on oily acne prone skin. Without those reviews I would have never tried on my face.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this purchase. My wife is using the Argan oil as a leave-in conditioner and it works great, leaving hair really soft. On the skin it works wonderfully too, again leaving a soft and radiant look. It absorbs quick and has no residue smell afterwards. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to apply to my hair and nails. My hair was dull and dry from coloring and perming, and the argan oil did bring my hair back to life! Also helped soften my dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I originally got it to use in my hair for frizzy issues. Aria Starr had sent usage information that explains it&#x27;s great for helping with nails, dry lips and scalp as well as overall moisturizer, wrinkles and acne. I&#x27;ve just gotten it but already have found it lives up to my expectations and more. I recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s Argan oil and then there&#x27;s Argan oil.  I&#x27;ve used another brand before ordering yours.&lt;br /&gt;It is superior to the one I used before.  It goes right into my skin and leaves no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;I will order this one again.</li>
    <li> Very nice carrier oil. Smells please tell and absorbs nicely. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> My oil had an odor that I have not really noticed with other argan oils. It&#x27;s not strong, but it is kind of... sour? The oil absorbs well, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as moisturing as other argan oils that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that the company was very kind and responsive about their product. As my oil was shipped to me in the middle of a Salt Lake winter, maybe the cold had an effect on the oil? Or perhaps it was just an \\&quot;off\\&quot; batch? The company offers a 90-day money back guarantee, so I think that I would be willing to try it again in the future.</li>
    <li> My nails where totally damage and after I used it they were almost normal. Totally worth it!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I have used it for around two days for my very dry face &amp; it has seriously done wonders! I&#x27;m use to spending almost 50$ on argon oil, &amp; when I saw this Price I simply had to try it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it  for extremely dry skin on elbows, feet and hands.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Also seems to make my nails stronger</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use on face daily and on hair the night before I shampoo the next morning. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far, I love this oil.  I need to mork with it a little more to maximize its potential.  I am excited to have it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good product. I ordered twice. The first time was excellent but the second time was weird. It has a funny smell like olive oil. But it&#x27;s still worked very well. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal but overall it&#x27;s an awesome product</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I absolutely love my Aria Starr Beauty’s 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil.  I use it after shampooing.  My hair looks so silky and healthy. Not dry and freezy like it usually looks.  I also use it on my hands.  They are so winter dry and this oil helps them look healthy.  I also bought a second bottle of Argan Oil for my adult son who has dry scalp and freezy curly hair.  I’m sure he’s going to love it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my skin moisture and soft, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this argan oil for a little over a week. I love how my skin absorbs it and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all. I purchased this to use on my daughters hair. I haven&#x27;t used it on her hair just yet, once I do I will def update this review. As far as using it on the skin I love it!</li>
    <li> Feels great on your skin. Absorbs well leaving your skin hydrated and with a subtle glow.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 months now in place of my normal lotion moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for my hair and nails so far, it&#x27;s not greasy at all. I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple days and I love it so far! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing when I&#x27;m out again :)</li>
    <li> Love it, soaks right in.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly. The bottle it came in has a nice dropper &amp; the quality is great. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> This has transformed my skin to luminous again.  This is a must in my routine every single day now. My skin is soft and perfect again.</li>
    <li> Love it slight smell like reminds me of summer!</li>
    <li> Love using this all over!! Face, hands, hair..works great and feels great</li>
    <li> Liking it so far. Only had it few days but it has helped clear up the dry skin on my face caused by this dry winter air.</li>
    <li> I love this oil so far. I have mild eczema and my face tends to get severe dry patches (especially during winter) and I find that normal lotion does not seem to be enough. I put a light layer of this on my face and rub it in every other night and it has really cleared up alot of the dry patches on my face. I also put this into my scalp and rub into my hair from time to time--combined with Jamaican black castor oil, almond oil, evening primrose oil, olive oil and coconut oil. It all hydrates and keeps the eczema-related itchiness at bay. Will definitely purchase again when I run out. Barely any smell.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t reviewed anything on Amazon in a very long time HOWEVER, this product is pretty damn amazing. I originally wanted argan oil for my hair but didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for the Josie Marin again. After some searching and reading all these amazing reviews, I decided to give this product a try. I literally use this product head to toe! I put it in my hair right after washing it and also right after I blow dry it. It makes my hair super smooth and shiny. At night, after I shower I rub this oil all over my body. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all. Yes, it does have a very earthy scent and my dog can&#x27;t stop sniffing me after I use it but the effects are really unbelievable. We really should all go back to the basics and use our natural products instead of adding more chemicals to ourselves. They definitely should bottle this in a larger quantity size!! Thank you for the intro email and the follow up!! I already highly recommended this to my coworkers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to embark on a journey of returning my hair, to its natural state. Though this journey is only 3 months in the making; I&#x27;ve chosen this oil to use for my regimen. Though I&#x27;ve just been using it for a few days. I must say it has moisturized my hair surprisingly well, without the oily build-up, that I feared. I will continue to use this oil, and replenish my supply as needed. Thanks for making such a great product. I look forward to exploring other products you offer.</li>
    <li> This has a stronger scent than other Argan oil I have tried, but it is an excellent price and feels very nice.</li>
    <li> Light on the skin, gets absorbed completely and I use it daily. I will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Many other ingredients listed on the bottle other than Argan oil so unsure about the pureness so I wouldn&#x27;t use on my face. It works well on my hair and leaves is soft and shiney but not greasy.</li>
    <li> Amazing I used this on my hair face and body I love the way it leaves my skin.  Fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> I do have to say that I like this a lot. I use this for my face and it is lovely. What&#x27;s interesting is I&#x27;m normally oily on my forehead and nose, however,  I&#x27;m not having that problem even though this has been added to my facial regimen. Impressed to say the least.</li>
    <li> The Virgin Argan Oil is of excellent.  I use it on my face, hair and together with a couple of other oils for the body. I&#x27;m glad I ordered it and will do so in the future. My hope is that the high quality of the oil is maintained.</li>
    <li> I like that this is natural and free of harmful chemicals. I find I have to use very little, only 4-5 drops. If I apply it to one part of my hair, that part will look greasy later. I find it looks better if I add a little water and then rub it in. It is really effective at controlling frizz and keeping my hair smoother.</li>
    <li> I am still learning all of the uses for this oil and have not used it long enough to be completely thorough in my review.  It has performed as promised on my hair and skin and I look forward to all the benefits this oil has to offer.</li>
    <li> Great face oil!  Arrived in a timely fashion!</li>
    <li> Absorbs well. Not greasy. Works better than lotion.</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin and hair and I love it</li>
    <li> Product is high quality and easy to apply and absorbs quick and easy. I use it for just about everything, hair, skin, beard, you name it, even though the bottle is small a little goes a long way, so I would expect this to last at least several months.  For reference I have a medium length bears and medium length hair and 2-3 drops per works great.</li>
    <li> Great product. Recommend that you only you a small amount.</li>
    <li> Virgin Argan Oil, so far so good! I have used it on my niece&#x27;s hair who has natural tight curls. The oil adds a nice healthy shine, and it acts as a great moisturizer. I love that it is not saturated with chemicals. I will continue to observe it&#x27;s effects. Thank you Aria Starr Beauty!</li>
    <li> It has made my face so soft and my hair really soft as well, i use it as a mosturizer in the morning and at night and I have really dry skin and it&#x27;s made it very soft&lt;br /&gt; Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems fine.. but the smell is unbearable! Absolutely disgusting :(</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and acne as a result of it. I ordered this product with the intentions of giving something new a &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; try. 2 days. That&#x27;s all it took for me to see a monumental  difference. My skin wasn&#x27;the flaky at the end of the day, my acne was healin and the cystic ones were no longer painful and moving to the surface. If anyone has issues with dry skin and cystic acne, try this product out. Give it 2-3 days. My 4 year long search for a helpful product is over.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fantastic argan oil for almost two weeks, and I am loving the results.  My rough, chapped winter skin is markedly smoother and I believe that the tiny, dry wrinkles that I had started to notice around my eyes have been lessened.  Very impressed with the company&#x27;s follow up as well.  Overall, top notch.</li>
    <li> This product is light &amp; makes my hair so shiny! I am in love.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go a day without it! I use this Argan oil as a leave in conditioner for my hair. After washing, I rub 3 drops across my fingers and then work it through my wet hair. I let it sit for about 10 min before I start combing/brushing. This has been a game changer for my hair! I barely have any tangles anymore, it&#x27;s stronger, and visibly healthier. I use 3 drops every time I wash my hair and the results have been amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised how much I love this product. I will never go back to regular moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter as a gift.  she loves it.  She has always had to use some type of moisture and says this  leaves no greasy feeling and you use a very small amount for the area       I got this product for my self in Sept.2015 because my daughter like it.  i am very happy with this. Was not thinking about my hands and nails but they have really improved just by applying to other parts of my body.   i have a medicat issue with dry skin, this really helped</li>
    <li> I use this product on everything, especially on my nails and hair!</li>
    <li> This is quality argon oil priced at a reasonable rate when compared to competitors. Fast shipping and excellent customer service, will buy again! A++</li>
    <li> Too early to expect wonders as i started using a week ago but i really love the way my skin feels and smells whenever i apply this product.&lt;br /&gt;For an Oil product, it Doesn&#x27;t stick - gets absorbed really quick - Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for the results but i believe that i won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been weaning my hair off of shampoos and am going low-poo at the moment. Originally my hair was severely damaged and dry, I&#x27;ve been using this over a week now putting a few drops at the ends of my hair. My hair loves this stuff!! I&#x27;m really starting to tell a difference in my usually severely dry hair. Love that it&#x27;s organic so I can use it if or when I go no-poo. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell in the beginning, sort of like olive oil but I guess that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s fragrance free! But after a few seconds it doesn&#x27;t smell of anything</li>
    <li> Great product and service. I appreciate the suggestions for usage as well.</li>
    <li> I use it for my skin and it has made a world of difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it daily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> This oil is by far the oilest argan oil that I have ever used in my life. It easily absorbed into every pore and follicle it was applied to. My oak floor even loved it when I spilled most of a new bottle onto it.</li>
    <li> Does a fantastic job of moisturizing my super dry winter worn hands and feet... Goes on smoothly and dries quickly. It has almost no scent at all, definitely a must have for your skin and hair... Felt a noticeable difference the very first day i tried it. Thank you for a great buy!!</li>
    <li> This oil is light, but moisturizes like crazy.  I have very dry skin and have been using it on my face twice a day.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Fragrant free and makes my hair and skin very soft.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product with nice price. This oil is wonderful for dry hair!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Used it as conditioner for my hair and nails/cuticles. Have not tried on skin yet but plan to. Smell was faint and good. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been trying a variety of argan oils in order to get the benefits argan oil is known for. I have been using it to soften cuticles, handle itchy scalp and soften hair.  This argan oil is superior to all those I have tried.  It is the first organic and virgin argan oil I have tried and compared to just organic it is superior. I would not hesitate to purchase it again from this seller who not only sent an email describing all the possible uses for the oil but then promptly answered a question I had about the differences between argan oil that is organic and that which is organic and virgin.  Best customer service on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil three times this week instead of my moisturizer...I don&#x27;t plan to go back to the moisturizer. This feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Since I began using it on my face; my skin feels so soft. You only need to use a little dab and it covers your entire face. It also helps tame my dry, wild hair, so it is truly multi-purpose.  Last but not least, it is reasonably-priced. I&#x27;d definitely purchase Argan Oil again!</li>
    <li> I wish I have bought this long time ago, my face is very smooth and my hair is no longer dry anymore. It&#x27;s better applying it to your hair  when wet n then blow dry.</li>
    <li> Until now i havn&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin ! I&#x27;ll give it one more month and i will edit my review ..</li>
    <li> Only used the product one time as a scalp/hair conditioner.  Loved the shine that it gave to my hair and now trying it on my complexion.  Glad that I ordered the product and will continue to use as you advised me.  Thanks for your info on where and how to use....this is definitely a positive for your company and this product.  It appears that you care about your customers and that is appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;BL</li>
    <li> My oil hasnt given any good result after 2 weeks of use.  It doesnt smell very good.  As per this site, it should smell of luxury :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://saadiaorganics.com/7-warning-signs-that-your-argan-oil-is-impure</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Argan Oil. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as a moisturizer every morning and night. My face feels so soft and healthy. The oil has given my skin a lovely glow and smooth complexion. I even used it as a shine serum on my hair yesterday, it works so well! Thank you so much, Aria Starr Beauty!</li>
    <li> Used this product. Very nice. Only need a few drops for the face. Same for hair. No scent to it, I even mixed it with some lavender. Organic too? Win Win. The price is fair too. I&#x27;d recommend and I believe it will last quite sometime, and I&#x27;ll be sure to reorder. Also can appreciate the reach out to check in on the product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love any organic product that will leave my face smooth,&lt;br /&gt;this clear up the dry spots on my face.</li>
    <li> great product.  exactly as ordered</li>
    <li> This was my first argan oil purchase.  So far I love it!  I don&#x27;t think I will purchase any other brand</li>
    <li> OK.  I don&#x27;t know if it is actually making any difference on my hair.  Maybe, psychologically...</li>
    <li> so I just bought it last week because my hair has been quite dry. after using this product for a week i can certainly tell the difference especially in terms of volume. thanks.</li>
    <li> I love my argan oil, it&#x27;s working wonderfully. I use it for everything (as a leave-in conditioner on the ends of my hair, and as moisturizer for my face, nails, and cuticle), and I was happy to find this one at such a great price.</li>
    <li> I am making my own condition for my daughters hair, it is curly and super thick and this has definitely helped. It was well packaged and I am looking forward to adding to my homemade shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this silky smooth oil, feels nice and helps skin feel soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Works just as intended and I love the follow up from the company! Glad I purchased it! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells legit. Has lot numbers and expiry dates. In the sea of Argan Oil competition id say this is a good one.</li>
    <li> I have used for a little over a week and love it. It makes my face so soft and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. I have also used on my hair as a leave-in. I don&#x27;t care for the smell too much but it does quickly go away after rubbed in. Other than that I have nothing negative to say.</li>
    <li> Terrible smell... like it had rotted. Definitely not supposed to be like that. Had to throw away the whole thing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product... I always had a problem with dry skin, especially my face.  After using this product just a couple of drops lasts the whole day.  I had to buy a second one to have in reserve.  hopes this review helps you decide to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I like it as any other virgin argan oil. It does what it suppose to do: moisturize, moisturize and moisturize</li>
    <li> This argan oil is absolutely top class and doesn&#x27;t come with the expensive price tag.&lt;br /&gt;The dropper is easy to use. It just gives me exactly what I need everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil smells fresh and absorbs right away! Amazing product</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I have been using it as a hair treatment, facial moisturizer, and on a recent surgery scar, and all three areas have shown marked improvement.  Naturally, I have tried other products in the past, and this outshines them all.  I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Product is great! Absolutely love using argan oil on my face, hands and in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Helps with very dry skin in a very dry climate.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it in my wet hair before blow drying and straightening and on my face as a moisturizer. It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair or my face greasy.  My hair is shiny and soft and my skin feels and looks great. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This Oil did not soften my hair or heal my scalp like I was hoping. I found this Argan oil to only be okay and not be worth the premium price I paid. I wish I would have my money back or have gotten an extra oil to make up for it&#x27;s high cost and lack of performance!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! It is incredible for my face and also my nails and skin. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I had already had some experiences with Argan Oil, so when I began to run out of my current stock, I wanted more and discovered this product.  Upon ordering, I received a great email from the company, AriaStarrBeauty, suggesting lots of ways to use their product, some of which I hadn&#x27;t considered.  It&#x27;s the middle of winter, and I heat with wood so my skin, scalp and hair is dry.  One of the suggestions was to apply Argan Oil to my scalp.  I did, and left it on overnight, pulling some oil through the ends of my hair.  My scalp is already feeling less itchy, and my hair is less dry on the ends after two applications.  It is great to put a little on the ends of my hair before using the blow dryer too. I had originally purchased it to apply to my face, but now I am using it all over, including on dry patchy spots of skin, a result of the cold, dry winter. Further, the other Argan Oil products I had tried had strong fragrances, whereas this product does not, because it is 100% oil, with no additives.  I will purchase this product again, and I will share it with my friends!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have only used a few days, but will definitely be repurchasing and in a larger size if available.  My skin is softer already.  I have been using under makeup (I let it absorb a few minutes), and I use it at bedtime.  It has a light, pleasant and fresh smell.  Sure beats paying a lot for expensive moisturizers when I can see this really works!</li>
    <li> I put 2-3 drops in my hair and it keeps it smooth, shiny, and frizz-free.</li>
    <li> This is amazing oil that I use on my hair and like half the price of buying Argan hair oil from haircare products. Works just as well if not better and you save a fortune.</li>
    <li> Great product.....I love it!!</li>
    <li> Definitely pure oil, been using it for a few days on my face (after thorough washing) and my skin is looking soft and refreshed</li>
    <li> great stuff....used on dry scalp and after shampoo on ends and it worked miracles!</li>
    <li> Bought this to use in my hair and I love it!  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell if it does me any good.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I love this, but I can&#x27;t say I hate it, either. While adding the oil to my hair does seem to control the frizzies better than without, I also have to put at least half a dropper full, contrary to the description of &#x27;a few drops goes a long way.&#x27; And I end up with unattractive oily strands. A few drops does not coat enough of the hair when it is as long as their models, and there&#x27;s no way the hair photo for this product did nothing except add the argan oil. That woman&#x27;s hair was styled professionally with plenty of product - and that&#x27;s misleading to those of us with long hair.</li>
    <li> Many argan oil products on the market have fillers. This product is organic and 100% argan oil. You can feel the difference immediately, just a little goes a long way. My face feels great and I&#x27;m also using it on my nails and hair. I was very impressed Aria (store owner) sent an email after I ordered to explain the different ways the oil can be used. I highly recommend the product and Aria Starr Beauty.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair oil, I also use it on my granddaughters hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week now and it&#x27;s so great. Just what I was hoping for. Lightweight moisture that feels amazing and doesn&#x27;t breakout my skin. I think I&#x27;m going to add a couple drops of Neroli essential oil to it for fragrance. But even unscented and natural as it is now, it is so great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Use a dab on your dry winter skin (elbows for example) and just perfect for your hair. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> My son uses this every day in his thick curly hair.  It is the first product that leaves his hair more tame, but not greasy feeling.  It washes out clean and it smells good, which is very important to teenagers especially!  My son&#x27;s hair is so thick that it is hard to find his scalp.  His curls are tight and stubborn.  This relaxes them a little but keeps them in shape.  Beautiful head of hair with this Argan oil. We tried other Argan products, but not with these results as they all had additives that dried his hair rather than just moisture.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  I purchased for my mom and I at Xmas.  It can moisturize your face, is good for nail cutilces, split ends, for your face if helps with eliminating breakouts.  As for removing lines and wrinkles, does not work for this or does not plump skin, just gives you a nice moisture.  I put on C serum first, then the Argan Oil and then moisturizer for day.  Also can use after you put on Retinol which can be drying!  Best wishes&lt;br /&gt;ladies.</li>
    <li> This stuff stink so bad . I&#x27;m embarrassed to wear it. Will stick to cream of nature brand,smells 100 times better.</li>
    <li> This product is so moisturizing, I use it on my face &amp; hair &amp; saw immediate results. Will definitely be purchasing this again soon</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because it had good reviews and was listed as fragrance free, to use as moisturizer on my face. But is has a WEIRD UNPLEASANT SMELL, something in between plastic and cured meat. It does not smell pleasantly &amp;#34;nutty.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t want to put that on my face or anywhere.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I never had skin problems, not even as a teenager, but all of a sudden I&#x27;ve become allergic to all my face creams and I typically spend a lot of money on my beauty products but there wasn&#x27;t a product that I tried that didn&#x27;t break me out in a rash...it was painful and ugly. I started using the Argan oil products from QVC and it worked like a miracle. I decided to go to Amazon for the same product in hopes of finding a less expensive version and think I have found it in this one. I love that it is not oily and my skin loves it because it doesn&#x27;t break me out in like the other products I&#x27;ve tried. It has to be all natural or my skin would have rejected it like the others and the price is a lot easier on my pocket than the other brand I was using.</li>
    <li> Kinda thin, but liked product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted to share my response to your Virgin Argan Oil, Aria. From the first time I applied the oil to my face and skin, I could see an immediate difference in the softness and texture of my face. I love it! You have a raving fan on your hands and a long-time, repeat user. Thank you for your personal touch and follow up to make sure everything met my expectations and your standards. Smiles, Jewel McKeon</li>
    <li> I really love this Argan oil I using it on my face and hair and notice a difference I recommend it</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my hair to make it shiny and calm the frizz. I also suffer from Rosacea and I use it on my face too!</li>
    <li> This is a repeat order for me- I really like this product, it is highest quality. I use this as a moisturizer for my face and sometimes ends of my hair. It absorbs fast and leaves my skin soft. Some other products have a lesser quality, but this is 100% argan oil and organic too!</li>
    <li> I moved to a new climate, and experienced different weather which has done a number on my skin. I use the Argan Oil directly on my face, without any dilution, and it has made a world of difference.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first because there was no USDA approved stamp. It&#x27;s seem a little greasy, just a little bit. And so I just put it in a shelf for a while. After 6 months, I checked it again because one of my friend is using one and so it made me want to check out mine but by this time, I was expecting it to be gone bad but to my surprise, it still smell the same as I got it (it is a slight pleasent smell to me) and this is after few months. And so I continued using it now and will probably buy it again soon.  Thank you for your patience to me..</li>
    <li> Exellent product. I use it after washing my face with black african soap and then i apply argan oil.  Next morning you can see the difference,  skin so smooth and nice. Even small wrinkles are gone. Nutty smell means it is 100%natural and disappear after few seconds. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I have only been using it for a short time, but it&#x27;s seriously so great for my skin and even hair! On top of that, these guys have wonderful customer service! They sent an email providing helpful tips and suggestions on how to use the oil, with a ton of details and instructions. It was perfect, especially since I kind of just got into this oil thing and didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing! So far I am super satisfied with this product and company!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for around the eyes and mouth; those fine lines seem to diminish.</li>
    <li> It is avery good oil.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell of this product it smells like motor oil/rotten olives.  I can&#x27;t imagine putting this in my hair and having myself smell like this stuff or putting it anywhere near my face. I put it on my hands and lasted about 10 mins before I couldnt take the smell anymore and went to scrub my hands until the smell was gone. I have  a bottle of argan oil from Josie Maran  and while pricey it has very little smell unlike this. Def wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have a sensitive nose or if you plan to be near people that will smell you. lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pure argan oil! The smell is a little nutty but it is silky and highly comparable to Josie Maran. It give such a some silky feeling that leaves you soft not oily. A little goes a long way so this should last me forever.  It&#x27;s great for healing, hair and facial moisturizer!  I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Ive been using it on my face every night before i go to bed because i have very dry flaky skin and its really made a difference. Ive also been putting it on my boyfriends hands and feet. I noticed results instantly...his hands didn&#x27;t feel like sandpaper just after one use😄definitely a must have!</li>
    <li> By far i have no complaints on this product. Is the firs oil based hair product I used that does not leave my face oily and itchy. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Exceptional product.  Just a couple drops as leave in conditioner has softened my wirey dry hair.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for almost two weeks now.  Have noticed that my skin is looking and feeling better.  I did break out a little bit, but persevered and am happy I did.  It&#x27;s also great for lips!  I use it on the ends of my hair which keeps them from flying around.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and see where it takes me.  I like the smell of it.  It arrived quickly and packaged very well.</li>
    <li> I love love argan oil for hair and skin! It has a light nutty smell I&#x27;m not a big fan of but it dissipates quickly. I really like the packaging of this oil (the dropper) because you only always need a fee drops of it so this function is super convinient to use! Quality of this oil is great becuase it&#x27;s free of preservatives or other additives.</li>
    <li> I used this oil in making a recipe for oily skin and my initial impressions are excellent!! There are no bad odor and it isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs very well. No negatives and I will purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Summer skin is feeling better and MUCH less dry. I like to mix the argan oil with lotion to put on my arms and legs.  i have also used it directly on my elbows, face and hair.</li>
    <li> When I opened the delivery box I did not expect a bottle soooooo small!!!! I was greatly disappointed. I was hoping it the bottled was a little bigger. I will mix it with other organic oils but this will be the last purchase. More to follow on whether the actual oil works. By the way, the deliver from the company was great!!!</li>
    <li> The product is very nice. I have middle aged hair that I color and use heat styling instruments and products on. It gets quite dry, a bit frizzy and the shine and color fades a few weeks after coloring. I have tried a lot of different conditioners, masks and oils. I am completely new to Argan Oil and have been searching for a product that would help my hair stay moister and healthier looking throughout the day. This product makes my hair soft, moist, and it looks healthier with a little more volume. A little of the oil certainly goes a long way! I am amazed how just a few drops can make such a dramatic difference. As I just started using it, I am hoping it will improve the health of my hair through regular use. The service has been great too. I have appreciated the followup by the company on the best practice methods for using the product. They let me know when it was shipped. that knew when it arrived and sent messages offering their support and advice. I am exceptionally pleased.</li>
    <li> so far so good I have only had it for approximately a week and I am enjoying it at the present time. Give me a couple more weeks and I can give you a better review</li>
    <li> No need to purchase expensive artificial moisturizers, this is it!  Works well on my dry sensitive skin.  I use it daily and my skin feels soft and moisturized.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I really like the oil but thought I was getting a 4oz. bottle really disappointed with that</li>
    <li> 4 stars for customer service! They were great! I wrote them asking suggestions on how to use it for my curly hair. They answered immediately, gave me some suggestions and a full refund. Not all products are for every hair type and this one didnt work out for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil and this product is exceptional.  I use Argan oil on my hair and face along with some other essential oils.  I make my own serums for my skin and hair with only high grade pure organic oils and the results are amazing.  I am no longer spending money on products that contain fillers and chemicals, and cost an arm and leg.  My hair has become lustrous and fuller since using argan oil.  My face is softer and glowing.  This argan oil product is easily absorbed and light enough to use in your hair without weighing it down.  Thank you for taking so much care in creating a pure product that is affordable and easy to use.  I love the fact that the company included a dropper which gives helps eliminate waste.</li>
    <li> Best oil, my face is very smooth, i use it for my skin , hair, I would buy again !</li>
    <li> The humid weather keeps losing the fight with this stuff.  This is the best treatment for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is great for your face, and nails, and even hair! I have sensitive skin, and my skin loves this Argan Oil. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I Love it!Virgin Argan Oil is awesome... Thank youuuuu</li>
    <li> Great for moisturizing my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin. Not sure if it does anything for my hair, but I do apply a little bit after I blow dry my hair. For my skin and hands though it&#x27;s amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue!</li>
    <li> This product is as great as it sounds - it worked wonders in a very short time, making my hair shiny and beautiful.  Though it does have an ...earthy... scent, it truly does go right away when you apply it! I love this!</li>
    <li> Love this product, absolutely would buy again. Very natural aroma, I use this product for my beard. Leaves my beard shiny and silky.</li>
    <li> This product has been wonderful so far. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days and love it! The oil absorbs nicely into my skin, leaving it super soft. I like the glass dropper and the bottle that the product comes in. I will continue to use this product and rate it highly thus far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep right on buying this product !</li>
    <li> I am in my early forties and I have thick, coarse hair (I&#x27;m Caucasian). I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has not been as soft and manageable as it used to be in my thirties. I do dye my hair about every 4-5 weeks and I dry and style my hair with a blow dryer.  My hair has gotten very dry and unmanageable in the last couple of years I have tried pricey shampoos and conditioners from the salon which helped a little but did not give me the soft, shiny, manageable hair I had. I have tried an Aegean oil mixture that I bought from Target but it left my hair oily feeling and looking that I disposed of it after a week. Also, my face broke out in blemishes during that week I tried the product so it may have irritated my skin. I was about to purchase a special hair dryer that had argan oil strips when I came across this oil. I thought I would give it a try. The reviews were great so I was interested to see how it would work for me. I received it right away in a well packaged box. I washed and conditioned my hair like normal and then applied some oil in the palm of my hand and rubbed it in my hair. I used almost two droppers full on my shoulder length hair which was way too much. My hair was very soft but slightly oily. It surprisingly was not greasy or greasy looking but not quite right. The next time I used about 6 drops total throughout my hair and blow dried. My hair is so soft, shiny, and manageable. I kept touching my hair through the day. Welcome back soft, shiny hair!  I still need to use the flat iron a little to manage my wavy hair but looks great now. I started using this product on my young sons hair after their bath and before blow drying. It seems to keep their hair soft and easier to comb/straighten in the morning with their &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34;.  I plan to purchase another bottle although this bottle will last awhile since you just need drops for each application.</li>
    <li> Great product, but disappointed it made me break out on my face. Will use on other areas because it&#x27;s a great oil.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do much for my fine, thin, highlighted hair.  It still looked like I had put oil in my hair on the ends.  I guess my hair is too fine?</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil</li>
    <li> I have used Argan oil for my skin and fly away hair.  I especially love it for my hair as it gives it body and softness and lots of shine.  and makes it very  manageable.  Use it every day and night on cleaned skin for softness.  Kathryn Sheehy.</li>
    <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product it works very good</li>
    <li> Love this product !!! As stated  can be used on body hair&amp;face. Leaves my hair so  soft .I will continue to by this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this along with some other oils.  I actually almost didn&#x27;t order this because I thought the others would be better for my skin type.  After using all of them for a bit, this is my favorite.  Honestly, it&#x27;s probably the only skin careproduct I&#x27;ve ever used and actually visibly noticed a difference.  I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other Argan Oils, but if I have to buy again, this is the one I&#x27;ll get because I already know it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to argan oil. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and am glad I bought it. I like how versatile it is. I use it for my eczema and my keratosis. It&#x27;s not a cure for either, but is extremely helpful. More so than anything else I&#x27;ve tried in 30-some years. I also appreciate how the seller contacted me to make sure I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. My answer is yes, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and the seller. Great product, great service, one very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I use it every day and night and love how it makes my skin look and feel!</li>
    <li> I used this product yo prevent pregnacy skin marks and it worked great! I have no marks in my skin. Now I&#x27;m using it to eliminate a surgery scar, my dermatologist recommended to me.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product at a great price. No more dryness around the eyes, and soft smooth skin. Also like the dropper. No mess!</li>
    <li> great oil shipped quick</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I am using it as face moisturizer after the shower and it feels and looks amazing.  Smooth, dewy, clear, glowing.  I actually added a few drops of Frankincense essential oil to it since that&#x27;s awesome for skin too and I like the way it smells.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is going to be a staple oil for my hair. It&#x27;s already softer than normal and feels healthier and moisturized.  I have long curly hair that is dry and also dry scalp so I use this oil right when I get out of the shower on my wet hair and scalp and its shinier and fuller. The company is awesome as well and they ensure the purest Argan oil in excellently sealed packaging. This is the first time I spent a little more money to get the pure argan oil instead of a diluted product and I&#x27;m glad I did. I highly recommend this product from this seller since Aria is quick to reach out to me and respond to all my questions and concerns. So happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like the product. Good price. I use it on my cuticles and face everyday and at the tip of my long hair after shampooing.Very moisturizing and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I just recieved the product and only used it a few times, but it aborbs quickly in both skin and hair, leaving a shiny finish. I don&#x27;t look greasy and my hair doesn&#x27;t look oily. As promised the natural earthy scent fades away. Very pleased and I am excited to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect &amp; pure. And a great price point. Buy it.</li>
    <li> After using it I am losing my hair</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for your face</li>
    <li> Excellent quality , my skin loves it !</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the argan oil. I will definitely order more .</li>
    <li> I have only been using this on my hair and face for a couple days now, but I can already tell a difference. My face is smooth and it is great for my damaged hair. People talk about and smell, and I have to admit it is a little strange but it&#x27;s subtle, and it dissipates within minutes so I have zero complaints about it! I am using this as my new facial moisturizer. I already love this stuff! The shipping was also really fast. It was at my house in 2 days!!</li>
    <li> Oil works great on dry skin. Product is organic is it has a very weird smel. I didn&#x27;t find smell pleasant which made it hard to rub all over my face. Seller was fantastic! They strive for 100 percent satisfaction and truly care about your feed back.</li>
    <li> Odd smell but its not oil or greasy.  I use it for my face, hair, and scalp.  I might re-order in the near future.  Price is much lower than any other product like it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I can&#x27;t tell the purity difference with this oil. I use it on my face and in my hair overnight as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> So this is probably the worst smelling hair product I&#x27;ve EVER used. Seriously smells like poop. But I really like what it does for my hair so I still use it but I mix in some perfume oil with it to take the smell away. It&#x27;s a really thick consistency and helps my super thick/course hair a lot.</li>
    <li> So far this product is what I expected. It feels great going on the skin and absorbs really well. I will update my review when I have used it a little longer:)</li>
    <li> Wow.  Who knew such a simple product could be so wonderful!  Since using Argan oil on my hands and nails two times a day, I have NO split nails and i have no split fingers near the nails.  Amazing.  Wonderful.  I put it on my face, neck, hair...  But love it most for what it has done for my hands.  My nails split down the middle all winter until i began using this.  Use it a couple weeks before you see improvement.  Then go ahead and use it on other dry spots of you body in this winter that will never end.  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I really love the oil.  Don’t use too much, as your bangs will be greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used argan oil for years, but using just a few drops of this product left my hair very greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been trying different brands of Argan oil for the past year and this seems to be the best of the bunch.  They all absorb quickly and leave your skin soft, but this brand, so far I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, seems to keep the dryness at bay longer.  My hands are in water constantly and so anything I use is usually stripped off fairly quickly.  I was surprised that my hands still looked and felt softer and moister (for lack of a better word) at the end of the day, having applied the oil in the morning before work.  I&#x27;m an elementary school art teacher, so my hands are not only wet, but often in paint, plaster, clay, etc., none of which is conducive to hydrated hands.  Even the scaly skin on my calves (these descriptions do not paint a very pretty picture, but are accurate nonetheless) has gone away with just a few applications.  My only complaint, or perhaps suggestion is I wish there was a bigger size.  An 8 or 10 ounce size, with a pump, would be great.  I know it might be a bit pricey, but it would be nice to be able to slather oneself occasionally.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I got this product for dry skin and i must say, it works so great. And Also a great price..</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this oil. It makes my skin moist.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product and she complements how great it feels on her skin. She&#x27;s only been using it for 2 days and she could already feel the difference. She says it&#x27;s not sticky, doesn&#x27;t dry out her skin, and skin feels smooth after application. She wanted to purchase more of this but we&#x27;re a little tight on budget so she&#x27;ll wait until it runs out before ordering a new bottle.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing for your hair and body</li>
    <li> This product keeps my hair nice. I use it every night. Love the results that I get by using this oil.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this Argan Oil on my skin.  It really absorbs quickly and leaves a smooth texture.  It&#x27;s more than I hoped for.  It also didn&#x27;t leave a too oily feel on my skin.  I have been looking for a product that is more organic that the products I&#x27;ve been using and I believe I&#x27;ve found it.  I highly recommend Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery. Arrived well packaged. Perfect!  Works great to make my hair and skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Amazingly awesome product. I&#x27;m using it on my face and in my hair and as a hand lotion. For the first time in months, my hands aren&#x27;t dry.  This oil is rich and has no fragrance.  My nutritionist has always to told me...you can&#x27;t get enough oil IN or ON your body.  Thank you for this organic oil and for your continued communication and education about your product.  Inspired!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase...oil really smooths my dry split ends. Also impressed with follow-up customer service by Aria.</li>
    <li> Great results. Purchased for use for psoriasis on my arms and scalp, and itchy facial skin under my neatly trimmed beard. Benefits have gone beyond these concerns as I apply to my hair and beard making them smooth and soft. Ladies now love to touch my beard and can&#x27;t believe how soft it is. Now applying to my whole face with very pleasing results. Will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> Love it!  This is my new product for everything: skin, hair, nails, you name it.  Just don&#x27;t over apply (1-3 drops max per area being applied).</li>
    <li> This product is great for skin or hair. Use in moderation to avoid breakouts or over oiled hair.I love it.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer ever.  Also great for dry hair, skin, and all over body lotion.</li>
    <li> Already in love with this product. Who would think you could put oil on your face, if you have oily skin. But this stuff is amazing. Only used for a few days and already notice difference in my pores.</li>
    <li> very good quality, my skin looks soft and hydrate</li>
    <li> Great quality Argan oil!  Smells fresh and works beautifully. I use this for so many things, skin, hair, cuticles, I mix it with natural lotion to boost the moisture. It&#x27;s just fantastic.</li>
    <li> My skin is great, but this stuff STINKS until it is absorbed. I plan on getting a different brand next time. I have never used it before, so I don&#x27;t know if the smell is for all Argan Oil, or just this particular brand.</li>
    <li> I was more accustomed to the Aragon oil having a fragrance to it from my experience with creme of nature&#x27;s fragrance so far that&#x27;s the only thing that was missing for me.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I have been doing research on the oil cleansing method and have finally settled on using primrose oil combined with Virgin Argan Oil mixed with high quality lavandar and ylang ylang.  I have only been using the method for the past week but have loved how dewy my skin feels and have noticed the hormonal acne I tend to get is less and seems to be clearing.  I highly recommend this lovely product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to create my own oil facial cleanser. I ended up using this alone and the results were great. Obviously not 100% after one use but I can say I felt a difference in my dry Minnesota winter skin! Also used on my hands and hair and it&#x27;s wonderful! I highly reccomend! Shipping was fast &amp; the follow up emails I loved. Thank you!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Love!! Best oil for hair, skin and nails!</li>
    <li> It feels really good on my face and I see a difference.  I feel like my face has a glow.  Tried it on my wavy hair that can be frizzy yesterday and it worked for that too.  Unfortunately I knocked it over in my bathroom last night and broke it.  I was so bummed that I bought two more this morning.  Can&#x27;t wait for them to get here!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have had dandruff problem and scalp build up since a really long time and have been using anti-dandruff shampoo every 2-3 days. My hair looks dull, dry and unhealthy. This Argan oil definitely helps in reducing the frizz in my hair. It is pretty effective so using just a few drops is enough.&lt;br /&gt;However it&#x27;s not a miraculous product. It won&#x27;t make you grow more hair or reduce hair loss. It only gives a nice glossy finish to the hair. I was also using this oil on my face. I have clear skin in general but suddenly got a few pimples, and hence I stopped using it on my face. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the oil or any other factor that caused them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found slightly annoying was the excessive mailing from the company urging me to write a review. Now it&#x27;s kind of clear to me why there are so many reviews for this product. This product is not bad but it&#x27;s not something miraculous either, which it seems to be, if you see the number of reviews on it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful pure organic Argan Oil! Great price! Very informative and cheery follow up letter. I am impressed and very pleased with this product and seller!</li>
    <li> Love to use Aragan oil to refresh my face. For the price I was weary ordered it amyway. Very pleased I did</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic product. Oil is clear, odorless and is absorbed quickly leaving no trace or residue. Using it with organic coconut oil in a whipped body creme. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This oil has worked wonders on my super dry skin. I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive creams, to different oils &amp; nothing works. I no longer have flakes on my face. I use this both in the morning &amp; night time. It doesn&#x27;t effect my makeup since it absorbs in my skin &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel. Of course a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over do it.&lt;br /&gt;Love the price &amp; love that it has no smell. Will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful oil to use! In just a few days using it as a moisturizer, I have noticed a relaxing of the fine lines I have from sun damage. I have combination skin, but the usually oily areas are not any oilier than usual after using this. Aria sent me an email with some tips on how to use the oil and I can&#x27;t wait to try them all. If you are looking for a really hydrating product to use while dealing with winters drying effects, I highly recommend trying this Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Used it as a lip/skin moisturizer and it&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about argan oil for a while now, and given the great price and reviews, I opted for this one. What a great investment! Living in the cold climate that is Massachusetts, my skin has been drier than ever this winter, especially my face. I&#x27;ve been using a few drops of argan oil as a nighttime moisturizer for about a week now, and already my skin feels softer and has more of a dewy glow. A couple drops in the ends of my hair have helped minimize my split ends as well! Aria Starr sent out an email after I purchased the oil with several other uses for the oil - hair, skin, face, etc. - and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying those, too. I am so pleased with this purchase. The bottle may be small, but a little oil goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. The oil is amazing and the service was top notch!!</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;My hair was dry and brittle...since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I can sure see a difference! What a life-saver!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a very nice oil, much lighter than others I&#x27;ve bought in the drug store.  That is a plus though because it makes it more versatile.  I can use on my face, hair or body and it&#x27;s not greasy.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Actually bought it to use on my cuticles. Now also use it on my face at night. My face is softer and looks healthier. Oh, my cuticles are not dry anymore. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this! I use it everyday in my hair and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. Light and non greasy. Makes my hair shine and stay frizz free.</li>
    <li> I have used this on both my face and my hair so I will review both uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair- I find this a bit hard to get from my hand to my hair. I know that sounds odd so let me explain... other argan based oils that I&#x27;ve used for my hair spread nicely on my hands an transfer almost completely to my hair. I find that this sort of absorbs into my hand before I can get it into my hair. I have to keep adding to get a sufficient amount into my hair. With that being said-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin- this absorbs almost immediately into skin, and my skin soaks it right up. I have extremely sensitive skin and this did not irritate my face in the slightest. I put it on before bed, and upon waking I felt that my face looked dewy and plump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this on my face, but will no longer use it on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great oil for moisturizing my face. It does not leave an oily/shiny residue, and has helped my complexion. It has no odor and seems fresh. Fast delivery and nice follow up from the company!</li>
    <li> It was a quick pick for me shipping was fast I love this product work amazingly on my hair and face I use it twice a day on my skin and it leave it soft and looking radiant its prefect!</li>
    <li> This argan oil is very moisturizing and a great multipurpose product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love it for on my hands and nails - it seems to have strengthened my nails and they are now growing stronger and not peeling anymore. My cuticles were also terrible with many small hang nails/snags and this really helped. Most cuticle products burn when applied but this did not at all which I really appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I feel like it&#x27;s actually HEALING my skin instead of sitting on top of it. My hands are also baby soft for days after using this - I do like it as an all over body moisturizer but it may get spendy when using it that way. It is a bit greasy at first, of course, but after about 2 minutes, it soaks in completely and skin doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy at all - just healthy and soft! I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers and lotions, and nothing compares to the moisturizing properties of this argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it under my eyes with great results - dryness is gone and fine lines have been plumped up and look less noticeable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the ends of my hair that is damaged and brittle from bleaching and dyeing it - it really helps with the frizzies and provides a smooth, sleek look. I refuse to use hair products containing silicones and this is a great natural alternative that actually improves the condition of your skin and hair, unlike products packed with chemicals that just give the appearance of improved skin/hair with silicones etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do think it would be easier to use if it had a pump top instead of a dropper, because I&#x27;m always worried about accidentally tipping it over and spilling it, but that&#x27;s a very minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil has a faint scent that is hard to describe, kind of plastic-y, but the scent dissipates once the oil has soaked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is a much better value than high end brands from Sephora, and I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s of better quality, too - it&#x27;s thicker and much more moisturizing. The Aria Starr argan oil feels very luxurious, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who has dry skin or hair!</li>
    <li> Just started using organ oil and am extremely satisfied, so far. Used it on my hair, face and nails.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I can tell it the real deal. A little does go a long way. I have just became a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for my badly damaged nail....it has exceeded my expectations!  Daily use has improved the condition of my nails and hands! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love it ! I use it as a beard oil. It moisturizes and adds a healthy shine. It soaks in too, and doesn&#x27;t build up or get sticky or gunky.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and fantastic, quick customer service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of this product.  Have ordered it over &amp; over.  It&#x27;s the only thing that kept my face moisturized this winter.</li>
    <li> I always love Argran oil not only that they are great in both my face and hair but it also promotes a softer skin and keeps it moisturized all day. Totally AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I wear it daily and can already tell a difference.  Great seller and super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Very silky and absorbs nicely into my skin and hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Absorbs quickly and leave your skin soft,not greasy and no foul smell. Fantastic for dry skin and it keeps my hair shiny and not frizzy. Will surely recommend this to friend. Great packaging too.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - Perfect for face and hair ends</li>
    <li> It has a different scent. Not the nutty scent I expected like the Josie Maran Aragon oil. Overall its ok.</li>
    <li> Great product , good quality . I used it on skin and hair . I love it .</li>
    <li> bought as gift no complaints</li>
    <li> I use this oil primarily as a facial moisturizer before bed.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin at all, and it leaves my face so smooth to the touch.  It absorbs quickly and does not leave behind any trace of oiliness or greasiness.  I&#x27;ve been able to see a positive difference in my complexion in just a few days.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do for me over time.</li>
    <li> I liked this producted, it worked well on my hair. I used it as a overnight moisturizer as well as to protect from heat styling and that work well as well (I only applied a little bit for styling). I also used it on my face as a moisturizer around the house. My face is combination/oily but this oil is not too oily and moisturizes well any dry spots on my face. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Would prefer a pump applicator for ease of use</li>
    <li> My wife and my daughter use this. They love it....</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Nice scent!</li>
    <li> Beautifully packaged. And does wonders for my hair. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Works great for moisture on face and using with facial devices</li>
    <li> Wonder oil! I use it on hands, feet &amp; face. Love the way it absorbs and has a light gentle smell. Also by adding coconut oil and Argan oil on hands at night I get an extra boost to my dry eczema condition. .A+ for me ;)</li>
    <li> Have been using Argon Oil from Josie Moran for about a year.  Tried this 100%argon oil at a much better price.  I have been using this product for about a week and it works as well as previous brand used. I really did not detect very much of a nutty scent, used it in my creams before applying to face and it mixes very well; alone it absorbs into skin and leaves it soft. I especially like the way it plumps up the skin in my neck area.  Also used just a small amount rubbed into palms and then thru my wet just shampooed color treated hair and got a nice shine with no weigh down. I was having end of winter dry skin especially on hands and it has improved the cracks near nails.</li>
    <li> Its significantly reduced my beard dandruff</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil from AriaStarrBeauty is really nice.  It has a nice gentle smell to it.  I have been using it in place of all of the other products I was using - I wanted to give it a try.  I am finding it is helping all of the areas I am using it.  My fingernails are stronger and are not breaking as often as before.  My hair is shiner (which is always a plus!).  And my skin is loving it - I rub it on and before a few minutes has passed it is absorbed.</li>
    <li> Compared to 2 other brands of facial argan oil, this one actually comes in 3rd for me. It&#x27;s not awful, but the texture has a somewhat synthetic or watered down feel as compared to the other 2 I have,. Both my sister &amp; I agreed that Aria Starr Beauty argan oil requires more during application as compared to the others. I brought it on a week-long vacation &amp; could not wait to get home to use my other argan oil (I had only 1 other at the time). My rating is 2.5 stars because the other 2 I have are comparable in price but of much better quality.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil! I noticed a change in the way my face looked in a few days. My pores are smaller, my skin is softer and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;Joyce</li>
    <li> Smells nice.  I have very fine hair..so using on scalp just made it greasy It is great for the ends. Combs out very nicely. Dr. Oz recommended it..i used it on my face and skin after a shower.. It made my face very greasy and my skin as well. So i plan on using it on the ends of my long hair. Or on my face at night. I hear the cuticles are good place to use it. I recommend if it makes you greasy..shower the next morning..still made my hair very soft and like i had used a conditioner..and i didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil!  It is almost instantly absorbed into the skin, making it feel soft and smooth.  Also, the product arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I used this product with no expectations. I used it once and instantly my usually fine and frizzy hair turned to a salon worthy style. Im very pleased and will definitely keep buying and using it. Thanks!! :)</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. My dry curly hair was soft and silky from one application! (of about a dozen drops) Also I am now using it as my only face moisturiser and my skin loves it.</li>
    <li> I love love love this Argan Oil!  I mainly use it as a natural moisturizer for my face and eyes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!  Excellent for my skin and hair.  Just a drop or two does it for me!  Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> I use small amounts on my hair to take the frizz out.Works great</li>
    <li> Functionality is very good.  The smell is very bad.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is a must have! I use the premium quality oil on my nails, face, and hair and the results have been amazing! Skin appears smoother, cuticle beds are not dry, and fly-aways are tame!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle that I ordered and it is great I use it on many things it leaves my skin very soft</li>
    <li> I am using this on my husband&#x27;s extremely dry elbows.  You could begin to tell a difference overnight.  Soaks into skin easily and dries quickly.  I would suggest this to others.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice and doesn&#x27;t leave too much residue. I use about a quarter amount for my thick,shoulder length hair. Makes my hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I use the oil instead of styling gel and it makes my hair fell soft and healthy. I plan on continuing to use the product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love that this is not really scented.  I have been using it to repair my hands after a cold winter with lots of hand washing, and it&#x27;s working fabulously!</li>
    <li> I started using this product on my hair about 4-5 times a week about 3 weeks ago. It wasn&#x27;t an instant result, like some have claimed. But I have noticed a gradual improvement in my hair&#x27;s texture and shine. I feel like my hair is more evenly moisturized, even on days I don&#x27;t wash it. So far, I&#x27;m a big fan of Argan oil.</li>
    <li> It was a little to stickey to put in the hair. It makes long hair stick together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> LOVE IT -- very moisturizing and very smoothing to my hair, skin, and nail beds -- GOOD BUY and good price.</li>
    <li> Great price for the quantity! Argan oil is my moisturizer of choice, being light enough to use on my face without causing any breakouts.</li>
    <li> great product fast service</li>
    <li> Argan oil was recommended to me by the gal that cuts my hair...  like me, she has curly hair and understands the related problems of frizz and tangles.  Plus I have fairly thin hair and am always looking for new (and natural!) ways to make the most of what I have.  After looking around at a local shop and checking here online and reading many reviews I decided this was the best brand to start with.  I&#x27;m happy to say I will be looking no further.&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival it was well packaged, and not overly so... this product is wonderful and exactly as described. The seller even sent me a note with suggested uses and helpful tips. Many thanks!</li>
    <li> Works well, a few drops on my wet hair after I shower and my hair looks frizz free and shiny even without blowdrying and I have hard water!  I do use extra because I have thick hair.  I keep it away from my scalp because they tend to look too oily at the end of the day.  (I have oily skin)  I do have to wash my hair everyday or they look oily to me, so for those lucky ones who only wash their hair a couple of times a week, they could probably get away with applying to the scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used argan oil on my hair for a long time.  My regular brand wasn&#x27;t available, so I tried this one.  It takes the life out of my hair without giving it any shine or smooth feel.  Never again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil along with my moisturizer. I really like the feel and look of my improved skin. Soft and feels great.. I am so happy I found this oil, here. It&#x27;s been 4 months since I started using Argan and love the smooth look on my neck and face.</li>
    <li> LET ME START BY SAYING I HAVE YET TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY AN ARIA STARR PRODUCT. WHEN I WAS OFFERED THE CHANCE TO RECEIVE A DISCOUNT TO TRY THEIR ARGAN OIL I DID NOT HESITATE. THE OIL ITSELF IS NICE, UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR SO WHEN I TRIED USING IT PRIOR TO FLAT IRONING IT WAS JUST TOO HEAVY FOR MY HAIR. I AM NOW GOING TO USE IT IN SOME HOME MADE LOTION :)</li>
    <li> love it on my hair. stops/lessens breakage from bleach damage and makes my hair soft and shiny. It is a little sticky, so I haven&#x27;t really used it on my face or any where else. I like avocado oil for that.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have used it in my skin, hair and nails. I have even used it on my little one because she has curly hair. It makes her curls look beautiful and not dry. Definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will be ordering again in the near future.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! My skin is soft and smooth and it gives me that glowing &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look. Love if!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!! Just a small drop on my dry skin areas and I can see the differance right away. I am also using this on my nails as I have hard nails that snap easily.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Virgin Argan oil! I use it on my face and also on my dry hands and weak nails. It feels so nice on my skin. Love this product, and Aria Starr follows up with you to make sure you are enjoying your oil and to give advice on its use! Very pleased, will reorder!</li>
    <li> The shipping on this item was great and the packaging was superb!  I am using the oil as a moisturizer for my arms, legs and stomach after I get out of the shower.  The bottle indicates you only need a few drops but I have found I need much more than that for each area of my body.  The top is a dropper type dispenser and I need at least one dropper full of oil for each area of my body.  The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, compared to others I have smelled, it smells mildly like burnt coffee.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time in excellent condition. I love the way it feels on my skin, absorbs quickly. I am going to explore some of the other uses.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, love this product for my face - using it day and night!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for 5 days. My hair seems soft and shiny. My feet seems well hydrated now.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, and I am 100% sure to buy it again!</li>
    <li> Love this oil for my hair and face!</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!! I use a few drops in my wet hair everyday. It detangles, smooths, and moisturizers without weighing my hair down. It also controls frizz. I also use it on my cuticles and hands. This manic oil does everything!! I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
    <li> More than a drop will make your hair greasy and wet all day. Havent noticed any difference in benefits.</li>
    <li> love argan oil..  perfect for aging skin especially.  I have used argan oil for years now as a facial moisturizer.  would not use any other product on my face</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. BETTER RESULTS ON MY FACE THAN ANY ANTI AGING OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED. MY SKIN IS ALREADY looking more supple and fine lines are improving.  My skin looks and feels younger. DON&#x27;T PLAN ON USING ANYTHING BUT ALL NATURAL OILS FROM NOW ON .WOW</li>
    <li> This argan oil is a great value. The price is excellent, but the quality is even better. This stuff makes your face feel amazing and does not leave any greasy residue. If you are scared of putting oil on your face, this is the one to try. It gives you all the benefits of a heavier oil, but absorbs instantly and looks flawless. Customer service was great. I would definitely recommend this argan oil.</li>
    <li> Love that it is pure argan oil with no chemicals!  Makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> So far I am very happy with this product. It shipped quickly and was delivered to my doorstep several days sooner than I anticipated. I&#x27;ve been using it as a facial moisturizer, and normally my skin is so oily that by mid morning it is already shiny all over and I have to reapply my makeup. This product absorbs quickly and keeps my skin supple and balanced all day, no more embarrassing shine! I&#x27;m hoping to see a decrease in acne over the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil with many uses. I use it on my face, neck, hands, and hair. Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and this product really helps! I use it daily as my nightly moisturizer, and if I am having a breakout it clears it up by the next morning. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> love love this oil! Will be ordering again</li>
    <li> I love this product, and it is wonderful for the value.  I use this in place of Moroccan Oil, and it really performs.  I use it on my dry, coarse hair before and after blow drying and flat ironing and it keeps my hair from frizzing out.  I&#x27;ve had this product a little over a month and my hair texture has improved to being more hydrated and frizz-free.  I plan to order more once this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good organic/natural way to help protect my hair from a flat iron and dying it so much. So, I use this as a leave-in conditioner/heat protectant when I straighten my hair, and I also use this before &amp; after dying my hair, so it doesn&#x27;t completely fry it. Keep in mind, &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34; is not an understatement, so use this sparingly! Got it for a great price, too!</li>
    <li> I use this to mix a moisturizing oil blend for face and body and so far I really like it it adds that extra moisture needed this time of year</li>
    <li> It worked from the first use. Left my skin glowing and fresh looking. The dryness of the skin diminished. Does not leave any shiny residue. I enjoy this product very much!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product and I got it for a fraction of what I would pay for other brands.  Additionally, the seller went out its way to follow up with me, educate me with the many uses of the product in a follow up email, the product was delivered very quickly, and packaged well.  A+ service, Amazon and AriaStarrBeauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to Argan oil.  I&#x27;ve used it pre-mixed into other commercial products (hair serum, shampoo, body butter) but have never used it as a stand alone serum or treatment.  I have very dry, sensitive skin and winter is just around the corner (be aware, though, this product is often marketed to those with oily skin as a balancer so this &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil can benefit people with different needs).  I need more moisture generally, and specifically at this time of year, so I was looking at other serums, capsules, and creams.  I came across this randomly on Amazon and being on a bit more of a natural beauty kick lately, I decided to buy this and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, I am trying to transition back into retinol use after a year&#x27;s hiatus. My skin isn&#x27;t in its best shape, but this argan oil mixed with my firming serum in the morning helps the serum to glide into the skin during application and makes a smoother base before I apply sunsceen and foundation.  I apply the oil lightly to irritated areas throughout the day when I am at home.  This has calmed and kept my upper cheeks, forehead, and nose/eye areas moisturized while my skin&#x27;s working through adapting to the retinol again. The argan oil is great if you are applying a thick handcream and plan to wear gloves for a bit.  For people like me with very dry, sensitive skin and increased moisture needs, this works well to help hydrate and lock in the moisture of other products for a longer period of time.  My favorite use for this is as a lip treatment -- squeeze a drop from the dropper onto your finger or palm and then gently smooth this over your lips.  I use a very emolient gloss at night over the argan oil on my lips and I have noticed a difference (smoother lips in the morning and overall) just with the addition of the argan oil prior to application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think argan oil is the miracle cure or anything, but this is a great staple for nourishing your skin, hair, and nails on a regular basis and it&#x27;s simple, natural, and highly versatile.  The price, quality, and service were great with my order, so if you&#x27;re thinking of trying an argan oil, I recommend this one.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> My daily night moisturizer ...!!! Glides smothly on my skin..and my skin feels great..!!</li>
    <li> The product seems great and works well with dry hair.  Be aware thought that this is expensive compared to other things on the market.  This is only a 1 oz container.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it on my face and hair. It makes my hair shiny and silky; on my face it seems to have reduced the appearance of some of my acne scars and has given my skin a very nice softness to it. I wish I had heard of argan oil before now!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and I&#x27;ve started using it. It&#x27;s only been a couple of days but it does indeed absorb really well and it makes my face feel really soft. Hopefully I will start seeing less black spots too but I have high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is the best. ...it made my hair very soft and shiny..I have received so many compliments on my hair&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the oil o r not but my ends are growing back finally I will never stop using this</li>
    <li> Love it! I have very oily skin and this oil along with sulfur soap has cured my acne and oil problem .</li>
    <li> 100% go to product&lt;br /&gt;This product is a #1 item you must have. It makes you hair feel so smooth and shiny, Does not weigh the hair down and all hair types can use this.</li>
    <li> This is a fine oil!  I use it on my curly hair; use it on my face (it absorbs well); use it after shaving my legs (it&#x27;s soothing and moisturizing)...I USE it!  Thus far, I haven&#x27;t found anything better for keeping my neck out of turkey land.  Try it--it&#x27;s a lovely price and has a lot of uses.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Price was good.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my hair, nail  and skin  is amazing</li>
    <li> Used it on my face and a dab on my hair for shine.  Very please with this argan oil!  Delivery was quick too.</li>
    <li> Great oil, great price...and the company has some nice employees!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. Since I started I can see &amp; feel the difference .</li>
    <li> I love this Argan oil, it does not leave my face oily. I can already see an improvement in the appearance of my skin!</li>
    <li> Would recommend &amp; will purchase again.. I&#x27;ve used other brands of Argan oil. This one is pure &amp; priced reasonably. I&#x27;m happy with it! I use on face, nails &amp; hair for hydration.</li>
    <li> This is 2nd bottle and I love it! Great for winter skin, will continue to use this in my skincare routine. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I bought this argan oil for my hair and body. I love it!!! A little does go a long way and I can already tell the difference in my skin and hair. Plus the price is great for organic and pure... Definitely will be repurchasing when it&#x27;s time for a new bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days but so far I love it.  I&#x27;ve been having some skin issues and I believe this oil is helping.</li>
    <li> This quality is better than the store bought. I could tell the difference first day.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Well I think it is doing well with my hair, though a very little bit is needed.  My hair is long, half way down my back, but just a few drops is good. I like how it works on my special needs son beard.  He is tolerating me rubbing it on so obviously the smell (which I can barely sense) is not an issue for him.  It helps to make his beard smooth, and keeps the skin under it soft and blemish free, though he doesn&#x27;t normally have that problem I noticed one went away in less then 48 hours, which is really important since he tends to pick on things.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love it! As Argan oil become popular its always hard to choose the right brand. I have tried many and wasted my money on Poppy Austin and Josie Maran. Poppy Austin has the worst smell ever. Josie Maran seems to be olive oil. I even wrote them about these problems. Anyways. I find this and Moroccon Gold Argan oil the best on web. Its become one of the necessary ingredient of my lotions and creams now. So buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your concerns.  HAVING NOT SEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IT&#x27;S HARD FOR ME TO RATE THIS PRODUCT.  HOWEVER, MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHO WAS BORN WITH A RARE SKIN DISEASE IS USING THIS AND SHE LOVES IT.  USES IT NOT ONLY ON HER FACE BUT ALSO HER HAIR.  SHE HAS SIGNIFICANT SKIN DRYNESS AND HAIR SCALP AS WELL BUT THE BOTTLE IS SO SMALL THAT SHE WILL GO THROUGH IT VERY FAST.  SHE HAS THE DISEASE FROM HEAD TO TOE SO SHE USES COCONUT OIL TOO WHICH COMES IN A LARGER JAR.  I&#x27;M SURE I&#x27;LL ENJOY IT WHEN I USE IT  FOR A LONGER TIME.  WILL THIS BE GOOD FOR NAILS AS WELL?  I&#x27;M FINDING THAT MY NAILS ARE CHIPPING AND SPLITTING IN MY SENIOR YEARS.  WHY IS THAT?  I&#x27;LL BE 80 BUT HAVE ALWAYS HAD NICE HAIR AND NAILS BUT BOTH AREN&#x27;T AS NICE AS THEY USED TO BE.  HOPE THIS IS HELPFUL. PERHAPS A LATER TIME WOULD BE BETTER. TO GIVE YOU MORE INPUT. JUNE</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Have used it a couple days and can see a major difference in my skin!! Wonderful facial moisturizer. Love that it&#x27;s organic and a little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully on skin and hair, I love it!!  I normally rub 3 drops between my palms then spread evenly through my hair, then just rub the remaining oil into my hands.  It dries quickly &amp; moisturizes wonderfully!  Doesn&#x27;t make hair or skin too oily as long as it&#x27;s used sparingly.</li>
    <li> After two applications on wet hair of only a few drops of Argan oil, I noticed a huge difference in my hair. It is much smoother and shinier. I have also used it on my eye wrinkles, lips, and neck with good results after only a couple applications. I think you should try it for yourself!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s marketed as being an excellent remedy to very dry skin - I found it works fine, but not as much better than anything else as I was hoping/expected. Def leaves oiliness. That said, it would probably be fine if you have just moderately dry skin!</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my hair and face. It does wonders to my face. I just love this oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bottles of 100% argan oil before, so I know what the pure oil is supposed to smell like, and this one is rancid. Unless there is a filler in it that is altering the smell. I opened it up and gagged. Either way, its going back.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it was supposed to do. Not disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> The product leaves my hair non greasy and gives a nice shine to it :)!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Makes my face less irritated and less shiny; works wonders. I wish the container was bigger for its price.</li>
    <li> It helps to fade away my age spots on my forehead</li>
    <li> great quality and does what it is suppose to,  Smells great also thus not a messy smell to it at all like others I have tried,</li>
    <li> It quenches my skin&#x27;s thirst. Love the oil.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed using it on my face at night before bed, it&#x27;s not super greasy and it really absorbs quickly. It has helped my cuticles...I cannot wait to try it in my hair, and find new ways to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my face and i am like it better than my normal moisturizer. I stopped using other things on my skin.</li>
    <li> Works well. Very emollient.  Like the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! And I love that it is pure 100% Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Happy to discover this natural product. I have very long hair and dry skin, it helps keep it hydrated and moisturized. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Feels nice. Don&#x27;t see any difference in skin or lines, but that takes time and probably more time is needed. I&#x27;ll update if noticing more.</li>
    <li> This oil smells BAD (doesn&#x27;t linger though) - but a few drops in my hand and massaged into my hair ends and it eases the dry feeling. Really good on cuticles and skin too. Not harsh as I have sensitive skin and I have not had any reaction.</li>
    <li> This oil is AMAZING. It smells sweet and light and not at all like motor oil/rotten olives/plastic/cured meat I read in the negative reviews. My very fine hair and sensitive skin love this stuff! It&#x27;s great for my cuticles, too. For my hair and face, a little goes a really long way and I use maybe 3 drops a day. My skin hasn&#x27;t broken out and my hair is shiny and silky. I&#x27;m hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: About a month later, my hair started to get some pretty heavy build-up and my face would by incredibly oily about halfway through the day.  Fortunately, my cuticles still love it!</li>
    <li> This oil works great on my skin but I&#x27;m a little disapointed. Oil started to smell (very unpleasant smell!) after only two weeks of use. I&#x27;m not sure if i should continue use :(</li>
    <li> Leave me alone and stop sending me emails badgering me for a review. Your product did not do much for my skin and is also very greasy and made my face break out. I was not even going to write a review but considering how you are incessantly emailing me for a review, well, here ya go!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I use it for my hair to straighten it with out damaging it as much as I have in the past. I want to have super long hair but I always have to get so much cut off because of all the damage I&#x27;ve done to it with blow drying and straightening. I got a small vial of this argan oil when I purchased my flat iron from amazon. I used it and noticed a HUGE difference after one use! My hair was so silky and shiny and super SOFT! I fell in love! However when I went to purchase the product I realized that this gem is SUPER expensive. It was $40 for a 1oz vial. Not something I could really be spending that much money on. So I started browsing and found this product and decided to try it. It works just as great, it just doesn&#x27;t have the pretty smell to it that the other one did, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me it just happens to be natural. I use this one as a facial moisturizer/ makeup remover and its great! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and noticed my dark circles fading and the puffiness under my eyes going away. I&#x27;m almost to the point I don&#x27;t need to wear foundation, even some of the minor scars(from zits) are starting to fade. I am so happy I purchased this and I will be buying more in the future! Hopefully this helps!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! It absorbs quickly, moisturizes fantastically and leaves your skin glowing:) I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if you use this as a face moisturizer it might make your face look a little shiney so to fix this just put some transparent powder on your face after you apply the oil and its absorbed :)&lt;br /&gt;But overall I would definitely recommend this product if you want beautiful skin:)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been battling with acne since I was 15, and at the age of 26, it still hasn&#x27;t gone away. This stuff has balanced the oils in my skin, while giving my skin a radiant look and my skin is slowly healing from the acne. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
    <li> I have been trying different argon oils on my hair lately. I love the shine that it gives my hair.I like the fact that it ia 100% pure organic and doesn&#x27;t contain all those other additives that my hair does not need.When I received this at a special price for my unbiased opinion I was more than happy to give it a try. I am so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil comes in a 1oz. bottle. I know that doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot but please remember that you only use a few drops at a time which makes your bottle to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;This works great on the wrinkles and the bags under your eyes. It moisturizes and leaves your skin so soft.It is also great for those cracks in your feet and leaving your feet feeling soft and renewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for your hair also. It helps with the frizz and leaves it shiny and looking great.I recommend this to give it a try and see how it looks on your hair or wherever you decide to use it on.</li>
    <li> Virgin Argan oil is great I have really dry, damaged hair from dying and straightening my hair too much and this oil has been helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2 to 3 times a week. I heat up the oil and apply it on my scalp &amp; hair,leave it on for an hour or more and then wash my hair afterwards my hair feels so soft i  love it!</li>
    <li> When I was given the opportunity to receive Virgin Argan Oil to review, I was so excited! Argan oil has been on the top of my list to try. My skin felt so amazing when i began rubbing it onto my skin. I left it on overnight to give my skin the best results possible. My skin was so soft and smooth when I woke up. It is the best moisturizer I have used so far!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the argan oil. I&#x27;ve been using it on my beard in the mornings and it has kept my beard moisturized and feeling less wiry.</li>
    <li> Using on my daughters hair and it shines so beautifully!</li>
    <li> Received the product right away and leaves no greasy residue.  I wear glasses and hate greasy oils that keep my glasses sliding off my face. My skin absorbed the oil and it felt nice and smooth.  It has replaced my face cream.  And I don&#x27;t notice any smell at all. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this daily on his beard, and loves the results.  He has no itching or dry patches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an oil product like this before for skin moisturizing, but I have become very fond of this Argan Oil. I typically use it for my face and tattoos after a hot shower. Every now and then I rub some in my hair to make my hair feel soft. For an area the size of my face, I generally use 3-4 drops. I like the way it smells. I like the way it feels. I have not tasted it yet. I highly recommend that you put it on you.</li>
    <li> I love the Argan Oil so far. I have only been using it for a couple weeks so I cannot speak to long term benefits. I mainly bought it to put in my hair which is curly to tame frizz. It works well enough for that. But I have also been putting it on my face, neck, and chest, and noticed just today that my skin looked amazing, I even had second thoughts about putting on the usual amount of makeup for work. I use a lot of essenital oils and also a lot of coconut oil on my skin but my chest specifically was very sensitive and would break out. So far with the Argan oil on my chest, just silky smoothness, no breakouts. Yay!</li>
    <li> Shipping was rather quick. I have definitely used better argan oil, but I suppose this quality is right for the price. If you&#x27;re looking for a really good argan oil and are willing to spend $40, buy Unite brand instead.</li>
    <li> I discovered Argan Oil while staying in Scottsdale.  Needed to replace what I had purchased.  This is outstanding.  I am using it on my face every morning and night and love it!</li>
    <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel to it</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin it tends to break out very easily when I go out in sun or with some moisturizer... On reading the use of argon oil as moisturizer and off course the fact it&#x27;s non comedogenic factor is 0, I wanted to try argon oil as my face moisturizer. So I ordered some other brands. The result was ok no breakout from them but it was kind of little greasy so prolonged my search for a good brand of argon oil. I ordered this and started using it the results were great. It was kind of pure with very mild odor and when I get the occasional breakout from expose to sun I put 2 or 3 drops on the spot and the next day it will be reduced. Now I am fan of this product always have one stock( just don&#x27;t want to go out of it) . And regarding the age defying properties of argon I see a very noticeable difference of wrinkles. Some lines are very less seen in the fast months. I have been using this product for about 8 months now. Even give this as a gift to friends and cousins. My only request to the sellers will be please don&#x27;t increase the price. With this price( 12$) many could afford to get the benefits of your product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Currently experimenting with this product, however, after using only a couple times since receiving this product is doing what it claims. My hair has feels healthy with a vibrant shine, where I have used on my skin this product promotes a very supple soft lively feeling. Would definitely recommend this product and plan on purchasing in the future if things continue while using this product.  Have been amazed at what this product can do in just a short period of time, will continue usage as it really helps keep my skin and hair rejuvenated.....</li>
    <li> I had really dry skin from winter and i dabbed a few drops and it went away! Other moisturizer i used would work for a few minutes but this stuff cured it! Plus you can use it for your cuticles, hair ends, face moisture,  awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product as my night-time moisturizer, and it has exceeded expectation.  It has a wonderful silky feel when being applied, an it absorbs into my skin quickly.  I massage the excess oil into my hands and cuticles, and it has made a significant difference in how they look and feel.  Highly recommended product!</li>
