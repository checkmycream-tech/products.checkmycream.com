### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have never used anything like it, its perfect.</li>
      <li>Neither had never seen nor heard of the PressurePointer, but were impressed with it and said they would rather have it than theirs.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>The fact that leg strength is used instead of arms, makes this a perfect tool for me.  </li>
      <li>They also have a very good reference on their website of therapy massages to help shoulder neck problematic areas.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how good it felt!  </li>
      <li>You can hold the instrument sideways and get great leverage to work on the side of your neck or under your arm</li>
      <li>I am so happy I found this thing.......</li>
      <li>Helps ease severe pressure points and pain - love it!!</li>
      <li>This....is amazing!</li>
      <li>The pressure pointer is like having your own pressure/ trigger point therapist!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;- Effective!</li>
      <li>If you are into trigger point therapy it is good for that.  </li>
      <li>then it will be a good product.     </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It is so much more pleasant to use because my arms do not get sore.</li>
      <li>Takes the effort out of self-treatment, light and great use of leverage&lt;br</li>
      <li>In an era when every product is manufactured overseas, it&#x27;s nice to support a Made in America</li>
      <li>It kind of breaks up the knotted muscle.  </li>
      <li>I showed it to my chiropractor and massage therapist who both happened to own something called Theracane.</li>
      <li>However when I happened to find this device on the Internet and purchased it, I found that self therapy is very easy for me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every trigger point product on the market - Theracane, Backknobber, Bongers, spiny balls - all are helpful, but the Pressure Pointer is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I love them because they are extremely effective, and even help prevent headaches</li>
      <li>I am 6&#x27;1&amp;#34;, in my forties and have struggled with headaches most of my life.</li>
      <li>Being able to use my foot to manipulate it reduces stress on arm and hand muscles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is also quite a bit more versatile, because I can reach more areas.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pressure pointer arrived and I felt goofy trying to use it.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you have the Clair Davies manual \\&quot;</li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t go and get a massage, this is the next best thing.  </li>
      <li>I simply love it.  </li>
      <li>but I have yet to see a better alternative</li>
      <li>I love that feeling.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I could not be more pleased - trying to get my wife to get the knots out never works out.</li>
      <li>Perhaps because it is not as fatiguing, I am more inclined to explore for more trigger points that might be causing referred pain.</li>
      <li>I convinced myself that my pain was more than muscular.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more for gifts as all my friends who try it want to borrow it.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this great product that will transform your life.</li>
      <li>This thing is incredible, I&#x27;ve been living with this burning knot next to/under my shoulder blade.  </li>
      <li>This is somewhat true: the instrument could be machined out of thicker and higher-grade metal, but then it would weigh more and cost more, so there&#x27;s a trade off.</li>
      <li>I can also see that when I am fully well again that I will still be using it, as I find it a easy self-massaging tool when using the rolling ball ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Choice of massage head is important.</li>
      <li>Oh yes, the very smallest attachment I use on its own for my sciatic trigger points--just push it along by hand.  </li>
      <li>I returned this item because I am just 5&#x27; tall and found I could not find a comfortable position to use this tool.</li>
      <li>Foot power is important since you&#x27;re NOT using one set of muscles to help release another set of muscles.</li>
      <li>I think this product is overpriced because of cheap construction of it</li>
      <li>But so worth it!</li>
      <li>But I still feel it was well worth the price!</li>
      <li>I am very tall (6-6), and it adjusts very comfortably for me.</li>
      <li>It is also good for getting the upper shoulder trigger points with a lot of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  </li>
      <li>The construction is extremely sturdy, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with the Pressure Pointer, even though I have to use a great deal of leg power on it to work out the knots.  </li>
      <li>Also, the construction is very light weight, which I actually appreciate because that makes it more comfortable to use, even if it might make it a bit more fragile.</li>
      <li>I wanted to get this product because I really thought it would help, and it does, but it is cheaply made.</li>
      <li>It allows you amazing precision to work specific spots on your back for amazing relief.  </li>
      <li>The Pressure Pointer is worth</li>
      <li>This puts everything in your own control without having to reach your arms back up there.  </li>
      <li>biggest advantage is that I am more familiar with my pressure points and can keep working at them daily.  </li>
      <li>applied right where I need it.  </li>
      <li>This is something you will wonder how you lived without it, I certainly do!  </li>
      <li>my opinion, the Pressure Pointer is by far the superior product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Pressure Pointer has four interchangeable heads so you can customize the exact amount of pressure you want to receive.</li>
      <li>, I use the third lowest (and am 5&#x27;9\\&quot;) and there&#x27;s 3 or 4 more holes</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I need and</li>
      <li>Took one star off because it is tricky at first</li>
      <li>I tried using the wooden balls to roll out muscle knots, but found better results from just pressing against the area instead.  </li>
      <li>sure you order newer version with rubber massage heads (along with wooden spheres).  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware I had.  </li>
      <li>Construction could be more solid</li>
      <li>This product seems better than the back buddy for getting at the trigger points between my shoulder blades and applying a lot of pressure.  </li>
      <li>My favorite massager is an electric one, but sometimes nothing gets to certain areas on my back like this Pressure Pointer.</li>
      <li>The foot control allows for more consistent, constant, deeper pressure, and relieves arm and shoulder exertion while treating the area  - which really matters if your trigger points are located in the shoulder girdle or SCM.  </li>
      <li>I suffer from chronic pain due to a metabolic disorder that does not allow my muscles to relax on their own.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only thing (besides a good massage therapist) that can work out the knots in my back muscles.  </li>
      <li>so it accomodates a pretty large height range.</li>
      <li>I am now very comfortable using it and can use various heads to effectively hit all of my trouble spots.  </li>
      <li>The most I would ever see a massage therapist would be weekly (or more normally monthly), and there are certain knots that therapist misses or only spends a brief amount of time on.  </li>
      <li>I like to really attack the trigger points, and at least for those in the back this is the best tool I&#x27;ve found for really digging in.  </li>
      <li>it is very clever designed tool to give some relief from people suffering from chronic pain caused&lt;br /&gt;by muscle spasms</li>
      <li>The tubular aluminum construction is strong, sturdy and adjustable for different heights.  </li>
      <li>An amazing product, takes a few minutes to catch on</li>
      <li>Every one of my friends that has tried it wants one.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced - I thought.</li>
      <li>I sometimes get when my shoulder muscles are very</li>
      <li>Their website is also very helpful:  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>The others go unused; I just cannot really get them into the trigger points like the rolling balls, whereas the rolling ball plays chords on the trigger points as if they were guitar strings.  </li>
      <li>precisely where you pain is, there are different sized attachments for broader pressure too.  </li>
      <li>Much to my delight, I also discovered that since I started using my Pressure Pointer before bed, I now sleep a lot better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, the only points that I find very useful are the two rolling balls.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve sometimes even placed the massage head in the right place, and allowed both arms to completely relax at my side while applying pressure with foot.  </li>
      <li>pressure pointer is the only self massager I have ever used, so I can&#x27;t offer a fair comparison as to how it measures up to other devices.  </li>
      <li>The idea is great to get to places you cannot reach but the different size balls you use on the end to push and roll on your body are made of hard wood instead of a softer rubber product.</li>
      <li>They grip clothing and stay in place nicely, as compared to reviews of wooden heads that are described as slipping.  </li>
      <li>Using my arms would cause more spasms in my upper back and neck.    </li>
      <li>This works much better for me than a Theracane or Knobble, especially for accessing trigger points on the back of my neck, back of the scalp, and most of my back.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>At first I had trouble using it effectively and got worried, but you quickly pick up little tips and tricks on what works and doesn&#x27;t.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! I always thought it defeated the purpose of using the muscle you are trying to relax to feel relief. This....is amazing! As soon as I got it, I didn&#x27;t get out of the chair from using it for 3 hours. I tell everybody about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from the manufacturer a few years ago, and I absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s the only thing (besides a good massage therapist) that can work out the knots in my back muscles.  If it weren&#x27;t for the Pressure Pointer, the knotted muscles in my back would get so bad I wouldn&#x27;t be able to move my neck and arm!  The fact that leg strength is used instead of arms, makes this a perfect tool for me.  Using my arms would cause more spasms in my upper back and neck.    The construction is extremely sturdy, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with the Pressure Pointer, even though I have to use a great deal of leg power on it to work out the knots.  There are three different, interchangeable working ends for you to use on those muscle knots, trigger points or wherever it hurts.  I tried using the wooden balls to roll out muscle knots, but found better results from just pressing against the area instead.  It kind of breaks up the knotted muscle.  The tubular aluminum construction is strong, sturdy and adjustable for different heights.  The Pressure Pointer is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold to me!

    <li> The idea is great to get to places you cannot reach but the different size balls you use on the end to push and roll on your body are made of hard wood instead of a softer rubber product. The wooden pointer used to push on trigger points also broke off.</li>
    <li> I could not be more pleased - trying to get my wife to get the knots out never works out. I hold all my stress in my upper back and now I can find relief without having to beg</li>
    <li> Where do I begin... I suffer from chronic pain due to a metabolic disorder that does not allow my muscles to relax on their own.  So I am constantly super tight especially in my shoulders, upper back and neck.  Before coming across this contraption I would roll for hours on end on the floor on a tennis ball/ base ball.  The pressure pointer is like having your own pressure/ trigger point therapist!  You can work on precisely where you pain is, there are different sized attachments for broader pressure too.  And it is genius that the pressure power comes from your legs not arms!  Which then allows your upper body to completely relax, instead of having to exert pressure with your arms   the way other pressure pointers work.  After using it just once I got major results!  I would recommend this wholeheartedly!</li>
    <li> it is very clever designed tool to give some relief from people suffering from chronic pain caused&lt;br /&gt;by muscle spasms</li>
    <li> I have major back issues form a terrible auto accident I was in 3 yrs ago.. My back and neck are constantly in spasm and severe pain.... I don&#x27;t have any insurance so I self rehab myself with stretching , rolling (foam roller).  I wanted to get this product because I really thought it would help, and it does, but it is cheaply made. The attachment pieces are light plastics that slide into the metal frame and as you know deep tissue and trigger point techniques require very firm pressure.    The product doesn&#x27;t look like the product in the picture either. The foot part is flat on the display pictures and when I received it the foot part was curved like a big umbrella handle.      I think this product is overpriced because of cheap construction of it and I don&#x27;t see it lasting that long. If pressure pointer goes back and beefs it up and puts quality end pieces on it then it will be a good product.     And...If your over 225 lbs or are really wide from back to chest I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product because it is significantly smaller than it looks on the lady in the picture. She must be tiny.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Everyone who tries it (and everyone who sees it asks to try it)  loves it too.  I keep the smallest ball on it and use it to dig into my neck and shoulder muscles.    You know how hard it is when you try to explain to someone else exactly where you need the pressure and how hard to push?  This puts everything in your own control without having to reach your arms back up there.  This is exactly what I need and both me and my husband use it almost every day.  If you are into trigger point therapy it is good for that.  Oh yes, the very smallest attachment I use on its own for my sciatic trigger points--just push it along by hand.  My only complaint was the extra $60 I had to pay the courier to get it into Canada! But I still feel it was well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I wrote a poor review for this product about a month after I bought it.  Now I feel terrible about that.  At the time, I felt like it was awkward to use and so I just gave up on it. I convinced myself that my pain was more than muscular. However, it is about a year later and I have completely changed my mind. I have had terrible pain around my right shoulder blade, which radiated all around my shoulder to the front of my collar bone, began making my arm numb, etc.  I&#x27;ve been to various specialists, and there is nothing wrong except for tension and tight muscles with knots/trigger points that act up daily. About 5 months ago, I took the time to get used to this thing.  I began using it daily for 5 minutes and &amp;#34;exploring&amp;#34; the muscles in my back with it. I now know exactly where to put the pressure in order to release the knot, and this gives me instant relief. After work, my shoulder usually hurts really bad, but I use this pressure pointer for 1-2 minutes, feel the knot release, and I feel MUCH better. If I use it daily, it provides a lot of relief.  On a side note - About two weeks ago,  I began taking Valerian root twice per day to reduce tension throughout the day.  I feel like this has helped me tremendously, so if you also have problems with sore muscles due to tension, do some research on the benefits of Valerian root.</li>
    <li> I wanted to thank the inventor of the PressurePointer device.  I simply love it.  My chiropractor and massage therapist agreed that interim therapy such as self massage would help me progress faster from my bungee jump caused shoulder injury.  I was trying to dig my fingers into my tight neck to shoulder area.  However when I happened to find this device on the Internet and purchased it, I found that self therapy is very easy for me.  I can relax my upper body and yet get the benefit from having helpful pressure applied right where I need it.  Thank you.  I can also see that when I am fully well again that I will still be using it, as I find it a easy self-massaging tool when using the rolling ball ends.&lt;br /&gt;I almost didn&#x27;t purchase it when one reviewer called it flimsy.  Mine was well made, sturdy,and finished well.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing more for gifts as all my friends who try it want to borrow it.  It may look a little &#x27;dorky&#x27;, but if you need it, then the Bo Peep type device will soon be your new friend.&lt;br /&gt;P.S I showed it to my chiropractor and massage therapist who both happened to own something called Theracane. Neither had never seen nor heard of the PressurePointer, but were impressed with it and said they would rather have it than theirs.</li>
    <li> Great product! You can really work the kinks out of your back. This is the second one on the purchase I have purchased. Now I have wanted home and the one at the office. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  Helps ease severe pressure points and pain - love it!!</li>
    <li> I am 6&#x27;1&amp;#34;, in my forties and have struggled with headaches most of my life. I woke up very tight one morning and tried improvising a device to dig into knots in my shoulders, in the hopes of hitting them in the same way physiotherapist recently had.  I then went online and discovered theracane, back buddy and pressure pointer for the first time.  Pressure pointer seemed big and ugly, but the concept of using foot to provide pressure seemed brilliant so I ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pressure pointer arrived and I felt goofy trying to use it.  I was looking for return policy within first 5 minutes, but remembered reading a few people talking about a bit of a learning curve.  I&#x27;ve now had it for about 3 weeks and have been faithfully using it twice a day.  I am now very comfortable using it and can use various heads to effectively hit all of my trouble spots.  I do not find it to be too flimsy for what it needs to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest advantage is that I am more familiar with my pressure points and can keep working at them daily.  The most I would ever see a massage therapist would be weekly (or more normally monthly), and there are certain knots that therapist misses or only spends a brief amount of time on.  I&#x27;ve read, and would recommend, &#x27;The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook...&#x27;, and agree that knots need very regular attention to work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure pointer is the only self massager I have ever used, so I can&#x27;t offer a fair comparison as to how it measures up to other devices.  However, I can tell you that there is no fatigue in my upper body when using it, and I can keep going for extended periods of time working on knots I wasn&#x27;t aware I had.  I&#x27;ve sometimes even placed the massage head in the right place, and allowed both arms to completely relax at my side while applying pressure with foot.  I can&#x27;t imagine relaxing in the same way while trying to apply pressure with my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could report that all of my headaches are gone,but they are not.  However, I think I am making steady progress in the right direction and that the pressure pointer is central in the process.  Book mentioned above talks about how damage of years of stress, knots and habits will take longer than days or even weeks to work out.  If you find any benefit in massage therapist working on you neck, shoulders or back, then I highly recommend you consider purchasing the pressure pointer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you order newer version with rubber massage heads (along with wooden spheres).  They grip clothing and stay in place nicely, as compared to reviews of wooden heads that are described as slipping.  I tend to use small wooden sphere to loosen up, and the dig deeper with the larger &#x27;finger&#x27; shaped head.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Theracane and several knockoffs (Back Buddy, etc.) for several years to work on trigger points in my shoulders and upper back. I love them because they are extremely effective, and even help prevent headaches I sometimes get when my shoulder muscles are very tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Pressure Pointer has replaced them all for me. It is so much more pleasant to use because my arms do not get sore. I don&#x27;t agree with the criticisms of other reviewers. I am very tall (6-6), and it adjusts very comfortably for me. The original Theracane, by contrast, is so small that it requires putting my arms in an awkward position to use it properly. Also, the construction is very light weight, which I actually appreciate because that makes it more comfortable to use, even if it might make it a bit more fragile. I&#x27;m not sure how the other folks broke things on this -- I&#x27;m not using this for pole vaulting, but for putting pressure on rather sensitive tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also quite a bit more versatile, because I can reach more areas. Perhaps because it is not as fatiguing, I am more inclined to explore for more trigger points that might be causing referred pain. I highly recommend this product. The only real drawback compared to the hand-held versions is that it is larger and therefore slightly harder to store. Since I use mine every day, it just ends up stretched across the couch, which is a bit ugly. But so worth it!</li>
    <li> It helps somewhat and gets to areas that I have trouble getting to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of self-massage items to manage myofascial pain and accompanying trigger points. This works much better for me than a Theracane or Knobble, especially for accessing trigger points on the back of my neck, back of the scalp, and most of my back. Being able to use my foot to manipulate it reduces stress on arm and hand muscles. Durability hasn&#x27;t been a problem; I&#x27;ve used mine for over 3 years now. My favorite massager is an electric one, but sometimes nothing gets to certain areas on my back like this Pressure Pointer.</li>
    <li> I also have the back buddy tool (similar, but plastic and smaller).  This product seems better than the back buddy for getting at the trigger points between my shoulder blades and applying a lot of pressure.  It is also good for getting the upper shoulder trigger points with a lot of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;You might notice both descriptions say &#x27;a lot of pressure&#x27;.  I like to really attack the trigger points, and at least for those in the back this is the best tool I&#x27;ve found for really digging in.  However, the only points that I find very useful are the two rolling balls.  The others go unused; I just cannot really get them into the trigger points like the rolling balls, whereas the rolling ball plays chords on the trigger points as if they were guitar strings.  I love that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update 10/20/2014&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over two years now, and wanted to update my review.&lt;br /&gt;I put the large rolling ball on one end and the small rolling ball on the other end.  I have no idea where the other attachments are anymore and don&#x27;t really care as these are the only ones I&#x27;ve ever found useful.&lt;br /&gt;When I start getting that pain in my neck or upper back this is what I reach for.  I&#x27;ve used a number of other pressure point tools but for the neck and back there is nothing to compare to the pressure pointer.</li>
    <li> This one was much too long for me and didn&#x27;t work well. I bought a shorter version which works wonders, along with a book.</li>
    <li> Some quick background on the demands placed on this item: I bought it because of chronic neck pain, caused by knots and tight muscles in my upper back and shoulders. Since I do martial arts these muscles are very developed and quite tight, requiring a lot of pressure and work to treat. Self-treatment using hands and fingers is possible but very tiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is very simple. Upon taking it out of the box it&#x27;s obvious how to configure and use it. At first I had trouble using it effectively and got worried, but you quickly pick up little tips and tricks on what works and doesn&#x27;t. For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The foot rest should point to the opposite side of the shoulder you&#x27;re working on. You can use it facing the other way but there&#x27;s a subtle difference in the leverage and control afforded.&lt;br /&gt;- If you have a small knot, you can find the spot and then gently wiggle the entire instrument with your hands in order to release the tense muscle.&lt;br /&gt;- You can hold the instrument sideways and get great leverage to work on the side of your neck or under your arm&lt;br /&gt;- Choice of massage head is important. I use the second smallest since it closely approximates a single thumb or two fingers. I did not find the other tools to be very useful but time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have complained that it is flimsy. This is somewhat true: the instrument could be machined out of thicker and higher-grade metal, but then it would weigh more and cost more, so there&#x27;s a trade off. Also, if you are using the smaller heads you don&#x27;t really require much pressure since it is focused on a small area. Having used it for a few hours I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely to break any time soon. When applying the maximum pressure I can feel it flexing slightly but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a danger of the metal bending. If you accidentally step on it or something, however, it&#x27;s likely to warp irreparably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Takes the effort out of self-treatment, light and great use of leverage&lt;br /&gt;- Effective! My neck pain is gone after a one-hour session while watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;- Versatile: can treat upper and lower shoulders, side of neck, under arms&lt;br /&gt;- A good price, about half the cost of a single massage therapy session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Construction could be more solid but I have yet to see a better alternative</li>
    <li> A lady at work brought hers in and she let me try it.  I was amazed at how good it felt!  I use it all the time at home after a hard days work looking at a computer.  Ugh.  Reasonably priced - I thought.</li>
    <li> I returned this item because I am just 5&#x27; tall and found I could not find a comfortable position to use this tool.</li>
    <li> I have had many professional massages at $50+ an hour and only a very select few can target the muscles that I can reach with this. They also have a very good reference on their website of therapy massages to help shoulder neck problematic areas. http://www.pressurepointer.com/PressurePointerManual.pdf</li>
    <li> Yes!!!  This thing is incredible, I&#x27;ve been living with this burning knot next to/under my shoulder blade.  I can&#x27;t afford regular massages, and one massage here and there isn&#x27;t enough to make it go away.  It&#x27;s impossible to explain to my boyfriend where, how much pressure, up, left, right, other right, etc, etc, etc.  I am so happy I found this thing.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Every one of my friends that has tried it wants one.  And as far as height, my 8 year old uses it on the lowest setting, my 10 year old on the second lowest, I use the third lowest (and am 5&#x27;9\\&quot;) and there&#x27;s 3 or 4 more holes so it accomodates a pretty large height range.</li>
    <li> If you get periodic knots in your back then you have to get this massager. If you can&#x27;t go and get a massage, this is the next best thing.  My back was giving me problems for a few weeks and I ordered one of these on the recommendation of my brother who has had consistent back pain for years.  After it arrived I used it immediately and it worked wonders.  Now I use it periodically, when my back is sore or I have a knot. It allows you amazing precision to work specific spots on your back for amazing relief.  I have never used anything like it, its perfect.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s a little tricky at first, this helps reach the difficult sections in my back to relieve pain.  I use it regularly.  Took one star off because it is tricky at first but once you experiment with it, you can use it to relieve pain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every trigger point product on the market - Theracane, Backknobber, Bongers, spiny balls - all are helpful, but the Pressure Pointer is by far the best.  The foot control allows for more consistent, constant, deeper pressure, and relieves arm and shoulder exertion while treating the area  - which really matters if your trigger points are located in the shoulder girdle or SCM.  Make sure you have the Clair Davies manual \\&quot; The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief \\&quot; to guide your actions.  A note to all who suffer from severe trigger points: for some really stubborn TP&#x27;s, all the deep pressure in the world won&#x27;t do the job.  Sometime, you need to get the suckers exploded.  Mine were treated with TP injections of a saline &amp; lidocaine solution by my MD.  It took several sessions, but they were finally subdued, and of the 4 TP&#x27;s treated, only one has reactivated in 9 years.</li>
    <li> I did extensive research to figure out which trigger point release device to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the Pressure Pointer is by far the superior product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Pressure Pointer is the only trigger point device on the market that allows you to use your feet. Foot power is important since you&#x27;re NOT using one set of muscles to help release another set of muscles. Both the Thera Cane and the Backnobber need arm power to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Pressure Pointer has four interchangeable heads so you can customize the exact amount of pressure you want to receive. None of the other devices on the market have the amount of choices that you get from the Pressure Pointer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. In an era when every product is manufactured overseas, it&#x27;s nice to support a Made in America product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The Pressure Pointer comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee so if the Pressure Pointer doesn&#x27;t work for you it can be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Much to my delight, I also discovered that since I started using my Pressure Pointer before bed, I now sleep a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this great product that will transform your life.</li>
    <li> This is something you will wonder how you lived without it, I certainly do!  An amazing product, takes a few minutes to catch on but once you do you&#x27;ll never want to put it down!!</li>
