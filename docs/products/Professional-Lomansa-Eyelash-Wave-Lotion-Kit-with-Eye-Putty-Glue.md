<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought  this not knowing how to use it but I went on u tube and there are lots of tutorials showing you how. It comes with its own rods but I would buy the rods separate as well because this only came with one size \\&quot;medium\\&quot; I used them on myself and my lashes came out great! I would dye them after too then you don&#x27;t need to wear mascara!</li>
    <li> First off, I received this kit sooo fast.  I did my eyelash perm last night in my bathroom.  My first eye turned out a little less than perfect but that is because it was the first time I have ever done this. They are curled! I used non waterproof mascara for the first time, loved it.  Next time I will use small rods, I used medium this time.  I bought all three, so I suggest if you buy this kit you do the same because it only comes with medium.  Message me if you want to see my photo of my results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my clients for about 4 yrs, very easy to use and the results are fabulous all the time.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, curled my eyelashes fine, had a major problem with the rollers. The perming rods that were sent to me come in one sheet two different sizes. These rods were extremely small. Had to buy other rods online because my eyelashes went completely around the rods that were sent. Had to wait another couple of weeks before could use, did perm my eyelashes with new rods… We&#x27;ll see how long they last.</li>
    <li> I just brought the product.order was quick and nicely packaged .I read the instructions carefully and noted there was no information about cleaning the perm solution off prior to putting on the fixative,the company who sell it were unable to answer my question .I decided to go ahead and use the product just as the instructions read and I was very happy with the results .As in most perm solution it has an odour which for me is not an issue , the lotion is very easy to use, as it&#x27;s thick and and easy to apply .the rollers stick well.I used cotton rounds and cut them to desired width and put the solution on them as instructed and Q-tips for getting the solution out of the little bottles . I have used other perm products and so far I like this the best .</li>
    <li> This product does work. The only problem I would say I have is that some eyelashes got curled a lot n some are not as curled. But overall this product worked.</li>
    <li> The product curls as it claims, but doesn&#x27;t last for a month as it states within the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasted for about a day and the treatment takes about 20-30 minutes. For those who stated they never received directions, you can find several &amp;#34;YouTube&amp;#34; videos on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite a simple application process.&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply Rods&lt;br /&gt;2. Secure Lashes onto Rods&lt;br /&gt;3. Use the Glue to Paint on the Lashes so that they adhere Perfectly onto the Rods. (Although I think too much Glue may prevent the Chemical from reaching the Hair Shaft)&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply Pink Lotion and Let it Sit for 10 minutes. Remove.&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply Blue Lotion. Follow #4&lt;br /&gt;6. Apply Pink Conditioner. Follow #4&lt;br /&gt;7. Apply Neutralizer&lt;br /&gt;8. Remove Rods</li>
    <li> I use this every two months? to curl my lashes. It works just like the salon, where I had to pay $30 per perm... I even do it for my friends too. Its great!</li>
    <li> I recommend this to my friends ,it really works</li>
    <li> The glue and liquid in some bottles was totally dry upon receiving.  It&#x27;s kind of doubtful whether they excercise basic quality control.</li>
    <li> Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y llegó en buenas condiciones, sin daños ni problemas</li>
    <li> In my area there aren&#x27;t any places that have eyelash perm available in my area and my eyelashes don&#x27;t keep curl with an eyelash curler at all! So I bought this kit and did it myself, of course extremely careful not to get it in the eye. Everyone loves my eyelashes and compliments me on them! Also a great price...</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t dream of leaving the house without a set of tightly permed eyelashes. If they don&#x27;t look like two mutant spiders curled up and died on my face, then I&#x27;m not doing something right, amiright ladies? It goes without saying that any kit containing \\&quot;Eye Putty Glue\\&quot; is gonna rank high on my beauty routine. An added bonus - it works on downstairs hair!</li>
    <li> The putty glue was useless.  I had to use another type of glue to hold the rods down.  Actually purchased silicon eyelash pads instead since it creates a more natural curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why but the perms I&#x27;ve done leaves the lash hair wirey and squiggly towards the end.  So, maybe it&#x27;s too strong on the lashes I&#x27;ve been using it on?  I don&#x27;t leave it on for long either because I&#x27;m afraid the lashes would fall out.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with lomansa eyelash perm kit. The instructions were very helpful and easy to follow. I usually I have to drive over 30 miles to get my eyelashes permed and they are only open 3 days a week, so I am super happy I found this on amazon and its so easy to do myself.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Works good. Doesn&#x27;t come with good instructions but youtube and it will help. My eyelashes are definitly curled.</li>
    <li> recieved pretty quickly and it works! i dont know how long results last yet but Im hoping at least a few weeks. came with everything as described including detailed directions. happy happy :)</li>
    <li> great! great results! highly recommend it! Easy to use and doesnt harm eyes at all. all you need to get a great lash perm!</li>
    <li> My order didn&#x27;t come with instructions but I found these on-line. I hope this helps! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lomansa Kit Includes:&lt;br /&gt;Perming Lotion (pink)&lt;br /&gt;Setting Lotion (blue)&lt;br /&gt;Nourishing Agent (coral)&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser (clear)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyelash Perm Instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparations:&lt;br /&gt;Remove all makeup from eyelashes and lid with oil-free remover.  Clean area with warm water, for best results, allow 10 minutes for eye area to completely dry before beginning the perming procedure.  Remove contact lenses, if any.  Immerse six to eight cotton pads in water and squeeze out the excess water.&lt;br /&gt;Procedure:&lt;br /&gt;1.Use the following guidelines to determine the rod size.&lt;br /&gt;a.  Smaller rod is best for the short eyelashes or if a tighter curl is desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b.  Medium is the most commonly used for a good all around curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c.  Large rod is best for the longer lash or looser curl (men prefer this size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Place a ½ round damp cosmetic pad on the lower lid before beginning the perm to prevent&lt;br /&gt;fumes from entering the client&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;3. Remove rod from packaging. Note: The rod is pre-treated with glue.  Bend the rod slightly in&lt;br /&gt;a \\&quot;C\\&quot; curve to fit the shape of the eyelid.  May be cut to fit smaller eyes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Place the glue that comes with the kit at the base of the lashes; use enough glue to cover an&lt;br /&gt;area equal to the length and twice the width of the roller.  Do not place on lid without first coating&lt;br /&gt;the lid with perm glue because the roller is pretreated with glue and will be difficult to remove from&lt;br /&gt;lid without additional.  It is ok if there is excess glue; the permanent lotion will work through it.&lt;br /&gt;If the rod does not adhere on the ends, place a small amount of glue on the ends and use a wood&lt;br /&gt;applicator (included with the kit) to hold the rod in place.&lt;br /&gt;5.After positioning the roller, add more glue on top of the roller.  Using the wood applicator, carefully&lt;br /&gt;place the lashes on the rod.  Make sure the lashes are \\&quot;straight\\&quot; and do not overlap.&lt;br /&gt;6. Use an orangewood stick or a clean applicator stick to gently dab a small amount of the permanent&lt;br /&gt;wave lotion (step 1) on the lashes.  Use a cotton pad to wipe off the excess permanent wave lotion and&lt;br /&gt;place it over the lashes.  Make sure there is enough lotion on the pad to touch the lashes; this will aid&lt;br /&gt;in creating heat for perming.  If you have a facial steamer, you may use it at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Let the lotion remain on the eyelashes for seven to fifteen minutes (depending on the texture of the&lt;br /&gt;lashes).  Clean the eyelid skin immediately after applying the lotion to avoid irritation.  Do not overuse&lt;br /&gt;the perm lotion.  Excess permanent wave lotion will be wasted and will not create a better curl.  To&lt;br /&gt;determine if the perm process is complete, carefully lift one or two lashes away from the rod with a&lt;br /&gt;wood applicator and check curl.  If necessary leave permanent wave lotion on until desired curl is attained.&lt;br /&gt;8. Remover cotton pad.  Use a newly moistened cotton pad to remove all traces of permanent wave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;9. Follow the same steps used for applying the permanent wave lotion to apply the setting lotion (step 2).&lt;br /&gt;Use a new cotton pad every time.  Wipe the excess lotion on the pad and place it over the lashes.  Let it&lt;br /&gt;set for seven to twelve minutes based on the length of time the permanent lotion was left on.&lt;br /&gt;10. Remove the cotton pad follow the same steps used for applying the permanent wave lotion to apply&lt;br /&gt;the nourishing agent (step 3).  Let nourishing set for five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;11. Use cleanser (step 4) with another clean cotton pad.  Gently clean the upper part of the roller touching&lt;br /&gt;the eyelid.  Using water damp Q-tip slowly roll downward, freeing the lashes from the rod.  Clean lashes&lt;br /&gt;with a warm damp cotton pad.  Apply hypoallergenic  moisturizer to the eyelid (optional) to sooth and&lt;br /&gt;re-moisturize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Caution:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practice of this procedure is highly recommended before servicing clients.&lt;br /&gt;Technicians should wear gloves throughout  the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;This product is for use by licensed , trained, solon professionals only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyelash Perm Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;  1.

    <li> Works great. I permed my own lashes which I was nervous to do at first even though it came with instructions in English they were not very specific. At first I used just the sticky curler pads it came with and when I applied the first pink lotion my lashes came unstuck. So then I removed it and started over first applying the curler pad and then the glue in the purple bottle on my lashes and that worked great. My lashes are now super curled and look perfect. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> As a make up artist I would recommend this product to any beauty professional. Its very easy to use and long lasting. The only bad thing (for me) if any, its the eyelash rods are not easy to put them on the lashes.  I decided not to use their rods so I bought a better ones from a different website. I definitely recommend this product, but if you are not a beauty professional make sure you fully understand the process before attempting to use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product way excellent price. Will keep my salon supplied with this product from now on.</li>
    <li> This product did not do what I thought it would do. I probably will not buy the same product again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product since my eyelashes grow downward and I have to curl them everyday.  My eyelashes didn&#x27;t stick very well to the rollers even using the glue included in the kit.  The end result was that my lashes now curl straight forward, not up.  It&#x27;s an improvement, but not as much as I had hoped.  Perhaps I will buy smaller rollers and give it a second try.  I guess it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
