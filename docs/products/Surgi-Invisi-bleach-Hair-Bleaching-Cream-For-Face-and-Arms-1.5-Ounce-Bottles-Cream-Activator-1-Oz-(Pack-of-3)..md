      <li>it&#x27;s a great buy.  </li>
      <li>for arms, this thing was great.  </li>
      <li>I loved it.  </li>
      <li>not as good as sally hansen.  </li>
      <li>This is a very good, easy to mix hair bleach.  </li>
      <li>They were right, this is a great product!  </li>
      <li>SO glad to find Surgi on Amazon!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective, so I recommend it...</li>
      <li>but this is by far the best one.</li>
      <li>so I bleached them and it turned out fine!</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m sure if you have lighter hair, it&#x27;ll be great the first time around.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and effective.  </li>
      <li>I love about Surgi:  </li>
      <li>That being said, anything more potent would damage skin, i think.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s relatively okay on my arms, but I can&#x27;t use it on my face at all, period.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s much better than</li>
      <li>This bleach works a lot better than I was expecting it to.</li>
      <li>I was scared to bleach my eyebrows, I had heard so many horror stories.</li>
      <li>I mixed this up and smeared it on, finding that using a qtip worked best to get it on evenly.</li>
      <li>and i feel more assure of myself.</li>
      <li>I was able to mix cream and smear it on both of my arms, and still have plenty in 1 bottle for a couple more applications.  </li>
      <li>If you want to do more, you need to buy more.</li>
      <li>Now, this isn&#x27;t the end-all be-all of bleach systems, but it&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, which is why I give it 5 starts.  </li>
      <li>my wife love it, and we order it soon.</li>
      <li>it worked pretty good.</li>
      <li>this worked pretty good.</li>
      <li>It seems to me that there aren&#x27;t too many bleaches available for body hair.  </li>
      <li>If you are going to bleach your body hair, this is one of the better products available.</li>
      <li>both bleach and activator are creams; mixing is so easy -</li>
      <li>Although I leave it on for a full 10 minutes and things are okay.  </li>
      <li>Which can be nice for a more natural look.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I experienced no burning or tingling sensations while the cream is on my skin, although the skin that came into contact with the bleach did lighten, but I have found this to only be temporary.</li>
      <li>Overall, this product works great at hiding hair by bleaching it a lighter shade.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The three-pack is a great deal, and it will probably last me for a couple of months.</li>
      <li>I found the cream to be quite hassle free.</li>
      <li>The process is fairly straight-forward, uncomplicated, and not very messy.</li>
      <li>, in regards to the directions saying apply it to clean skin, I would recommend not taking a shower before applying the product.</li>
      <li>Because it will make your hair light very fast!</li>
      <li>so I had to remove it right away!</li>
      <li>On my face, it&#x27;s fine, but stubborn hairs (and what the heck is it with those hairs right at the corners of your mouth???), you may have to bleach again.</li>
      <li>Does a good job overall.</li>
      <li>forward to the winter: my tan has mostly disappeared and I&#x27;m a normal color.</li>
      <li>Always patch test first!</li>
      <li>I opened a fresh box today and realized that I have two tubes of #1 instead of one #1 and one #2.  </li>
      <li>It was worth the difficulty of mixing all the batches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(yes I have one, don&#x27;t laugh).</li>
      <li>Originally I discovered Surgi at a local beauty supply store and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>so I was pretty sure that this product was not going to cause much, if any, irritation; however, I would highly recommend reading and abiding by the directions and warnings for the more sensitive person(s).</li>
      <li>I recommend not leaving this product on for the full length of time until you get to know how much lightening you need.</li>
      <li>I also like that you get 3 boxes in the pack, since for large areas you can go through this stuff pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easier to mix than other bleaches, but the Sally Hansen one works exponentially better!  </li>
      <li>: I have pretty tolerable skin and have used chemical products before</li>
      <li>The only effects are the itchy tingly feeling while it does its magic on my hair.</li>
      <li>i have darker and thicker hair then most and have lived in silent embaressment all my life.</li>
      <li>I followed the requirements and wiped it off exactly when it said.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now 3 weeks after my vacation and many of the hairs are still blonde.  </li>
      <li>I have never used powdered hair bleach, but after reading the reviews of such products, I would say I was quite pleased with my experience with the Surgi bleaching cream.</li>
      <li>As far arm hairs, if you have very dark arm hairs, this will bleach nicely, but it will not be &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; or very blond - think very, very light brown.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The first time I tried this product was during the summer, when I was really tan.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t do two bleaches in a row, but from one day to the next it was certainly fine.  </li>
      <li>and I really think it works</li>
      <li>The hair was so much lighter and my skin was not affected.</li>
      <li>The area was so much lighter compared to the rest of my arm that I decided not to move forward with bleaching anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>Works fast and works well.  </li>
      <li>It really did the trick.</li>
      <li>but it goes away fast.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Once bleached, the hair does blend in really well, and becomes quite invisible.</li>
      <li>Easy to measure and so much simpler than measuring and mixing creams and powders in every other cream bleach I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this i have used jolen and fem</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>As I keep lightening my hair though I had to do something, my eyebrows were already much much darker than my natural hair anyways.</li>
      <li>summary - wait until the winter months to use this product, or until you are a normal color (no tan).</li>
      <li>I have dark, fine hair on my legs,</li>
      <li>and I have fairly dark yet fine body hair</li>
      <li>I leave the hair bleaching cream on a little longer than the instructions; I have found that 20 minutes works well for me, but I would make sure to test the product in a small area, and see what your own individual experience is.</li>
      <li>I also love that when bleached, hair actually becomes of that baby hair blond color, and not orange like after some other bleaching creams, so it looks very natural.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I must say that this one works better than most other options, I use it only for facial hair, so I just use a small portion of what&#x27;s in the tube, maintaining the 2:1 proportion (which is no rocket science, really).</li>
      <li>It has less chemicals in it&#x27;s ingredient list, and is a hassle free product.</li>
      <li>It works really well never burns works really fast and lasts a really long time before having to use again.</li>
      <li>It was overall much easier to measure and mix.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t keep the cream on for the duration it required because of my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It still does its job while your skin is being protected by your natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>My dark dark mustache became light light blonde and invisible!  </li>
      <li>It says with multiple use it will lighten over time so since I&#x27;ve already used it I can&#x27;t very well return it,</li>
      <li>I moved on to do my entire arm, which turned out to be very tricky.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really burn, and the nicest thing was that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, no red spots afterwards, and the skin itself did not change color, pigmentation or anything.</li>
      <li>Also, one box just enough to do your whole legs once, for example.</li>
      <li>However, although the results are good, they are not perfect.</li>
      <li>It does work, mildly, it still can&#x27;t turn the really dark ones I have</li>
      <li>The skin color was normal and the hair was the desired blonde.</li>
      <li>Be careful on sensitive areas!!!!</li>
      <li>Works very fast, in less than 10 min</li>
      <li>A large reason I choose \\&quot;Surgi Invisi-Bleach Hair Bleaching Cream\\&quot;, was due to the ingredient list.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t tried any other bleaching product, but I don&#x27;t really feel the need to.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So this certainly isn&#x27;t the easiest product to use, but it&#x27;s also not as hard as some of the other reviews made it out to be. I agree the mixing procedure is very dumb, and they stress so strongly not to alter the \\&quot;2-1 ratio!!\\&quot; that it makes you very nervous with the unscientific mixing tray they provide. But really it&#x27;s not that hard, you squeeze some out, mix it around and then spread it on. After a few minutes you rinse it off. My skin did change color but returned to normal after about half a day. My hair on the other hand... it got a little lighter (it was very dark) and much softer. Certainly not invisi-bleached... but on the way there. So I&#x27;m sure if you have lighter hair, it&#x27;ll be great the first time around. If you have darker, then probably 2-3 tries will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Does a good job overall. I don&#x27;t have very dark hair, and even that sometimes needs to be bleached twice with this (to get very blonde). That being said, anything more potent would damage skin, i think. Also, one box just enough to do your whole legs once, for example. If you want to do more, you need to buy more.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream bleach I&#x27;ve found that is actually two creams that are mixed together.  Easy to measure and so much simpler than measuring and mixing creams and powders in every other cream bleach I&#x27;ve used before.  Works fast and works well.  I have never had a problem with it burning, used according to the directions.  Only place I could find it was on Amazon.com.  Believe me, I looked.</li>
    <li> I have dark skin (Paula Patton Tone). I don&#x27;t like shaving other than the common areas of the body and I have fairly dark yet fine body hair and I wanted something that would lighten my arm hair and other parts of my body. I purchased this as a tester and I really think it works (scratch that, it works!). I only leave the product on for ten/fifteen minutes and it lightens the hair immensely. The product has not lightened or caused any damage to my skin. The only effects are the itchy tingly feeling while it does its magic on my hair. I think it is a great product and I would recommend to everyone, especially, darker tones and/or with fine/dark body hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, in regards to the directions saying apply it to clean skin, I would recommend not taking a shower before applying the product. I personally feel that the oils that are produced on your body throughout the day act like a type of barrier to help reduce the irritation that the product would cause otherwise. It still does its job while your skin is being protected by your natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have pretty tolerable skin and have used chemical products before so I was pretty sure that this product was not going to cause much, if any, irritation; however, I would highly recommend reading and abiding by the directions and warnings for the more sensitive person(s).</li>
    <li> i have darker and thicker hair then most and have lived in silent embaressment all my life. i could just die when a kid asks me why i have such ugly hairy arms... finally decided to do something about it and got some of this. it works well and i feel more assure of myself. i dont have to worry about having guy arms anymore !</li>
    <li> Just a note to follow the instructions.  I didn&#x27;t try it out first and it burned a little but lightened even my black hair.</li>
    <li> It seems to me that there aren&#x27;t too many bleaches available for body hair.  I&#x27;ve only ever tried Sally Hansen and Jolen before, and both were satisfactory, but nothing to write home about.  Enter Surgi: Invis-Bleach.  Now, this isn&#x27;t the end-all be-all of bleach systems, but it&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, which is why I give it 5 starts.  Overall, I would say that all three brands I&#x27;ve tried have bleached my hair equally, but where Surgi exceeds the others is in ease of use.  I hate using the powder activator for the other two brands.  It&#x27;s much more difficult measuring out the 2-1 ratio, and the powder would always end up getting everywhere because of those stupid flat trays they give you in the box.  Furthermore, if I went through a period when I didn&#x27;t use the product, the powder would inevitably harden and I would be stuck buying another box.  With Surgi&#x27;s product utilizing the concept of two creams, instead of one cream and one powder, it pulls ahead of the rest.  It was overall much easier to measure and mix.  To get dark hair completely lightened, you might have to use it twice.  I did have some tingling on my skin, but no more or less than with other brands.  I wouldn&#x27;t do two bleaches in a row, but from one day to the next it was certainly fine.  I also like that you get 3 boxes in the pack, since for large areas you can go through this stuff pretty quickly.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I did a patch test on my arm and I noticed that my skin color was temporarily bleached/lighter. I was a little worried about using this bleach on my face but I went for it anyway. I used it around the area of my sideburns. I have a few dark fine hairs that surround that area so I bleached them and it turned out fine! No pain or burning! BUT when I used this on my upper lip I ran into some MAJOR burning. As soon as I applied it, I could feel the burning sensation so I had to remove it right away! I did get a small mark from the burn, but it went away the next day. I had previously waxed that are in the last two days, but I had a few fine hairs that stuck around and I wanted them to be less visible. I think the waxing prior to the bleaching may have caused the burning sensation. I have gotten it before from the sally hansen bleach but never on application. It usually occurred within 4-6 minutes. Be careful on sensitive areas!!!!</li>
    <li> It works really well never burns works really fast and lasts a really long time before having to use again.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this i have used jolen and fem but this is by far the best one. no itching no redness</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out something other than Sally Hansen because that&#x27;s all the convenience stores around me sell! Well, it looks like I&#x27;m going back to dear Sally because this stuff burns! My problem with Sally Hansen was that the product itched and it was so hard to resist scratching where the cream was, but this stuff burns and it&#x27;s so much worse than an annoying itch. It&#x27;s relatively okay on my arms, but I can&#x27;t use it on my face at all, period. It does work, mildly, it still can&#x27;t turn the really dark ones I have (I&#x27;m heavy Italian I have really thick coarse dark hairs) it&#x27;s rather frustrating. It says with multiple use it will lighten over time so since I&#x27;ve already used it I can&#x27;t very well return it, so I guess I&#x27;ll keep trying on my arms and happy trail (yes I have one, don&#x27;t laugh). Even there it&#x27;s still annoying to tolerate the stinging, and here I always thought I was very resistant to these kind of things.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t deny that this product works. However, the 10-minute wait between applying it and rinsing it off feels very unpleasant in a way I can&#x27;t articulate well. It&#x27;s effective, so I recommend it... just don&#x27;t be surprised if you find yourself counting down the seconds until you can finally rinse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for my arms, so I can&#x27;t say how it works for other areas.  Also, I have not tried other creams so I cannot say how it compares to other products.&lt;br /&gt;But for arms, this thing was great.  I was able to mix cream and smear it on both of my arms, and still have plenty in 1 bottle for a couple more applications.  It only stung my arms a little toward the last minute. I followed the requirements and wiped it off exactly when it said.  My hair was bleach blonde the night before my vacation.  No red on my arms the next morning!  I loved it.  It&#x27;s now 3 weeks after my vacation and many of the hairs are still blonde.  I will be using this again because it works and makes my arms appears as if I have do not have arm hair. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> It bleaches your skin very light when you use it and stings but you&#x27;d have to use it like once a week if you really want to keep any hair bleached :[</li>
    <li> I ordered the three pack of this product.  I opened a fresh box today and realized that I have two tubes of #1 instead of one #1 and one #2.  I then preceded to open the other two boxes and found the same thing.  I now have six #1 tubes and NO #2 tubes.  This product is worthless to me and I can&#x27;t figure out how to return it.  I am very unhappy right now.</li>
    <li> This bleach works a lot better than I was expecting it to. It DOES lighten your skin, but, after a few hours, your skin is back to normal. I would NOT recommend that you use this on skin that you&#x27;re about to expose, unless you don&#x27;t mind people staring at the random globs of lighter skin on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the product was applied for a few minutes, you might feel a slight tingle/burning sensation...but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s unbearable. You only leave it on for a few minutes after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any other bleaching product, but I don&#x27;t really feel the need to. It has been over a week since I&#x27;ve used it and the hair is still bleached! So it&#x27;s much better than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to others. I feel like this product will last me a long time (you get three boxes of the stuff), so the $26 I spent was well worth it IMO.</li>
    <li> I have used other brands of creams before (mostly Italian), so I am familiar with the procedure, and with the unpleasant sensations that may be associated with it.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this one works better than most other options, I use it only for facial hair, so I just use a small portion of what&#x27;s in the tube, maintaining the 2:1 proportion (which is no rocket science, really). It didn&#x27;t really burn, and the nicest thing was that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, no red spots afterwards, and the skin itself did not change color, pigmentation or anything. I also love that when bleached, hair actually becomes of that baby hair blond color, and not orange like after some other bleaching creams, so it looks very natural. It says you should keep it for 10 minutes, but I think i held it for maybe 5 or 7 minutes, and that was enough. But then again, I have been bleaching hair for a while now, so maybe it&#x27;s just thinner and does not take that long.&lt;br /&gt;The three-pack is a great deal, and it will probably last me for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> It may make your skin a bit red for a bit but it goes away fast. I recommend not leaving this product on for the full length of time until you get to know how much lightening you need. Because it will make your hair light very fast!</li>
    <li> Not the worst bleach, but not very good.  It&#x27;s easier to mix than other bleaches, but the Sally Hansen one works exponentially better!  I have dark arm hair and this stuff only slightly lightens it to a lighter brown, whereas, the Sally Hansen bleach turns it to blonde.</li>
    <li> Beard turn out too dark? This product will lighten it in just a few minutes!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this item over the summer. I&#x27;m female and Italian, and the thick, dark hair on my arms has always made me really self-conscious. I decided to try and bleach the hair in order to make it less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this product was during the summer, when I was really tan. I did a small patch test according to the instructions, left it on for the recommended 10 minutes, and to my dismay, it left my hair AND my skin a lighter color. The area was so much lighter compared to the rest of my arm that I decided not to move forward with bleaching anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to the winter: my tan has mostly disappeared and I&#x27;m a normal color. I tried this product again, did a patch test, and it worked perfectly! The skin color was normal and the hair was the desired blonde. I moved on to do my entire arm, which turned out to be very tricky. The kit comes with a tiny little tray, so I had to mix multiple batches in a bowl and apply it to my arms. Once I covered the areas, I waited the 10 minutes and rinsed off the bleach. My arms looked wonderful! The hair was so much lighter and my skin was not affected. It was worth the difficulty of mixing all the batches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary - wait until the winter months to use this product, or until you are a normal color (no tan). Always patch test first! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> No rash, no redness! Works very fast, in less than 10 min your hair is all bleached! I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, based on the other reviews.  They were right, this is a great product!  The two solutions come in separate tubes.  Just squeeze a little of each into the small tray that comes in the box and use the small mixing spatula that also comes with it and put it on your face or arms.  Follow the instructions carefully on the correct amounts to use.  Leave it on just 10 minutes and rinse.  My dark dark mustache became light light blonde and invisible!  You get three entire boxes of this product with your order, so it&#x27;s a great buy.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> my wife love it, and we order it soon. thank you.</li>
    <li> I was scared to bleach my eyebrows, I had heard so many horror stories. As I keep lightening my hair though I had to do something, my eyebrows were already much much darker than my natural hair anyways. I mixed this up and smeared it on, finding that using a qtip worked best to get it on evenly. It really did the trick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and effective.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for bleach for the hair on my legs, and settled on this product: \\&quot;Surgi Invisi-Bleach Hair Bleaching Cream For Face &amp; Arms\\&quot;. I get really bad in-grown hairs when I remove the hair on my legs, and have tried just about every hair removal tactic, as well as in-grown hair treatment. Instead of looking like I had the chicken pox 24/7, I decided I would let the hair grow out, and the skin on my legs heal. We live in a culture that tends to be repulsed by women&#x27;s leg hair, so I felt ultra self-conscious, and decided I would try bleaching the hair to make it less noticeable.    A large reason I choose \\&quot;Surgi Invisi-Bleach Hair Bleaching Cream\\&quot;, was due to the ingredient list. While not perfect, the Surgi brand appears to be less toxic and chemical laden when compared to other hair bleaching products available.    Upon opening the box, you will find a 1.5 oz. tube of Bleaching Cream, a 1 oz. tube of Activating Cream, a small plastic tray &amp; applicator spatula, as well as instructions. Since my legs are a larger surface than my arms or face, I just throw away the small plastic tray and spatula, and use a popsicle stick and small plate.    The process is fairly straight-forward, uncomplicated, and not very messy. The ratio of Bleaching Cream to Activating cream is 1:2. I have never used powdered hair bleach, but after reading the reviews of such products, I would say I was quite pleased with my experience with the Surgi bleaching cream. I found the cream to be quite hassle free. Once you measure out and mix the two creams together, you simply apply the cream to the desired location using the plastic spatula (or other spreading device). I leave the hair bleaching cream on a little longer than the instructions; I have found that 20 minutes works well for me, but I would make sure to test the product in a small area, and see what your own individual experience is. The last step is to rinse the bleaching cream off your skin.    I have dark, fine hair on my legs, andthe \\&quot;Surgi Invisi-Bleach Hair Bleaching Cream\\&quot; bleaches my hair blonde in one go (as I mentioned earlier, I do wait a little longer). I experienced no burning or tingling sensations while the cream is on my skin, although the skin that came into contact with the bleach did lighten, but I have found this to only be temporary. Once bleached, the hair does blend in really well, and becomes quite invisible. I use up one box of this product when bleaching the hair on both of my lower legs, but smaller areas would require much less of the bleaching cream.    Overall, this product works great at hiding hair by bleaching it a lighter shade. It has less chemicals in it&#x27;s ingredient list, and is a hassle free product. Plus, there is no skin irritation or burning sensations during application. If you are going to bleach your body hair, this is one of the better products available.</li>
    <li> SO glad to find Surgi on Amazon! Originally I discovered Surgi at a local beauty supply store and fell in love with it. When the store stopped carrying it I resorted to Sally H. and Jolen. Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about Surgi:  both bleach and activator are creams; mixing is so easy - no trying to stir tiny powder granules and cream on a flat plastic tray. Surgi is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t fall off before the timer goes off; other products I&#x27;ve tried are so heavy the bleach mixture starts falling off in chunks well before time is up! It does burn a tad, but I simply moisturizer immediately after and all is well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three pack is a great deal!</li>
    <li> I have black hair on my arms, not a lot of hair, just black. And thin.&lt;br /&gt;So this worked pretty good. I couldn&#x27;t keep the cream on for the duration it required because of my sensitive skin. I was in itchy pain. But even though I took the bleach off minutes before I was supposed to...it worked pretty good.</li>
    <li> not as good as sally hansen.  It doesn&#x27;t bleach the hair as well as other bleaches I have used.  I don&#x27;t know why people in the reviews raved about this stuff</li>
    <li> This is a very good, easy to mix hair bleach.  I emphasize the easy to mix because other bleach kits can be annoying to get the right balance when mixing.  However, although the results are good, they are not perfect. On my face, it&#x27;s fine, but stubborn hairs (and what the heck is it with those hairs right at the corners of your mouth???), you may have to bleach again. Although I leave it on for a full 10 minutes and things are okay.  As far arm hairs, if you have very dark arm hairs, this will bleach nicely, but it will not be &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; or very blond - think very, very light brown.  Which can be nice for a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: Ease of use (mixing) &#x3D; 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Bleach effectiveness &#x3D; 3.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Skin Irritation (itching, etc.) &#x3D; minimal&lt;br /&gt;Redness or rash &#x3D; none</li>
