      <li>Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
      <li>I love using these.</li>
      <li>Its okay</li>
      <li>I keep ordering these pads because I haven&#x27;t found any better ones.</li>
      <li>Add alcohol to them, and they clean off the protective sticky coat, and shine up my nails!</li>
      <li>Not lint free, but they do the job better than a cotton ball.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and keep clean.</li>
      <li>These are NOT lint free.</li>
      <li>I would say they are about 80% lint free.</li>
      <li>These are by no means lint free.  </li>
      <li>I do not find that these are lint free.  </li>
      <li>just looking at them they don&#x27;t appear to be lint free</li>
      <li>They are lint free.</li>
      <li>Theyre a great bargain but beware of shipping they take a long time to come in.</li>
      <li>I use these with alcohol to clean the tackiness off gel nails when done curing.</li>
      <li>I use them to clean off my nails just after I have applied gel nail color.</li>
      <li>these are great and work well when wet.</li>
      <li>Good for removing stick of gel nails, not absorbent enough to remove polish unless you are using a stack of 10 pads</li>
      <li>I do gel nails, and they wipe off any access good enough.</li>
      <li>Great for general use but not if you actually need a lint free wipe!</li>
      <li>So if you use these alot make sure you get seceral packs so you can have enough time to reorder some more</li>
      <li>Super then but works well</li>
      <li>Shipped reliably and quickly.</li>
      <li>absolutely LINT FREE....</li>
      <li>Even then it takes more to complete the task.</li>
      <li>my only regret is that i didn&#x27;t order more...</li>
      <li>Product does exactly what it promises to.</li>
      <li>They are far from being lint free.</li>
      <li>These ruined an expensive &amp; the best product I ever have found to strengthen my nails!!!  </li>
      <li>some lint free wipes really aren&#x27;t but these definitely are....</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re just using them with polish remover they are very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>paper thin and tiny...not good at all.</li>
      <li>Overall this was an okay product but the wipes are sill a little fuzzy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how they can get away with saying these wipes are lint free.</li>
      <li>definitely lint free but very small</li>

    <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they can get away with saying these wipes are lint free. They&#x27;re as bad as cotton. Unless you want to be pulling fibers and lint from your clients polish, don&#x27;t buy these wipes!</li>
    <li> These are not at all what they said they were. They are far from being lint free. Very disappointed in them and they also charged me shipping and handling on the which doubled the price and they are garbage.</li>
    <li> I do gel nails, and they wipe off any access good enough. I havent had any issues with the item. Theyre a great bargain but beware of shipping they take a long time to come in. So if you use these alot make sure you get seceral packs so you can have enough time to reorder some more</li>
    <li> Pieces are too thin. I have to use 6 at a time to remove polish. Even then it takes more to complete the task. I will not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> These are great! They don&#x27;t leave lint or cotton on your nails. They do a great job. I use them to clean off my nails just after I have applied gel nail color. Add alcohol to them, and they clean off the protective sticky coat, and shine up my nails! I love my nails to shine!</li>
    <li> Good for removing stick of gel nails, not absorbent enough to remove polish unless you are using a stack of 10 pads</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and keep clean. I use these with alcohol to clean the tackiness off gel nails when done curing.</li>
    <li> absolutely LINT FREE....some lint free wipes really aren&#x27;t but these definitely are....great price!  my only regret is that i didn&#x27;t order more...</li>
    <li> I keep ordering these pads because I haven&#x27;t found any better ones. They are to small and to thin, but when I can find some bigger and alittle thicker I will use these. They are lint free.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with the fact that these are super thin. I mean wafer thin.</li>
    <li> Order came in time and product was as described.</li>
    <li> Overall this was an okay product but the wipes are sill a little fuzzy. I would say they are about 80% lint free.</li>
    <li> got these in about 2 wks after ordering them they are reall nice i done have any lint left on my nails after using these a my have in any nail collection</li>
    <li> Took over a month to receive my purchase. These are also very thin and hard to handle. Not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> I do not find that these are lint free.  Once I use it leaves fly aways everywhere</li>
    <li> fair prices, and recieved my item as stated on the delivery right between the dates, looks as pictured and im very happy. thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the purpose of doing gel nails and I needed something other than cotton balls that wouldn&#x27;t leave anything behind. to get caught in the polish. These leave fibers behind that I have to go back and pull off of the nails, super annoying. Great for general use but not if you actually need a lint free wipe!</li>
    <li> Thinner than expected but usable. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> A little too small, but God for the price</li>
    <li> Excellent...very happy with purchase and delivery time.</li>
    <li> paper thin and tiny...not good at all.</li>
    <li> I got these to wipe of nails in the cleanse process and they work great. Paper towels and cotton balls were not as effective at cleaning the nail bed and brushes. These are very thin and difficult to separate but work great.</li>
    <li> I use it for gel polish manicures at home.  The wipes leave fibers behind like a cotton ball.  I should&#x27;ve just stuck with paper towels.</li>
    <li> i have seen others put a bad review... these are great and work well when wet. idk why others say it leaves things on the nail it doesnt</li>
    <li> These are by no means lint free.  These ruined an expensive &amp; the best product I ever have found to strengthen my nails!!!  I always wash my hands after removing nail polish, just thought I should add that point.  I bought that product on Amazon also, after reading about it in a magazine but I don&#x27;t know if you can mention other products in reviews.  You get what you pay for with this product.</li>
    <li> These wipes are really thin. You need to use several to get the nail polish off. Its okay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I received my item thank you!</li>
    <li> definitely lint free but very small</li>
    <li> Incorrect description. These are NOT lint free. I do gel nails and they left lint fibers all over. I cannot use them. If you&#x27;re just using them with polish remover they are very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** Contacted the seller. They were pleasant and refunded my money</li>
    <li> Product does exactly what it promises to. Shipped reliably and quickly.</li>
    <li> took a very long time to get here...just looking at them they don&#x27;t appear to be lint free but we will see when I use them in a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> These work perfectly. No lint, no mess, perfect nails.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy there is so many in a pack because they work best if you combine 3 together when cleaning your nails.</li>
    <li> Great size and truly lint free</li>
    <li> Shipping was awful. about a 2 month wait. quality is as expected.</li>
