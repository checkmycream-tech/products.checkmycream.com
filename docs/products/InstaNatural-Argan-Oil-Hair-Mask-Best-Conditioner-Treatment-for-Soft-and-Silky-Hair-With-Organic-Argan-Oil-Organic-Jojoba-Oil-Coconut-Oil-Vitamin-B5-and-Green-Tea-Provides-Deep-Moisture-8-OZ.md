<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Our hair needs masks like our face. Can you imagine what torture we put it through when we style and dry them. It is like, we bake them in the oven. They need a little pampering too. I love these kinds of masks. It is a little care that we can show to our hair for making us look so irresistibly beautiful, LOL :) Thank you InstaNatural for this wonderful mask.</li>
    <li> This one really perfect</li>
    <li> This made my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> It smells soooooo good!</li>
    <li> I live in Utah. That means I am in a dry, desert climate and my skin and hair pay the price. I tried this hair mask and the results were fabulous. The product smells great (kinda like an orange creamsicle) and keeps your hair smelling nice throughout the day. Immediately after using it, I noticed my hair was so soft, manageable, and smooth. This is like a miracle product! It washes out nicely and is easy to use - apply it to your towel dried hair for 5-15 minutes and then rinse. I use it twice a week and LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioning treatment for color treated hair like mine! Leaves hair soft, smooth, and frizz free. Takes a few extra minutes in the shower but so worth it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference but it didn&#x27;t affect my hair negatively so I give it a 4 for that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous conditioners, this one is Ok. I deep moisturize the ends of my hair 2x a week, this conditioner is moisturizing but it tends to leave a film on my hair.  I also use the oil, it&#x27;s excellent. Leaves my hair soft, and silky.</li>
    <li> I left it in my hair overnight.  I did not have any problem rinsing it out and my hair did not feel heavy.</li>
    <li> I received my package  with my product already used it was half full... Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve delayed writing this review as it would only make sense if I can actually see the results after a few uses. I&#x27;ve used it twice since I&#x27;ve ordered it a few weeks back and I am satisfied. The hair does look healthy, soft and more manageable. Only downside is the strong orange smell that lasts quite some time but I think it is bearable and relatively a small cost for improved hair quality. The instruction says to use it once or twice a week but I would probably use it one every fortnight. Highly recommended if you have dry and difficult broomstick (especially Asian) hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Argan oil hair mask for the last two weeks, and have noticed my hair to be softer. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy and it has a nice scent to it.</li>
    <li> I do like this product and the fact that there are no offending ingredients. I was looking for a de-frizzer that would weigh my hair down just a bit and leave my hair soft. this comes quite close. I would give it 4.5 star if that option was available.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask. I have to use a hair mask once in a while because my hair is aging being 54 and I have been coloring it since I was a girl. this mask brings may hair back to life very nicely and a jar lasts and lasts . its easy to use and effective . #hairmask #gotitfree</li>
    <li> Hair is so silku soft after a ONE use of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Holy Grail.  Can&#x27;t live without this product.  Would purchase again at almost any price.  In fact, have purchased 20 Literally save my hair!!!  Words cannot express my excitement and gratitude of what a amazing product this is!  Simply put the best hair product on the planet!!!</li>
    <li> Buy this right now! This is the best hair treatment I have ever bought. My hair has gotten from dry to silky and soft. Not only this product has natural ingredients, its only 19 bucks..( I used products thats more than 40 bucks and didnt work as well as this one ) . I will definitely purchase this product again. Delivery was super fast as well +++++</li>
    <li> I have only used the product once and I really liked the results.  The one thing I have noticed after a week, besides the softness, is that this product has made my hair more susceptible to receiving moisture. Meaning the other products I use such as a leave in conditioner worked a lot better. My curls are spiraling from root to end. I have low porosity hair so it soaks up water but at the same time would get dry rather quickly. This is why I purchased the hair mask.  I have decided to use it weekly.  It smells awesome, like orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream which is my favorite ice cream. *:) happy I am looking forward to my 2nd use.</li>
    <li> This product works well and smells heavenly (like a dreamsicle).  Recommend it? Yes I do!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this product, but I am so glad I got it!  This hair mask is amazing!  It smells great-not overpowering at all.  I have used it as a mask which has helped with the drying effects of winter on my hair and scalp.  I also use this as a rinse-out conditioner.  It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and easy to manage.  It does not leave my hair feeling oily or heavy at all.  I absolutely love this product!  InstaNatural has awesome customer service, delivery was fast, and the item was very well packaged.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This mask is pretty amazing!  I&#x27;ve used it several times now and it smells great and keeps my hair feeling moisturized.  This will definitely be a staple.</li>
    <li> This completely transformed my relaxed dry hair. Silky to the tip when I flat ironed it and great body.  I didn&#x27;t need to follow this with a regular conditioner, but if you find your hair tangles easily I would strongly suggest following it with another natural/organic conditioner from Aubrey Organics to help out with that issue. Natural/organic products rinse out much better than those that aren&#x27;t. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Unfortunately... I am not impressed.  I had high hopes... but the product smells like an orange cream soda, which isn&#x27;t a bad smell, but doesn&#x27;t strike me as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell.  I tried not to let that affect my opinion of the product and used it for a couple of weeks as a regular conditioner 2x&#x27;s a week to see what the result would be.  The product did condition my course, naturally curly hair, with no lingering after-smell, which was good, but I found after using it for three weeks, that it starts to leave a bad build up on my hair.  I bought it to use once a week as a mask, but I will have to use it less often, maybe once or twice a month, and for that reason, I am not happy overall with the product.  I am not sure why it created the bad buildup, maybe because of the oils that are in it??? but the way it made my hair feel was kind of nasty:(  HOWEVER, the company, which has excellent follow up and customer service, did hold true to their guarantee and based on my response to them about the product did issue a full refund.  For this reason, I would recommend this product, as everyone&#x27;s hair is different and I can see where it may work for others.  With the excellent guarantee, you can&#x27;t go wrong, give it a chance!</li>
    <li> I had the chance to try the Argan Oil Hair Mask and Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream. The Argan Oil can be used as a conditioner every day or once every few days. It smells so good! It makes my hair silky smooth and it seems to be a bit fuller. When I use it, my hair is completely tangle free and can be quickly combed through. This is a good product for me to use because my hair stylist said my hair was a little dry the last time I went to see her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the moisturizer before I put on my make-up. It smells like cucumbers, but is not overpowering (I’m not a big fan of cucumbers.) It has not caused me to break-out, which is a plus! As for age-defying properties, that is to be seen!</li>
    <li> Very sticky...weird.  And it doesn&#x27;t detangle.  It clumped up in my hair so I had to re-shampoo my hair.  I can&#x27;t understand how it got so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try the argan oil hair mask. I am really picky about the products I put in my hair, due to my hair being excessively oily. But the Argan oil mask proved me wrong! It has natural ingredients such as; ArganOil, Amino Acid Complex, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter and Vitamin B5. Which all are essential to promoting hair strength and health!  It left my hair feeling great, not greasy or heavy. It also works as a protectant against any hot tools such as blow drying or the hair iron.  I also noticed my hair looking a lot more hydrated since my ends were pretty dried and dead. If you&#x27;re looking for something that is free of chemicals and all natural, then this product is for you!</li>
    <li> My hair type:&lt;br /&gt;Natural African American&lt;br /&gt;3C and 4A type curls (they look like the tiny springs in retractable pens)&lt;br /&gt;Fine strands,&lt;br /&gt;high density&lt;br /&gt;Coarse at the crown&lt;br /&gt;Low porosity (it takes at least 15 minutes for water to saturate my hair in the shower, and that was BEFORE I started using this product)&lt;br /&gt;Years Natural: 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I used this product: overnight deep conditioning ( 4 times) and 45 minute mask treatment, with the aid of a blow dryer to harden the hair mask and aid in penetration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long I used this product: 3 months and counting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful (Some people have a sensitive olfactory system, and this scent is prominent, not overpowering for me, but it may be for others. Another reviewer said that it smelled like an orange cream soda, it didn&#x27;t to me. Each person is different and will have a different tolerance for the scent.)&lt;br /&gt;Thick- it is a really thick conditioner; which I love!&lt;br /&gt;IT actually works! I sleep in my conditioner overnight sometimes, sometimes I do not. I tested this product both ways, and I still got the same result (soft, manageable hair after rinsing) each time.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are beneficial to maintaining moisture&lt;br /&gt;Softness without residue- oil and residue is not just a concern for people with naturally straight hair; even though African American textured hair doesn&#x27;t suffer from being &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; if it retains oil, residue and buildup can accumulate on the scalp and clog the pores, stunting growth and depriving the hair of natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The price and the amount - I have no problem paying more for a superior product, but the amount to price ratio leaves a bit to be desired for me. Because I have a lot of hair, I end up using 1 jar for each conditioning session. Still, this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;The jar - it is a bit difficult to get the product out of the jar without aid of a spatula, but this is a minor issue that can be worked around and again, not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this conditioner for my hair type and any others. I have softer, more manageable hair now, and the scent stays with me for a couple of days at least. It does what it says, and is better than most other conditioners I have tried.his conditioner for my hair type and any others. I have softer, more manageable hair now, and the scent stays with me for a couple of days at least. It does what it says, and is better than most other conditioners I have tried.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair silky and smooth.  It has made a real difference to my dry processed hair</li>
    <li> i was not able to use more than two times, because I felt the smell was too agressive for me, I have curly frissy hair and did not notice any frizz reduction ot extra moisture in my hair. Maybe this is a product for a healthier hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used. My hair is long and very thick. I do exactly as the instructions tell you and my hair is silky soft and very shiny. I would buy this product again and again. I also recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m a 4b curly girl and it worked wonders for my hair. It left my hair normally dry hair feeling soft and luscious. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t have much slip. But overall loved it and will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this mask is great but I have to use it very light and then wash my hair with shampoo afterwards. It is like my hair has been through a Brazilian blow out. Love it and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations. Hair was quite color treated and sundamaged. This product brought it back to life almost 100%.</li>
    <li> it was opened when i received it , no sealed ... not  working at all ....i think it&#x27;s fake ....don&#x27;t buy it !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that would blow dry and flat iron my hair daily. So, my hair would turn out with split ends and made it look stiff and dull. I&#x27;ve used other InstaNatural products, and they work like magic. Once i saw this Argan Oil Hair Mask, i was so ready to buy this and help my hair. Using this hair mask twice a week, it helped moisturize and soften. On the plus side, it smells soo good! It reminds me of the Original Orange Julius drink haha. If you use it once or twice a week, you&#x27;ll receive great results :)</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I was in shock. I have very thin hair that tangles very easily, but since I started using this my hair is healthy and nearly tangle free.</li>
    <li> After I used it first time (keeping it on for 15 minutes), my hair looked healthy and shiny without the look of dryness anymore. Next few times I used it more like a conditioner only leaving it on for 2-3 minutes, and the result seems just OK. Its pricy and I have not used it long enough to know its long term result.  May not be a good idea to use as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Okay so I know better than to expect miracles but hey, I thought this was gonna do something. I&#x27;ve read all these amazing reviews and thought hey this might work and be good. But if you, like me, have dry and thick hair, that&#x27;s curly sometimes, this won&#x27;t work for you. And the smell is super strong.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product. My hair does get smoother, but with the smell of it, I don&#x27;t want to use it again.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair and over time, I get breakage. Especially since I dyed part of my hair purple and the bleach used really takes a number on my hair. So I’ve used the conditioner as a regular conditioner and already love the results! I mean, even after one use I was already in love. It also has a really great smell. In addition to using it as a regular conditioner, I&#x27;ve been using it as a deep conditioner too!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> Love it! Did well for my hair. Softens frizz and helps with dryness.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> Really like this mask!  And I love the smell.. great hydration for my natural 4b to 4c hair</li>
    <li> Great stuff. My hair is so soft now!!! even the hair dresser asked me what did i use on my hair. I will always buy it.</li>
    <li> From the first time using it, I was in love. The smell is amazing!  You only need a small amount, so the tub will last for quite some time. It detangles your hair and from the first use I could see a MAJOR difference in my hair. After blow drying, which usually leaves my hair frizzy with tons of flyaways, my hair was visibly smoother and much softer, especially in my bangs and ends, which previously looked dry and broken. It did not weigh down or add any grease at all! I am so glad I recieved this product to review. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This hair mask is amazing. It made my hair so silky smooth, soft, and so healthy looking. I would definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> This mask is awesome! It leaves my hair soft and detangled. My hair looks and feels healthier and shinier when I use this. I use it 2x a week. It does have a strong scent to it that I&#x27;m not a huge fan of, but after I put in my other hair products, you can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
    <li> I have never used an Argan Oil Hair Mask before, but I have used Argan Oil to tame pesky fly-away&#x27;s. I did my normal regimen in the shower, towel dried my hair to where it was not dripping wet, but it was certainly not close to dried. I applied the Argan Oil Hair Mask, and let it sit in my hair tied in a bun for 15-20 minutes. Rinse my hair out after the time was completely, blew dried my hair and I was absolutely impressed with the results. I have always been extremely leery with using Argan Oil since you can easily make your hair look like a nasty mess. I was honestly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford to invest in this Argan Oil Hair Mask by InstaNatural, I highly suggest that you take the time to order your mask now. It comes quick and clean, and also in a very high protected package.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair that tends to be dry. To help with that I only wash it three times a week and use deep conditioners whenever I do. I&#x27;ve never tried a hair mask before. This takes a bit more time since you have to leave it in 5-15 minutes, but the result is well worth it! With premium ingredients like argan oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, shea butter, and avocado oil, my hair felt silkier, less frizzy, and had lots more volume than before. It smells really nice too! I am definitely going to continue using this once a week! Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> Is this product safe to use on Keratin treated hair?</li>
    <li> I give it no star it leaves my hair drier than before and frizzy! Very expensive and does not deliver the results as mentioned!</li>
    <li> Used it with the Argan hair oil as a conditioner was worth every cent made my hair moist has it soft and I suffer from dry scalp this erased that without it being oily....recommended</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff, leaves my hair soft and shiny. I normally have VERY dry and course, thick hair. I use the argan oil hair treatment oil 1 hour before washing my hair, shampoo it out, towel dry it, then apply this and let it sit for 15-20 minutes before washing it out. Then apply a dime size amount of the oil again before and after blow drying. My hair has never looked so healthy, shiny, and soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd review. This hair mask is amazing. It was skeptical about purchasing it initially because of the price; however it is well worth the price! It leaves my hair extremely soft and manageable which are two must-haves for a naturalista. I will buy this over and over. Please do not discontinue.</li>
    <li> This is the second time i bought a product with Argan Oil. The first one was a face cream, which caused my skin to burn and turn red within seconds of putting it on. This product smells great, but doesn&#x27;t seem good for my hair. My hair feel dry and are very hard to brush after using it. Perhaps Argan is simply not agreeing with my body.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Love it. For one thing, it smells like....I don&#x27;t know. Like pudding. Or dessert. Or something decadent. It smells SO FREAKIN&#x27; GOOD I WANT TO EAT IT. It&#x27;s super thick, super creamy, but doesn&#x27;t feel gross or goopy when you put it on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should admit that the directions say to use this mask on damp clean hair. I use it on dry dirty hair. That said, it still works. My hair is so much shinier, so much softer when I use this. It&#x27;s not voluminous, but that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m putting it all over my entire head - my fine hair doesn&#x27;t do well with conditioner of any kind on the roots. Regardless, this product has saved my hair this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tub is huge....no joke, I&#x27;m probably going to have this for a year. Knowing that, I&#x27;m easily going to tell you that the $18 price tag is worth it. (Even if it was a smaller tub, it&#x27;d still be worth it.) I did receive this free for testing purposes, but when I run out of it I&#x27;m buying more!</li>
    <li> What an amazing product! I am Nigerian with 4c hair that is frequently dry and fragile due to heat processing. This conditioner is a dream! Moisturizes, detangles, and leaves my hair super soft. Plus it smells divine!</li>
    <li> Super great product for my hair.  It is thick and smells great  After one use my hair feels so much better.  The ends&lt;br /&gt;are not so fly away.  Item arrived one day ahead of time which is good for me. I will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff is amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! My hair has never been so manageable before!! And it smells so amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It smells great and leaves my hair soft without being oily. Like all the other Instanatural products I&#x27;ve bought, this one is now a staple in my life.</li>
    <li> Best stuff EVER.  Hair was sooo dry after one use....AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I love, love, LOVE this product. It&#x27;s literally a miracle in a jar. I went from not being being to comb my dry, brittle hair to running a wide tooth comb through it like butter. It really works! I use it once a week as a deep conditioner (for 5-10 minutes), rinse it out, oil my hair and up in a ponytail it goes. It keeps my hair hydrated and soft for a week!</li>
    <li> I received the Insta Natural Argan Oil Hair Mask free for review and could not wait to try it for a couple reasons.  First, I love to try all kinds o hair products, and second, I totally trust the Insta Natural brand.  When I opened the jar, it smelled like heaven.  It had a very unique scent that I have smelled before, but cannot quite put my finger on- almost like an orange baby aspirin.  The direction said to apply it to dap hair after washing.  It was very easy to apply, smooth and creamy.  I left it in 10 minutes as the directions stated between 5 and 15 and I tend to go middle of the road.  I combed it through my hair before the final rinse and the comb slid through so smoothly.  The mask rinsed out completely and the only disappointment was that I felt it did not hold the scent that I initially smelled.  I proceeded to blow dry my hair and it came out smooth and soft.  It seemed to give it a little more life and body. The directions state to use it once a week and I am sold on doing so.  A hair mas iscertainly an interesting concept.  It is thicker than conditioner and I could see a noticeable difference.  The ingredient are al natural and it is obvious where those awesome scents are coming from: argan oil, coconut oil, shea butter and vitamin B5.  This product is definitely  worth a try and would be fun to use on a girls&#x27; beauty night.</li>
    <li> i got this and I got the holistic maple conditioner, and I did not like this. It was not worth the money. My hair didn&#x27;t feel moisturized or healthy. The other conditioner was much much better.</li>
    <li> So far so good and affordable</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I love the way my hair looks; feels and it&#x27;s manageability from using it!!!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!!!!!!!! We have extremely hard water and it&#x27;s extremely hard on our hair.... My daughter and I both use this product. Our hair is soft and manageable. Will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Had one sent to my daughter  as well who has long thick hair makes it silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair about waist length. As you can imagine for long hair,  conditioner and shampoo really matter. That being said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve  been hunting for years for the right conditioner. I tried everything from Costco&#x27;s Kirkland brand to pricey hair salon conditioners. I finally settled on BioLage Ultra Hydra Therapy. It made my hair feel luxurious. And on top of that, I tend to have an itchy scalp and this one didn&#x27;t make me itchy. But...they changed their formula and I no longer like their conditioner. So the hunt started again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little intimidated by &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; for this conditioner. My mom used oil treatments and it was literally oil. This conditioner is not an oil. (See picture.) It&#x27;s a creamy conditioner and you use it like any other conditioner.  It also smells wonderful. It does not smell floral. The smell is a bit hard to describe, but it&#x27;s very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch at all! I have no known allergies, but so many conditioners I&#x27;ve tried over the years have made me itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels healthy and great with this Argon Oil.  Not dried out. Not flat. No feeling like my hair is brittle when I comb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is....I&#x27;m going to say fair. I think I paid about $17 for it. I&#x27;ve paid way more for conditioners that didn&#x27;t work for me.  And of course there are cheaper ones out there, but none worked as well as this one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I love everything about this product.</li>
    <li> This product is the best on the market. .. this Argan oil mask keeps my hair soft and curly... i really love this.</li>
    <li> AWFUL.  I bought this because of the seemingly rave reviews.  I have very long color-treated hair that is fine and silky but very thick.  I wanted this mask to be an added boost of moisture and silkiness for after colorings.  I&#x27;ve used Argan oil products often, but this was my first time using this mask.  Terrible.  I used the recommended amount, which just wasnt enough - granted, I have long hair, but it seems that there isnt enough oil in this to actually make a little go a long way - as with many argan oil solutions.  So the next time I used more. It got tacky and sticky in my hair and tangled it (my hair rarely tangles usually).  The stickiness got worse and worse.  I spent 45 minutes shampooing it out.  Afterwards my hair felt thin and stringy.  All the volume was gone and I had issues with greasiness for over a week.  Awful.  Seriously, how did this stuff get so many good reviews?  PS - I noticed that a lot of the more recent reviews are negative, so maybe they&#x27;ve changed formulas?  Save your money and buy straight-up argan oil that you can use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I used this hair mask two different times so far:  once, as a conditioner and once as a mask, ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> First off this stuff smells amazing! Oh my goodness. I used it first as a conditioner after shampooing and used a little too much but it made my hair smell awesome and feel really soft to the touch. Haven&#x27;t tried to leave it in for a while yet but I&#x27;m expecting great results! I have long thick hair and so far I like it.</li>
    <li> Best conditioning mask. Use it once a week for my overwashed and dehydrated hair. This works well and smells great. This gives you better results if you use some daily moisturizer in your hair.</li>
    <li> My hair got very damaged from coloring, and I&#x27;ve also been trying to grow it long. That means a LOT of split ends and hair breakage! I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about 3 weeks now. I feel like my hair was transformed! It feels very silky, and it looks shiny. I still have split ends, but I haven&#x27;t developed any new ones, and my hair is not breaking off like it had been. Also, it smells great!</li>
    <li> very moisturizing and helped repair my damaged colored hair really fast. really surprised by the fast results.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft and healthy. My hair also smells great!</li>
    <li> I will purchase this product again..My hair is colored and this conditioner made it soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> This product did not work on my hair. I have very thick relaxed hair. I understand my hair is very difficult, so I don&#x27;t think it was the product.</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly. And is great on my hair. I have very long hair and need to deep condition more often. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Works well. Even with the price cut, I still think that it is too expensive.</li>
    <li> This product does make my hair softer, but somehow I was expecting extra softness.  Perhaps my extra thick hair needs something a bit more potent.  This product may be great for someone with normal or fine hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with Silicon Mix and I prefer this! I am a naturalista and this leaves my hair feeling really soft and manageable.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product makes your hair soft and manageable,  Very nice gloss to hair.  I left a little in after washing my hair.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I am BLOWN AWAY. My hair is not fine, it&#x27;s super frizzy and gets dried out really easily. I just used this for the first time and I&#x27;m in awe of my new, soft, gorgeous salon hair. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried that this would leave my hair greasy.  I&#x27;ve tried pure argan oil on my hair before and it felt nasty and I had to wash it out immediately.  But I was pleasantly surprised by this!  I have thick, course wavy hair.  My hair is much softer after each use, and dries much quicker than before and with less hassle to straighten it.  The smell of this leaves something to be desired, but it&#x27;s worth it to reap the benefits of this mask.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend using this mask!</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel dry after each use. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> I love this item!! My hair looks better after I started to use this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few so far, works wonders for my damaged hair</li>
    <li> It significantly reduces falling hair for me and my wife. We&#x27;re buying more to give as a gift to our siblings. Thanks, Argan Oil for existing!</li>
    <li> I received the insta natural argan oil for testing purposes. I am a big fan of argan oil but never used it in a cream form so I was very excited to try. This conditioner can be used as a hair treatment before the shower or as a conditioner after shampoo. I chose to use it after shampoo because I did not want to wait. It smelled like candy and left my hair full of bounce and a silky feel to it! This argan oil cream is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great product works well.</li>
    <li> This has done fantastic things for my wife&#x27;s hair.  She&#x27;s had pretty dry, damaged hair and it&#x27;s so much healthier now.  Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Great for hair! I bought this as a gift for my MIL and she is loving it! She has really thick, coarse hair and it has been making it shiny and healthy looking again. Great product and good price for it, especially since its all natural. Would buy this again :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> The Argan Oil Hair Mask has worked wonders for my hair.  My hair has been dry since the summer especially and I have been looking for a product to give it more body and not so dry.  After I shampoo I use a small amount and leave it on for about 5 minutes and rinse it out.  My hair is much more manageable and less dry.  I am very pleased and look forward to using more products in their line.</li>
    <li> I love everything with a Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Not worth the price!very high price for just a thick hair cream. Nothing special about this product. A total rip off.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the smell.and look</li>
    <li> InstaNatural’s Argan Oil Hair Mask contains argan oil, coconut oil, amino acid complex, shea butter, Vitamin B5, and many other high-quality all-natural and organic products. It is a deep conditioning treatment for dry, damaged hair, that offers treatment to nourish and hydrate hair. It has a blend of ingredients to strength and protect hair, as well as repair and deep condition hair, to offer a silky, softer feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to trying out this hair mask, I was nervous because my hair gets oily quickly, and easy, especially from hair-care products. I have thick, frizzy and dry, damaged hair from years of coloring and straightening. However, the benefits outweighed the possibility of oily hair that could be handled. It’s a creamy mask that is simple to apply. Just massage the conditioner into your clean, damp hair, and leave it on for 5 to 15 minutes. It works by penetrating your follicles to deliver hydration and rejuvenate from key ingredients. Many are told to try coconut oil in their hair for benefits. Well, just imagine all the ingredients in this hair mask, offering so many benefits, including healthier hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, I would apply this once a week, just to give my hair time to adjusted because my scalp is sensitive. Now, I can say I am not longer scared of argan oil! It works extremely well with nourishing and providing my hair with the hydration it needs due to damage. It did not leave my hair oily, and it actually left it soft, easier to manage, and healthy. When I went for a haircut after using the product, the woman complimented me on how healthy my hair is, and what I use to keep it so. It was a delight to hear after trying to manage my hair previously when it was dry, and frizzy.</li>
    <li> Greasy and leaves my hair limp and heavy... probably better for thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> For the price, I was definitely expecting more. It definitely moisturized my hair, but no more than my regular conditioner does. Just didn&#x27;t work for me! I have lots of fine, looong hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for super long hair! my hair feels &amp; looks so healthy. I get tons of compliments since I started using Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> Really like the product,leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Hair became much more beautiful! Smooth, silky and fragrant! No wonder the boyfriend loves it more.</li>
    <li> I really like how this moisturizes my ends.  They are colored and very dry but this works well.  It also has a very mild and pleasing smell.  I would purchase this again.  I would not use it root to tip, I only need it on the ends.</li>
    <li> Using this once a week and it makes my hair soft and smooth. I have very fine hair but using this gives it volume.</li>
    <li> It smells great and I love that I can use it as a daily conditioner as well. Only problem is the logistics of opening the container while in the shower, scooping some into my hand, then finding a way to screw the lid back on tightly. It can get tricky while trying to avoid the water! But makes my hair very shiny until the next shampoo.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have ever used. I have relaxed hair and the humidity usually has my hair in a crazy state. This is the only conditioner that has been able to battle the humidity so that I am able to wear my hair in styles usually reserved for only when my hair is freshly washed. Really love it!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this, I thought I would be getting a miracle product.  It did condition my hair but not with any greater results than I have had with other products.  I have permed hair that can be somewhat dry in the winter and this product did condition well enough but not with the spectacular results that others have had.  I think my hair just did not need this formula.  I did follow the instructions but I did not get the spectacular results that I had hoped for.  I am presently having better luck with the Lanza Trauma Treatment.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! Just like orange cremsicles! Really brings a lot of softness to my hair and I use it as a deep conditioner once a week and let it set on my hair with a hair cap for ~20 minutes. It&#x27;s really brought moisture to my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer, conditioner &amp; hair smoother. It has a wonderful scent, which is great because other products I&#x27;ve tried with Argon Oil don&#x27;t have a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super soft</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair feeling amazing. Very smooth and I love the smell</li>
    <li> I love how this product helps tame my fly aways and frizziness.</li>
    <li> AH! This is a great hair mask. It leaves your hair soft and silky not greasy. Even works well in beards.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I substituted my regular conditioner with this and the difference is huge.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews for this product at all. This did absolutely nothing for my hair. A total waste of money. It was a thick paste with a strong wierd smell........I tried it twice and the second time I tried to leave it in longer than the first time because of all the good reviews......but still what a mess. I could not even get a comb through my hair and I had to use one of my other deep conditioners I had on hand to straighten out the mess my hair was in.  You have been warned!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely heavenly but doesn&#x27;t moisturized my hair very well. Actually left it kind of dry. For some reason Argon oil shampoos/conditioners do not work on me</li>
    <li> The hair mask is great, nice and thick, and it smells nice. I used it to do a braid out and the results were great. My hair was soft and shiny and well defined.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner,so much after the first use.When I opened the jar,the smell blew me away,a beautiful smell.I used it to condition my hair it was wash day,let me tell you my hair was soft,moisturized,it smelled so good.Is is also good to use as a everyday conditioner, which I have been using with my other DIY Hair products,my only issue is that I have a lot of hair, I have a little left over,wish the jar was bigger.This is some good stuff that you do not want to be without off.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil Mask is really good on my hair which is very dry, thick and coarse. The fist time I did the intense condition  boy what a difference in my hair. Oh I don&#x27;t want to forget to tell you about the wonderful smell it has so it is a win win for me.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about how well this has worked for me. I have had a really hard time finding something to moisturize my hair this did the job.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  It last a long time and my daughter also uses it. It does help your hair.</li>
    <li> love love love this product .. smells great and my hair is so soft .. 2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> This conditioning mask is amazing! I used several other brands in the past w/o good results. I have natural hair which tends to be dry &amp; brittle, especially the grey. I now look forward to doing my hair--InstaNatural Argan Oil Conditioning Mask leaves my hair moisturized &amp; soft--&amp; it has a nice scent! This is the best product for dull, dry, lifeless hair. It does what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> I used this as a daily conditioner and absolutely love it!  It moisturizes and leaves my hair tangle free, which is a lot to say for my mat!  My hair is naturally oily so I have to be careful not to get it on my roots but it&#x27;s a miracle worker for sure!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, sometimes frizzy, thick hair and I have issues with my hair feeling dry and coarse at times. I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of months as both a 15 minute intense mask and a shorter 5 minute mask while in the shower. I really haven&#x27;t noticed any amazing differences after using it compared to just using my normal conditioner and shampoo. In fact I definitely prefer the smell of my regular stuff, this doesn&#x27;t appeal to me at all. I have very healthy hair, anyway, so maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t notice anything... It also seems like I really have to pile a ton of it in my hair to feel it working and when I wash it out my hair feels like it did before. I definitely will stick with my regular stuff and won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This hair mask came into my life at the perfect time! Not only am I about to run out of the hair mask I’ve been using, but my hair is definitely suffering in this dry, winter weather. My favorite thing about this Argan Oil Hair Mask is that it can be used either as a deep conditioning treatment 1-2 times per week or in place of your regular conditioner. To use as a treatment, let the mask soak into your hair for 5-20 minutes and then rinse out. Otherwise, use as you would your daily conditioner. I chose to use the mask as a treatment. I really like the texture as it is lighter than a typical hair mask but still heavy enough for some deep conditioning. I left it on my fine hair for about five minutes and was really surprised when I didn’t have much to rinse out. My hair was so dry it absorbed nearly all of the oil! In fact, my hair looked shinier and felt smoother all day long, too. I’ll be using this on the regular for sure!</li>
    <li> My sister has been using this product and LOVES it!! She has super thick, frizzy hair and this has really helped to soften and lighten up her hair!! And yay, it&#x27;s not frizzy since using it!! She uses it as both a conditioner and a mask (as it can be used both ways). She said the smell is amazing as well and would highly recommend the product!!</li>
    <li> What is it your may ask yourself. It is a mask you put on the roots of your hair. I have learned if you put it on the scalp it will make my hair oilier. By putting it on the roots it is getting into the roots and up the stems of the hair follicles. If you want an extra duty of a job on hair that is dry and nasty. Try this put it on roots then find a shower cap or something of that nature and put your hair inside it. Leave it on from 12 to 24 hrs inside it. Then go wash your hair. Remember it is going to take a couple of good uses to get your hair back to how you want it. If your hair has minor damaged then the shorter time will work for you.I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!  I can say most women or men are hard on their hair from products to outdoor environment. I would suggest to do the longer treatment on your hair for the first couple of times to get the best result out of this product. I would also suggest when you wash this out to use warm or cool water. If you use hot water then your hair follicles will fall out easier. By doing this you will keep your hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried every conditioner under the sun trying to soften my thick, coarse unruly hair, and even the most expensive brands barely made a difference. This is the first conditioner to actually make my hair more manageable! Definitely give it a try and I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> Would be perfect if the tub was a bit larger.</li>
    <li> This works. I could tel after the first time. I swear it feels like my hair even grew a bit longer. Love this</li>
    <li> I like this mask a lot. I like that it can be used as a mask as well as a conditioner and that it is made with Argan Oil and not chemicals. The smell is really nice and it makes me hair soft and healthier. I&#x27;m not sure that the results are much different than other hair masks sold at drug stores, but it is much more natural which for me is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous! I love how it smells, and it makes my hair so soft (and way easier to comb). Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love the way the mask makes my hair feel and the fact that I can use it on a daily basis as a normal conditioner. The only slight complaint I have is that the smell could be better. It is not a bad smell I just like good smelling hair products.</li>
    <li> This work really well for my hair type. Good product</li>
    <li> Very nice product, easy to apply. I see a positive result on my second use. So far looks like a good product and do not leaves oily touch.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff best ever tried it on my end on my hair it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> Smells great (sort of a sweet sugar cookie fragrance) and left my naturally wavy/fuzzy/fluffy hair soft, shiny and manageable.  I usually have to apply a lot of styling products to get my hair to behave, but I found that after using this conditioner I didn&#x27;t need nearly as much.  I often see little to no difference in my hair after using other conditioning hair masks no matter what the price -- this one made an immediate difference that I could see and feel.  I would definitely recommend this product and purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask about once a week for about a month.  I have thick straight hair and it didn&#x27;t do as much detangling and softening as I would have expected from a hair mask.  My regular coconut oil based conditioner does a better job.</li>
    <li> works wonderful on frizzy &amp; dry hair. i use it once a wk, leave on for 15 mins</li>
    <li> Love it....leaves hair silky and smooth. ...</li>
    <li> I love hair masks, especially those with great, natural ingredients. This is how I’ve been using it: after I wash my hair, I apply about two tablespoons of it onto your hands (just a guess, I just scoop it out with my hands, to be honest) and then I run fingers through my hair to make sure I get it everywhere. I let it sit for about 10 min (I shave my legs etc) and then I detangle my hair and rinse off. So I basically use it as a deep conditioner (not a leave-in conditioner, you’re supposed to rinse it out). This hair mask smells so good! If you like sweet scents, you’re going to love this! It smells like vanilla or cinnamon, not really sure, but it smells yummy! If you don’t like hair products with strong scents, then this is not for you. And now the best part: the way it leaves your hair. I have thin, curly hair that always gets dry and frizzy. This hair mask is very thick, but is easy to use, easy to rinse out and does not leave any heaviness to my hair. My hair feels moisturized and is still light and bouncy. After my hair is completely dry, I add my regular Argan Oil. Perfect combo for shiny, soft hair.</li>
    <li> Maybe I was expecting too much after the great reviews, but it did nothing for me fine, curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight, long Asian hair. I&#x27;m beginning to get some split ends on my tips, and they are a bit dried out from my curling iron/wand (which I&#x27;ve used maybe ~15-20 times since my last haircut 1-2 years ago). Recently, I started swimming in chlorinated pools about 3 times a week for the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it smells similar to pink bubble gum. I don&#x27;t find the scent to be pleasant. I&#x27;ve tried this product both as a hair mask (2-3 times) and as a conditioner (2-3 times). Right after rinsing the product out, my hair feels smooth and healthy, but after my hair dries (sometimes towel and air dry, sometimes blowdrier), my tips go back to being dry and stiff. After I use this product for a longer period, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> Wow I am pleased with this product. I have yet to see long lasting effects, but on the days that I use it, my hair is extremely soft, bouncy, and healthy until the next wash. Wow!</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair was a mess, I had a baby almost a year ago and right after I delivered my hair started falling like crazy for a few months, I lost half of my hair but it started growing again and the new hair was ALWAYS sticking up, I hated it, no matter how I fixed it it&#x27;d stick up. I&#x27;ve tried the mask a couple of times for 15 min and a couple in the shower as conditioner, I like it better for 15 min because I cal tell the difference but either way it works. I love it, my hair looks straighter and doesn&#x27;t stick up anymore. I love that it doesn&#x27;t make it oily, I was afraid it would make my hair oily but it didn&#x27;t, I love it, I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend it. I even got my husband to try it and he loved it too!</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil hair mask. I live in Pennsylvania where the weather right now is cold and my furnace is constantly running.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore my thick, course hair is dry and fly away. I recently purchased the argan mask because of the hype behind argan oil and&lt;br /&gt;the reasonable price. I have used this as a mask and love it. My hair is smooth, silky, and shiney. It is not weighed down at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it also as a regular conditioner but it works best for me as a mask. I have recently purchased several items from&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural and have to say they are just as good or even better than some of the $$$$ skincare products I used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This container of the argon mask is huge and will last for some time.. I would highly recommend their products.</li>
    <li> Works great... love it</li>
    <li> Helped my dry hair so much!</li>
    <li> I love this product I&#x27;ve always had an issue with dried brittle hair because of the fact that I&#x27;m always bleaching and dying it.This product has made my hair feel so much better and healthier it has a shine to it now its soft and my hair smells great.This product is a 8 oz jar which is a great amount of product.I dont use this as an everyday thing,but as a way to treat my hair like a way to pamper myself I use this product once a week.Its amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR A HONEST REVIEW**</li>
    <li> Does miracles for my hair. I use it once a week only. I could see the results form the second time I used it.  My hair looks soft, silky and shiny. Just love it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful deep conditioner...excellent service!</li>
    <li> Restores softness and strength to weak hair. Will use every time i shampoo. Good product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and as stated before i like all organ oil products because they do wonders on my curly hair .&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this mask and the fact that a small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I try to use it at least once a week and i can definitely see the difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I often use it as a hair conditioner too. It works amazing like that too.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;Since i started using it my hair has become softer, more moisturized,my curls are so bouncy and very easy to brush trough.&lt;br /&gt;It is not tested on animals and its made in usa with only natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some directions for better results:&lt;br /&gt;Hair should be clean prior to applying the hair mask. It should be towel-dried yet still slightly damp.&lt;br /&gt;Apply a tablespoon of the hair mask onto your hands and run your fingers through your hair evenly in order to distribute the product. Work from massaging your scalp down to your ends. Let the hair mask absorb for 5-15 minutes and then rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;You can apply more or less depending on your hair length and volume. You can also use a comb to help distribute the hair mask thoroughly if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Use 1-2 times a week as a deep conditioning treatment. If hair is too oily or heavy after application, apply less of the hair mask next time, and/or reduce the frequency of use.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: The Argan Oil Hair Mask can also be used as a standard conditioner. Simply apply to your hair in the shower and rinse off shortly afterward.</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!! I have extremely damaged hair from dying/straightening and have tried countless products. I can finally say I found one that works! After just one use my hair looked and felt amazing and so much healthier.</li>
    <li> Made my hair tangle. I could tell it was the mask, because it would only happen when I used this particular mask and not others. Did not make a difference in softness for me.</li>
    <li> Nice mask, using twice. So I don&#x27;t yet it will totally help or not.&lt;br /&gt;But for two times it is great</li>
    <li> This smells so amazing! It really makes my hair soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil Hair Mask is avery good! It&#x27;s a huge 8 oz jar, Best for deep conditioner treatment for dry, damaged Hair. It smells so great and i can see the better result on my hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work as described. Contains too much alcohol</li>
    <li> Love this product, works great!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!! After the third use its left my hair so soft and frizz free. My hair used to be so damaged from all the chemicals In hair dye but this product has helped alot by repairing the dryness I had. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> It is a good moisturizer for the hair but I just can&#x27;t get past the cheap dollar store vanilla candle smell of it.  Three hair washings and conditioners with other products later and I can still smell it!  For that reason I didn&#x27;t like it and will not repurchase. If there was one available that was fragrance free, I would buy it.</li>
    <li> not bad product. makes my hair feel a little heavy so I would not use too often.</li>
    <li> I used this a few times. It did help condition my hair, but it didn&#x27;t feel deep conditioned. Its not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair mask more for my head than for my hair, as weird as that may sound.  For some reason this year my scalp has been very, very dry and it has been itching a lot.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff and never have, but it has just felt abnormally dry this year.  I thought that I could deep condition my hair as well as my scalp and that it might help with the dryness.  I considered doing this with mayonnaise, but really didn&#x27;t want to have to do that.  It just sounds gross to me, so I ordered this hair mask.  I have only used it twice, but I can already tell a difference.  I definitely notice that my head is not itching as much and my hair feels very soft and silky.  It also smells very nice which definitely wins over the mayonnaise routine.  I would recommend this product and I will most likely purchase this again when I get through the container that I have now.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair so soft and smooth after just one use!  I color my hair and with the dry cold weather my hair is so dry.  InstaNatural Argan Oil Mask really made a difference to my hair...a great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this  product I  do a bit of  swimming at my work out  facility and my hair was always  frizzy and lots of split ends and this is helping a lot after only a few applications I can tell the difference  it has made as  a added conditioner .I was given this product free for a honest  review and I would say it has good quality.</li>
    <li> Smells bad, not very conditioning.</li>
    <li> Deserved a 5 star. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE and WE LOVED the product!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! No oily reside!</li>
    <li> This hair mask leaves hair very soft and silky. It actually smells great too.</li>
    <li> Does wonders !!! However have to keep the product on for at least 45 mins to really feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I like it so far.. The scent is ultra strong but it smells good.. but its a very strong smell..</li>
    <li> Great product apply and leave on for good scalp penetration wrapped in a towel. Will try a&lt;br /&gt;Hot moist towel next time.  Easily rises does not leave hair greasy like some other products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, did make a slight difference, but my hair is realllllly dry and very long, so definitely harder to moisturize.  I think it could be great for those with less dry hair. I&#x27;m still hunting for the perfect condish.</li>
    <li> After using it, my hair becomes very soft and smells good. Totally recommend!!</li>
    <li> This product really works for my hair and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good going it but different when you rinse it out. The smell is ok - I use this after I&#x27;ve had a non-organic/natural product in my hair like styling products of sorts. Usually I leave it in my hair for 10-20 minutes then rinse it out - sometimes I shampoo/condition and sometimes I don&#x27;t. Just depends on how my hair feels. It keeps my hair softer and nice - feels hydrated after I use it but I can see how it may leave hair oily if you don&#x27;t shampoo it out. All-in-all I like it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Definitely improved frizz control and dryness of the Florida climate. Have used three times. Now combining with Hair Repair Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Argon Oil is great on mostly every hair type but it works wonders on my 4c type hair.  This conditioner made my hair super soft and even gave it some curl definition which is extremely hard for 4c types. It also smells great!! I used it as a deep conditioner and applied a heated conditioning cap for 30mins and received awesome results.  I plan to use it as a pre-poo next.  It&#x27;s great and I haven&#x27;t seen it in any of my local beauty supply stores - including Target so it was a great find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very good, leave your hair looking and feeling wonderful.</li>
    <li> I previously used it&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Hair Mask and Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask by Arvazallia.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because of the great reviews but it was a major disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;While I was massaging the mask into my hair, It felt like it didn&#x27;t absorb into my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves my hair very very dry and frizzy the next day. It makes me mad because this is expensive and I want my money back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed and will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this once so far and can already tell it works and made a difference for my dry, colored, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent.  This product makes my fine hair feel thicker, stronger and less frizzy.  I will purchase the mask again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Amazing product .. I love it and recomend it to everyone ..... It gives your hair luster and shine with out wighing it down like other masks and conditioners i use it as a regular conditionar too.</li>
    <li> Just tried the hair mask, for the first time, and I love it.  I have dry damaged hair, from color.  This made my hair feel much better.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The best mask and conditioner for my long hair.  After use this one my hair recover a bit and shinier. Very happy with this product !</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT! I have SUPER fine, long, hair and I just recently got an entire head of bleach blonde highlights. This dried out my hair significantly. I purchased the InstaNatural Argan Oil about 3 weeks ago and have used it 3 or 4 times. I only wash my hair every 4 to 5 days. Each time I&#x27;ve used this product I will lather it into the ends of my hair and lightly apply it everywhere else. I will then put a plastic grocery bag on my head as tight as possible. This allows steam to build up and the product to really soak into my hair. While I&#x27;m bathing and doing everything else, I leave the bag on my head for up to about 10 minutes. The smell of great. It really does smell like a cream sickle. My hair is super soft afterward and smells great.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! My daughter has very thick long curly hair, and I have noticed a tremendous difference in her hair from just using it twice.  Her hair was very frizzy and dry at the ends and it now has shine and hardly any frizz.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The product leaves my hair soft and shiny without feeling greasy or weighed down.  I use it as a once-a-week deep conditioner for my extremely fine hair and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works wonders love it</li>
    <li> Honestly I was expecting something better for the price, smell OK but don&#x27;t hydrate hair</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have been looking for a great natural conditioner.  This mask goes on really clean.  It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, but leaves my curls in great shape-- not at all frizzy.  I use it as a  regular conditioner  and do not wash it all the way out.  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Product does not have a pleasant smell, but does work well to condition hair. Hair feels soft and tangle-free.</li>
    <li> Wow, this thing really works even after the first use. The seller is super nice and wanted to make sure I loved the product. Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Love this mask. It works even as a daily conditioner (leave in for 2-3 minutes) and has made my hair so much more manageable. I will say, and maybe its just me, but I&#x27;m not terribly fond of the smell. My husband likes it though, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to it at this point. Best hair mask that I&#x27;ve found in a long time and certainly worth the money.</li>
    <li> it is very good. after use it, my hair is more smooth than before.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a significant difference in my hair after using this product.</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly, I love it and hair Feels amazing!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is super processed, as in its bleached to white then dyed pink. This mask has helped with the texture and health of my hair immensely. I also have a lot of allergies to &#x27;products.&#x27;  as well as sensitivities to fragrance. This stuff soaks right into my hair and has a light natural scent reminiscent of vanilla and amber and doesn&#x27;t cause my scalp to break out. The smell is very pleasant, light and not at all cloying. If you are looking for something that doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume and repairs damaged hair this is your stuff.</li>
    <li> This argan oil mask does a good job of helping my coarse, unruly hair a bit softer to the touch. I can&#x27;t say that it helped with the frizz, because nothing helps with my heavy duty frizz, but I&#x27;m sure it would help most people&#x27;s frizz quite a bit. Smells lovely, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom. She is raving about her soft hair.  Is not greasy feeling.  She says it&#x27;s better than hot oiling her hair. It feels much softer to the touch. I love the InstaNatural brand. Another great product.</li>
    <li> I love it! I bought the mask at their website and before I have used also their emu oil what I like a lot!&lt;br /&gt;I promise you this mask is fantastic! My hair was extremely dry but when I started using  this mask my hair became shine and finally it looks healthy again!</li>
    <li> This is so good for dry, damaged hair. . . After using this my hair is shinier with a lot less frizz even in humid weather. This really is a great conditioner.</li>
    <li> Unlike other masks or hair conditioners, this one really moisturizes and leaves hair feeling soft.  Such a difference.  This product is fantastic, great for long hair.  After only a few uses, it has given back the bounce to my hair and the texture has improved.  A must have.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair mask, that I use every ten days.  It revives my hair, and leaves it soft.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of hairs masks in my time but none of them with argan oil so when I was asked to review this, I was psyched and excited to try it out. I do use argan oil for my hair and my skin that are quick and on the go but never a hair treatment wherein you have to leave the product for 15 minutes. Compared to other hair masks that I had before, this one is a touch creamier and buttery almost like a lotion with the exception of congealed hold like hair gels would have. I wasn&#x27;t doubtful that this wouldn&#x27;t work knowing the power of argan oil so I wasn&#x27;t surprised that after the 15 minute period then shower that my hair feels clean and refreshed already just like a salon treatment. After a day, my hair still feels soft and manageable so I decided to leave it for one more day un-showered and I find that it was still style-able and easy to detangle. Having long limpy hair, those are my main concern, that is tangling, flatness and loss of hair. I can say that these alleviate those concern for a more than a week I should say before it wore off. I also noticed added volume and shine which is a plus so I don&#x27;t have to tease my roots and do all those hair damaging stuff.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft but not greasy, so it doesn&#x27;t make my fine hair limp.  Great product.</li>
    <li> IT SMELLS SO GOOD. kind of like cake batter and cookies. it actually did make my hair smoother too and i left it in for 10 minutes and then blow dried</li>
    <li> Awesome mask, I use this along with another argan oil serum and doing wonders for my hair and scalp. Argan oil is definitely one of the only this getting rid of my dandruff problem</li>
    <li> ahhhh! If I could give this a 10 star, I totally would! My long, dry, thick hair was in need of something like this and I was very fortunate to be able to try it out for testing and reviewing purposes for a great deal. I washed my hair, conditioned it and put this bad boy on (I leave it on for 30 minutes; personal preference and because I have thick hair). After rinsing my hair, my hair feels soooooooo soft and looks healthy. I have a luxurious hair treatment that I put on after the mask and my gosh, my hair feels and looks so much better. My bf&#x27;s sister who&#x27;s a student in hair school also noticed how soft my hair was (no more dry and dull hair for this girl lol). This mask is AMAZING and it smells so good!! you&#x27;ve got to try it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Hair Mask past 2 weeks and it really has made my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my hair feel very soft and smooth. I use it as a hair conditioner but I do leave it on for at least 5 minutes before rinsing out. Great product, highly recommend if you have dry or damaged hair</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have very dry hair, and this made my hair soft and supple with a minimal amount of effort. It cut down the time of my preparations by a significant of margin and I do not spend nearly the same amount of time on my hair, as it is no  longer necessary. This is a God send!!</li>
    <li> I bought this bc I was looking for something to revive my hair.  I used this in the shower before blowing my hair out and noticed less frizz and better texture.  I will def continue using this every week or two to keep my hair soft and smooth</li>
    <li> First of all, this smells amazing.  Citrus and Shea butter!  I used this on mine and my 12-year-old daughters hair. It was so easy to comb through her hair afterwards which is so thick that it&#x27;s usually super tangly.The directions say to let it sit on your hair 5 to 15 minutes. I just quickly shampoo my hair then apply the hair mask and let it sit while I wash my face and everything else. After I rinse it out I apply my regular conditioner but you don&#x27;t have to do that. I received this free to try. All thoughts are my own.</li>
    <li> I really like the hair mask.  I have very dry curly hair and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s quite moisturizing enough for my dried out locks but it would probably be terrific for hair that&#x27;s not so dry like mine. Smells great too!!</li>
    <li> I was sooooo excited about that mask!&lt;br /&gt; I used as soon as it got home. And I have to say: it&#x27;s AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt; My hair feels so much better, it&#x27;s really shiny, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not sure about the smell, if I loved it or if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product, I thought I was a little disappointed because it weighed my hair down. I had a shoot that day and my hair was a little limp. But I realized that it could be that I didn&#x27;t rinse it well or used a little too much because it said in the container that you can even use it as a conditioner everyday, although I wouldn&#x27;t probably recommend. I stopped using it for a few weeks then used it again and left it much longer in my hair while in the shower. I put a hair cap on and as a result, my hair was softer afterwards. I&#x27;m hooked since then. I use it now at least once a week. I wish I used it more frequently throughout the duration of winter since the season really dried out my hair. If you use this mask right, it will be your best friend. You just kinda have to figure out what works for your hair – frequency, amount, etc.</li>
    <li> At first the scent is amazing - it smells kind of like yogurt. But as you apply it to your hair in the shower and wait out the time before rinsing, it starts to get on your nerves and almost turn in to an overwhelming scent. I didn&#x27;t notice anything to out of the ordinary for this hair mask other then my hair seemed a little more oily and weighed down. Probably not something I would repurchase - but if it was given to me, I&#x27;d use it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask! It&#x27;s has done a wonderful job of repairing damage to my hair When used as a mask. Also it has done an amazing job of taking care of my dry ends when I occasionally use it as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a try because it is organic. I got it for my daughter, she has excema and we have to be careful what products we purchase for her. First of all it smells and feels great! She noticed a huge difference after a couple of uses. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy and has calmed the fly away hairs. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. This product made my hair frizzy and gave it more volume. I have wavy, thick hair-absolutely did not need any volume. It also has an unpleasant, hard to get over smell.</li>
    <li> Great smell.  Leaves hair soft and tameable.  At first, seemed to leave scalp a little greasy.  Second use, I washed my scalp a little more vigorously.</li>
    <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;Excellent and I would advise everyone to use it</li>
    <li> nice product, highly recommend</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a great difference with this product, however, I&#x27;ve only use it once so perhaps I just have to give it more time.  I think it maybe a bit to light for my hair naturally curly hair texture.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this! I was worried it would have that sickly sweet, floral smell like some other argan oil products. This smells yummy like cocoa butter or shea butter. It&#x27;s super smooth and creamy. I&#x27;ve used it once as a deep condition and then use it most showers as an every day conditioner (using a much smaller amount of course). You have to bee careful not to use too much or it can definitely weigh your hair down though. I lightly shampooed after the deep condition.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky and full. Bought it f or thinking hair and it helps. Must rinse well, though.</li>
    <li> I tried this both on myself and my daughter. We have two totally different hair types. I have super long, thick, straight hair and she has frizzy, curly hair. We went by the directions as instructed. Nothing seems to work on her hair to get it to comb through. But this worked so much better than any other conditioner so far we have used. I was able to brush out her hair without any tears. And for myself, I think I put too much in as it seemed to make my roots a bit too oily in the morning. But when I just used it as a regular conditioner in the shower, I really liked the results once my hair dried.</li>
    <li> Horrible conditioner.  Probably the worst I&#x27;ve ever used- did not detangle, left a slimy film, actually had to re-wash my hair and use another conditioner because it was so bad.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!!! My hair feels wonderful after the first use and it just gets better each time.</li>
    <li> By the 2nd use i felt a difference in my hair, felt a lot softer. Still not that great of a product. I guess I was expecting to be wowed.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, makes my hair smooth and silky. It doesn&#x27;t last me a long time since I have a lotta hair and I use a lotta product ever time.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Changed my life.</li>
    <li> Great product but my daughter and I can not get over the smell. It&#x27;s very strong maybe argon oil or coco smell. I&#x27;m not sure and I actually don&#x27;t mind it, but after a while although my hair will be very shiny and soft, the fragrance does not smell clean to me after a day or two.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing. As for a daily conditioner I find it a bit heavy for me as I have thinner hair. I used this as a daily conditioner for about a week and notice my hair was limp and weighed down. I now use it twice a week and it works great. I did use it as a deep treatment for myself and daughter and it made our hair really soft and shiny. I will definetly continue to use this.</li>
    <li> Great scent and nice product.  Hair feels incredibly soft for days after use.  No complaints at all with the shipping or product.</li>
    <li> I feel like this made my hair dry for some reason.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for me, myself and I because my hair gets dry and damaged as it gets longer. I used it and unfortunately it really didn&#x27;t make a difference in the texture, feel, or look of my hair. I love the smell of it, it smells like orange-sicle and the color looks like oatmeal. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it worked awesome on my 8 year old sons hair. Our family ran out of regular conditioner and my daughter and son both have super long hair so I allowed them to use the argan oil. The product relaxed my sons hair and gave it a super smooth and shiny look. Plus his hair smelled great! He looked and felt confident!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have really curly dry hair and I use this product once a week and it provides a great amount of moisture to my hair. Will buy again in yne future.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! It made my hair feel extremely soft and made it look healthy. I will continue to purchase it over and over again. It also smells great!!!  Glad I bought  it and took a chance ;0)</li>
    <li> Love it!  Makes my hair so soft. Great for deep conditioning.  It&#x27;s makes my hair flat if I use it every wash, but it&#x27;s great for a once a week treatment.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks very shiny.</li>
    <li> This makes your hair soft and a little goes a long way. In fact if you use too much it will leave your hair greasy. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have really long thick black hair. And this conditioner leaves my hair soft shiny and smelling great! I love it.</li>
    <li> It works marvelously and smells amazing!  The combination of Argan Oil, Japanese Green Tea, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil &amp; Vitamin B5 work together to nourish your hair and give your senses quite a bit of pleasure while they&#x27;re doing it.  ;)</li>
    <li> Works fine. Very thick. Too heavy for my hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! My hair is curly so naturally it tends to be very dry.  It got even worse after I bleached it but this product worked wonders on it.  By the second application I could already see a difference.  It so soft and helped with  frizz too.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Made a major difference with my hair.</li>
    <li> Menopause has been very unkind to my hair making it very frizzy, dry and unmanageable.  I have tried many conditioners and masks without much improvement, until I tried Argan Oil Hair Mask.  I could not believe how well it works!  I wish I had tried this years earlier.  If someone out there is struggling with uncooperative hair, give this a try.  I use it every other day and I am still amazed at the difference it makes.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my my fine, dry hair unfortunately. I used it per the directions as a masque and had high hopes given the ingredient list and good reviews, but while it did make my hair softer, I experienced some tangling and breakage after the first use (I did not use any heat styling products). I returned to my normal products after the next wash and did not have the same issues, but wanted to give this another try. The second time I used it, I left it in for less time as it seemed possible it was just a bit heavy for my type of hair, but I had the same experience as the first use and with a feeling of slight build up even though I used it with a gentle clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company seems great however, and the smell is pleasant and not overwhelming or unnatural. It just isn&#x27;t a good match for my fine, non-color treated hair even though I liked the idea of it a lot.</li>
    <li> I have 3c type hair (curly but not super kinky) and I have recently decided to go natural. I was shopping around for deep conditioners and this product caught my eye because of all the amazing ingredients for hair (argan oil, jojoba, B5). I left it in for just over an hour and a half, and my curls simply sprang to life when I washed it out. This sweet-smelling conditioner moisturizes without weighing down. My curls are reaching for the stars! Definitely worth a try for natural girls!</li>
    <li> My hair is very much heat treated and felt very dry and burnt. After seeing such high reviews, I bought this and am I glad that I did. After one use, I felt almost 80% better. My hair was much more manageable after the first use. I have given it only 4 stars because after couple washes without using the mask, my hair was feeling the same as before. So I guess I need to keep using it.</li>
    <li> ok~not moisturizing enough for my hair</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It has made a difference in my long, dry, naturally curly hair. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have time for deep conditioning so I was happy to see the product has a pretty big label that says you can use it as daily conditioner. That&#x27;s just what I did. My hair is soft to the touch just after a few days of use. It kind of smells like Fall spices, think cloves and pumpkin spice.</li>
    <li> Not good for me. I have thick coarse curly hair</li>
    <li> This hair mask works wonders! I use it as a deep conditioner (10 min) weekly and everyday as a light conditioner.</li>
    <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for. I was so impressed with there professionalism, and the eager to go over and beyond to make sure that I was a satisfied customer, that I just had to apply for all of there products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Excellent customer service is KEY! that will only reflect even more on their products.  It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  From their skin care, to hair care and body Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  Their products are amazing.  Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  I have seen a big difference in the look of my skin and my hair.  Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  I look forward to continue to do business with Insta Natural.  I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product.  This oil is just what your fantasizes about~</li>
    <li> I love this deep conditioner. It smells like orange creamsicles, makes my hair soft and shiny without buildup, and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally dark brown curly hair that I have professionally bleached to a level 10 (platinum blonde) and I blow-dry straight weekly. Even though I take the best care of it that I can, it&#x27;s damaged. Occasionally it starts to feel really gross and heavy, like wet wool, and that&#x27;s when it is time for drastic measures. Recently I started using a protein reconstructor followed by this deep conditioner once a month and the results are incredible. My hair goes from being frizzy, what my husband describes as &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, quick to curl in humidity, unmanageable, and all around gross to being soft, shiny, and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company also sent me a helpful email with some tips on using the product. I will definitely buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> This hair mask has such a great smell - like orange and vanilla. And it works beautifully. It did a great job of conditioning my long hair and keeping the ends looking and feeling soft.</li>
    <li> ONCE A WEEK AFTER SHAMPOO I PUT THIS ARGAN OIL HAIR MASK  AND 20 MIN LATER I WASH IT OFF.  SO GOOD. MY HAIR SOO SOFT. THANKS. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS FREE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Great aragan oil hair mask.  Love using it on my hair.  Makes my hair soft, shiny and healthy.  I recommend it. I use it at least once a week and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have always tried to take really good care of my hair. I have A LOT of it and at times needs so much attention. I am always looking for products that will ensure my hair doesn’t become damaged due to the heat from flat ironing. I love how soft and shiny my hair looks with this,&lt;br /&gt;I received the product I am about to review at no charge. All opinions are 100% my honest feelings regarding the product being reviewed.</li>
    <li> Love this but you only need a small amount did the first treatment for 20 min and wow....hair felt silky smooth....</li>
    <li> A lovely conditioner that smells fantastic.  I have very long color-treated hair that needs a lot of special attention to keep it from breaking. I use this conditioner as a hair mask about once per week when I have extra time.  On other days, I just use it as my regular conditioner.  In the past I&#x27;ve used Biolage products exclusively, but I find that this conditioner penetrates more deeply and adds more shine.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this hair mask! You can also use it daily!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Have to use again soon!</li>
    <li> I tend to have very dry and frizzy hair and no matter how many oils I put on my hair by the end of the day I am having a bad hair day. I only wash my hair twice a week because my hair is so dry so I only use this every other shampooing. It did leave my hair feeling silky smooth and i noticed a big difference in the the frizziness and drynes of my hair. Even after an entire day, my hair still looked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a hair mask for so long. There&#x27;s just so many that whenever I&#x27;d research them I&#x27;d get overwhelmed! I saw this one randomly on Amazon, because I recently touched up my ombre (MORE BLEACH) and just, my hair wasn&#x27;t as strong as it was prior to the ombre, so it scared me a little. Specially since my hair is getting so long! I didn&#x27;t want it to just break back off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this product in my natually curly, wet but not soaking wet hair. And, left it on for 15 min. It hardened so I knew time to rinse!&lt;br /&gt;As I rinsed it out, it really didn&#x27;t feel like anything had changed. It wasn&#x27;t extra silky or any of that. (But I figured it&#x27;s only use one!)&lt;br /&gt;But, then when I went to comb my curls out, it combed so easily. Easier than ever. And, then it was suddenly much softer than it normally is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After blowing it out, also using a beyond the zone blow out heat protection balm, my hair is so much silkier. Softer. Bouncier. I for once don&#x27;t feel like I fried it and like it&#x27;s just going to break off like it normally feels after blowdrying + Flat ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so excited to continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;ve only used it once, I would definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but you do get a good amount! I can see it lasting me for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend trying it with a blow our balm if you&#x27;re blowing out your hair afterwards for that extra protection from breakage. If you&#x27;re looking for a good balm, again I also purchased the Beyond The Zone Blow Out balm. Found it on Amazon too!</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair and I find it difficult to look for a really hydrating conditioner. this mask really does the job. Unlike other conditioners/masks, this one actually makes a difference on the texture of your hair. After using this, when my hair is halfway dry, then I style it with creams/hair styling lotion. I currently use it as an everyday conditioner.</li>
    <li> Noticed a big difference right away. My hair is definitely softer.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair natural and I do not use heat. I did not feel like this product improved the condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> Not for my hear type, did not feels soft after using this, prefer pure organic Argan Oil, not as &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair had become dull and lifeless because of a couple of bad choices I&#x27;d made in the shampoo/conditioner department. I normally have long, thick(ish), shiny, healthy hair which began to look like brittle straw, to the extent my husband noticed and started telling me how my hair looked terrible and not at all like normal (takes a lot for him to notice!)! This hair mask though, made my hair feel so soft, lustrous and thick again, in a relatively short time - I&#x27;d say a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so nice my husband started using it as well (since his hair began looking like hay too with aforesaid bad products) and all was well. Unfortunately, I think he was using it rather liberally (twice as much as I do, twice as often, for hair much shorter) and we ran out of it quicker than I expected. Would definitely buy again though, especially since I&#x27;ve now educated my husband on how much he really needs to use!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews and decided to try this and am glad I did.  I have color-processed hair that can get dry, especially if I use my flat iron a lot.  I use this mostly as a daily conditioner (but I wash my hair every 2-4 days, and in between I use a dry shampoo), and my hair is less frizzly and feels softer after I use it.  After I run out I plan on buying another jar.  The smell is fine, sort of a neutral nutty smell, but not overpowering or chemical-smelling.</li>
    <li> I have super curly and frizzy hair.  I love this.  I have gone from using multiple products with chemicals to using ONLY this oil!</li>
    <li> So awesome, I had to bring my fellow co-worker a small sample to try!! &amp;#60;3 it!</li>
    <li> I have coarse thick red hair.....this product smells fabulous and after only a few uses, my hair is smoother and softer!</li>
    <li> Product made my hair feel heavy and greasy and definitely didn&#x27;t make it softer. It was actually harder to manage and I had to rewash my hair again and apply another deep conditioner. I was VERY disappointed with the product. This argan oil is a MUCH better product: Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner By Arvazallia for Dry or Damaged Hair.</li>
    <li> Really not sure how this product got so many good review. I have dry hair and this hair mask is so noneffective. I used it several times, thinking it would get better, but nope. really disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff...Use it every time I wash my hair...and noticed a difference!!! Seems as though my hair is growing, and long hair and I are buddies!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending money to make sure my hair looks great. My hair is red and a bit frizzy but I used great products to cut down on the frizz and to keep my hair shiny and healthy.  I&#x27;m a loyal &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; deep conditioner user, but I felt that you&#x27;re really should switch things up at times and try other products to prevent build up.  So I did some research, saw the great reviews on this argan oil, and purchased it to replace my &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34;.  But I really don&#x27;t like it.  Now for the record, I was trying to use this as a daily conditioner (the label says that you can do that).  When I used it, my hair was tangled and dirty (it had been a couple of days since I washed it).  Normally with my other conditioner, I can immediately get a comb through my hair after rinsing.  With this product my hair was still completely tangled.  It failed my rinse test and I&#x27;m going to return it.  There are so many good reviews on this, but it did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> I usually make my own hair mask but I decided to try this and I love it.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look as dry and frizzy as it was.  This works really well for curly hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ve used this product twice and it has left my hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I have a head of super thick dry as the desert sun hair. I am usually skeptical when it comes to trying different hair treatments because they rarely work. I have got to say this hair mask works magic. It was super easy to use, and smells amazing. Almost a vanilla scent. I put a turbie towel around my head and used my hair dryer to warm my hair all up and went about my business for about 15-20 minutes. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was when i got out of the shower. My hair brush just went right through it, so it also de-tangled it really well. My boyfriend keeps sniffing my head and playing with my hair, not to mention it looks super classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> Love the product but don&#x27;t use too much to avoid oily/greasy looking hair.</li>
    <li> No noticeable change in hair moisture.</li>
    <li> Bought this some months ago and came back to review because it deserves it, even thought it doesn&#x27;t really need it as much because it has too many 5 star reviews. Let me tell you this, I&#x27;m the type of people that really analyzes the products that is going to buy, I look everywhere for prices and reviews of people to give me an idea if it truly works. I can honestly say I bought this because of that : the reviews and I&#x27;m glad to say now that they aren&#x27;t wrong. Aside from the fact that this has mainly natural ingredients, it works! with other products I&#x27;ve felt that the results I were getting were just temporary and by that I mean a few hours. Of course no product is literally permanent, but this I have felt that my hair in fact has improve the texture with time.My hair is dyed and also has highlights which means death to your hair if your don&#x27;t use the appropriate treatments, and so far I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference since I bought this, my hair is silky and smooth even the days I forget to put it on, definitely worth every penny and I&#x27;ll stop buying other similar products to try on because this is the one :) .</li>
    <li> OMG I absolutely LOVE this product!!  I use it on both my and my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It smells great and leaves our hair so smooth.  My daughter has curly hair and brushing it often leaves us both in tears but not anymore - this has really made her hair manageable.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get it. This product made my hair dry, and it does not de-tangle afro hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this as a mask and as daily shampoo. It leaves my hair extremely soft and frizz-free. It is fabulous and I love it! It is great on the budget too, as I will no longer have to pay for a deep conditioner at the salon.</li>
    <li> This is my first not so great InstaNatural experience :-( I wanted to love it because of all the great ingredients and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural without questionable additives, however it did a poor job conditioning my hair. My hair felt unmanageable after I washed the mask out, not silky and smooth like it does with my normal conditioners. I had to use a lot of hair serum and spray on de-tangler just to be able to comb my hair afterwards without causing breakage, and when my hair dried it appeared frizzy and dry. Only positive for me was the pleasant orange creamsicle scent.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job conditioning and moisturizing my hair.  It left it feeling very smooth.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell of this. Smells almost like almond oil.  Added moisture to my hair, but did have to stay in my for awhile before I washed it out, so if you are in a hurry, this might not be the best choice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t take the time to use hair conditioners as I should, but then I try something like this and wonder why not? It really made my hair feel terrific, soft and shiny and in much better shape. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Got a rash on my face the first time I used it as conditioner in the shower</li>
    <li> This product can be used not only as a hair mask, but as a daily conditioner. It has an amazing vanilla-orange (creamsicle) scent that I really enjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this product, I used it as a simple conditioner, which only requires 1-2 minutes of wait time before rinsing. Unfortunately, I found that after rinsing and towel-drying my hair, it was tangled and even a bit greasy-feeling, which I was not fond of at all. Once I brushed out my hair and it was fully dry, I did notice my hair has a nice shine to it and felt softer, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to go through the tangled, greasy mess in order to get those results.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use it as intended a few days later: as a hair mask. I applied it to towel-dried hair and ran my fingers through to make sure it was covering all the strands. I left it on for about 15 minutes before rinsing it out very well this time, as I was trying to avoid that greasy-feel.&lt;br /&gt;Yet again, my hair was tangled and difficult to brush out. I rinsed very well this time, so I do feel like the greasiness subsided quite a bit. I had the same sort of results using it as a mask, although I do feel like my hair was significantly softer and more manageable once fully dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I think is going on here: I have very thin, color treated hair. It doesn&#x27;t take much to make my hair greasy. I think this product is best used for thick, long, damaged hair, or some combination of those. While my hair is very thin, it&#x27;s not very dry or damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Hair Treatment&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t always mean &amp;#34;very good conditioner&amp;#34; as many of us like to think. So I decided to give this product one more try, except with my roommates hair. He has thick, damaged hair. I also explained to him that we were going to use it a bit differently.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to have him wash his hair, put in the treatment and wait 15 minutes, then rinse. Then instead of that being it, I had him re-shampoo his hair, and then use a little bit of his regular conditioner and rinse as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was that this product really should be used as a treatment, and not a conditioner. It absolutely works wonders (and did for my roommate) in regards to making your hair look visibly healthier, softer and shinier. However it doesn&#x27;t detangle like a typical conditioner, and it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean out of the hair like one. While the company does say it can be used as such, I would definitely not recommend it. This works beautifully for severely dry, damaged hair treatment-wise. Just make sure to cleanse and condition as normal after use.ditioner and rinse as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was that this product really should be used as a treatment, and not a conditioner.

    <li> Smells good, an works pretty well, just not as long lasting as I would like.</li>
    <li> Made my hair smooth and frizz free when used as conditioner.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Good smell and really made my hair feel good.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for hair products that can help nourish and clean my hair as I suffer from thinning hair. Argan Oil hair mask from InstaNatural has all natural and organic ingredients that are good for hair. The addition of Amino Acid complex, coconut oil, shea butter, Vitamin B5, Jojoba oil and avocado oil makes this product superior to all other hair treatments. My hair is oily but scalp is very dry. I used this treatment mask as directed and left it for fifteen minutes. I put on a shower cap to trap the body heat and make the mask more effective. Washed my hair with shampoo and let it air dry. My hair felt conditioned and hydrated. No dry scalp. I have used the treatment a few times and I can see that my hair is healthier and soft. It also seems to strengthen the hair with the Amino Acids and Vitamin B5.&lt;br /&gt;I don’t blow dry or use any styling gels on my hair, although it claims that it protects hair from damage caused by these. With a big 8 oz. jar it is going to last for a while.</li>
    <li> I love anything that helps my dry, damaged hair, and this argan oil hair mask is wonderful! I used it last night, and let it soak in for 10 minutes. I dye my hair blonde so it&#x27;s very dry, and when I first applied the hair mask, my hair was still very dry, but after 10 minutes with the hair mask on, my hair was happy and moisturized again! The smell is really nice - kind of sweet smelling. Now whenever I take a bath, I&#x27;ll need my candles and this amazing mask to soak in my hair while I soak in the tub :)</li>
    <li> To start off, I have really dry, frizzy wavy hair that&#x27;s been relaxed a couple years ago and is a huge drag to keep healthy when I heat style it. I have tried a ton of brands drugstore to salon to organic and the only one I really liked until now was the Macadamia Oil mask, which I then found out had tons of silicones and chemicals that just coat your hair temporarily to make it feel healthy (which was very true), and switched to organic masks. None ever softened my hair enough, even really expensive ones and even when I cut back on heat styling. When I got this mask I was skeptical of whether it would really soften my hair, but I WAS SO PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! After 5-10 minutes in the shower, my hair felt like silk when I washed it out! After a month of use, my hair is a lot softer and shinier, and I&#x27;ve been able to do heatless hairstyles without it being a frizzy mess! The ingredients are so pure, nothing hidden that&#x27;s damaging to your hair, and it smells so good, almost almondy-floral and when I hug people they always comment that my hair smells nice. If you are even the least bit skeptical, please try it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, first use I noticed a huge difference in my hair.  A lot less frizz and more manageable!  Thanks for this great Argan Oil Hair Mask!</li>
    <li> I love it my hair is shine and softer</li>
    <li> Made my hair really greasy It doesn&#x27;t smell very good. &amp; It doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I love this so far. It really seems to be working on my bleached hair. My hair feels Wonderful after using this.</li>
    <li> Very nice treatment.  My hair was badly damaged from a year&#x27;s worth of mistreatment.  Two uses of this line of products &amp; it looks better than it has in a decade!</li>
    <li> This mask is great. Leaves my hair much softer and smoother.  Works well as a conditioner too, when you don&#x27;t have time to do the mask!</li>
    <li> I have such dry course hair and the Argan Oil Hair Mask brought it right back to healthy life! So pleased with this product. I got this product for review.</li>
    <li> Love it...the only conditioner I&#x27;ve found lately that actually does anything for my naturally dry wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel!  I have tons of hair that requires a lot of shampoo and conditioner,  do I am not always using the best quality products,  since they can be expensive...  But this treatment seemed to repair my hair and made it shinier.  Feels much healthier.</li>
    <li> I am 55 years old. have always had a bad birds nest in my hair every morning when I wake up. Have tried 100&#x27;s of product at any price over 30 years  to get smooth hair. Even very expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;But this one is a FANTASTIC product. No birds nest.&lt;br /&gt;It said to wash and towel dry hair and leave product on for about 20 minutes. But knowing my hair needs extra help, I did my ironing and left it on for two hours before rinsing off. My hair was still slightly damp when I went to bed, so I thought any chance of this product working I had wrecked because of my hair not being dry.&lt;br /&gt;To my amazement my hair in the morning was smooth and soft as if I had just come back from the hairdresser after a blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Love!!! This made my hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> love love love this hair mask.  smells amazing and makes my hair feel like i&#x27;ve never used any harsh chemicals on it.  awesome awesome stuff</li>
    <li> I am using this once a week to give my hair a deep conditioning treatment. I color my hair, and with more greys popping up, the texture of my hair overall is changing. I think this leaves my hair very soft and shiny. It feels nourished, which is what I wanted. It also has a nice orange and vanilla scent to it, very light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Love it, my hair is very dry,kurly oh god my hai&lt;br /&gt;r just loved.it.thanks Amazon give u 10</li>
    <li> Worked fine, but has an odd smell to it. But all in all a really good product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Does wonders on my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is oily after :(</li>
    <li> I got this to replace another argan oil mask I loved that was out of stock .  This works fine for a normal, everyday conditioner, but I have not experienced any &amp;#34;deep conditioning&amp;#34; benefits.  I find it only so-so.  My hair is very straight and fine, but I have plenty of it and it is tangly (color-treated).  This conditioner did not help smooth or detangle my hair at all.  The fragrance is pleasant, but very strong and does not fade over the day.  In fact, I can still smell it for a couple of days after using it, even when shampooing and conditioning with other products each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this other argan oil conditioner which is now available again (yay!) - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KOKS2NI.  It works great as both a deep or regular conditioner.  Leaves hair smooth, silky and shiny, no greasy buildup (my hair gets greasy really easy), and a lot less tangly.</li>
    <li> The reason I purchased the argan oil is because one of the reviews said not only does it work well but it smells good, well, it doesn&#x27;t but my hair appears to be soft ---- unsure if it&#x27;s working or changing the texture of my hair, feels the same --- I&#x27;m not impressed..</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling very dry and brisky after i rinsed it out</li>
    <li> Fast shipping - so far good product</li>
    <li> Love the product. Noticeable change in hair already.</li>
    <li> This hair mask is great and well worth the price. I use it a couple of times a week and find it makes my hair softer and more manageable as hair is heavily processed. Just need a little bit and only have to leave on about ten minutes for it to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived early and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller follows up as to any questions, etc.</li>
    <li> I use this mask once a week and I can tell my hair feels softer and healthier. It has a nice sweet bubblegum smell and I can put as much as I want on my hair and it never felt greasy. It washes off easy for me and afterwards my hair feels brand new.</li>
    <li> My hair is like dry straw straight out of the farmer&#x27;s field without some kind of intervention.  I have used argan oil straight...and loved it...but I wanted to try this mask for deep conditioning.  I am VERY pleased with this product.  I would recommend it to others who need more moisture in their hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders definitely worth the buy!!!</li>
    <li> This is a must have for those with dry hair!!  I use it as a deep conditioner and as a leave in.  It leaves my hair soft!!</li>
    <li> While this product may work well for other people, it did not work for my hair at all. My hair became very tangly and dull after use.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  Leaves hair silky and manages frizzies.</li>
    <li> I use this product at least once per week on my curly hair and my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair. I usually leave it on for 15-30 minutes and then rinse. It has a wonderful citrus scent and leaves our hair soft and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the hair mask, InstaNatural personally emailed me to follow-up with my satisfaction. Excellent customer service can be rare these days - I&#x27;m happy to have found a wonderful product offered by a company that genuinely cares about its customers.</li>
    <li> My poor hair has been so dry from this crazy weather nothing was working this past week it went from super oily to so dry that even my psoriasis on my scalp was driving me crazy! I couldn&#x27;t stop itching my hair looked like straw i was just about to say the heck with it and soak my head in oil when this came in today thank Goodness! i put it on my damp hair my hair is so soft right now its like spun silk! its never been like that before ever ever ever!!! I am so excited that this finally i found a product that has everything i need in one without me having to mix it myself every time i say i need something with ingredient it seems this company is right on top of it i&#x27;m so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Swimming is one of my favorite things during the summertime. Cold, still, bottle-green lakes with tiny minnows flitting by. The crashing freezing shower of woodland waterfalls. The deep tamed blue and cool tiles of manmade pools. The wild unfettered sluice of salt air, sand and waves found only at the ocean. All of these call to me and restore my soul, but my hair has a different opinion. My hair wants to know what it did to deserve such torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I gave a little sigh of relief the very first time I tried this Argan Oil Hair Mask. I&#x27;ve reviewed and come to love some other products containing argan oil, mostly for the skin. It really is quite unlike any other single ingredient I&#x27;ve come across in its ability to smooth and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask has a light, pleasant smell, not overpowering or cloying. It&#x27;s thick, rich and creamy to the touch and just glides onto the damp strands of your hair. After each treatment my hair was visibly shinier, smoother and healthier-looking. I feel even just a few treatments repaired a whole summer&#x27;s worth of damage and had my hair looking amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the ingredients, it contains a whole list of wonderful restorative items, including Japanese Green Tea, Amino Acid Complex, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil &amp; Vitamin B5, along with many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m basically in love with this treatment at this point. I really can&#x27;t say enough nice things about it!</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant. It&#x27;s easily washed off.</li>
    <li> Works great. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I never used a hair mask before so had no idea of what to expect. It was for my daughter&#x27;s VERY HARD to manage hair. The product went on easily, smelled great, and washed out without any residue. It left my daughter&#x27;s hair feeling rejuvenated, springy, and healthy. I would recommend this product with either damaged or healthy hair!</li>
    <li> My hair feels silky and shiny. Definitely buying it again.</li>
    <li> I have type B and C natural hair. This product completely detangled my hair as soon as I applied it to my wet hair. My hair felt very soft and manageable. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is curly and tough to control when it is long. She has it professionally straightened and fixed. It costs her a ton of money.  The problem is it doesn&#x27;t stay straight long enough. She used the Argan Oil Hair Mask and it keeps her hair looking good. It gives her hair moisture that it needs to keep it a bit more straight than usual. She likes how it makes her hair look healthier. I think it is a great investment, compared to all the money she spends in the beauty shop. Now her hair is softer and much easier to control. She loves this stuff. This product was given to us to review, but my wife is happy she got to try it. It is a great product that really improves how her hair looks and feels.</li>
    <li> Application: This hair mask comes in a tub, so you have to scoop the product out with your fingers.  It kind of looks and feels like vanilla pudding with a thick consistency, and the smell reminded me of vanilla pudding mixed with orange dreamsicle. I used this product in the shower, applying immediately after wetting my hair and pinning it up for the duration of my shower and rinsing it out at the end.  After my shower, my hair did feel smoother and it wasn&#x27;t as greasy-feeling as it can be after using some other hair mask treatments. However, it did seem to get oily faster than it would have if I had just used normal shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: This is a good deep conditioner to have on hand and leaves my hair less greasy than other hair masks I&#x27;ve used. I would like to try leaving it in even longer to get some added nourishment to my dry hair ends. My biggest complaint would be the tub itself. I only have a stand-up shower, and the tub just doesn&#x27;t fit as neatly as the other taller products, but that is definitely a very specific issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
    <li> Since my hair is long I decided to use Argan Oil Hair Mask as a leave in treatment. My hair could use all conditioning it can get. Results: I absolutely love this product not only did it make my hair smooth and shiny,it also made it soft. Also the fragrance smells like cocoa butter. One day my sister came over and I had my hair down (normally i&#x27;ll have it in ponytail/bob) she like somethings different. Did you do something to your hair?  It looks more bouncy and got more ummfff to it. I told her that I&#x27;m testing this product for Tomoson to Review Intsa Natural Argan Oil Hair Mask. She&#x27;s like hook me up sister. Needless to say she had to test out my Insta Natural Hair Mask. She better be glad she my sister and I love her....lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this Argan Oil Hair Mask and so glad it came in such a generous size.  Being an older lady now with finer texture and thinner hair, I&#x27;m delighted that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  After washing my hair and towel drying it a little, I use a small amount as a conditioner and rinse it out several minutes later as I finish showering.  It leaves my hair easy to comb through and moisturized, but not oily at all.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair more soft and manageable; limiting breakage</li>
    <li> This mask is simply amazing. I have bleged my hair recently and it was damaged. I bought this product to try on my hair. It&#x27;s been already 2 weeks since i used it. I like the product so far. I use it both as a conditioner and mask. My hair became healthier and smoother.</li>
    <li> not sure if I felt any difference but it&#x27;s thick and smells ok. i don&#x27;t think my hair has really changed from using it though.</li>
    <li> I really love InstaNatual products, I actually use about five or six of them from this Argan Oil Hair Mask to their Vitamin C Serum. This summer has really taken a toll on my hair. It has been dry and tough and I have been dealing with a large amount of hair loss as well. I have used Argan Oil in the past and really liked the results, but only one other time a dedicated hair treatment. I started using this hair treatment and started seeing immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally used this hair treatment as a deep moisturizing hair mask. I just put a generous amount of it in my hair and wrapped it in a towel to keep it from running and left it in my hair for fifteen minutes. Once the fifteen minutes were up I showered as usual and washed and rinsed my hair skipping conditioner since with this product its really unnecessary. I then went on to dry my hair and it came out looking soft and smooth. It was frizz free and easy to manage all the way until the next wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started using this treatment later as a simple hair treatment. I just added a little to the tips of my hair after I shampooed then dried my hair as normal and it has kept split ends and frizz at bat in between hair treatments. As a result of using this hair treatment, I have seen where I have less hair falling out, my dry scalp is now hydrated and healthy, I have to condition less because my hair is more naturally hydrated, and my hair is consistently soft and smooth looking. If you want to pamper your hair affordably and get great results, Insta Naturals Argan Hair treatment is just what your hair is ordering.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair mask I&#x27;ve tried! I love that the Instanatural Argan Oil Hair Mask makes my hair feel soft, and provides my hair with a lot of shine! I used the InstaNatural Argan Oil hair mask as a deep conditioning mask, and as a regular conditioner. My hair is easier to manage, and looks healthier than before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask for reviewing purposes. However, all the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, it has worked tremendously on our hair.</li>
    <li> I mostly apply conditioner after shampooing hair. You can consider this hair mask mostly as a conditioner. It comes in a plastic jar containing 240 ml . This is having thick cream like consistency and not like oil.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply. I mostly use it a conditioner i.e after doing shampoo, I take little amount of this cream and spread it on my hair. I only wait for 5-7 mins and then wash with water.&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t produce any lather, it is having consistency like cream and is not very oily. I checked my bathtub and bathtub was not slippery after its usage. It is light brown in color and has strong smell. I couldn&#x27;t describe it&#x27;s smell but it smells little strong.&lt;br /&gt;When ever I apply this product it makes my hair soft and smooth. I could feel the difference easily. Also, I noticed that I was able to comb my hair easily. It reduced hair combing time by at least 50%.&lt;br /&gt;In short, I liked this product. I am using it as a daily conditioner. It keeps my hair soft and silky. You can try it for preventing dry hair problem, it hydrates hair really well. Only feedback or suggestion that I would like to give is to make it smell like some flower. Currently it has some wild woody smell. If it can be changed to some good flowery smell then I would really love that.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer- I received Argan Oil Hair mask for review purpose, I am sharing my honest opinion here and not influenced by anyone.</li>
    <li> If I could give this 10 stars I totally would! I love this product and will continue to use this forever! I was given the chance to review this on my blog for testing purposes and I am so glad I did! I first use InstaNatural Argan Oil on my dry hair and let it sit then rinse, then I shampoo and then I use InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask. I always leave it in for about 10-15 mins while i do everything else I need to do in the shower. This has a wonderful Orange Creamsicle smell to it, and I find my husband coming to my hair and just sniffing it every so often lol! It does smell really good and leaves my hair so soft and so healthy!! It is amazing and if you have always wanted to try a hair mask and didn&#x27;t know which one to pick, look no further than InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask! You will not regret it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian, but I don&#x27;t have the straight, black, glossy Asian hair that you would expect. My hair is wavy, brown, and dry at the ends. It splits really easily and doesn&#x27;t keep moisture sealed in well. I chose this product over other argan oil hair masks because this one listed the ingredients, and all of them were organic or beneficial oils. There is amino acid complexes, green tea extract, jojoba oil, and more, all good things for your hair! When I got this, I was so excited to use it. It comes in a huge tub and smells really good and natural (kind of like toasted marshmallows, as another reviewer mentioned). I left it in as a mask for 15 minutes and my hair definitely felt more moisturized. I mostly use it towards the middle of my hair towards the ends since my hair is dryer there. I also tried using it as a standard conditioner, and that also works if you don&#x27;t have time to wait 15 minutes and then wash it off, or if it&#x27;s inconvenient for you (I live in a dorm so I share a communal bathroom). I normally put the argan oil conditioner on first, and then use my DevaCurl shampoo for the top of my hair so that I can leave the conditioner on longer. However, experiment with what&#x27;s best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a holy grail for your hair, seriously! My hair is so soft and moisturized, and has actually straightened out a bit (probably because the oils are heavier hair). It will NOT fix your dead or split ends (as those are already a lost cause), but it does fix the rest of your dry, straggly hair. Don&#x27;t go with products that aren&#x27;t transparent with their ingredients. I am very wary of chemical ingredients as they are generally not good for your hair or skin.</li>
    <li> This hair mask has a VERY strong smell of bubblegum which can be a bit nauseating. It left my hair a little greasy even after shampooing more than a few times. Once it finally came out, my hair was quite soft. This hair mask has a VERY strong smell of bubblegum which can be a bit nauseating. It left my hair super greasy even after shampooing more than a few times. Once it finally came out, my hair was quite soft.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews I expected something amazing. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair.  Actually, most of my conditioners work much better than this. My hair wasn&#x27;t smooth and shiny afterwards (like it is when I use other saloon quality products).  It was a little heavy and tangled after using this product. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.  I use other conditioners that are much less expensive and work much better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask...I have a lot of high end expensive masks, but this one surpasses! I will definitely buy again!!! and try other products from instanatural You have to try it!!!</li>
    <li> I tend to have very dry hair if I don&#x27;t add some form of moisture daily to my hair. Being African American and having three (3) children, it gets very tedious trying to deal with moisturizing my hair every day. So when I got the opportunity to review this hair mask, after hearing so much positive things about argan oil, I decided to give it a try. I was very sceptical though as to whether or not it would actually do anything for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided that I would give it about 2 weeks to see if there would be a difference in my hair&#x27;s texture and moisture. I didn&#x27;t even need to wait that long; after a week my hair was much softer, voluminous, and had body again without feeling heavy and weighed-down. After 2 weeks, I didn&#x27;t need to apply anything to my hair for at least 2 or 3 days. Needless to say, I am in love with this mask for myself. I will purchase another jar for my daughter&#x27;s hair since her hair needs moisture even more than mine does. I will update the post with the results of my daughter&#x27;s experience.</li>
    <li> I am always doing stupid impulsive things to my hair and this stuff has saved my fried booty time and time again. Love it. A little goes a LONG way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more than what I expected&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair softer and more healthy event bough I got many chemicals on my hair so it highly meets my satisfaction and expectation&lt;br /&gt;I recommend many of my friends to try it and they are trying to purchase it these days</li>
    <li> awesome moisturizer.  Great for dry hair</li>
    <li> This product has really helped my daughter with her thin hair. I have found her hair much thicker and even more manageable with this product. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The product works great. I have platinum blonde hair &amp;#60;dyed&amp;#62; so it is a good product for keeping that moisture locked in. I definitely recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service, even got an email to see if I liked the product! I do, smells great, seems to be making my swimmers hair softer and more manageable</li>
    <li> I have used the product since receiving it in the mail (very prompt delivery by the way) and am really amazed at the difference in my hair.  I have always had problem hair – very thick and curly and frizzy.  I am now 65 years old with shoulder length hair.  My hair had become very brittle, I wore it tied up all the time because of this and was considering getting a short cut.  I’ve tried countless products but nothing worked until InstaNatural Argon Oil.  My hair is now soft with none of the frizziness and I am wearing it down again and getting compliments from everyone.  I have let me sister use it and she also loves it.  I will definitely be ordering again.  It is so refreshing to get a product that actually lives up to the hype.</li>
    <li> With dry winter air here in New England, my hair needs some regular TLC. After receiving this mask for review, I’m happy to report that this is one hair mask worth your hard-earned dollars. I love my InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask because of the natural and organic ingredients, pleasant, spa-like scent (I kept smelling my hair all day!), and thick texture – not just regular conditioner in a fancy container.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this mask – my hair felt so soft after use.</li>
    <li> love this product so much that I&#x27;m getting one for each of my duaghter</li>
    <li> Raise your hand if you have over-processed hair? Me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I try to keep my hair as healthy as possible, the reality is that blow drying and flat ironing has become such a norm in my grooming process because it’s fast and convenient. We can’t always let our hair dry naturally since I’m always on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why I love deep conditioner and treatments. It’s almost like a day of indulgence to let it sit in my hair and do its magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is one of the latest, I guess you would call ‘crazes’ for hair treatment though it’s been around for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m very happy to say that it is really a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s start with the smell. It smells so incredibly good. I had to resist the urge to taste it. I think maybe it’s the coconut though I’m not really sure but, I have gotten a lot of compliments on not only how good my hair looks but, how great it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair as usual and dried it and applied the mask while my hair was still damp, let it sit for about 10 minutes and then rinsed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t add any other treatments or creams into my hair before using the blowdryer because I wanted to see how it would look with just the Insta Natural Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so soft and shiny. I didn’t even need to use a flat iron afterwards. It looked so nice. I read the description just now and one of the claims is that it will leave your hair ‘soft &amp; shiny’. They get an A+ from me on that because I’m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like this hair mask. It doesn’t feel heavy like other deep conditioners. It goes on very light. I’m tempted to just leave it in and let my hair dry naturally with it on but, for the purpose of this review, I wanted to use it exactly as recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good ingredients, lasting results, reasonable price, smells lovely.  I have bought so many deep conditioner hair products that said they would give results, but none delivered until this product.  I used this before my hair appt and very little needed to be trimmed off ;)</li>
    <li> Use Everytime I wash my Hair, Smoothier and not as Frizzy.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and my hair is super soft and easy to manage. I have thick course hair. I leave it on about 10 minutes every day while I shave. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 day now and my hair is not heavy or greasy. This stuff is amazing for thick course hair.</li>
    <li> Been using this product once biweekly for about a month now and I love it! I have thick &amp;#34;4c&amp;#34; hair and it penetrates my hair, rather than just sitting on top! Leaves my hair soft and easier to detangle! Definitely recommend this one. A little goes a long way and when you pair it with a steam treatment - divine!!!!</li>
    <li> This is THE best deep conditioning treatment available! Love that it&#x27;s natural and loaded with Argan Oil. The scent is a toasted sugar note, which lingers on your hair. My thick, color treated, dry hair responds really well to the mask. It&#x27;s soft, not frizzy, smooth and bouncy after I use it. I use it 1-2 times per week. Does not weigh my heavy hair down at all!</li>
    <li> leaves hair silky smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male in his 50s with semi-long hair and the lovely &amp;#34;oily scalp/straw ends&amp;#34; type of hair. Up here in the colorado mountains there is no humidity so my hair takes a beating. This is the first product I have tried that pretty much eliminates the damaged dry ends. Like so many others have mentioned, be careful how much you apply, a little goes a long way. Hard to imagine but if you put too much oil on your hair it might start to feel oily-go figure! The smell is also pleasant and not perfumey which is helpful. My wife who has hair down to her butt has really noticed an improvement in the health of her hair as well.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable. Great for processed hair.</li>
    <li> This mask smells awesome but it left my hair dull after the first wash next wash my hair looked noticeably shinny and healthy. I spend a lot of time in a pool during the summer so i think it will help with the damage of the sun and chemicals. this product was offered to me free to give a honest opinion. I will try this again when my hair needs it most. but for now i was not over impressed with results.</li>
    <li> Made my color treated hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the root beer scent. You can&#x27;t go wrong with that! It smells so good! I use this daily, or every other day, in addition to my regular conditioning treatment to help add extra moisture. My hair gets particularly dry, especially during the winter, and this hair mask is all I need for smooth, shiny and healthy locks.</li>
    <li> Have only used this once but loved the way my hair looked.  Made my locks very silky and soft.</li>
    <li> Sealed well;no spillage</li>
    <li> Product works well with my hair, making it less frizzy when used once a week. The only thing is I wish it didn&#x27;t smell so bad! If it smelled better I would buy it by the case!</li>
    <li> &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPb31ecedb5cc200615fa5cf28e624c263\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    I love this product so much, it smells absolutely great like it doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell or anything. I leave it in my hair with a cap over it for about 45-1hr to get the best performance my hair is so hydrated afterwards. I have really curly hair and it&#x27;s hard to keep it moisturized but this gets the job done, if it works on my hair I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good for all hair types. Also it helps if I run the blow dryer around my whole head about 5 times to open the hair follicle.      I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMb31ecedb5cc200615fa5cf28e624c263\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil hair mask does miracles to my hair. It moisturizes my hair and enhance my curl pattern. Better yet it smells GREAT!!!!  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Also the customer service was beautiful. I will densely recommend Instanatural products.</li>
    <li> Insta Natural sent me this product to try out. I have very long hair and it is ombre so hair masks tend to be my best friend. This one in particular made my hair feel amazingly soft and luscious, it got rid of all of my horrible tangles. I don&#x27;t really care for the scent but the product itself it amazing and honestly that&#x27;s all that really matters. Right?! If you have difficult to manage hair and are in the market for a new hair mask try it out for sure!</li>
    <li> Second time ordering this product. I have THICK, color treated hair, that gets blow-dried and straightened weekly. This product has helped tame the mane! Smells great too. I used it every time I shampoo. Would love to purchase in a larger tub!</li>
    <li> I have severely damaged hair from dying and bleaching .... Really does the job. And knowing that&#x27;s it&#x27;s all organic and I&#x27;ve used other natural products that don&#x27;t do anything. Will be buying again along with the shampoo. :))))))</li>
    <li> This luxurious mask smells ah-mazing. It kept my hair smooth and frizz-free, even in Florida&#x27;s humidity.</li>
    <li> Use it and blow/air drying my hair. I can use a difference in my hair texture. My hair was not hard and dry feeling, I felt very moisturized. The smell of the product is great to. It reminds me oThis was a Argan oil product. i&#x27;m very pleased to say i am very happy with this conditioner.f a lemon meringue pie.</li>
    <li> Very good deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> This really helps my hair curl up.  Unfortunately I dropped it the first time I used is... so lost a portion of the hair mask.  Will probably purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products from InstaNatural and have been pleased with them all, but the Argan Oil Hair Mask is my absolute favorite! I&#x27;ve been using it as part of a weekly “spa day” at home and have seen a great change in my hair. It’s softer and shinier, with less flyaways. Split ends are definitely less noticeable and my hair, which is over-processed, colored, straightened (and basically tortured!), just feels better. Especially in the winter when my hair is oh-so-dry from forced hot air heat, it&#x27;s made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, at only $17.95, I think it&#x27;s a real bargain. Used weekly, a jar lasts me about 6 weeks. I have very long hair, so it would last most people much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I LOVE that it&#x27;s Made in the USA and has no animal testing!</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve used much better products for my hair, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair&#x27;s condition</li>
    <li> I like this product with first use found my natural hair to be more manageable.  I hoping with continued long time use results will be even be better.  Goes on easy, not greasy, light scent, if company makes a leave in form would purchase. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used Argon oil products in the past and I have to say I was very disappointed with this mask. First of all it took quite a bit more than the directions say to use to cover my hair and while I do have somewhat long hair, I also have fine, layered hair so there is not a lot of it. I keep it this way to keep the weight of it down. The directions in my opinion were misleading. Then despite repeated rinsing and even rewashing, my hair which is normally very dry was left quite oily. Not conditioned or revitalized, but just oily and honestly it looked as though I had not washed it for a couple weeks. Now I know this sounds like I just used too much, but that is not the case. I am not new to hair masks. I will admit my hair is difficult to treat and I do have medical conditions that have a direct affect on my hair, but to go from dry, broken and brittle to so oily that it took 4 washings before my hair started to look as though I wash it on a consistent basis is more than just a little issue. I left the product in for 10 minutes. I did try is a second time because I agreed to give this product a fair review and I wanted to make sure that the first experience was not something I did wrong. The second time I tried the product I did use less just in case and I left in on for 5 minutes because the instructions say 5 to 15 minutes. Unfortunately my second experience was just as bad as my first. I will say my hair was no longer dry, but I can&#x27;t say that oily is a better look than dry. I can&#x27;t say it repaired any damage or gave it a healthy shine and I absolutely did not experience more volume. I am really disappointed because I love argon oil and was hopeful for an argon oil mask... Unfortunately I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this hair treatment, I could tell the difference after the first time I used it. It also smells great!!!</li>
    <li> I have never liked a hair mask as much as this one. The results are amazing. I have really dry curly hair, but after using this product it has left them very soft and bouncy.</li>
    <li> The price of the product is amazing for what it does!  I have bleached hair and it helps IMMEDIATLY after first use to give it a more nourished and healthy look!  I used this, and then as I was heat styling, I used their Argan oil....the curls lasted until the next morning!  LOVE IT!  I try to sray on point with my monthly allotted beauty budget and this is incredible!  Try it!</li>
    <li> A very effective hair mask. It works.</li>
    <li> This hair mask smells so good. It leave my hair feeling smooth as silk. Love it</li>
    <li> This Argon Oil is a great product if you are seeking silkier, shinier hair. It has a great smell and a little bit sure goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now but it doesn&#x27;t take you that long to feel the results. The moment you are done with you bath and your hair is dry, you can feel a difference. Really enjoyed trying this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is extra temperamental because of the lack of humidity out here in TX. I use all kinds of oils and sprays to keep it looking hydrated but the minute I step out the door...it starts looking dry again. This Argan Oil Hair Mask has been a big help to me as it hydrates my difficult hair. I use a little bit of it as a conditioner every time I wash my hair and so far, I am very pleased with the results! Two thumps up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

    <li> First, I love this sweet smell of this hair mask. It was applied very easily on my cleaned hair. In fact, it works as a dangler, having thick natural hair, I didn&#x27;t need to use a comb, just my fingers! It was rinsed off very easily too without any residue. Great product!</li>
    <li> so i got this hair mask in the mail a few weeks ago.  i held on to it until i felt i could really tell how well it worked.  some friends of mine and i went to the beach labor day weekend, just for the day.  you know how sun and sand and salt water can be–by the end of the day, my hair was the consistency of straw.  i figured that that would be the perfect time to try out this hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i washed and conditioned my hair as normal, and then cracked this baby open.  first of all–holy heck, does this stuff smell amazing!!!  i can’t pinpoint the smell.  there’s ginger, orange, vanilla, i swear coconut…it smells delicious.  so i coated my hair pretty thickly with this stuff–i used maybe a sixth of the jar.  the directions say you can leave it on for 5-15 minutes.  i chose to go the 15 just because of how freaking dry my hair was.  after the requisite 15 minutes i hopped back in the shower and rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here are some things i noticed:  firstly, it rinses very easily.  you know how some masks it feels like you have to scrub to get them out? this one rinses out cleanly and smoothly.  secondly, the delicious smell lingers.  it wasn’t washed out with the conditioner–my hair smelled delicious for days afterwards.  thirdly, it really works!  my hair felt seriously silky, frizz was tamed, and it smelled amazing.  no trace of dry beach hair to be found!  the jar says that it’s gentle enough to use as an everyday conditioner, but i prefer to use it about once a week, as a treat to my hair.</li>
    <li> I did not experience what the best reviews are saying - does not help at all to brush your hair, does not smell specifically good even when I leave it for 30 min :(</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference after two uses...my hair is healthier and more hydrated. I still have split ends but hopefully after a few weeks they will decrease.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I bought it when my niece told me about Argan Oil being a new great thing I had never heard of as I need hydration for my skin and hair during the brutal Maine winters.  I also color my hair which makes retaining moisture even more of a challenge.  I use a little as a hair conditioner every few days and even do a hair mask once a month or so when I have time.  What a difference?!  My hair looks like it did when I was young - shiny!  And its so soft!!  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask. My hair was damaged my being over processed by chemical treatments and daily use of straightening irons. (Noticed I am writing in past tense.) Please read my response below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1 it did not make my hair softer, but it did something more remarkable. It restored my hair&#x27;s memory. I forgot that my hair used to hold a curl. After one use my hair held a curl for 3 or 4 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2 - It made my hair softer, shiny, and more conditioned!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 3 - more beautiful and healthy. I am now using less styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my desert island product. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I had been using the wen hair mask, but this product seems to work better.  I have fine color treated hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make it greasy, but does keep those wispy fly away hairs more smooth.  I have been using it once a week as an overnight treatment.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of the smell of this product to begin with. I would give another star if it gives wonderful scent to it. Anyway, I have not used it as deep conditioning but have been using as conditioner after shampoo twice a week. I originally used it everyday but it made my hair too sticky and heavy. It does give me nice body and natural wave to my hair and stop frizziness on my hair. This product does not spread well so maybe the reason why I tend to apply more than I need and ended up heavy sticky hair. But my hair does have nice body to it and no frizz which are big plus to me!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Best hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it once a week, any more and it weighs my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash as usual, towel dry and then use a generous amount and work through to ends with my fingers. I then wrap it in a shower cap and then a towel around that and leave that on for at least an hour, then rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, shining hair! I have wavy to curly hair and I&#x27;m prone to frizz, this takes care of the frizz and looks polished while still maintaining the waviness and curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go through a jar a month or so.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle in a jar! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. It took my dry, frizzy hair and transformed it into silky ponytail. I used it once a week for a month and now I use it 2x a month. It truly works! I recommend this for anyone with 4A/4B hair!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and smooth (frizz free).&lt;br /&gt;Hair stays moisturized longer and looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good. It not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It has amazing ingredients that are really good for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only setback is that it contains amodimethicone which is a type of silicone that gives slip and makes the product effective in detangling knotted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. See the detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> My new place has hard water and it left my hair really dry and hard to manage. I noticed a dramatic difference after using this hair mask. Not the first time, but definitely by the 3rd time. I&#x27;ve used this both as a conditioner and a hair mask. Seems kind of wasteful to use it as a daily conditioner so I would only use it during long showers on the weekend. Just leave it in as you exfoliate or do a body wash or something. It leaves my hair silky smooth and much easier to manage. Less flyaways, less frizz, less breakage.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but it&#x27;s much easier to tolerate than some of the other hair masks I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I really feel like this is slowly repairing my hair every time I use it!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It makes my hair really soft and smell nice as well. My hair has been very dry lately and this is what has saved it. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> My hair is finally growing back in after six months of chemotherapy treatments. The texture is different - a little wiry and dry. When I was searching for a deep moisturizing hair treatment and read the reviews on Argan Oil, I decided to try it. I have given my hair three treatments so far and can honestly give this product a five-star review. The shine and softness is returning and making my hair more manageable. Thanks for a quality product that does what the description promises.</li>
    <li> My hair hair is dry and after using this product, I didn&#x27;t feel anything change. Maybe it&#x27;s not working on my hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing, love this product. It keeps my very dry and frizzy hair hydrated. Love the consistency of the product and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Easy to apply and great packaging.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nice. I wouldnt say it&#x27;s awesome. It does it&#x27;s job. i guess I was just expecting it to be amazing. It left my thick coarse hair more on the greasy side. It may be because I dont wash my hair everyday. This would be good for someone that washes their hair every day or that has dry or color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Restored and Revitalized rhe Moisture in my hair, I Absolutely LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this Hair Mask so much! It works way better if you leave it on for a longer period of time--try a minimum of 30 minutes. The longer you leave it on, the more the product gets to soak into your hair. I have very dry and damaged split ends and overall very coarse hair, and this made my hair very soft and silky. The product itself is quite pricey, but you get a nice amount-an 8 oz jar. Be quite generous when you&#x27;re applying--it&#x27;s better for your hair!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: this product was sent to me for review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Wow !!!!! It feels awsome!!!! it really works and my hair is better day by day....</li>
    <li> Its great! Highly recommend this for people with natural hair. I have searched and tried a lot if priducts but this sofar us the best! Love it!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be all natural but it isn&#x27;t. I prefer using all natural products on my hair.</li>
    <li> It seems Argan oil is the only type of hair product that can manage my hair without leaving it either too oily or too dry.  This mask is no exception.  I loved the scent and the consistency of the hair mask.  It went on smooth and felt luxurious in my hair.  After rinsing it off I could tell a definite difference to my hair: silky soft and smooth (just the way I love it).  The scent stayed in my hair, even after rinsing the product out.  It was very pleasant and even my sons commented that they liked it.  While this can also be used as a daily conditioner, I love this product best as a deep conditioning treatment.  Would highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was given to me at a reduced price for me to test &amp;amp; give an honest review.  I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions--positive or otherwise--and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
    <li> I love it! Everyday I apply argan oil to my hair and my scalp right after washing it. And Once a week, I would spend some time using this argan oil hair mask to get more deep treatment. It&#x27;s been over a month since I started using this mask, my hair now no more dry and dull, instead more shine and soft after using it. Great product and great value compare to the pricey saloon treatment.</li>
    <li> I think Argan oil is the best thing to ever happen to my curly hair.  Curly hair can get so dry, and I have tried dozens of conditioners, both rinse-out and leave-in and Argan oil is what I keep coming back to.  This smells nice, is wonderfully moisturizing and I&#x27;m really happy with it.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 4 stars is just my own personal quirk.  I prefer products to come in squeeze bottles rather than tubs.  I like to pour/squish into my palm instead of digging out with fingers.  No reflection on the product inside, which is awesome!</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes my hair super soft and shiny!!</li>
    <li> These stuff is absolutely awesome. Loves how soft my hair feels following use.</li>
    <li> I use this for my dry hair and it works good. Now my hair much better and shine</li>
    <li> Love this Product it&#x27;s my go to hair mask it has a nice sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t transfer to the hair, but your hair is left feeling soft ,clean and looks so shiny I have a review and demo here: https://youtu.be/zNhIlpYtCMY</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel great</li>
    <li> I read all the good reviews and thought this can&#x27;t be that good.  But is is and even better.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very course &amp; wiry.  Caucasian hair but very thick as well.  My hair is so soft, the texture is different.&lt;br /&gt;Found a product for my unruly hair..... And I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Insta Natural is a company that offers a great selection of beauty, hair care, and skin care products.  I have really been impressed with all of the products that I have tried from them.  My hair has really been dry since we swam quite a bit over the Summer.  I was recently given the opportunity to try Insta Natural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Mask.  I was so excited to try this product out because I knew my hair really needed some help.  This is a product that provides your hair with the extra moisture it needs.  This is a deep conditioning treatment.  The product is designed to treat dry and damaged hair.  It is easy to use and it really left my hair feeling really soft and shiny.  However, it did not weigh down my hair, and leave it looking oily.  The Argan Oil Hair Mask is made with Argan Oil, Amino Acid Complex, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, and Vitamin B5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - free sample provided for blog review</li>
    <li> My hair is a little dry and tends to be frizzy. After reading the good reviews, I bought it. After using it my hair looks like the same, dry and frizzy. The smell is like citric and I loved it, that is the reason I gave the product  two stars instead of one.</li>
    <li> It is good product to soften your hair</li>
    <li> Everytime i use this product, i notice increased moisture level in my dry hair and little or no breakage. After i ran out of the first jar, i couldn&#x27;t wait to re-order more. I will use this product again and again. Welldone, AJ.</li>
    <li> Reading some reviewes, i was skeptical if might work so well but thought it&#x27;s worth a try. Used it first time 3 days ago and left it in the hair for 15 minutes. I was amazed how smooth, light and good smelling my hair was after. I have very long hair and never wore it loose because especially after washing it was all furry, and end looked very unhealthy but not any more. :))) this week have not used a hairband yet and when usually it tangles and turn into mess in wind, no problems with that either. I put a lot of the product in the hair btw, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. And I am thinking after few times I can start applying less as my hair is already so much healthier.</li>
    <li> This hair mask actually dried my hair out as opposed to conditioning it. It also smells strange and unpleasant. Not worth the money, you&#x27;d be better off just using a pure oil mixture in your hair for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I am super excited to be discussing the Argan Oil hair mask with you today. As a mom, I am starting to age not just by my skin but my hair. I have been dying it since I was 13 and I am now 30, so I know it is competently damage, its limp, its so thick its course.I have to wet it everyday to just get the flyaways out of site. I stopped dying my hair , I want my hair to start growing longer with volume and vibrant strength. Thats where the Argan oil comes in, you can use it as a daily conditioner, but this conditioner is unlike anything other. Compared to regular conditioner you put it in your hair and it sometime still looks dull and no volume but that is just me and my experience. With this oil after taking a shower dry your hair but leave it damp. Put a descent amount into your hair and keep it in fo 10-15 minutes. You will start at the root of your scalp and work your way to the ends to make sure all the moisture is locked into the scalp and every inch of your beautiful lengths. This Oil is completely organic and contains coconut oil. A little secret if you have children you can use coconut oil to keep lice away. I had a great experience, I am not sure how others felt but I really enjoyed trying this product out.</li>
    <li> I used the mask on me and my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She is type 3, whereas I am type 4.  It worked well in our hair.  I especially wanted to deep conditioner her hair as I planned to heat-style it for her birthday, using a ceramic flat iron.  I needed all of the protection that I could get.  After washing out the mask, there was no build-up and neither one of our heads felt heavy.  The jar for the mask notes that it is good for when you heat style and I admit that there was no apparent damage to her hair and even after her hair got wet, it reverted back to her curly waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my other reviews here: http://kinkykinetik.blogspot.com/2014/09/product-review-instanatural-argan-oil.html</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderful on my hair. I have thick hair that can be coarse and get very tangled. This makes it soft and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> I have only used this mask twice, but I really like the results.  I have fine blonde going gray hair that seemed to be turning to fuzzy straw!  I knew I needed a deep conditioner, and took to Amazon to do some research.  I made up my mind that this sounded like the best bet.  I am doing the mask treatment on the weekends for now, and plan to use it for a once-or-twice-a-week conditioner for the ends.  After the 1st use, my hair was soft &amp; silky...no more straw.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good size, left hair soft, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have received this product in return for an honest opinion.  I&#x27;ve used Argan Oil Hair Mask three times this month and really don&#x27;t care for the product.  With all the wonderful oils in this product I would expect a beautiful scent but it smells like an ant anticeptic  to me. My hair is coloured so I expected great results but that didn&#x27;t happen.  My hair felt like straw and wouldn&#x27;t even blow dry out properly.  Totally disappointed .</li>
    <li> This product is extremely watery and does not provide a lush hair mask at all. I had to use 3x what I would normally use and it did not yield ANY results with my hair. Stick with the Arvazallia Mask!!!</li>
    <li> Buy something else, my hair was so greasy &amp; gives your your dull look. I only use a min. Amount of it. . My 17 yr. old kid use it &amp; the same thing happened to his hair. Funny smell &amp; Price extremely ridiculous for the way it makes your hair feel.</li>
    <li> So simple to use all you have to do . Simply apply one or two pumps of oil to damp hair working from the scalp down to the ends, For oily hair, avoid the scalp. For dryer scalps, massage the oil liberally over your scalp and entire hair strand. Now style as usual. My sister has dry hair and she loves this , it has made her hair so soft and more curly. After you straightened, curled or whatever you do, they suggest using another pump or two of oil on your finished hair style – before using hair spray. She said her hair stays softer for days after she does this.</li>
    <li> My everyday conditioner works better</li>
    <li> Tried this in the shower, I rinsed it out, and started to comb it after the shower. When dry, my hair was more frizzy than before. I will go bach to the liquid after my shower.</li>
    <li> My Hair has never looked this good. My hair is very healthy and shiny. Does not look greasy. I love how soft and amazing my hair looks.</li>
    <li> This left my hair feeling amazing. I usually have dry hair that kind of feels like hay from being over processed.&lt;br /&gt;It now feels so soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I use this as an overnight mask for my over processed hair, works wonders. I tried a new hairdresser who over processed and bleached my healthy locks. My hair was dry and brittle immediately after and for 3-4 weeks until I started noticing and freaked out. I built a collection of hair masks and conditioners and this one was my favorite. It really moisturizes your hair. After the night mask is shampoo with a moisture shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product has really helped my hair feel soft and look shiny!  You can use it as a normal conditioner or do it as a deep conditioner! Also the smell isn&#x27;t to bad either.</li>
    <li> I feel like I waste my money</li>
    <li> Overall a nice argon oil hair mask tht does moisturize and help dry/damaged hair. After a mask treatment my hair was more manageable and had less tangles. Not a great choice though if you already have oily hair so use sparingly. I received the product complimentary for review purposes and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Not clear on product usage, is it a leave in or not..smells great though</li>
    <li> perfect&lt;br /&gt;does the work&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> If you love your hair then you will love using this product on it. I used to press, blow-dry, and perm my hair and realized the damage my hair was going through. I started from the beginning again by cutting my hair short and regrowing it naturally. One year later my hair is gorgeous, springy, healthy, shiny and totally manageable. I prefer to use products without a lot of ingredients I cannot pronounce (not always possible) and strips my hair down to bone dryness. When I received the opportunity to try InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask, I was very excited! I&#x27;ve used it for a month now but let me tell you, the first time I used it I noticed a wonderful difference in the feel of my hair! I did a full review on this product on my blog: http://libr8ed.com/2014/10/03/instanatural-argon-oil-hair-mask/</li>
    <li> Before applying the InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Mask, I first washed my hair with shampoo and conditioner. I towel-dried my hair and applied the Argan Oil Hair Mask on my hair generously. I started on my scalp and worked my way up to the ends of my hair. Since I opted to try the deep conditioning treatment, I put my hair up in a bun so that I can do other things while waiting for my 15-minute treatment. I used about 1/5 of the hair mask for my short, thick and wavy hair. The InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask has a bit of overpowering scent while it was on my hair. Good thing it smelled nice and not irritating and I&#x27;m thankful for that because I&#x27;m stuck with the scent for 15 minutes. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 15 minutes, I went back to the shower to rinse it off. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to shampoo my hair again because it rinsed of easily. I didn&#x27;t feel any remnants of the hair mask on my hair and scalp. I towel-dried my hair and combed it and was amazed that my hair has lesser tangles than before. My hair also smelled really nice. I proceeded to blow-dry my hair to see how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty amazed at how soft, shiny and healthy-looking my hair was after I blow-dried it. The frizziness and fluffiness was greatly reduced and I know I&#x27;ve said it a lot of times but my hair smelled GREAT! I also noticed that my scalp became clear and dandruff free. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because of the InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Mask because I&#x27;ve tried a lot of anti-dandruff shampoos but none of them really fixed my dandruff issue. And for the record, my hair smelled nice up to 3 days after I used the InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Mask. I do shampoo my hair everyday so the fact that the scent of the InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Mask stayed 3 days after I used it, it&#x27;s pretty nice. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Mask works great in deep conditioning and repairing my hair. I&#x27;m not exaggerating but I&#x27;ve really never felt my hair this soft and smooth for years. It was also effective against my dandruff which has been my problem since I was in highschool. I love the hair mask and would not think twice of buying it again.It was also effective against my dandruff which has been my problem since I was in highschool. I love the hair mask and would not think twice of buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, and it works well as a deep conditioner.  The product doesn&#x27;t create that much suds compare to other conditioner and hair treatment. Also, the conditioning calms and helps relaxes my scalp.</li>
    <li> the smell is terrible and disgusting.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my 3 year old with super curly and super dry hair. Well, it didn&#x27;t do anything for her hair. We were using it every day exactly according to the label. Now I&#x27;ve switched for a different product that actually works. Also the smell is super strong and super sweet. She didn&#x27;t like it, I didn&#x27;t like it, nobody in our family liked it...</li>
    <li> I use many conditioners.  This one wasn&#x27;t bad.  It conditioned my hair but no miracles.</li>
    <li> You have no idea how excited I am to share with you my “Argan Oil Hair Mask Review!” Everyday you do damage to your hair, from dying, blow drying, just putting hair up and so on. So my hair isn’t exactly happy with me. Its dry, bridle and theres too many split ends to count! Which is why I’m thrilled the Argan Oil Hair Mask found its way to my much needed and well deserved hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whats absolutly fabulous about the Argan Oil Hair Mask is that it will actually help transform your dry and damaged strands into soft, shiny, healthy hair all with its deep conditioning treatment. The goodness that you’ll find within include of coarse Argan Oil, Japanese Green Tea, Amino Acid Complex, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil &amp; Vitamin B5. All those ingredients put together equals some heavy duty restoring activity to penetrate your hair deep down to deliver an ultimate nourishing and hydrating experience. Which over all will just build your beauty by enhancing your hairs texture and shine. Plus by strengthening your hair its building a shield to help defend against heat damage as well as other external aggressors.</li>
    <li> My man has super curly hair that is thick. We always do our blog reviews on his hair since it is the ultimate test of a hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He really liked the way it went on and easily rinsed off- leaving soft hair behind!  It did not weigh his hair down in any way, and it smells great to me! YUM! Like a vanilla orange scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is the hottest thing around for hair care and this product does a great job with it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I recently tried InstaNatural&#x27;s Superior Hydration Argan Oil Hair Mask. I liked that it was made in the USA and that it wasn&#x27;t tested on animals. It contains argan oil, amino acid complex, coconut oil, shea butter, and Vitamin B5 to name a few of the ingredients. Did I tell you that it smells great? It does, and it made me think of citrus! I liked it a lot!</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing!!!  I have very dry/brittle hair &amp; this is the first product that has worked.  I use this mask twice a week &amp; it has made my hair healthier, softer &amp; more manageable.  Even my husband comments how great my hair looks now.  I have also used it as a facial mask &amp; my skin is noticeable softer &amp; less dry.  I feel it is a great value that in addition to WORKING, you need to use only a little of this product to get fantastic results.  As for customer service &amp; shipping, it also gets 5 stars.  I was amazed how quickly I received my order &amp; I was also impressed with the email I received from the company with tips &amp; directions.</li>
    <li> very disappointed when spending so much money on it , the result is not as good as the ingrediants .My hair looks still frizzy after using it. An normal shea butter hair mask I bought at counter is better than this one.</li>
    <li> This just wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I used this as a conditioner and on occasion as a leave in. Note that my hair is curly and color treated. Pros: it smelled okay, like cream candies peaches and cream or vanilla as some reviewers have said, the product itself is creamy and thick and the packaging came nicely sealed. I like the container which makes it easier to use my hand to scoop it out. I used the entire container since my purchase. Cons: this didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, made my hair eaky and tangled, almost like pudding. Also I&#x27;ve used other products that made my hair shiny, bouncy and healthy and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any of these things occur while using this product. It just weighed down my curls and make my hair dull looking. This is not something I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> is the hair mask J At first I wasn’t so sure because it had a weird smell which normally turns me off but I went ahead and tried it and was actually impressed. My hair is normally very dry and after using this , my hair felt less dry than normal, though it was still a bit dry I put it through the brushing test and it actually brushed through quite easily without hurting like it normally would J which is impressive, I didn’t have to fight or use my detangle spray , so it’s a A+ for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am here again back in 2015 once again trying this product, I gave this item a second go and at first i was really unimpressed i didn&#x27;t understand why i liked it before but not now. I tried the item again and started to realize, if you don&#x27;t leave this product in for a certain amount of time it won&#x27;t help your hair. I noticed when i left it in for a while and washed it , My hair was very soft and just all together nice feeling, but when i only left it in for a little bit my hair w as still very dry and tangled. So i am in a love / hate relationship because i&#x27;m not completely sure how to feel. I do enjoy the product and i will continue to use it , but i don&#x27;t know if id&#x27; buy it again just because it seemed a bit temperamental but then again my hair is always hard to mange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :) I was sent this for free to test out and give my opinion</li>
    <li> I have long hair to my waist and it gets knotted up throughout the day. Therefore, I am always looking for leave in hair treatments to help keep my hair shiny, and healthy looking. I have tried other brands of Argan oil before so I was familiar with it&#x27;s uses. However, other brands seem to leave my hair oily and that is not what I need. Insta Natural&#x27;s Argan Oil, turns dry, damaged hair into luxurious, silky strands.  Along with organic argan oil, this leave in mask contains  coconut oil, shea butter, &amp; vitamin b5 for a deep treatment cream that increases volume, softness and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a shower, I towel dry my hair and get any access water out. Then I apply about a palm full of product through out my hair making sure I get the ends really good. And then, I comb or brush it through to make sure it reaches all the hair. It smells amazing like fresh herbs. I recieved this product for review, however all thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> I have used a few hair mask productsand this one is my favorite so far. Even though I have used it only once, it made my hair instantly silky and smooth. I left it on for about 10 minutes. I guess the longer it stays on, the better effect. Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask deep conditions without weighing down your hair.  The InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask has a medium thick consistency so it’s versatile! You can use it as an intensive deep conditioning mask, or as a light weight conditioner. I love that the Instanatural Argan Oil Hair Mask makes my hair feel soft, and provides my hair with a lot of shine! I used the InstaNatural Argan Oil hair mask as a deep conditioning mask, and as a regular conditioner. Both times I used it, my hair was easier to manage, felt soft, and looked less dry. I’m not the only that thinks so, my hubby also tested the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask on his hair, and he loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;I can’t forget to mention how good the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask smells! It smells amazing! It has a cocoa butter, and citrus scent that I absolutely love. I really like the way it leaves my hair lightly scented. My hubby didn’t like the scent, but I sure did so that’s a plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like my experience with the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask! I will continue to use the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask to keep my hair shiny, soft, and manageable!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask for review purposes. However, all the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I absolutely love it.  I have thick, long, wavy/curly hair and it works wonders to detangle my unmanageable hair.  I especially love that it is all natural and a great value too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one who spends a whole lot of time on their hair but I do see the need to now as I&#x27;m getting older and my hair is getting a bit harder to manage.  I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that bring the moisture and I was very pleased with this Argan Oil Hair Mask. Easy to apply and use! Simply wash your hair, coat strands with the hair mask (comb through if necessary) and leave on for about 20 minutes. Rinse off and enjoy your soft, silky locks! I almost forgot the greatest thing about this product...the scent is amazing, like a sweet,  fruity candy! I use this mask about once a week, although I may use it a bit more in the wintertime.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling amazing! However, its scent reminded me of a really weird smell like juice inside a small plastic barrel container (like the ones  I used to have as a kid lol )Couldn&#x27;t handle it but the product itself did what it claimed to do! Also... I bought this with my own money. Much love! XOXO</li>
    <li> One use and there&#x27;s no going back, I am IN LOVE.  My hair has never been so happy!  My flyaways even seem more tame.  I have only been doing 5 minutes at a time, but it;s been great.  I love this stuff and it smells AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product--leaves hair soft and easy to manage--thanks.</li>
    <li> I was surprised this product worked so well on my dry, thick hair. I thought it was going to leave my hair greasy if I left it too long, but it left my hair very smooth. I would definitely continue to buy this product and I do recommend for thick, dry hair that needs moisture and smoothing.</li>
    <li> I have loved this. I actually use just a tiny bit after I wash my hair as a leave in conditioner. It helps a ton with my frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve started using it on my three daughters hair as well. One had very brittle hair that always got scraggly if I let it grow, now it looks so much healthier!</li>
    <li> My hair is permed straight and gets alot of abuse with a flatiron.  I left this in my hair as 1 hour treatment. It made my hair silky soft and super shiny.  I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair! I will definitely buy again. I also recommend the vitamin c serum by this same brand.</li>
    <li> The mask is good, moisturizes my hair, the smell is a little bit too intense for me but overall I use it as a mask once a week. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair is fine,color treated and I use a curling iron every day. I had high hopes after reading the reviews. I am not disappointed. My hair is bouncy,soft and in way better condition. After I use it my hair is a little harder to comb out but once it&#x27;s detangled it&#x27;s easier to style and actually holds the curls until the next day. I will only use this brand from now on. I&#x27;m also going to try their other products. I already use the eye cream. It is also amazing.</li>
    <li> I think it is helping my hair.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about the mask was how thick and rich it looked. It also smells really good. Unlike other deep conditioning treatments this one was easy to spread on my hair and rinse off. I have used other masks before and it took a long time to rinse out. My hair instantly felt softer and smoother. As I let my hair air dry it was really smooth and shiny. I just let my natural waves come out as my hair dried and didn&#x27;t need to blow dry or flat iron.</li>
    <li> First, this stuff smells heavenly. If all of my beauty products smelled this good, I would be in heaven. That alone is enough to sell me on this product, but it also really helps me combat the dry, frizzy hair I get in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have some shampoo and conditioner that helps with treating dry hair, and while it is enough for a good part of the year, I need extra help in the winter. The dry air from having the heat on really dries out my hair and makes it frizzy. Using this for a deep treatment every few days really helps reduce that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though most of my hair gets dry, I do have oily roots. I quickly learned to keep this away from the roots of my hair so I didn&#x27;t make things even more oily. I also recommend you wrap your hair in a towel or clip it up when doing the leave in treatment so you don&#x27;t get the cream on your shirt and risk getting oil stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> people thought i used hair ironing tool or i had professional hair straighthening process, it just tamed my hair and made it so soft. just that the smell is kinda weird to me. my husband thought im wearing an old grammy&#x27;s perfume. but wow oh wow product is amazing! although its not a miracle wonder that it will mend your brittle ends and damage hair instantly, patience and time. but as far as taming frizzy hair is a miracle</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed! If you&#x27;re someone who bought this because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; I would recommend Shea Moisture&#x27;s hair mask way more, and for anyone that just wants a good hair mask, try Arvazallia&#x27;s mask. Not even sure how it&#x27;s possible, but my hair actually felt drier after using this product. NOT worth any money at all, let alone the $20 I spent.</li>
    <li> I received the argon oil hair mask from InstaNatural. I have to say I loved it! Using it once a week made my hair so soft! I usually deal with frizz on a daily basis. The only thing in my daily routine I changed was adding this hair mask. Even my husband could tell the difference! I think he noticed that my hair smelled like vanilla pudding! It even smells amazing! I have not found another product that can make my hair so soft in just 15 minutes a week!</li>
    <li> Worked wonders om my hair. My hair was dry and brittle and this has helped. I wear it a few hours before my shower.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.. Smell good too</li>
    <li> smells amazing, and definitely left my hair shiny &amp;&#x27; silky.</li>
    <li> Really nice feeling and smell.  Better than gel, I leave it in.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. Drug store products work just as well if not better. I have to wonder if this is a knock off because it was extremely poor quality.</li>
    <li> This mask smells incredible! I have only used it once because it&#x27;s expensive so I don&#x27;t want to use it every week...but I did enjoy it the time I used it! I also deep conditioned by boyfriend&#x27;s brillo pad beard with it and I think it did a great job!</li>
    <li> I used it a few times as a conditioner (not leave-in) and it kept my hair very silky.  All of the reviews are true.  I have very dry hair and it really helps!</li>
    <li> so far (after 3 uses) I love this as a conditioner. It smells great, my hair looks a lot better than usual. I will order again probably.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work on thin dyed hair at all. over the counter conditioner works better</li>
    <li> It has a bit of a smell, I can&#x27;t describe it and I wish there was a general guideline on how much to actually use. Otherwise, I think it is a great product to use on your hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft and it smells so amazing and just WOW. I think I&#x27;ve found my brand, here.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a very nice smell.  I used it as a conditioner rather than as a mask.  I have short gray hair and it has helped to soften it quite noticeably. This is good to keep in mind for a gift for any of your family or friends.</li>
    <li> I got the chance try out this great hair mask and I loved it.  This is one of those hair masks you can use as a deep conditioning treatment.  Just slather your hair with it and leave in for five to fifteen minutes then rinse out and you can use it twice a week.  I also loved to use this just a regular conditioner. To use it as a regular conditioner, I just put it on the ends of my hair and rinsed out like normal.  This was a pretty thick conditioner so if you are going to use it on your roots make sure to only use it twice a week.  It left my hair feeling very soft to the touch and very manageable.  I did not even have to use a detaingler when I was done.  My split ends and frizzy hair was so much better you could not even tell I had split ends and the frizz was almost nonexistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insta naturals has a wide range of beauty products.  For your every day needs or even for specific needs.  You are sure to find what you are looking for here.  Their prices are great and you will really get a lot for your money. I have had the chance to try out quite a few of their products and loved every single one.  I would suggest insta naturals to everyone.</li>
    <li> Really wonderful product.... smells like coconut and vanilla.... Smells so good I want to eat it!  But aside from that, leaves my hair super soft and moisturized.... really great for winter months when our hair gets all dried out... and summer months too I guess when we are in swimming pools and beaches.  Ingredients are &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; in my opinion... lots of natural, recognizable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a regular conditioner between &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; treatments... just keep it in the shower and use it as a conditioner.  And a cake frosting!  OK kidding on the last part but again wow it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive compared to drug store hair products, but you&#x27;re paying for quality ingredients, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> It took a few times to get used to the consistency of the product in my hair, but I&#x27;m starting to like this.  It makes my hair really soft and smooth.  I use it every other time I wash my hair and it works great!</li>
    <li> Oftentimes it&#x27;s difficult to get your sons to use a hair care product or at least find one that everyone in the house can use.  Instanatural Argan Oil Hair Mask is such a product, everyone in the house can and has used it.  My son uses it as a daily conditioner to keep his hair moisturized and I use it weekly.  This is a great product and I appreciated the quick ship from Amazon.com, we will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I like your product very much.  I really did see a difference after just the first use. I left it on 15 minutes the  first time and it made my hair look so much healthier. After menopause, your hair texture really changes. The Argan Oil hair mask brought back the shine and made it feel thicker. (my hair in thinning terribly) I am very thankful for this. I thought it was pricy and was hesitant about buying it, but glad I did. The smell is pleasant also.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Mask - Review (Amazing):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just going to jump right into this review with, I LOVE this Argan Oil Hair Mask from InstaNatural! It is truly AMAZING! I like the container though my only wish was that it was pump style instead of a jar. I love the smell. It smells like Creamsicles! It is a nice creamy texture, not too runny and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, but rather soft, silky manageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;I Highly Recommend InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Mask....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used mine all up and right now I have no way to get anymore so I can&#x27;t wait til I can!</li>
    <li> Some mentioned a great smell but I was not fond of it.. It works okay but would not buy again as I didn&#x27;t see much improvement from any other product.</li>
    <li> Great! I love argan oil.</li>
    <li> Argan oil mask left my hair feeling so soft and silky I never knew my hair could feel like that. Wow!!! I was so impressed.</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt softer and more hydrated.  I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair and my ends always look dry and frizzy.  But after using this hair mask my hair looks healthier and more hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product free for review.</li>
    <li> Works well and ssmells great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product has so many good reviews. It really drys up my hair every time I use it. Not worth $$.</li>
    <li> This is the best product!!! My hair feels and looks so much better after using it!!! I definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair from a deep red to a platinum blonde. I was afraid my hair would be fried for life! This hair mask makes my hair feel soft and healthy again! I can&#x27;t imagine my life without this hair mask.</li>
    <li> Maybe this works wonders for everyone else&#x27;s hair, but this makes mine go limp. No thanks.</li>
    <li> It is a very light, fluffy, whipped texture. It smells like an Orange Creamsicle.  I seriously at there for five minutes just smelling it.  The directions say use on wet just washed hair, and then rinse out. Ive done it that way, and using it prewash, on dry hair. Both ways, makes my hair feel smooth, look shiny, and gorgeous. I am 5&#x27;3 and my hair is past my butt. I seriously, only needed maybe the size of a regular spoonful. If that, a little really does go a long way with this product. I usually only apply it to the ends of my hair, as my hair stylist mentioned that is really the only place argan oil is needed. Though, If i want some shine and moisture all over I will coat all of my hair with it.  Really the choice is yours. *complementary product received for review*</li>
    <li> This is the best!! Feels cool on your head..smells like heaven..leaves hair 100 percent improved.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil hair mask. My hair was very damaged from over dying and flat iron abuse. Since using my hair looks and feel so much healthier. Its super soft and has a healthy shine to it now. Its easy to use. Just apply to damp hair and let it set for 5-15 minutes and rinse out. I do suggest waiting the full 15 minutes if your hair is severely damaged like mine was for best results. Do not apply too much or its hard to rinse out. It doesn&#x27;t take much at all. It also smells great. I received to review but will be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS CONDITIONER!  I HAVE USED IT DAILY AND CAN SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE!  MY HAIR HAS MORE SHINE &amp; IS HEALTHIER!</li>
    <li> Silky, soft and smooth. That is my haie with this lighweight, clean rinsing argan oil. Fantastic product and generous size.</li>
    <li> I have natural, unprocessed hair and this hair mask helps my coarse hair to feel softer. I have purchased it twice now.</li>
    <li> I was really happy when InstaNatural sent me their Argan Oil Hair Mask to test out for them and I have been using it about once a week for the last few weeks and I have noticed that the condition of my hair has really improved.  I was on a hair mask kick for quite awhile but then for some reason (mostly time) I stopped so my hair was in desperate need of some deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did the Argan Oil Hair Mask leave my hair feeling super soft it even looked a lot more shiny and it was more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair like I normally would in the shower and then once I got out of the shower I towel dried my hair, applied the mask and let the mask worked it&#x27;s magic for about 15 minutes and then rinsed it out.  The difference in my hair was immediate!</li>
    <li> I HAVE FOUND HAIR SALVATION! I received this product in exchange for my inspection and honest review, and as a once a week hair mask I LOVE IT! I did not use it as a daily conditioner, but it says it can be used as such. As a mask I really lathered it on and worked it into my scalp. I let it sit there for about 5 minutes then rinsed it out in water that was in between cold and lukewarm. My hair feels silky smooth without feeling greasy. I don&#x27;t think the picture does it justice!</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt better!</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair, became more manageable too!</li>
    <li> I am sooooo in love with this...I have very natural curly hair...and this helps the frizz..but also add moisture and softness to my hair.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair mask for curly hair type3b-3c. I have tried multiple products and so far this one would be in my top 10.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service too!&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
    <li> Great as a mask or a conditioner. Makes my hair smooth &amp; silky feeling but not limp. So happy to have found this product. I especially like the customer service. The follow up email instructions were spot on!</li>
    <li> Great product, you need to use it for several times to get the desired results. I am using and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> very good product but wish it had a better scent</li>
    <li> My fiancé loves this product!</li>
    <li> I love the smell. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair quite as soft as I expected. Apple cider vinegar worked better for softness. But I don&#x27;t doubt the ability of Argan oil.</li>
    <li> It smells so good in my hair and it feels so sultry</li>
    <li> DId not work for me. I love hair masks and deep conditioning treatments. It&#x27;s really the only way to make long, straight color-treated hair look halfway decent and stay tangle free throughout the winter. My product smelled like orange Tang. That really saccharine-like artificial sweet with a hint of citrus smell. I didn&#x27;t care for the scent in the least, but I wanted to at least give the product several chances. For me, it had no detangling ability. Did not make my hair more managable. I had to use about 3 times as much as my salon conditioner to rectify the results of this product. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have very long, very thick wavy unmanageable hair. I put this hair mask in and let it set 15 minutes and rinsed. I was able to blow dry my hair without using a brush! Just my fingers i used to comb through my hair and there was no tangles! My hair is so long and thick that it tangles very easy and looks kinda dry. After using this, i kid you not, my hair is more manageable,  shiny, less tangled, less frizz and the ends of my hair are even looking better! I have to use it more often because i have so much hair, which is to be expected with any hair product since i have so much hair. I only wish it lasted longer for me but again its because i have so much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the company is very nice and great to deal with. They make sure you are informed on the product and how to use as well as your honest opinion on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been recommending this to my friends. I dont recommend something unless it id really worth getting &amp; this is. The company is very appreciative of it customers &amp; their opinions.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product and I love it. Perfect for dry winter hair to give it a moisture boost. I have been using it as a daily conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for anyone with textured, curly hair and dry skin. I recommend not washing it out, or washing out just a little bit, depending how oily your hair is naturally.</li>
    <li> While this mask was quite moisturizing, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky as my other favorite hair mask. However, it was really good considering the much cheaper price tag. It had a thick consistency that was easy to use and left my hair quite hydrated. I personally did not like the vanilla-cocoa butter scent, but my roommate loved it, so I gave it to her. She has used it several times now and told me that she really likes it.</li>
    <li> Immediately jumped in the shower when i got the package the moment I arrived home after work. I loves the scent. It smelled like bubble gum and cotton candy. I loved the fact that this product is organic. My hair is heavily damaged and super dry and somehow this product prevents it from more damage. It doesn&#x27;t magically turn my hair glossy or perfect but it made my hair manageable and softer. For that, I give it a 3 star.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and I love the way my hair feels.</li>
    <li> My first use of this product left my hair a bit greasy and oily in certain places.  I will make sure to submit another review after a few more uses</li>
    <li> Use it weekly and your will be soft and shiny! This is a new must have product near my shower now.</li>
    <li> i usually purchased a name brand hair mask! However, I was quite surprised by the outcome of this mask and at half the price.</li>
    <li> I started using this product because my hair was really damaged from washing it almost every day. I really didn&#x27;t wanna  get my hopes up about it but it met every single one of my expectations and more. It is not a super oily product, so it doesn&#x27;t pack my hair with unnecessary oils. It moisturizes my hair just perfectly and allows me to let it air dry without any complications. On top of that, my hair is really thin and tangles easily. This argan oil treatment allows me to have better control of my hair. Although it still tangles after a few days, I&#x27;m able to bear with it as my hair is much more manageable. I honestly recommend this product to anyone who wants to restore their hair&#x27;s health and shine.</li>
    <li> Great product! I left the mask in my hair for about an hour before rinsing, and my hair went from straw to silky after the first application. I am also noticing a reduction in hair loss. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair was so dry and damaged and overly processes.  Please know that my hair has not felt this way in I don&#x27;t know how long.  I also bought the shampoo and oil hair condidtioner.  My hair is natural curly so normaly it is very dry and frizzy...Wow!! what a difference in my hair...Thank you so much .....</li>
    <li> I have this product as a gift, I really like the style and  it feels really good on my hair. I enjoy this project</li>
    <li> This aran oil conditioner is amazing, I received it complimentary but with my heavily colored hair it gives my hair so much softness and shine!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It really does wonders for my hair. I am of mixed race so it is hard to find a product that actually works. But I can reassure you this one does! Although the smell is quite strong for me, once it washes out its not so bad. Its quite appealing. If your looking for a hair mask that works, and works well... Take a chance on this guy! You wont be sorry!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the hair mask twice. My hair is very fine with no body. After the first time using the hair mask, my daughter and I couldn&#x27;t get over the difference in my hair. My hair actually had body and curl. The second time I used the mask my hair had more body and curl, than the first. My daughter has long hair and the first time she used it, we could tell an immediate difference in the feel of her hair. The mask hydrated her hair. If I could give the mask 10 stars I would. Can wait to see the difference in our hair over the next year!!!</li>
    <li> After trying the InstaNatural Deep Cleansing Oil I was eager to try a few other products by the company as well. I was able to get my hands on the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask and I’m so thankful that I was able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things that I noticed about this product was the scent. It seriously, no lies, smells like marshmallows. As soon as I smelled the product the first thought that went through my mind was “Even if this doesn’t work it’s worth the price to make my hair smell like marshmallows!” However, I obviously can’t leave a review at just the scent of the product and call it done. So I decided to stop sniffing the product and give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask can be used as either a twice-a-week hair treatment or as your regular conditioner. To use the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask as a hair treatment you do five very easy steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash hair with shampoo and rinse&lt;br /&gt;2. Towel dry hair&lt;br /&gt;3. While hair is still damp use fingers to apply product from scalp to ends evenly&lt;br /&gt;4. Leave on hair for 5 – 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;5. Rinse completely out of hair&lt;br /&gt;6. To use the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask as a conditioner just apply as you would your normal conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent wasn’t the only great thing about the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask. It left my hair feeling so soft and super manageable. Usually I have to use product after washing and conditioning my hair to keep my hair from having flyaways etc. However, after using the hair mask as a treatment I did not have this problem. The scent also stayed around for several days as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask is a great treatment and regular conditioner. I will probably repurchase this to have on hand to use at least once a week as a treatment.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Makes my hair feel fuller and stronger.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this product. She uses it almost daily and it leaves her hair feeling smooth, shiny and healthy. I haven&#x27;t used it myself as my hair is already fabulous and thinning. Best she does say it is a good product, so I trust her opinion.</li>
    <li> After shampooing and conditioning my hair, I used the intensive hair mask with a conditioning cap for a few hours and washed it out with cold water, and my hair was soft and pleasantly smelled like marshmallows and flowers. There are so many natural ingredients in the mask and perfect for the girl looking for a toxin-free deep conditioner.

    <li> Its just fantastic !!&lt;br /&gt;I deep conditioned my hair with it ( i.e 15 mins and washed it off) . Its amazing!! My hair feels like silk!! Light and bouncy !!&lt;br /&gt;Go buy it !!!</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have very long curly hair that I had highlighted blonde, my hair was very difficult to comb out until I found the Argan Oil Hair Mask.  I definitely improved the health of my hair and it looks fabulous.</li>
    <li> I have very short curly hair .  It is naturally dark brown but I have been blonde for years.  Argan Oil Hair Mask works perfectly.  It keeps my hair moist and soft.  It smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> This mask smells wonderful! It makes my hair feel great too. I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> This really works for me. I have very fine hair and this gives me a thicker feel to my hair and more control. I don&#x27;t use much, just a quarter size amount, it&#x27;s very concentrated. If your hair is drier you might need more. I only use once week.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair that I straighten with a flat iron about once a week.  I used this a handful of times and with different hair styles.  First off, I really dislike the smell.  It reminds my of the 90&#x27;s LipSmacker flavor, vanilla ice cream.  The product itself did not improve my hair, nor did it make it worst.  Overall, a $17 waste.  I highly recommend the Pantene pro-v deep conditioner over this.  It is 75% cheaper and works like a dream.</li>
    <li> It smells so good 😍 Also I like the way it coats my hair, however I&#x27;m unable to attest to it&#x27;s worth in strengthening hair. To me such an experiment would not work unless you get rid of variables such as the shampoo and conditioner; I have not and will not do so until next year 2016.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this for a week already (3 times in a week) and I can only see my hair more dry and looking oily/dirty.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel the moment I am applying it that it isnt conditioning my hair at all,, I saw this since the first use buy decided to wait and try it a couple more times however the result is dry, dirty looking hair. Also it DOES NOT LEAVE MY HAIR SMELLING AS OTHER REVIEWERS SAID.&lt;br /&gt;Completely dissapointed I have wasted 16 dollars on this since I wont even be using it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Hence my hair is very thin so its not like its my hair that&#x27;s too thick or dry for the product not do its work.</li>
    <li> Really like this product!</li>
    <li> Update: after reordering this product quite a few times and very happy with it, my last order was a shock.  When I opened it, I noticed a very strong unnatural fragrance that the product never had before.  The color and texture are also different.  So I compared the ingredients.  The new product is no longer all natural.  I am very disappointed.  I am trying other brand now. *************************************** I have recently switched to an all natural shampoo because I was losing a lot of hair.  It was amazing that I did stop losing hair after using the all natural shampoo.  However, the shampoo also left my hair so hard to manage.  As soon as I switched back to my old shampoo, the hair loss started.  I was caught in a very hard place.  I always have very fine and silky hair,  but the all natural shampoo makes my hair looks and feels like straw!  But I don&#x27;t want to keep losing hair.  Then I found Argan Oil Hair Mask.  I never heard of Argan oil before.  When I read all the positive review and decided to give it a try.  I have to say I am very impressed.  Not only My hair is silky again. it actually makes my hair shines.  You know how those hair product commercials that show the hair being so smooth and shining?  My hair ACTUALLY looks like that!.  Combining with the new henna hair coloring I just did, I received a lot of compliment about my hair.  Also it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like some other all natural conditioners that I tried.  I highly recommend it.  Also the seller InstaNatural is awesome.  I bought another product from them (the 100% argan oil) and it arrived with cap broken.  (not their fault. Amazon shipped it without proper protection).  I contacted the seller for a new cap, they immediately sent me a new bottle.  Superb customer service.</li>
    <li> Even after using the hair mask once, I&#x27;m already able to feel a difference in my hair. I blow dry/flat iron more than I should, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has been feeling dry and brittle lately. I used the hair mask for the first time this weekend (left it in for 20 minutes), and my hair already feels smoother! Will definitely keep using it, especially during dry winter weather.</li>
    <li> very good conditioner, smells nice , looks like melted chocolate. it does a nice job with the hair.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!  It makes my 4c hair very tangle free, manageable and soft as butter.  Its fragrance is also fantastic.  Smells good enough to eat.</li>
    <li> The level adherence of the oil to my hair is incredible! I have coarse hair and used to relax + japanese straighten it. The feeling of relaxed hair is wonderful, but the impact on hair&#x27;s health is negative. After many years, I decided to go with curly hair instead. By this time my coarse hais has also become frizzy. It looks bad and irritate my face + neck skin, even more so when it&#x27;s dry. This hair mask (plus InstaNatural&#x27;s hair oil) has reduced the frizziness to almost non-existing. My hair is still coarse, but is never dry and feels quite smooth to the touch. It also curls very nicely with sponge rollers.</li>
    <li> good product ! it working as well as my expectation.</li>
    <li> I love the way this mask makes my hair feel.  The directions stay to put it into towel dried hair but it has to be rinsed out.  I find this a little difficult when your in the shower.  I have just been getting as muck of the water out before applying,  It seams to last for a long time.</li>
    <li> 4 stars rated this because I yet haven&#x27;t applied it as many times to see final results. So far so good, the product has no noticeable smell after washing and washes easily.</li>
    <li> Smells okay, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and have not noticed a difference with my hair. After I use it, my hair does not feel any softer or stronger. I think I&#x27;ll stick to garnier fructis.</li>
    <li> Felt like it washed right out, no nutrients. Doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it how smooth and shiny my hair is after starting using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product has transformed my hair. Its much softer, smells lovely and my split ends have reduced.  I also feel like my dandruff has reduced but that might be attributable to some other products I&#x27;m using. I only wish the quantity were better. But I will keep buying this product nevertheless. Its totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Really seems to make a difference in my daughters hair after just one treatment!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used as a deep conditioner, I use it twice a week when I wash my hair and only have it on for a few minutes.  Keeps my hair hydrated and fresh and doesn&#x27;t feel like it is weighing it down.  I have very fine hair so I lose a lot of body with other heavy conditioners.</li>
    <li> I Love this product. My hair is very dry, damaged and brittle so putting on this mask I noticed a difference right away. My hair is silky and soft. Oh and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Alright product. Hard to remove. Left my hair a bit greasy.</li>
    <li> The mask smells awesome! I use it once a week, and it leaves my hair soft and smelling great! Got a free sample for a blog post review.</li>
    <li> Last week I received Argan Oil Hair Mask from InstaNatural to review. Usually I would try the product a couple times before writing a review but I absolutely love this stuff. Saturday morning I took my shower like normal, got out, towel dried my hair and threw the mask on for 15 minutes. When I started to rinse off the mask I could just tell that my hair was going to look amazing and I was not wrong. My hair is so silky, smooth, and shiny. I was so surprised to wake up the next morning and see that the effects even lasted through another hair washing. Now it&#x27;s 3 days later and my hair still looks amazing and smells amazing. I have tried a ton of different kinds of hair masks but after using the Argan Oil Hair Mask, I truly can&#x27;t picture using anything else.</li>
    <li> Summer has taken a toll on my hair. After weeks of sun and chlorine exposure my hair became dry, bleached, easily tangled and frizzy. I was excited to try this Argan Oil Hair Mask since my hair was in need of a little T-L-C. According to the instructions, you can either use this as a hair mask or as a deep conditioning daily treatment. I tried both uses...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I tried using it as a deep conditioning hair mask. I generously applied it to my hair and massaged it into my scalp. I did read the ingredient list first as not all products are suitable for skin contact, and I didn&#x27;t see any ingredient that concerned me. Then I wrapped my hair in a towel and used my hair dryer to warm the conditioning treatment. The instructions suggested leaving the treatment on for 5-15 minutes. I did a full 15 minutes. Then I shampooed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing and drying my hair, I found that my hair was soft and shiny. The problem is it still looked greasy. I shampooed again and that fixed the issue. I did use a lot of product on my hair and scalp, so I should have known I should have shampooed twice. My bad. But I do suggest thoroughly shampooing after this treatment. Once I did, my hair was soft and silky and easily detangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using this mask as a daily conditioner. For this use, I applied a very small amount to the ends of my hair after shampooing.  I started applying around chin length through the ends of my hair. (My hair is shoulder blade length). I left it on for a minute while I shaved my legs then I rinsed it out. It left the ends of my hair as soft as it was after the deep conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to share a little more about the product. According to the label, it is made in the USA and not tested on animals. The container holds 8 fluid ounces which I believe will last a long time. So far, I did one deep conditioning treatment and used it as a regular conditioner after two different washes. I barely dented the contents, it looks like an unused bottle. The scent does linger, it is very light but sweet. It reminds me of a &amp;#34;Creamsicle&amp;#34; (for those who don&#x27;t know an orange and vanilla icecream bar). The one small caveat, I would generally recommend this more as a mask than a daily conditioner. The main reason is the container has a very large &amp;#34;mouth&amp;#34; like a large jar of lotion or cold cream. I think it would be difficult to keep water out of the container if it were kept in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this as a deep conditioning treatment especially if interested in a treatment containing popular natural ingredients like argan oil, shea butter and coconut oil. I did receive this product for free in exchange for a fair and honest review. Still, the opinions expressed are my own after using this product for several days.he contents, it looks like an unused bottle. The scent does linger, it is very light but sweet.

    <li> When I first opened up the container of Argan Oil, I smelled a nice light scent of  what I would say is of orange and vanilla. One thing I really liked about this Argan Oil Hair Mask is that it has all natural ingredients like Amino Acid Complex, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, and Vitamin B5. These are all things combined with the Argan Oil, that I think is what makes this mask so great. I left the mask on my hair for 15 minutes. It&#x27;s hard for the pictures I took to show it, but after I let my hair dry, the before and after of how soft my hair was like night and day! It not only felt softer, but it was less frizzy and stronger. I was really impressed with the results, and this was only after one time! I can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair does after using it over time. I have to say InstaNatural makes a lot of wonderful products, but so far this is my favorite product. ***I have posted before and after pictures for yall to see.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: This is my opinion and my opinion alone. I did receive this product from the company for free, but was not payed nor was I payed to write a favorable review. This is 100% my complete honesty.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review for my blog and I love it! It&#x27;s a good consistency, not too thick, not too thin, smells really good and leaves your hair soft and shiny! You can leave it on for 5-15 minutes, I only did about 5, and you can just use it in the shower! Great product!</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and if you have natural, curly hair as well then you know that oil doesn&#x27;t disperse down the follicle like straight hair. This product definitely replenished moisture to my hair and made it silky soft, easy to comb through and the smell was amazing. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this especially for curly, dry, colored, or over processed hair. This is great for all hair types but if you have oily hair you may want to use a smaller amount. Will be adding pictures soon (&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask any questions!</li>
    <li> I color my hair a lighter shade of blonde every month, so my hair takes a beating. It is frizzy, and dry. I am honest enough to say that I pretty much neglect my hair when it comes to trying to help combat against all the trauma I put it through. Naturally when I was given the chance to try this Argan Oil Hair Mask, I jumped at it. I had nothing to lose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day I got this in the mail, I used it. I put this on my hair for 1 hour while I watched a tv show. It was thick in texture, so I didn&#x27;t have any issue with product dripping off my hair, which was nice of course. The smell was fine, if you have used Argan Oil then you know the scent. After a hour, I rinsed it out, and my hair just felt super amazing. Soft, luxurious, shiny, just everything I&#x27;d want my hair to feel like! It was love! I am also keeping up with trimming my hair and getting rid of any split ends, and taking supplements formulated for hair growth. So between all 3 things, my hair is just getting all the TLC it has been begging for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for about a month now, and I use it 2-3 times a week, and also a day before I color my hair, immediately after, and the day after I color my hair. My hair just appears to be in such better condition since adding this into my hair care routine. I have given some samples of this to family members to try out whom also have dry frizzy hair, and each loved it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a product to help revive your dead blah hair, I give my full 5 star recommendation to try this one out by InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> Every day I use a leave-in conditioner to manage frizzy or fly-away hair. As someone with fine hair, damaged by color-treatment, treating it daily after washing has become a necessity. Leave-in conditioners can get expensive (and tiresome) so I occasionally try hair masks, wash-out conditioner or oil treatments to help give my hair a little extra umph. Most give my hair some extra moisturizer but still require use of the leave-in conditioner even right after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received InstaNatural Superior Hydration Argan Oil Hair Mask to test and have found that it works really well. I&#x27;m usually able to find at least something wrong with a product, anywhere from scent to price, but this one I couldn&#x27;t. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: It has a citrus-ish scent. It&#x27;s not overwhelming at all. No strong perfumes or floral scents with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: It&#x27;s a medium-thick mask. Goopy enough to scoop out easily. Not so thin it runs through your fingers, not so thick you need to chisel it off your fingers after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Procedure: Apply to clean, towel dried hair. Leave on from 5-15 minutes. At my hair care professional&#x27;s recommendation, I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily. I wash it as needed. I&#x27;ve used this product after washing as well after just wetting my hair. Putting it on then returning to the shower to rinse it out was fine since the timing wasn&#x27;t overwhelming. What worked well for me was to apply it at the beginning of my shower and leave it on while washing, exfoliating and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scheduling: Package says to use it once or twice a week for deep conditioning or daily as a standard conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effect: It left my hair soft and moisturized. On the days I used this, I didn&#x27;t need to use a leave-in conditioner. For me, that&#x27;s a very big deal because as I mentioned before I need to after other treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: At the time of this writing, the list price was almost $50 but the Amazon price was under $17. That&#x27;s pretty comparable to what I would pay for a treatment purchased at Walmart. Except this one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: It&#x27;s made in the USA and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I usually am able to find SOMETHING I don&#x27;t like about a product (usually it&#x27;s the price) but in this case, I didn&#x27;t find anything negative.That&#x27;s pretty comparable to what I would pay for a treatment purchased at Walmart.

    <li> I recently received this product to test and review for free from Insta Natural and Tomoson.  This product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve never used any type of Argan Oil before and my hair definitely needed this treatment.  After years of coloring my hair and damaging it I was able to see results immediately.  I loved the smell...reminded me of being at the beach with the coconut, jojoba, and shea butter scent!  It gave my hair life again.  My hair is shiny, smooth, and manageable again.  I highly recommend this product and will be a life time user for now on.  If you are suffering from brittle, damaged, and dull hair...you really should check this product out.  Trust me...you won&#x27;t believe the difference it will make in your hair.  I use it as a weekly conditioning treatment and have loved the results.</li>
    <li> Noticed a drastic improvement after my first use. My hair feels like it did before it became damaged from dying, heat, etc. Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this hair mask! I love that its thick and not a thin consistancy. When I first opened he product, the smell was very very strong. Almost too strong to use. BUT! Since it was for a review, I sucked it up. After I washed it out I felt an IMMEDIATE difference in my hair! I was so silky and smooth. Not to mention the strong smell faded and now there was a sweet almost almond smell. I highly recommend this product for those ladies or men who are looking for a hair mask to replenish their dry over worked hair.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try the Argan Oil Hair Mask leave in conditioner for review! Let me say that I really do like it! I had been meaning to try a deep conditioning product for a while now. I have long kinky hair that I wash and straighten with a flat iron almost daily so I was very much in need of this! The mask left my hair soft and shiny! I will recommend this product to anyone needing some TLC for their hair! :)</li>
    <li> For reasons chronological, hormonal, and medical, my once pretty good hair has become very thin, very dry, and very damaged.  My hairdresser puts a concoction on it that makes it shiny looking (but still rough feeling) for one day, and I wondered if I could, perhaps, do better.  I liked the ingredients in this hair mask, and I already like the company because of my experience with another product they make, so I decided to take a vacation from the hairdresser (ok, my physical therapist wants me to wash my own hair as exercise for my shoulders) and try this stuff.  My hair is shoulder length almost, but thin, so I used the one tablespoon amount plus a very tiny bit more, and let it sit fifteen minutes before rinsing.  I was a little bit worried that it might weigh my hair down or make it greasy looking (having read another review) but let me tell you this:  my hair rinsed clean, and now, three days later, is still very soft and full feeling, and very healthy looking.  I am waking up with unsnarled hair in the morning, which is a first.  Tomorrow is shampoo day again, and what I can tell you for sure is that I will be using this, in the one tablespoon plus a tiny bit more, again right after the shampoo.  It&#x27;s good stuff and lives up to its promise.</li>
    <li> This hair mask is absolutely incredible. It smells AMAZING, is nice and thick and creamy, and leaves your hair feeling smooth as silk -- almost like barbie doll hair. Wonderful purchase!! Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!! I noticed my split ends improve within the first week of use. Hair is stronger, hardly any split ends and its smoother. I have long hair and I do not I have to use much. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> This product in conjunction with Argan Oil Shampoo has made my hair manageable, soft and healthy looking.  I have long, thick hair that was damaged due to coloring.  I was investigating a few hair products because I needed it to calm down for my wedding.  I used this product once and began getting compliments.  I highly recommend this hair mask for color damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Not any product work like this one and I did try everything.Try it</li>
    <li> The Argan Oil hair mask hydrates my dry and breakage prone hair so well. It smells good too. I prefer to use this hair mask daily because my hair is so dry. You can use it as a standard conditioner like me or you can use it a couple times a week as needed. Just begin with the product at the scalp and work towards the end, leave in for 5 - 15 minutes then rinse. I highly recommend this hair mask whether you need it once a week or everyday this hair mask will hydrate your hair. Plus it defends against heat damage and other “external aggressors”. I received this free for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> found this hair mask for a great price, so i ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;it smells so good. and my hair feels amazing after suing it.&lt;br /&gt;goes on well, rinses out well.&lt;br /&gt;great product</li>
    <li> I rated this InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask 5 stars because it works.  It works very well.  My wife has long hair and she loves this product.  We received this product at a reduced price for review.  The product has a nice scent but does not linger after drying hair.  It is a pleasant scent to both my wife and myself, but if you don&#x27;t care for it, know that it doesn&#x27;t linger.  The best way to use this on long hair is to wash your hair and apply liberal amounts of the hair mask to your hair and continue your shower activity.  After 10 minutes or so, wash it out lightly.  Not only does it make her hair look wonderful and feel soft, it conditions the scalp and calms the itch.  I use a little every time I wash my hair just to nourish my scalp with the Argan oil.</li>
    <li> made me hair very smooth i love it i didnt imagine a cheap deep conditioner could do so much!</li>
    <li> I love this mask, my hair gets very silky after using it and also adds weight to it.</li>
    <li> This hair mask is by far the best home hair mask I have used. I just received this and used it once, my hair feels so soft, silky and shinning after one use. It smells really good also (I had thought it might not have any nice sense). I was my hair first and then towel dry my hair then put this hair mask on and wash myself. Then I wash off this hair mask as the last step. After I blow dry my hair, it really feels like I just step out of the salon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner! Follow the directions and be amazed at how soft and conditioned your hair and scalp become.</li>
    <li> This has helped my hair when I have used it. Problem is I will have to use it all the time. I have very dry frizzy natural curly hair, not tight curls, and when I use the mask it helps for the day or two but it&#x27;s application is time consuming. I leave it in 30 to 60 Minutes instead of the 3 to 5 minutes it suggest and you have to put on you hair after you have washed and cream rinsed and towel dried it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read the reviews for this product and was excited to try it out. It works great as a conditioner or to leave in for a little longer as a mask. Leaves your hair super soft and silky. I haven&#x27;t decided if i like the scent yet or not. It&#x27;s kind of a cross between sugar cookies with a hint of orange. Not unpleasant, but i don&#x27;t usually care much for vanilla scents. Still it makes your hair feel great and no greasy residue. I&#x27;d recommend checking it out.</li>
    <li> Soft and non greasy, great treat.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, courteous follow-up, and excellent product.  Highly recommended.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask. It works great on me and my daughters super thick hair. I like to leave it on for 30 mins under a shower cap and when it comes off and I rinse it out it makes our hair feel amazing. Great for natural and relaxed hair styles.</li>
    <li> Great product. Knocking off one star only because the smell is not fabulous. Someone described it as smelling orange creamsicle-like, which seems accurate (maybe a more like a &amp;#34;burnt vanilla&amp;#34; orange creamsicle, if that makes any sense). I guess I can see how some people might like it. I will use it even though I don&#x27;t like the smell because it makes my hair so soft, and the softness really lasts.</li>
    <li> Damages otherwise healthy hair.  Their other products seem decent.  Not this unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I received this from I Love to Review. This leavesy hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This hair mask is so great. Every time when I use it. I can feel the immiediately improve of my hair. Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong for me but it made my hair much softer.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask. It smells great and left my hair feeling super soft. You can&#x27;t beat the size of the container either, you only use a small portions so it will last forever! This was also super easy to apply and wash out, it won&#x27;t make a mess of your bathroom!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair mask after reading that it can also be used as a conditioner. I use several other oils in my hair and my 3 year olds very curly hair. I can honestly say that I haven&#x27;t tried this product as a mask because I&#x27;m too impatient for that. I&#x27;ve been using it several times a week as a conditioner. It does have a very strong smell (I actually like it). It has left my coarse, frizzy hair looking really shiny (not greasy) and does help reduce the frizz/fly aways. It&#x27;s too heavy to use daily and it does leave my hair looking a bit greasy the next day. As for my 3 year olds hair it has made a world of difference for brushing through those curls. It&#x27;s helping keep the tangles down as well as reducing frizz and it doesn&#x27;t leave her hair looking greasy the next day.</li>
    <li> The hair mask has made a big difference in my hair I really am happy with it</li>
    <li> I use this product weekly as a deep conditioner for my fine hair. I absolutely love the scent of this mask and how soft and healthy it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> My curly hair needs regular moisturizing nourishment. This mask delivers it perfectly. Since my hair is fine, I don&#x27;t leave it on for too long, only about 2-3 minutes. Otherwise, it becomes too limp. It is great for any type of hair. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it about once a week on my long hair, and I can tell the difference!!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for your hair.</li>
    <li> Used a big gob of Aryan Oil conditioner and put on a plastic cap and applied heat for 20 minutes.  Hair felt and looked noticeably softer. Loved the results.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good and makes my hair so soft.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product for maintaining healthy hair.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the holy grail for my hair. I bleach, dye, straighten, you name it my hair goes through it. With in one week of using this product i notice a huge change. This is a must have on your hair routine.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> Not as great as the reviews make it sound. It smells very good, but it hardly transformed my hair. I recommend ACURE Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner over this stuff--plus it&#x27;s way cheaper.</li>
    <li> I am really really impressed with this mask. My regular hair care moisturizing routine during the winter includes a regular conditioner in the shower, a leave in conditioner when I get out and once a week, I put pure coconut oil at the ends, let it soak in for 15 minutes before shampooing the crap out of it because it leaves my hair so greasy. I have to do this because I got a failed perm a year ago and it fried my ends and causes them to knot very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this item as a promotion/on sale but I was kind of desperate enough to buy it full price to see if it would be able to help alleviate some steps in my routine. I&#x27;ve tried pure argan oil before on the ends but I have to use quite a bit of it to keep the ends moisturized (I have a decent amount of fine hair) and that stuff is very expensive! The mask itself smells like.. grapefruit mixed with maybe pineapple? I haven&#x27;t quite put my finger on it yet. I&#x27;m usually not a big fruity person, I prefer a perfume scent instead but I can live with this smell. Its certainly pleasant enough and brings me to a summery location in my mind. The first time I tried it, I decided to follow the primary directions which was to use it on clean toweled dry hair for at least 15 minutes. Now, please don&#x27;t judge me for what I do next, I know it sounds counter-intuitive. I took a shower and washed my hair, shampoo only, no conditioner, then, I applied the mask to the ends (I don&#x27;t like greasy roots) and tied it in a bun. Then, I ran a hot bath (with essential oils and epsom salt for those that care) and sat in it for a good 25 minutes. That way, I don&#x27;t have to stand in the shower for 15 minutes while the mask works and run the risk of the water rinsing away the mask. Then, I rinsed away the mask. Initially, I was really impressed with how soft and silky my hair was. I swear, it was better than my normal routine. The next day, however, I was disappointed to find how greasy my hair got by the end of the day. I try very hard not to wash my hair every day. Okay, so then, I tried using it as a normal conditioner, ie., I shampooed, then applied and waited 5 minutes while in the shower before rinsing. Twenty four hours later, greasy again. I was disappointed in this product that I had such high hopes for so I went back to my normal routine for couple days before I remembered that I had an adjustment period when I first switched to sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. I decided to give it another shot. I used the mask weekly for 15 minutes, and every time I washed my hair, it was my conditioner. Two weeks later, my hair is super silky smooth and the ends never get tangled despite this harsh winter wind and I am back to washing my hair 2-3x/week without excessive grease build up. I think I&#x27;m a convert, so I&#x27;ve gotta say, I do recommend this product. One thing that I have to add, I have thick (as in a decent amount of) fine hair. I tried to use this product as a leave in conditioner (just a tiny tiny bit) at the ends on damp hair and I think its too much for me to tolerate. It builds the grease up overnight somehow. Oh, and the scent of the mask fades quickly, within the first 12 hours usually unless I have my hair up in a bun which means that since its not my favorite scent, I don&#x27;t have to smell it enough to get sick of it. That&#x27;s a tidbit probably only helpful for me, but maybe there&#x27;s someone else like me out there. :)</li>
    <li> I got this item for free to try out and it&#x27;s GREAT.... It leaves your hair nice and soft and easy to manage.  Smells great you almost want to eat it.!! I would definitely buy more after mine is over.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, so I really rely on hair masks to keep my hair healthy. This mask is great! I love how it has natural ingredients. My hair feels moisturized after I use this. I try to use it once a week to keep my hair healthy and strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a leave in conditioner. It moisturizes my hair without making it greasy and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this!!  I have such dry hair...this is giving me a more manageable and softer hair</li>
    <li> I have dry, color-treated blonde hair and I always use hair masks to keep it as healthy as possible. What I really love about InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask is that is organic and free of parabens, chemicals and silicons. The mask smells wonderful (I think is something like sweet almond, but I might be wrong) and my hair feels super soft and tangle free while I am rinsing it off. It kind of feel just as silky as when I use a mask that contains silicone in it, but here I don&#x60;t have to worry about putting a bad stuff on my hair. When my hair is dry, it feels soft and manageable. I am pleased with this mask and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;I received InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Mask complimentary for testing purposes. As always all opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair mask for long hair. I have waist length hair that is in desperate need of a haircut, with very dry ends. I tried this and my hair was smoother and softer, with my dry ends moisturized. This has a fragrance that I personally am not crazy about but it does dissipate quickly from the hair when dry. I am happy with the way it worked on my hair.</li>
    <li> This left my hair supple, hydrated and smoothed my kinky, parched,dense 4b hair after not moisturizing it for a couple of days! Did I mention it smells like vanilla cake batter? The only drawback is the 8 ounce size: If you have thick hair or long hair you should probably either order two or subscribe for delivery- you&#x27;ll definitely want more on hand.</li>
    <li> After a few times using this product, my mom&#x27;s hair looks softer and healthier.</li>
    <li> I currently use Moroccan Oil and Pureology products on my long, bleached hair that I use dryer, flat iron and wand on.  I have to baby it because I want to torture it so much. This mask is a good of quality and does just as great of a job on my hair than the much more expensive hair masks I have been using.  This will now be my new hair mask!</li>
    <li> This ismy second time using this product.  I AM IN LOVE!!!!! I have colored my hair over 7 times in the past 2 years and my poor hair for so damaged from the lifting and coloring.  This conditioner has brought my hair back to life.  The last lift I got completely fried my hair.  It was brittle and hard, I just was not happy.  I thought about cutting it all the way off but now that I started using this, I don&#x27;t have to.  My hair feels amazing and it&#x27;s affordable.  I&#x27;ve spent hundred of dollars on treatments and conditioners, this product is the answer.  I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle today!!!!</li>
    <li> This works!!! I have long fine hair that I dye every month and it was dry and frizzy I tried coconut oil and tons of different conditioners that didn&#x27;t help but this gavee new hair!! Fizz is gone! I can run my fingers straight through like silk!!! I put it in a ponytail and put this on the pony and covered it with a ziplock and went to bed for 5 hours then shampooed it and used regular consitioner and it air dried perfect with a little wave!!! The reveiws were right and it&#x27;s worth $25!!!</li>
    <li> Sometimes I stray away from hair products that say &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in the title because I have really fine hair that is easily weighed down, but this mask is super hydrating and doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, curly/wavy/frizzy hair, and honestly this did close to nothing for me. I went through the whole container and used it as directed, but it didn&#x27;t help my hair at all. I was hoping this would help my severe dryness (I have bleached highlights and my hair is suffering), but I was pretty disappointed, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I used a very small amount- I have shoulder length thin hair but a lot of it. I did not have the time to put the cap on, so I just used it and let it sit in my hair while I showered. I rinsed it out and styled my hair as usual. My hair was soft and silky. I don&#x27;t care for the smell at all, but my hair did not have the smell once I blew it dry.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff so much - she keeps raving about how healthy her hair feels after using it. Her unexpected bonus is that it seems that her hair is holding a wave really nicely after treating herself to an Argan Oil hair mask.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair mask. It smells amazing and makes my hair feel great!</li>
    <li> This is such a great hair mask. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my hair looks and feels amazing. It doesn&#x27;t contain any nasty chemicals, so I use it on my young daughters hair too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair masks, and this has been the worst so far. I&#x27;m only giving it two stars so I don&#x27;t seem like one of those melodramatic one-star reviewers. I have super long, thick, color treated hair. I only wash it 2-3 times a week so the ends don&#x27;t dry out, and I use hair masks every time I wash instead of regular conditioner. This particular hair mask has a sickening smell to it, which I could have overlooked if it had worked well. The mask did nothing to condition or moisturize my hair. It felt like it disappeared into my hair no matter how much I put on, and always left it a tangly mess. Really, I can&#x27;t think of a single good thing about it. Fekkai Prx Reparatives Mask is a much better option. You can actually tell a difference in your hair with the Fekkai mask, and it smells great. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EYZY6AC/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> No difference after using three times.  Smelled yucky.  Won&#x27;t bother using again.</li>
    <li> I only started using this last night and immediately after washing hair with it, i noticed a difference. This stuff is actually pretty damn good. My hair was so soft and still is. My hair feels very moisturized and smooth. Not to mention my hair looked thick. I have natural hair and seeing the difference was amazing. I am willing to use this again. I wish they sell big containers because i am almost done using the one i have. I think i found THE ONE!! Im already in love with this. The only thing is though, although the smell is not bad. It smells like food. it is not a bad scent, it just makes you feel hungry lol</li>
    <li> I love this! I have noticeably less split ends now than I did a week ago. I was worried it might make my fine hair greasy and look weighed down, but instead my hair is soft and shiny. I will buying this again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair. After using this for the first time I saw a noticeably difference. It was very easy to rinse out, which I&#x27;m flad. Some products are very gritty and hard to rinse out, but not this one. I would definitely recommend this to others to try.</li>
    <li> I hate to only give this 3 stars....as I love InstaNatural&#x27;s products.  I would be interested in knowing if any other people with processed/fuzzie hair found this product to not create a smooth outcome?  I noticed it rinses out well, some other products seem to leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34;.  But&lt;br /&gt;since I have fine/ fuzzy hair this did not work well for my me.&lt;br /&gt;Could be I need to just dump 32 oz of oil on my head!  :-/</li>
    <li> Not big on the smell and appearance on the product. Its any okay item</li>
    <li> Me and my girls have been using this for a few weeks.  We mostly use it as a conditioner in the shower as opposed to a mask that stays on a long time.  Our hair has been soft and shiny each time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m growing my hair out and this did magic to my ends and help with tangling. I found my hair felt soft and moisturized. Not too heavy either with fine hair which means I didn&#x27;t have oily/greasy hair after washing it out.</li>
    <li> I love all of the InstaNatural products I&#x27;ve tried so far. Their formulas are excellent and they use premium and natural ingredients. I&#x27;ve only used the hair mask a few times, but I can see a difference in my hair. It also smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I have not really seen any Improvement in my hair by using this product</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t finely day for all this product works because it seems impossible to use properly in my lifestyle. It requires 5-10 minutes in towel dried hair. Well I don&#x27;t have time to take a shower, dry my hair, apply this product, waste 10 minutes then get back in the shower to rinse. I have a newborn and a toddler and am lucky to get a shower at all. Also smells really bad. But, I love argon oil for so other uses so I&#x27;m sure if I had that kind of time and could give it a try I world like this product also.</li>
    <li> After one use I am hooked. My hair and skin suffer a lot during the winter and I wish I had discovered InstaNatural months ago. I used this hair mask today and I am extremely happy with the results. Background: I have medium length dark brown hair, 75% has been bleached very blond to allow for bright colors to be added which has made my hair damaged and mildly frizzy, and I suffer from moderate dry scalp during the winter months(no dandruff shampoo or other treatments have helped). I followed the directions on the label and massaged into scalp to the tips and let sit on my hair for 15 minutes. A little goes a long way and I barely made a dent in the product. Rinsing took as long as using regular conditioner. I let my hair air dry just to see the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;The mask left my hair shiny, soft, and with minimal frizz! My scalp flakiness has decreased by 80-90%. The portions of my hair that are dyed bright colors seem more intense and my ends are soft, not dry and brittle. I am looking forward to testing this against this summers enemies, sun and ocean water!&lt;br /&gt;Another plus, according to the Amazon description and their own webpage, InstaNatural has a crazy long return policy.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for people with course, curly hair. I wash my hair daily and it&#x27;s usually quite dry and lifeless. InstaNatural replenished the natural oils and my hair is much softer and looks healthy with a minimal of two hair masks a week. My damaged hair is slowly rebuilding to it&#x27;s original natural soft curly state.</li>
    <li> It really make my hair smooth. really recommend.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE... I am I heaven.. I have dry processed hair..  I&#x27;ve used it 3x now, &amp;  my hair looks &amp; feels great..I am so happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen with all The InstaNatural Products..</li>
    <li> For testing and giving my honest opinion on my results I have recieved his product for free. The fragrance is very pleasant and mild, a BIG plus for me, as I live with serious asthma. I tried it as a leave in conditioner and an instant conditioner also. I was thrilled with my results. I&#x27;m 53, &amp; my hair is down to my waist. I realy loved the instant results of first the feel, so silky soft, and the radiant shine!!! My daughter commented on that right away!!! She has cut my hair for the last 6years, and knows my hair well enough to notice a wonderful change. She now uses it also!! I&#x27;m very glad to be using this product!!! :)</li>
    <li> Being a cosmetologist I have tried many salon brands of hair products. I have been using hair masks for years on myself and clients and I&#x27;m always excited to discover something new. InstaNatural Argan Oil hair mask is PERFECT for anyone with color treated, heat damaged, frizzy, dry, or chemically treated hair. It penetrates deep into the hair to nourish and repair damage. It hydrates the hair and reveals softer, shinier, and healthier looking hair. The ingredients in this hair mask are natural and it contains Argan Oil, Amino Acid Complex, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Vitamin B5, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil and more. You just let it penetrate the hair strand for 15 minutes and shampoo it out. It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to rinse out. Those 15 minutes a day, once a week, will help maintain soft and healthy hair. I love how soft my hair is after using this. I have less frizz, it&#x27;s easy to style, and I get more volume! It also smells nice too! I love this stuff and highly recommend it. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes of taming my naturally curly (and frizzy in humidity) colored hair. The mask is easy to use and as others have said, it smells wonderful! I usually hate scents in hair products. This smells fresh, natural, exactly what hair in summer should smell like. :-) I&#x27;ve used it as a deep conditioner and also as a regular conditioner after each shampoo. I love it. This will be a staple in my hair care. I also am using the Argan oil drops in my hair from the same company to control flyaways. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have bought this 3 times now.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have used a couple of other hair masks in the past, such as a few of Shea Moisture&#x27;s. I was never fully satisfied. There was always something missing. So I kept searching and I searched and searched. Well, I have finally found it: Instanatural Argan Oil Hair Mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hair Mask is perfect: (1) the moisture is awesome; (2) the amino acids do 10 times a better job than the normal proteins would; (3) and then to top it, there is one silicone close to the bottom of the ingredient list. I am done searching for hair masks! I will be buying this for life (as long as they don&#x27;t change the recipe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they can start making shampoos too (argan oil ones). I think the best shampoo is the type that is made with Aloe Vera, either some glycerine or honey, and no silicone/cabomer or Methylisothiazolinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for this great product. I plan to try more of your products in the future.</li>
    <li> This mask is a great moisturizing treatment if you are struggling with dry, frizzy hair.  Twice a week, I have used this instead of my daily conditioner and left it in for a few hours.  It was easier to blow dry my hair straight than it usually is.  My ends look much smoother.  I used this product for a month before posting my review because I wanted to see cumulative results...And I did.  This hair mask also smells great...Almost like candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an advocate for animal welfare, I appreciate that this product is cruelty free.  If every consumer would buy cruelty free only, it would force companies to use some compassion.  As someone who is licensed, I have used the best of the best in beauty/hair products and my standards are pretty high.  I can recommend this mask just as much as I could a professional product that would cost 3x&#x27;s as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for creating such affordable, effective products with compassion in mind.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly, coarse, dry, and unruly thick hair. After just one month of using Argan Oil Mask, my hair looks shiner and healthier. The only problem I see in the future, is that I need to buy more because I need a lot more product in my hair to maintain these great results.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised. GREAT product! I am 58 years old and my hair feels so soft. This product will remain in my hair care regime for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love all the different organic oils that are in this product! My hair is sensitive to anything with sulphates in them. I&#x27;m happy to say that this product has no sulphates. It made my hair soft, silky, and fresh. I have frizzy hair, so this product made a world of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product to review. I&#x27;m a blogger that was chosen by the company to review this product. The company does not influence my review.</li>
    <li> made my hair smooth and worked wonders on my split ends. After the 2nd application I was split end free again.</li>
    <li> great deep conditioner. Argan oil is great! I have been using it often.</li>
    <li> So far I really like it. The smell is so good, and it feels so good on my hair. I&#x27;ve also used it as conditioner, and it worked great for that too.</li>
    <li> Ok so my girlfriend bought this for me given I have very curly usually dry frizzy hair, I have been using the product as a regular conditioner for about 5 days and I can already see the changes on my hairs aspect. I workout heavily everyday plus having to work in a construction enviorment with alot of dust floating around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Girlfriend always complained about my hair no it seems the complaints have stopped, Lets see what a few weeks of this product can do for my hair. It smells great, easy to rinse and leaves my hair feeling soft and its starting too look much different.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of using this product, I have noticed an improvement with dry hair and irritated scalp.</li>
    <li> I have vert kinky and curly 4a natural hair. This product although doesnt have the slip I look for, does moisturize my hair A LOT. It also makes me hair feels more resilient</li>
    <li> Unimpressed! It made my hair soft, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. My hair is wavy naturally, very thick, and does not look silky. I was hoping this would transform my hair. I&#x27;ve had other products that worked better. I paid more for this product than I did my other stuff that worked better. I now use it in my daughter&#x27;s long(already silky) hair, and it just makes it soft, nothing extraordinary. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This s*** made my hair feel gross. Dry, frizzy,  tangled and just gross. My hair was softer and more conditioned before I used this product, now I have to figure out how to fix it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It worked well for my wife, it was easier comb her hair.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product - I think it did a good job of making my hair soft, smooth, and more manageable - I have thick curly hair that is unruly most of the time - but this was a nice dose of moisture that made my curls soft.</li>
    <li> i received this product for free from tomoson.com for my unbiased opinion. the mask leaves your hair very soft and smells nice.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this was how thick and creamy the mask was. It applies sort of like a lotion, using your hands to scoop it from the container and lather it over your hair. It is simple to apply and takes only seconds to spread over your entire head. You can instantly feel a change in the hair softness when using this. It took me a couple of scoops to get enough for all of my hair, but it is down to my waist so that was expected. Once I had it all covered, I allowed it to soak in as directed before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions for this hair mask say to apply it to clean, towel dried hair. I wanted to avoid having to get in and out of the shower, so I washed my hair as usual, towel dried it while still in the shower and applied the mask, letting it soak in while shaving.This allowed me to use the mask while finishing my shower and avoid wasting time. I learned to take the lid off ahead of time too, so I could avoid trying to do it with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this a couple of times, I noticed a shine and softness that wasn&#x27;t there before. My hair felt fuller and had less frizzy strands and hair loss too.I could see a change myself, but really knew it was working when others commented on the difference. I imagine if you didn&#x27;t have the beginning damage that I did, you would probably get even better results. I plan to continue using this to see if my results get even better with more use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample for review purposes. All opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> Wow, the water on base has destroyed my hair, but after my first use my hair feels so much better!</li>
    <li> This mask is the most hydrating thing I&#x27;ve ever experienced for my hair! Personally, my hair near the roots tends to get oily and when I put it all the way up, it was kind of weighed down... however the next time I used it, I put it from my ears down ONLY and WOW what a difference. The citrus-y scent was lovely but almost overpowering (I still liked it thought). I think this is the perfect thing to do once a month or so to give your hair a hydrating boost. InstaNatural continues to use so many quality, organic and natural ingredients in their products, which is something I really look for. I received this promotionally for review, but all opinions remain my own.</li>
    <li> This product was not for me.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  So, I didn&#x27;t use it because of that. However the seller was very accommodating and refunded my money.</li>
    <li> I have very curly sometimes frizzy hair. I have a hard time finding a product that adds moisture to my hair with making it look greasy. The last thing you want it freshly washed hair the looks like you haven’t showered in two week.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try the Instanatural argan oil hair mask for free in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to try this hair mask. I use argan oil on a regular basis I love it. The hair mask was so much better than just plain ole hair oil. It is really thick so you don’t need much at all. I use it after regular conditioning to give me a deep conditioning treatment. I have been using it on my hair as well as my daughters. She has very long thick curly hair so this has been a godsend! It has been so much easier to brush her hair and she doesn’t have crazy frizz. It makes our curls look more defined and bouncy. I love love love this product. Instanatural is one of the best brands out there. I will have to continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I typically go into using ANY hair mask with much skepticism. This one was no different. When I received it I opened it and off the bat, I LOVED the smell. To me, it almost smells like sugar cookies. Being someone who LOVES sweet smells like that, I was sold on that part immediately. The directions say to leave the mask on your hair for 15 minutes...and even though I&#x27;m usually someone who will leave a mask on MUCH longer, I decided to test this within the limits of what the directions said. I washed my hair, saturated it with the mask and put a shower cap on before setting the timer for 15 minutes. The product feels very heavy to me...and that&#x27;s probably the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it. After I washed it out, my hair felt SO soft and smooth...but, as I feared, the heaviness left my curls a bit droopy. I&#x27;ll take that as a drawback for the amount of moisture this imparted on my hair, though! Before this, the only mask I TRULY liked was the Macadamia Oil mask...this one has won me over, though! This mask will be taking that ones place in my shower for my weekly deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> Love it hydrates my hair which is very dry, curly and brittle! I don&#x27;t typically review products but this is a great hair mask.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. I LOVE this stuff. I really like the sugary vanilla smell and  I am hoping it will improve the condition of my hair overall! Definitely will buy again. This is a huge jar and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> My hair needs that healthy moisturizing mask for a transition from curly to straight. I love Insta Natural products and this hair mask does not disappoint. It&#x27;s easy to apply, and gives great results.  The citrus-y smell is great, and the way it feels is like a massage to my scalp. My hair feels soft and nourished after the mask and it is super shiny. That&#x27;s enough of a result for me.</li>
    <li> Loving this hair mask.  It gives my hair a shiny look and fluffy/soft sensation, and the smell is sweet and pleasant. The organic ingredients brings peace of mind and is environmental friendly.</li>
    <li> I have thick, natural hair (no chemicals), and I have tried a few hair mask. Insta Natural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Mask is by far the best I have used.</li>
    <li> Great product. The deep conditioner left my hair soft and shiny. I let the conditioner sit for an hour before rinsing it out. The smell was pleasant. The conditioner wasn&#x27;t too heavy on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair was previously dry and sort of rough before using the conditoner. I absolutely love this conditoner.</li>
    <li> REALLY thick cream mask...a little will go a long way. You just have to work it into your hair, avoiding your roots if you are prone to any oiliness like me :)</li>
    <li> This stuff feels amazing in my hair, and has never weighed it down or made it feel gross and greasy. I just wish you could get a bigger container because I go through this stuff like crazy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy to make this purchase, It make my hair much smooth and easy to manage.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> What can I say bad about this hair mask? Nothing. I&#x27;ve being using this for well over a month and this is probably one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ver hair. It defines my curls and leaves my hair detangles and soft. If you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;Naturalista&amp;#34; like me, this is a must have. Not much product is needed like other deep conditioners to really penetrate the hair, that&#x27;s what I love most about it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells amazing too. It has been so dry in Boston with all this snow we&#x27;ve been having and the dry heat on at home that my hair has taken a toll!&lt;br /&gt;I put this on once a week for about 15 minutes and then rinsed it out.. not only does it smell really good, it made my hair feel and look really smooth and healthy!</li>
    <li> Hair is nice and soft after use.</li>
    <li> Great results. Fast shipping. Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Good product will buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice quantity. The smell is awful and product makes my hair hard after rinsing.</li>
    <li> Fantastic smell and really deep treatment.</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft &amp; healthy after using the Argan hair oil. I love it!</li>
    <li> I like this conditioning mask, however the smell can be a little overwhelming in the shower. I do feel that it works. My hair is soft and the product rinses out easily. I just wish the scent wasnt&#x27; sooo heavy.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. can not use it because it will make my hair way greasy. Yes it is a argan oil hair mask but u shouldn&#x27;t have to shampoo your hair 3 times just to go out in public. Plus, I find that the shampooing doesn&#x27;t help keep any of the conditioning in my hair so why do it? I have actually passed it on to someone else with super dry hair to see how she likes it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times since I purchased but I love it so far! I wasn&#x27;t using a hair mask before purchasing this so I can&#x27;t really compare this to other masks. However, I think this is a great product. There is an ample amount of product and it smells nice. My hair feels noticeably more moisturized after I use this mask vs not using one after I shampoo and condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my daily conditioner and I really like it. I have very curly, very dry hair and I feel like the conditioner really absorbs into my hair. It&#x27;s thick, but I don&#x27;t notice it weighing down my hair or a lot of product build-up. I don&#x27;t love the smell of the conditioner, but it&#x27;s OK and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger after you wash your hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, smells good and makes your hair super soft!</li>
    <li> This product is of exceptional quality. I noticed an immediate improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask! With just one use it made my hair feel very moisturized, soft, light and flowy, and very shiney. It smells great too! Reminds me of creamsicles. Orange sherbert and vanilla ice cream, but not too strong of a smell. It comes in a huge tub also and it will definitely last you. I feel it&#x27;s worth the price and does what it says it&#x27;ll do...plus you can&#x27;t beat all the healthy ingredients it has in it for your hair and scalp. I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Love the hair conditioner. Definitely can tell after I&#x27;ve used it. I have very straight fine hair. I often have problems with fly-aways and this helps to control them.</li>
    <li> Love.  Great for fine color treated hair</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and told it works as expected.</li>
    <li> A wonderful hair mask! My hair is usually dry and unmanageable. When I used this, my hair became soft &amp; smooth after! I don&#x27;t need to wait too long to take it off for it to work. I usually put it on a few minutes before I shower and I get the results I want.</li>
    <li> This is the most luxurious hair mask/deep conditioner I have ever experienced.  It is thick, rich, velvety smooth, has a whipped consistency and is slightly off-white with an incredibly light orange creamsicle scent.  Even with all this, it is not heavy, not too thick, not too weighty on the hair.  I really put this to the test on my dry/damaged hair, which had started to frizz up in the warm weather.  I used it in the shower and left it in for the duration of the shower, then rinsed it out at the very end.  I don&#x27;t know what I expected to happen, I guess usually when I use a coconut-oil based deep conditioner my hair looks really glossy afterwards, but takes a really long time to dry and is definitely weighed-down and heavy.  With this argan oil hair mask - my hair actually felt bouncy and light.  The scent - like I said it barely hints at creamsicle - is fantastic and doesn&#x27;t interfere with any other scented hair and bath products I am using at the time.  My hair was nourished, hydrated, healthy and happy after the very first use.  I also want to add that in my research of natural oils I found that argan oil is the closes nature has to offer in matching the oils that we naturally produce for our skin and nails - so it is easily absorbed into both skin and hair and that may be how it is able to give you moisture without the weight.</li>
    <li> This had so many great reviews I had to try it. I wish I could say it changed my life but sadly, no. I just have not had the fantastic results others seem to have had. It does condition but no more than any regular conditioner I have used. My hair goes through hell, color, hair dryer, curling iron, sun, wish I could have had better results. Will keep looking.</li>
    <li> Coloring and blow drying takes a toll on your hair. All you need is this mask to bring it back to life! It makes your hair feel soft and amazing</li>
    <li> I blow dry my hair everyday and before using the mask my hair was dry, flat, and dull. The first use with the mask it improved my hair instantly! Now my hair is fuller, has volume, and soft.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Nice daily conditioner</li>
