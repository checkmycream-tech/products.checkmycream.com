      <li>The packaging needs to be better.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s a cheap price.</li>

      <li>Eye Shadow Is Very Cheap And Comes Off Really Fast</li>
      <li>how true it is to it&#x27;s appearance.</li>
      <li>and I really thought I was going to love this</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
      <li>They dont have real lasting power unless you use a really good primer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to my make up because i put on eyeshadow everyday and i love these palettes! so many different colors and they stay on all day and look very nice.</li>
    <li> Great colors love them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. It came in right on time. The colors are beautiful.   The case was cracked, but that doesn&#x27;t matter as all the eyeshadows were intact and perfect. Can&#x27;t wait to start wearing them!    Thank you amazon for bring us great products at great prices!</li>
    <li> This product look great and came earlier then expected. The only downside would have to be that one of the eyeshadows came out and It wont stay in, other then that it was good.</li>
    <li> I meam come on it was 6 bucks. The plastic case they are housed is is super brittle and breaks easy. When i first got it three of the shadows in one case and two in the other were broken and it was a mess! But once I got it cleaned up I started to use them. They break up super easy so be careful Or a huge power mess you will have. They also have alot of shimmer to them. Which is fine but not what i was expecting. They dont have real lasting power unless you use a really good primer. But like I said itwas only 6 bucks. I have had it for two years now and still use it. Also it doesnt come with the tools that the picture shows.</li>
    <li> My daughter liked these color shades that I bought her but I will say that they are alil shallow to me. But great for the price!</li>
    <li> It was much smaller than I had anticipated. But I guess that&#x27;s a good thing? Very portable. The colors are nice, shiny and sparklely.</li>
    <li> Cheap priced but alright quality. If you are THINKING about buying it, just do it, good buy for the price and descnt quality.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Got it in like 4 days. Came perfectly wrapped and no broken shadows! It was bubbled wrapped and in packing peanuts. Soo happy. The size of the shadows is about nickel size. Bright beautiful colors plus I couldn&#x27;t beat the price. Can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow!! They go on easy, and look fabulous. The colors stand out, and are very bright. They also have a nice silky sparkle &amp; shine to them. The eyeshadow is durable, and lasts all day. Plus, the variety is awsome for such a low price! I would honestley recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Received mine in the mail today it came in bubble wrap as well as package peanuts. The colors were in one piece. Seem to be very pigmented and vibrant cant wait to explore and experiment with these shades, thanks Emori Collections!</li>
    <li> Awesome colors, love it a lot, but, I was expecting the dark browns and blacks to be a bit more pigmented and last longer.</li>
    <li> would buy again love the colors</li>
    <li> I gave this eyeshadow palette this rating because it was shipped to me all broken up. In both palettes, I had eyeshadow that was all crushed up. This is a beautiful eyeshadow, it last a long time, and it is good quality for its price, but I think that whoever packed the eyeshadow package should of done a better job in packing it so that the eyeshadow wouldn&#x27;t be broken while shipped! Other than that, I think this is a wonderful eyeshadow palette!!!</li>
    <li> Packing was not done properly and product arrived broken. Not worth sending back so I ended up having to throw it out. Will definitely not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow pallette the colors are very pigmented the price was not bad cant wait to try them..</li>
    <li> These eye shadows are very nice. The only thing was when I received them,  two of the colors came apart but it&#x27;s okay it was a very good deal</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping it came three days faster than it stated but two colors were broken in one and one color in the other going to have to clean it up and try to be easy with the rest. Definitely not for travel they seem fragile but most pressed powders are.</li>
    <li> These are a softer eye shadow than I expected. Not in the color but just be careful you don’t use to much force when applying to brush. Very little pressure goes along way. I would expect to pay more for the quality actually. I didn’t have high hopes when I purchased these but was very surprised and pleased. Large array of colors with a hint of glitter. You can get dramatic or softer looks with each color. Depends on where you’re going. Goes on nice and smooth. A lot of eye shadow out there, as you put it on leaves excess brush off on your cheeks or eyelashes. These don’t and that is very important to me. I am not a fan of having to wet a tissue to wash the powder off of my cheeks and under my eyes, with a tendency to spear all over. The colors are exactly what you see. Arrived on time. Small issue with one of the colors being destroyed and scattered all over the inside but open it and blow into the trash and that took care of that.</li>
    <li> Nice colors and good quality.I have only used a couple so far but am very pleased and have also found that they go on better with other brushes then the ones provided</li>
    <li> I liked the color selection it has, but the only negative thing I have to say is when it arrived some of the shades where broken.</li>
    <li> The product seems to be quite good for the price, and the packaging was extensive...I was almost positive that the packaging would have kept them intact, and it did. All but one of the colors was completely intact and beautifully colored. It comes as two 24-color palettes, each about the size of your hand, and a two-sided application brush in each.</li>
    <li> Well it was not the one I seen pictures of.  I had all this dark colors in the and it came to me broken. So I had to go on ebay to purchase another eye shadow palette. Which had the elegant colors and was price a little less .</li>
    <li> I got this item and I really thought I was going to love this but when I got it almost half of one of the case was destroyed and plus the textures were just not right so I don&#x27;t think I will ever purshase this item again</li>
    <li> the quality is good but received it damage. Wish it didn&#x27;t come smear into each other.The packaging needs to be better.</li>
    <li> OMG  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! PACKAGE CAME TOTALLY BROKEN IN A MILLION PIECES!!!! AS SOON AS I STUCK MY HAND IN THE PACKAGE I CAME OUT WITH THE MOST DISGUSTING SHADES OF BROWN YOU COULD IMAGINE----I DIDNT EVEN KNOW SUCH DISGUSTING SHADES OF BROWN WERE IMAGIGNABLe!!!!!  ONLY 2 SHADES WERE USABLE----PLEASE, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS DISGUSTING MESS OF AWFULNESS!!!!  I AM A MAKEUP ARTIST AND ALL I COULD DO WAS TO THROW OUT THIS MESS ASAP!!!!!  LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR COLORED SHADOWS----THIS IS A RIPOFF AND TOTALLY A WASTE!!!  I CANT EVEN GIVE IT 1 STAR!!!!!</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow was delivered promptly and wasn&#x27;t damaged in any way. I really like the way the shadow feels the texture. It goes on very smoothe. The shadow does have a powdery smell but not overwhelming. I personaly just use it for special occasions because its definitly more glittery than I thought. You do need to be careful when storing because the shadow does chip easily. Also using primer helps it stay longer. Overall this product was worth the money. I would definitly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today for my girlfriend and four colors in a palette were shattered witch made the whole palette unusable. The other had one shattered but we blew it clean. She loves the colors but cannot use the second palette witch sucks! regretting my purchase.</li>
    <li> It is a good choice with a good price.</li>
    <li> To shades broke, but very go quality for the price</li>
    <li> Eye Shadow Is Very Cheap And Comes Off Really Fast</li>
    <li> Well it is a good product and the colors are nice. But should have been mailed in a better container. Two colors when opened were just powder all over the other colors. I do really love the colors they are very nice to work with</li>
    <li> The packaging was perfect.. It arrived early and only one color was was broken.. They are very shimmery.. Over all I am very happy with the product..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter when I received it some of the colours were damaged - when applied it just did not meet her expectation.  Would not recommend to other friends</li>
    <li> My makeup palettes arrived in 5 days- in one palette I had 3 broken eyeshadows, my palettes were only bubble wrapped, no packing peanuts as I heard some other people mention, I requested that they send me a replacement and in a few short days the new palette arrived, This time they bubble wrapped my palette and put packing peanuts in the envelope and it arrived perfect~ I was very impressed with the company, they corrected the problem with no complaints or hassle and they didn&#x27;t make me wait forever to receive my makeup! That&#x27;s AWESOME~ THANK YOU! I really love the colors in these makeup kits! I am very happy I ordered this makeup, 48 eyeshadows for under $6.00~ Seriously? I love it!</li>
    <li> I received the package earlier than expected one of the containers was flawless the other had a broken eye shadow color that spread all over the other colors. I didn&#x27;t like that color anyways so I&#x27;m not going to go through the trouble to return it.</li>
    <li> The colors i really like but the quality could be a little better. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed but I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything like MAC makeup off of amazon. Pretty good for its price though.</li>
    <li> This product is fairly nice for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel there is any cons on this product , very nice ! Loved it</li>
    <li> When I received the item half the colours were destroyed. They had crumbled the container was a mess. A few colours were ok but i sure had less than 48 colours to use.</li>
    <li> These colors are beautiful and vibrant.  The price us very reasonable. I love the way it goes on. It arrived very well packaged and not one was broken. I will be ordering more. They are a good size too</li>
    <li> I brought this as a gift for my sister-in-law and she loved it,awesome collection and i am also planning to buy one more for myself.</li>
    <li> Lasts all day. Beautiful colors, very girly :)</li>
    <li> the shipping damaged most of the product that I couldn&#x27;t even use it. the left over product that I could use doesn&#x27;t really apply on the eyes and you have to put alot of it on in order for the color to finally show.</li>
    <li> So happy with my purchase.  The colors wear well through my work day, no need to reapply.  You don&#x27;t need much to see the color show on your lids. The cases are great for travel. I am very happy with these shadows.</li>
    <li> One of the eye shadow was messing when I got this it was missing a eye shadow and every thing was messed up and melted</li>
    <li> Great makeup!! Bright amazing colors. Great price! Shipped fast! After wearing the eye shadow all day. No crease!! Even with more expensive makeup I always get creases. I am so happy with this makeup!! I recommended it to my friends!!</li>
    <li> Just because this didn&#x27;t have a high price tag on it, doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t good. I bought this a while ago and it has great pigmentation. This one was great for a great price. Many colors to choose from. I think the brand name was Emori and I have brought several other items from this brand and all had a great color pay off.</li>
    <li> Love the colors they match the picture it shows. I have no complaints the makeup is worth the price I paid. Also has a great variety of colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> Very good eyeshadow for the price.  Made great gifts&lt;br /&gt;for all the girls in my family.  I even bought one for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit, I found it to be better eyeshadow than most&lt;br /&gt;drug store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was good... not great.  Only one small shadow was broken&lt;br /&gt;and I was fine with that, considering I ordered 5 :)</li>
    <li> was purchaced as gift came on time and was a good quality would recomend and will be sure to buy again myself.</li>
    <li> Came in within 2 days but maybe because i lived so close. Nothing was broken and came in very good condition. Both palette is called Amuse. The emit a odor that is like baby powder and roses maybe an old lady smell but i usually ignore it. Use it with a base and it&#x27;ll last a very long time without creasing. Some colors you have to pack on or else it&#x27;ll be opaque. But over all they are so pigmented. It is a powdery eyeshadow. For me there was only little fall out. some of the colors seemed to be very close to eachother. The palette dates that it&#x27;ll only last 24 months but I think it&#x27;s good enough. Overall I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love it, was a little worried after reading the reviews but now of the Colorado were broken. They show up great lots of fun to play with</li>
    <li> excelente producto buena presentación y servicio de primera me encanta deseo hacer en el futuro mas compras con ustedes gracias</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail 4 days after and i was worried that some might be broken. I was so happy everything is intact, was wrapped well with bubble and non of the shadows are broken. Been using it for a week now and impressed with the product...it does really good consedering it&#x27;s a cheap price. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> unicas q barbaridad me gustan</li>
    <li> Some colors are not quite as pigmented as I would like, but perhaps that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t currently have a base or primer. Until then, this might not be a very fair review, but it&#x27;s my first impression.  UPDATE  Now that I have a cream base for these shadows, I can say the color payoff is much better than on bare skin. I usually use just neutrals, but these two pallets may be a good starter to being more fun with my color choices.    These shadows are very soft, and VERY shimmery, which can be an issue when wiping away fallout. The sparkles just stay behind, making a damp tissue a possible necessity for everyday use.     Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased. My package arrived right on time, and everything was intact. The one flaw I see, is that the mirror is too small and skinny to be of any use.</li>
    <li> I really like the colors and how true it is to it&#x27;s appearance. Fast shipping, delivered all the way to Hawaii in perfect condition. Only downfall is I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s tested on animals.</li>
    <li> All of my colors were broke not worth the money!!!! It was just a big mess!!!! I was so excited to get this make up cause I love make up and when I opened it I was let down!!!!</li>
    <li> i got my eye shadow  and it was actually bigger then i expected so i was impressed however they are NOT sturdy! i dropped one NOT far from ground so didnt hit hard... but several of them shattered!! havent used them yet waiting on my other products i ordered so i can try it all out together... but put some on my hand and colors were nice and bright like i like</li>
    <li> Hi sir the palette is cream or paowder pleas tell me?</li>
    <li> There is a lot of fallout with these shadows, some of mine were broken and all over the box. Shipping was okay. I guess for the price is is a good product and good for first timers and such..Pretty colors though</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!! It came before it was suppose to. The colors are so vibrant and they last all day!!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a Christmas gift and she loved it!</li>
