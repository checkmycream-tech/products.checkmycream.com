      <li>It&#x27;s working excellent.</li>
      <li>This is the best product ever.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome product!!!</li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>Thank you for great service.</li>
      <li>Builds and strenghtens you nails and works wonderfully with or without nailpolish on top.</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with my shipment.  </li>
      <li>My nails felt strong and healthy and LOOKED GREAT!  </li>
      <li>great product, so i decided to try the Nail Shield because my nails would grow but they would break too easily.</li>
      <li>I am on week 2 now of using this product and am so thrilled with it, I bought a set for my mom and sister.  </li>
      <li>It really works wonders and the service was equally awesome!!!</li>
      <li>I recently discovered Mavala products and I am always impressed with the results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My nails have never looked better.</li>
      <li>so I just finish it off with a top coat (I&#x27;m a perfectionist)</li>
      <li>I have been looking for Mavala Nail  Shield for years and finally found it very very happy</li>
      <li>Mavala is a Swiss brand, and the formula for this nail hardene is outstanding.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly and looks great without a color on top if you don&#x27;t have time to do a full manicure.</li>
      <li>the nails still don&#x27;t feel completely smooth</li>
      <li>and this duo really works!!!</li>
      <li>Since then I have experienced only one damage incident, and that was from a particularly stubborn pistachio nut shell.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the flexible way without much success.  </li>
      <li>Do not hesitate to buy it, it is completely worth the price.</li>
      <li>In the photo of the product, they show the nail hardener (the one that has the microfibers) and the coating, kind of pink.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this Mavala Nail Shield, I did not like it.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>When I first used this two-stage product, seven of my fingernails were suffering from tears, rips, splits and snags.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy it because it really works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a Flight Attendant</li>
      <li>It really does protect the nails</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really help my nails as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>For me, I just put this extra layer of clear enamel, but you can just use it without any other coating on top and you will love it.</li>
      <li>The color is natural and really makes the nails look pretty.  </li>
      <li>As opposed to other products that require a fresh coat applied daily to clean nails</li>
      <li>I had a party that very day, which required lots of dishes and laundry and general house cleaning and the manicure survived!</li>
      <li>but  so far there seems to be hope</li>
      <li>I bought this to repair my soft, peeling nails.  </li>
      <li>The reason: it has some kind of microscopic fibers, transparent, that make the surface of the nails uneven even after applying the second coat of the treatment which is supposed to fill the little gaps that those fibers leave.</li>
      <li>Well, it is not &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; it a very subtle pinkish, almost natural, that you could even wear without any other color on top.</li>

    <li> I had artificial nails on for three months and removed them.  I bought this to repair my soft, peeling nails.  Follow the directions and do it faithfully.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works!</li>
    <li> Helps protect nails. Takes several months to see a change b/c of length of time for nails to grow. Dries quickly and looks great without a color on top if you don&#x27;t have time to do a full manicure.</li>
    <li> it does not toughen my nails for playing guitar, its a nail polish</li>
    <li> I have picked at my nails all my life and then had acrylic for the last couple of years so growing my natural nails was no easy task. As opposed to other products that require a fresh coat applied daily to clean nails (Extremely tedious not to mention nail polish remover dries out skin) This stuff you apply once a week. The color is natural and really makes the nails look pretty.  This stuff really works! I saw a visible difference after 1 week! It really does protect the nails, I wash my hands constantly working in the hospital and would always break nails and snag them on stuff, until I discovered nail shield! I recently discovered Mavala products and I am always impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;While phase 1 makes the nails rough and even after phase 2 the nails still don&#x27;t feel completely smooth so I just finish it off with a top coat (I&#x27;m a perfectionist)</li>
    <li> I have to say that this product met my expectations I would buy it again. Thank you for great service.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. It did not make my nails strong and about half way through the bottle it started getting really thick and I was forced to put a thicker layer and it would take a long time to dry.</li>
    <li> Builds and strenghtens you nails and works wonderfully with or without nailpolish on top. I especially like the fiber. Put two coats of Phase 2 on and you can wear it like it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working excellent.</li>
    <li> For some reason my nails split well below the tip.  This two part system does help protect nails, but has done nothing for the splitting.</li>
    <li> When it arrived one bottle was broken but that was no biggie. My money was immediately refunded, so I could purchase again!! This is an awesome product!!! It really works wonders and the service was equally awesome!!!</li>
    <li> it has a bitter taste and I think twice before bite my nails but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Finally i have found the solution to my thin peeling nails. Forget all the other products out there. This duo lays down a hard protective coat that stays on for days. I&#x27;m a Flight Attendant and I&#x27;m really hard on my nails and this duo really works!!!</li>
    <li> The directions are hard to understand if you are not used to using this product. Once you apply as directed but leave it on for the week. Take it off then repeat. Hope that clarifies things for future users!</li>
    <li> Did not make my nails harder or stronger. Did not stay on my nails. Peeled and chipped off.</li>
    <li> It is a bit too soon to tell if the nails get stronger but  so far there seems to be hope</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really help my nails as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my shipment.  I have been looking for Mavala Nail  Shield for years and finally found it very very happy</li>
    <li> I suffer from paper thin nails that can grow a bit long and pretty, but are paper thin and always peel and then break. Any manicure would fail in less than a day because of this.  Having to do dishes was a punishment, because it would make my nails so weak that polish wouldnt stick to them and they would peel even worse.  I tried strengthaning polish and glitter polish to create a thick shield, but no luck.  I had given up and would just keep them cut short, but even short, they would still peel back.  I did a search on products that would help and tried every over the counter &#x27;nail hardener&#x27; or &#x27;for soft peeling nails&#x27; with little result.  Finally, I stumbled on this product and instantly - after ONE APPLICATION felt like my nails were finally going to make through the day! I had a party that very day, which required lots of dishes and laundry and general house cleaning and the manicure survived! My nails felt strong and healthy and LOOKED GREAT!  I am on week 2 now of using this product and am so thrilled with it, I bought a set for my mom and sister.  Truly a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> There are two ways to prevent nail damage.  Either make them soft and flexible or make them rock hard.  I&#x27;ve tried the flexible way without much success.  When I first used this two-stage product, seven of my fingernails were suffering from tears, rips, splits and snags.  I applied two coats on successive days.  Since then I have experienced only one damage incident, and that was from a particularly stubborn pistachio nut shell.  If you want really rock hard nails, try this.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever. My nails have never looked better. Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy it because it really works.</li>
    <li> I already knew the brand, Mavala, as I used to bite my nails... but that changed after using &amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34; great product, so i decided to try the Nail Shield because my nails would grow but they would break too easily. The first time I used this Mavala Nail Shield, I did not like it. The reason: it has some kind of microscopic fibers, transparent, that make the surface of the nails uneven even after applying the second coat of the treatment which is supposed to fill the little gaps that those fibers leave. I solved the problem by applying another coat of a nail polisher. Great. Problem solved. The fact is that since I have started using this product, I have not had one single nail broken.. .unbelievable, but true. Mavala is a Swiss brand, and the formula for this nail hardene is outstanding. Do not hesitate to buy it, it is completely worth the price. In the photo of the product, they show the nail hardener (the one that has the microfibers) and the coating, kind of pink. Well, it is not &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; it a very subtle pinkish, almost natural, that you could even wear without any other color on top. For me, I just put this extra layer of clear enamel, but you can just use it without any other coating on top and you will love it.</li>
