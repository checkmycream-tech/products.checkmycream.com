      <li>--Dove has great soap-</li>

      <li>Also it&#x27;s nice and creamy.   </li>
      <li>It will make your hair look nice and shiny.</li>
      <li>So to get to it; this Dove Nourishing Oil shampoo is so NICE to my hair.  </li>
      <li>nice i like it.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Scalp feels better.  </li>
      <li>It also feels more lightweight than the Suave.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and greatly reduces frizz.</li>
      <li>However, I gave it 3 stars because I know it probably works great for people with really damaged hair.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful and I can use this without the matching conditioner and still have soft and smooth hair-</li>
      <li>I really like is how my ends seem so happy with this shampoo (</li>
      <li>Hair manages better.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>Like the Suave shampoo, this shampoo is moisturizing but does a much better job at taming frizz.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of shampoo&#x27;s from many years ago.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s new, as for me, nothing is more important than it&#x27;s new condition, The good smell and good condition, I like it</li>
      <li>Also, the scent of this shampoo is really lovely and fresh.</li>
      <li>i cant ever find a shampoo or conditioner or any product to smooth my hair</li>
      <li>It now air drys and its frizz free and shiny</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, manageable, and looks really good.   </li>
      <li>---I swear I originally thought I was going to have to cut some of my hair off</li>
      <li>--I don&#x27;t remember what shampoo I originally used that gave me the knotted mess--all</li>
      <li>Not too heavy but does a great job moisturizing.</li>
      <li>and it worked the best, but not great.</li>
      <li>thank you very much.</li>
      <li>It works, but not any better than the regular stuff.</li>
      <li>though I love the conditioner too for extra nourishment.</li>
      <li>This entire line of nutritive therapy products, shampoo, conditioner and styling cream are fabulous!</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this shampoo and will buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>This is a great shampoo for dry, coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Many of today&#x27;s shampoo&#x27;s just gum up your scalp and hair....and leave your hair and scalp dry.  </li>
      <li>My hair gets slightly dry and fizzy in the winter, on top of styling.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair in great condition without being too dry or weighted down, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend you try it!</li>
      <li>If you have oily hair I&#x27;d go with the intense damage therapy.</li>
      <li>This shampoo didn&#x27;t really work for my type of hair.</li>
      <li>I have never had a shampoo really do as it</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much of it at all to wash all your hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>If you are older and feel you are losing some of that moisture in your hair (thus having tangling and breakage) - I must say I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>From day one my hair has been so soft and pretty.</li>
      <li>My hair is softer, less frizzy and more manageable.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve got high hopes for Dove, and maybe it&#x27;ll be the one to stick with long-term.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Now that smooth is in, years of chemical processing have left me with a frizzy blonde lion&#x27;s mane that would have been great back then (at least if I sang back-up for Bon Jovi or Poison).</li>
      <li>Oh, what an expensive trip that was---I don&#x27;t know--I wasn&#x27;t happy for what I was paying.  </li>
      <li>I tried many brands but as my hair dried naturally it would always frizz and kink up.</li>
      <li>willing to purchase next time.</li>
      <li>(I still used some conditioner just in case) but tangle free and worry free----it&#x27;s like my hair has calmed down a bit.  </li>
      <li>I began with dove intense damage therapy shampoo and that made my hair soft and knot free but still dull looking.</li>
      <li>My hair type is baby fine, long and wavy, and at times it can look a bit dry on the ends.</li>
      <li>no frizz ... feels soft and supple.</li>
      <li>No wet tangles ...</li>
      <li>I am constantly changing my shampoo to find one that makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve laughed about how unfair fashion is: Back in the 80&#x27;s big hair was all the rage</li>
      <li>But as a side effect my hair gets really dry and with normal shampoo and conditioner becomes knotty and flat.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve laughed about how unfair fashion is: Back in the 80&#x27;s big hair was all the rage and I just couldn&#x27;t get my limp locks to pouf up. Now that smooth is in, years of chemical processing have left me with a frizzy blonde lion&#x27;s mane that would have been great back then (at least if I sang back-up for Bon Jovi or Poison). I haven&#x27;t had a perm in nineteen years, but still do highlights on my long, dark blonde, slightly graying hair. I tried many brands but as my hair dried naturally it would always frizz and kink up. Brushing out while wet was nearly torture and I used a lot of smoothing anti-frizz goop and spray to tame it down. I found Dove Oil Care and it worked the best, but not great. However I was still using a lot of anti-frizz cream before my hair dried. Then I decided to let Dove do its work without any extra products. I just used the shampoo and the conditioner that goes with it - nothing else. After two or three washes this way, my hair was practically reborn. No wet tangles ...no frizz ... feels soft and supple. I&#x27;m truly amazed. I&#x27;ve had products that worked well for a while but the frizz always came back. But I&#x27;ve got high hopes for Dove, and maybe it&#x27;ll be the one to stick with long-term.</li>
    <li> I am constantly changing my shampoo to find one that makes my hair feel soft and silky. My hair gets slightly dry and fizzy in the winter, on top of styling. This entire line of nutritive therapy products, shampoo, conditioner and styling cream are fabulous! From day one my hair has been so soft and pretty. Leaves my hair in great condition without being too dry or weighted down, it&#x27;s just right. Highly recommend you try it!</li>
    <li> helps a lot to dry hair</li>
    <li> My hair type is baby fine, long and wavy, and at times it can look a bit dry on the ends. I absolutely love this shampoo. It&#x27;s really thick so it doesn&#x27;t take much of it at all to wash all your hair. Also, the scent of this shampoo is really lovely and fresh. It will make your hair look nice and shiny. I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!! I had dry knotty short hair. I have to wash my hair daily otherwise my scalp becomes itchy. But as a side effect my hair gets really dry and with normal shampoo and conditioner becomes knotty and flat. I began with dove intense damage therapy shampoo and that made my hair soft and knot free but still dull looking. I recently moved to dove nutritive therapy shampoo and conditioner and it did the trick. My hair is soft, manageable, and looks really good.   Basically, if you have dry hair go with nutritive therapy.   If you have oily hair I&#x27;d go with the intense damage therapy.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t want to admit it; as we age - things change.  Well, my hair did.  I used some shampoo (not Dove) one day and had a knotted mess.....  I guess you could say this was my wake up call.  I then looked into cleansing conditioners.  Oh, what an expensive trip that was---I don&#x27;t know--I wasn&#x27;t happy for what I was paying.  so saw the sale on Dove and thought well--Dove has great soap-maybe they a know little bit about shampoo.  I must say this shampoo is NICE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It started with my ends which I&#x27;m still trying to tame after what I call the day of disaster---I swear I originally thought I was going to have to cut some of my hair off--I don&#x27;t remember what shampoo I originally used that gave me the knotted mess--all I know is winter is not a friend to my hair either.  So to get to it; this Dove Nourishing Oil shampoo is so NICE to my hair.  (I still used some conditioner just in case) but tangle free and worry free----it&#x27;s like my hair has calmed down a bit.  I can comb through it and NO knotted messes------yeahhhhhh!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is how my ends seem so happy with this shampoo (even happier than with this one cleansing conditioner I had tried-will remain nameless on that).  This shampoo is so great!  If you are older and feel you are losing some of that moisture in your hair (thus having tangling and breakage) - I must say I really like this stuff.</li>
    <li> Awful...gave me and my daughter a rash.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even buy this product from Amazon, and I feel the need to say that after 1 wash, it made my hair look great!!!!!  How did years of bleaching, dying, straightening, and chemicals get thrown in the back burner after just ONE wash???  You don&#x27;t even need the conditioner people!  I&#x27;m highly impressed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like a single thing about this  product. I hated the feel of it. I hated the way my hair looked after using it, it was lackluster, limp, and felt icky! I didn&#x27;t see ANY benefit to using this at all!!</li>
    <li> Many of today&#x27;s shampoo&#x27;s just gum up your scalp and hair....and leave your hair and scalp dry.  I just discovered this product. It reminds me of shampoo&#x27;s from many years ago.  I am 70. Leaves my hair looking healthy and shiny. Hair manages better. Scalp feels better.  Also it&#x27;s nice and creamy.   I can also go a bit longer between hair washings.  I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair so I can&#x27;t comment on the claim of frizzy hair reduction.  There is a conditioner but I don&#x27;t feel I need this. It might be good for greater fullness if required.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for dry, coarse, frizzy hair. Very moisturizing and greatly reduces frizz. Prior to using this shampoo, I was using Suave&#x27;s Shea Butter and Almond shampoo. Like the Suave shampoo, this shampoo is moisturizing but does a much better job at taming frizz. It also feels more lightweight than the Suave. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> nice i like it. willing to purchase next time. thank you very much. as the as i expect. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my hair from the regular Dove shampoo.  It works, but not any better than the regular stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s new, as for me, nothing is more important than it&#x27;s new condition, The good smell and good condition, I like it</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It makes my hair feel so soft and seriously revives it. I have a problem with build up with other brands but Dove has never made my hair feel heavy or waxy. The smell is wonderful and I can use this without the matching conditioner and still have soft and smooth hair- though I love the conditioner too for extra nourishment. This also helps with frizziness and fly-aways. I have very thick, longer hair that can be coarse and dry. If you have hair like me you should give this a try!</li>
    <li> I have never had a shampoo really do as it says!&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been a poofy wild mess i cant ever find a shampoo or conditioner or any product to smooth my hair so i had to straighten it all the time or it was just not managable&lt;br /&gt;Well this changed my hair! It now air drys and its frizz free and shiny i love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair. This is one of my favorites.  It&#x27;s in my constant rotation. Not too heavy but does a great job moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for one week and I do notice a difference in my normally unruly, thick long hair. My hair is softer, less frizzy and more manageable. I haven&#x27;t gotten a hair headache (caused from putting my hair back in a ponytail) since I&#x27;ve used it, which was a bi-weekly occurrence before. I definitely recommend this shampoo and will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t really work for my type of hair. Granted, however, I probably don&#x27;t have the right hair type for it; thick, wavy hair that actually usually tends to the oily side. My hair has been feeling dry lately so I bought this shampoo. This shampoo makes my hair in it&#x27;s present state oily, not nourished-feeling. However, I gave it 3 stars because I know it probably works great for people with really damaged hair.</li>
    <li> great price and quality.It is just like what it says on the website.I will use it for a long time</li>
