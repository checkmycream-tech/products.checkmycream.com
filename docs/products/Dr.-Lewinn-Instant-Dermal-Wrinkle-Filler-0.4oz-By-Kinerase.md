### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome product, received in a timely manner and in excellent condition, Thank you</li>
      <li>its great!</li>
      <li>All of Dr. Lewinn items are great</li>
      <li>The delivery was quick &amp; price was good.</li>
      <li>But this is okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>I use a lot of Dr. Lewinn&#x27;s products and I love them all except for this one.</li>
      <li>Wish it was still available</li>
      <li>My first purchase of this seemed to work better.  </li>
      <li>Blobs and some kind of clear liquid.</li>
      <li>I purchased the filler and noticed a surprising result not at all mentioned on the box or the website, and I&#x27;d like to know if anyone else can confirm -- this product will actually prevent your glabella muscles from contracting!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s astonishing to me that this effect is not disclosed nor by what mechanism or technology can deliver such a powerful result.  </li>
      <li>First, the product came out of the tube separated as someone else mentioned.</li>
      <li>I have used Botox for too many years, and now I find the same result with this cream.  </li>
      <li>It really refreshes my skin and makes my wrinkles appear to be gone.</li>
      <li>It will do for now until I can get the real thing that lasts quite a while--Botox.  </li>
      <li>did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>But, given my intense preoccupation with my frown lines, using it is irresistible.  </li>

<li> Also, it didn&#x27;t do a single thing for me.</li>
<li> Mind you, I only started using it yesterday, but absolutely no noticeable difference!!</li>
<li> I usually reapply several times a day.</li>
<li> After shipping you may need to give the tube a shake but other than that, use two times a day - morning and evening and see RESULTS.</li>
<li> After finally getting this four days late, I am not satisfied with it!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little expensive for only 4 oz  though.</li>
<li> not a good product..does not address wrinkles as promised.</li>

    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference.</li>
    <li> After finally getting this four days late, I am not satisfied with it! Mind you, I only started using it yesterday, but absolutely no noticeable difference!! I will continue to use it and hopefully there will be some difference.</li>
    <li> First, the product came out of the tube separated as someone else mentioned. Blobs and some kind of clear liquid. Also, it didn&#x27;t do a single thing for me.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Dr. Lewinn&#x27;s products and I love them all except for this one. This one does nothing at all.</li>
    <li> Wish it was still available</li>
    <li> its great! It really refreshes my skin and makes my wrinkles appear to be gone. It&#x27;s a little expensive for only 4 oz  though.</li>
    <li> Dr lewinn instant wrinkle filler did nothing.  It came out of the tube separated in big globs and oily drops.  Was unable to get a smooth line into my wrinkles.  Would not buy again</li>
    <li> Does soften the look of the lines around my mouth, but doesn&#x27;t last too long. I usually reapply several times a day.</li>
    <li> not a good product..does not address wrinkles as promised.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, received in a timely manner and in excellent condition, Thank you</li>
    <li> would buy this product over &amp; over  helps fill in wrinkles and [[ASIN:B007KCIDQ4 Dr. Lewinn by Kinerase Instant Dermal Wrinkle Filler 0.4 oz (11 g) one unit]]will make you an ageless beauty.  All of Dr. Lewinn items are great</li>
    <li> Been using for a month on forehead wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
    <li> My first purchase of this seemed to work better.  My skin may have become accustomed after use. The delivery was quick &amp; price was good.</li>
    <li> I purchased the filler and noticed a surprising result not at all mentioned on the box or the website, and I&#x27;d like to know if anyone else can confirm -- this product will actually prevent your glabella muscles from contracting!  I have used Botox for too many years, and now I find the same result with this cream.  It&#x27;s astonishing to me that this effect is not disclosed nor by what mechanism or technology can deliver such a powerful result.  I can only then wonder if the safety factor has truly been assessed.  But, given my intense preoccupation with my frown lines, using it is irresistible.  I would be lying if I said I didn&#x27;t want to use this product forever.  There must be nano technology involved to freeze the muscles as it does, and also why the tip is designed to bypass using the fingers to apply.  Try this and see what happens.. you&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
    <li> This product works!! After shipping you may need to give the tube a shake but other than that, use two times a day - morning and evening and see RESULTS.</li>
    <li> Been using and no improvement like it advertises</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a miracle, skip this product.  did absolutely nothing. i would save my money and look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It will do for now until I can get the real thing that lasts quite a while--Botox.  But this is okay.</li>
