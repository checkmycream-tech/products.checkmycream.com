      <li>Reviewers claim that it is oily, but I suspect that they are using too much.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say I actually look younger.</li>
      <li>I use it as a face moisturizer but it has so many other uses.</li>
      <li>It is truly a great product and a little goes a long way.  </li>

      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s oil, but a&lt;br /&gt;very light, delicate oil that pampers the dry skin and relieves any discomfort that winter brings.  </li>

<li> If you have any dry areas on your skin like around your nails, or hands, neck, eyes, lips or any part of your body that gets dry and needs some help, this is the ultimate in beauty creams.</li>

<li> I think it does help a little with dryness</li>
<li> After a few days I thought I would try using it on the rest of my face.</li>
<li> I use it everyday on my face before I put on makeup.  </li>
<li> usual</li>
<li> Nothing has broken me out this badly ever.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m afraid I lost track of it and never even opened it:(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love anything that Josie has.  Much cheaper here than QVC.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works ok. Nothing special though.</li>
    <li> Great beauty product for night use.</li>
    <li> I returned this as my daughter did not want it.</li>
    <li> It is great...no complaints....I will be back for more. Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other creams and lotions from everywhere - even other countries.  I always go back to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I could find a similar cream at a lower price, but nothing compared to this brand.  It was a life&lt;br /&gt;saver this past winter as a facial moisturizer, especially around the mouth and nose.  Yes, it&#x27;s oil, but a&lt;br /&gt;very light, delicate oil that pampers the dry skin and relieves any discomfort that winter brings.  I also&lt;br /&gt;love putting it around my eyes and into my brows.  It soaks right in to the skin, no oily mess.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Deep moisture.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS.  Best hand cream I have ever used.  AND it has the elixir of life from Josie Maran.  Her argan oil is miraculous and I use every product she makes.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it on my face, neck, hands and even my heels.  It is truly a great product and a little goes a long way.  Will definitely reorder this product.</li>
    <li> This is NOT argan oil. I bought this after watching on QVC claim that it&#x27;s the same stuff as the bottle but in a creamy consistency. I can&#x27;t believe she is allowed to make that claim when the ingredients clearly say otherwise. This oil is thick, doesn&#x27;t absorb and at least mine had a gritty consistency almost like a light scrub. Not something you want to put on your face. I suppose you can use this as a cuticle oil or maybe a body oil but please don&#x27;t try to put this on your face in the morning. You will never be ready to put on makeup let alone leave the house with your face shinning like you covered it in vaseline.</li>
    <li> one of my absolute favorite products. and it&#x27;s cruelty free! Nothing has ever moisturized my dry skin as well as this product. I recommended to anyone with sensitive skin who likes to buy cruelty free products</li>
    <li> If you have any dry areas on your skin like around your nails, or hands, neck, eyes, lips or any part of your body that gets dry and needs some help, this is the ultimate in beauty creams. It has a thousand uses and does not clog pores. It&#x27;s truly an amazing intensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few of Josie Maran&#x27;s oils, make-up and creams and her products are always fabulous and long lasting. This cream lives up to any rich moisture cream and provides excellent results. This is Josie&#x27;s answer to petroleum jelly however, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores like petroleum can and you definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to use petroleum jelly on your face, but with this cream, you can use it anywhere without worries. It&#x27;s rich and thick and has a very nice scent and it stays on, hydrating where ever you smooth it on for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I use it everyday on my face before I put on makeup.  Don&#x27;t apply to much or your face will look too oily.  I like the dewy looks it gives me.</li>
    <li> I use it on my feet twice a day and it keeps them very soft.  During the summer my feet get very dry from wearing sandals all the time.  I also, use it on my hands and elbows.  It helps keep my eczema at bay.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, but definitely leaves my face like an oil slick. I pretty much only use it on my lips and hands now, but even when I use it on my hands, the product takes so long to absorb that it gets all over my keyboard and mouse when I use it at work. I suggest dampening your hands in the bathroom and using only a very small amount on wet skin. Absorbs more quickly and hydrates longer. Decent ingredients though!</li>
    <li> Love the product, it&#x27;s gentle and moisturizing.  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> fabulous.  can&#x27;t get enough.  Great as a night cream and wonderful for lips, eyes and hands.  Need a larger size</li>
    <li> Better than vaseline - no petroleum!  only argan oil</li>
    <li> This was so small and arrived in a large envelope....I&#x27;m afraid I lost track of it and never even opened it:(</li>
    <li> This is the best product I found this winter season to help with my extremely dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel sticky, oily and it absorbs quickly. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual I received this item within the 2 days promised by my prime account.</li>
    <li> Great night time moisturizer, may be a bit heavier than some, but still a very good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last month and I am astounded by how wonderful this produce is!  My eye area always looks dry and dehydrated and I have never found an eye cream I was satisfied with. I decided to try it because of the great reviews and I am happy I did. This product is incredible! I was concerned about it clogging pores and it has not. My eye area looks refreshed and younger. Btw I am 42. I noticed the difference immediately. After a few days I thought I would try using it on the rest of my face. Again I was concerned about it making me oily or clogging my pores. It  has transformed my skin!  It does not get oily. Instead it looks rejuvenated. My skin feels more balanced and it has a healthy glow. I can honestly say I actually look younger. It smells incredible too!  You do not need to use too much. It smooths out wonderfully and soaks in quickly. This is the best product I have found in a long time!!  I did not buy it here. I bought it at Sephora. Next time I will buy it on amazon to see if the quality is as good. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love Josie Maran&#x27;s Infinity Cream! I use it in place of petroleum jelly. Much better for my skin and my body since my skin absorbs much of what I apply! Been using many of Josie&#x27;s products for quit some time now and love them. Very pleased:)</li>
    <li> Love the smell (a little lemony), but it is very oily when it goes on and your face will stick to your pillow or anything else it comes in contact with.  My face stays sticky for quite awhile and I can only use it at night or I&#x27;ll be a walking fly paper.  I think it does help a little with dryness and  the price is ok.</li>
    <li> this product is well worth the price.  I have not found anything comparable.  it works on nail, lips, around sensitive eye areas, and any dry areas.  great product.</li>
    <li> I use this at night on my cuticles and it keeps them soft and moist. Smells light and citrussy. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had AMAZING results with this product! I use it on my face, under my eyes, and on my neck. I have combination, acne-prone skin and my face doesn&#x27;t break out as with other products. My skin is more even, hydrated and supple, and the wrinkly look on my neck is much improved! It&#x27;s also wonderful on hands and cuticles. Reviewers claim that it is oily, but I suspect that they are using too much. I use a tiny, tiny bit and it is quickly absorbed and my face is ready for makeup. I don&#x27;t find it to be grainy, either. It comes out of the tube very creamy, and liquifies in my hand in a few seconds. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It&#x27;s very versatile. Works well at night and under makeup. Will order it again</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my skin. I bought mine at Sephora on a whim. I use it as a face moisturizer but it has so many other uses. I used to have major breakouts from other cream moisturizers and haven&#x27;t had a breakout since using this. My face looks clearer and I use less makeup because I don&#x27;t have to. It has evened out my complexion perfectly. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Drug store products  are better.  The Josie Maran Argan cream oil does not absorb into the skin.  I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Tried a small tune and loved it so much bought the larger size</li>
    <li> My face has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Nothing has broken me out this badly ever. Nothing. I never had acne as a teenager but it&#x27;s cystic acne galore all of the sudden. It took a month to get my skin clear. Spare yourself.</li>
