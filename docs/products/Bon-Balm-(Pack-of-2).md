    <li> This product did nothing to my pains.  And I would not buy it again.  Not worth it.  It does not smell bad but again, it did not do anything for my pains as it is sold in the commercials to do.</li>
    <li> good for massaging, but pain still the same</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandmother who seen it on a commercial. She has pain in her leg along with arthritis and at times gets swelling on her feet from being up all day. She tried this oil and says it is helping her. She use to not be able to walk around her court/street at home before but after using the oil for a few days she is getting the urge to walk and is now taking short walks outside. She says the pain is no longer there after she applies the oil and uses it whenever she feels restless or any pain. I think if she feels its working for her then its great. Its not a bad price for the two plastic bottles(ea about 4 in tall) when youre using so little of it at a time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my parents because they both sseen it on television. My mother has Arthritis and is a Diabetic so she doesnt like to take too many prescription meds.. My mother said this really helps her arthritis pain and I will be ordering some more for her.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother. She had watched this on TV and wanted it for her ACHES!!! But they put in a fake track # as if it had been put in route... which it never was.  This is a total rip off please report them to AMAZON and the BBB if they have done you wrong. We can stop future people from getting victimized!</li>

    <li> I am a skeptic and I don&#x27;t believe everything I see on TV. I gave this a try and I must say, I&#x27;ve never had anything work so fast! It works within seconds for me! I love this product!</li>
