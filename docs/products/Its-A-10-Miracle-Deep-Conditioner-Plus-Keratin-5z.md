    <li> I have such bad curly, dry and processed hair. This conditioner helps my hair to feel and act normal again. I only use it once a week and it helps my hair feel soft. Without it, my hair won&#x27;t even straighten without frizzing.</li>
    <li> Love how soft my long thin hair is after using it! It&#x27;s pretty expensive though.</li>
    <li> Did not work. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Product came on time. Great product for hair. It is expensive but it is a 10! Hair feel great from this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this product, making my hair stronger and healthy</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair, with an ombre. I use this product every week, and it works for me. I</li>
    <li> My hairdresser wanted me to try this....I did and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made!  My hair feels and looks so healthy..My hair was dry and fly away; and now it has some weight and sheen to it.....I love it and will always use it!....</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner that does exactly as it says.  Conditions, softens and lasts until your next wash. Does a better job than many conditioners used at a salon.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product  and I will re order again</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!!!! I&#x27;m in love with this product and my hair feels like silk. I have combination hair of black and white, curly with afternoon frizz. It was like magic with the first use.I It makes blow drying and flat ironing a since without any needed products (shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;My husband can&#x27;t keep his hands off my hair; and he says it smell clean and refreshing. That alone is a reason to purchase it. Give it a try ~</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair. This product along with the leave-in conditioner spray soften the curls so that you are able to comb right through without damaging or breaking your hair. I must admit I was skeptical before purchasing. I had heard all these amazing comments from random people about how great the product was, and well they were right. It&#x27;s worth the money you spend. I am very pleased and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube of this stuff and I really love it.  I&#x27;m 58 and color my fairly-thin blonde hair and use this once a week for that deep conditioning that I need.  I shampoo &amp; rinse my hair as soon as I get in the shower and put this on and leave it while I finish whatever else I need to do (this is a good time to shave to give the conditioner more time on my hair) and the last thing I do is rinse it out.  My hair comes out soft and smelling nice (but not overpowering) and not weighed down like most leave-in conditions leave it..  It obviously has fragrance so if you don&#x27;t like that then don&#x27;t use this, otherwise it should do a good job.</li>
    <li> I washed my hair with the shampoo containing Keratin and used this conditioner, and my hair felt and looked like a sponge, and very frizzy. My hair has not felt this dry in years, and this was just after one wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to give it away to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally Messed up my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Keratin free product is better.</li>
    <li> really loved the product, did wonder for my hair; highly recomend! specialy for damage or over process hair; try it!</li>
    <li> Does the job... My hair is super soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Glad I purchase this because the condition and shine is great. Also loved speedy delivery. A good investment.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating b/c I loved the way it was compact to take anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it mainly since it was very handy to use wherever you go.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend his to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered these It&#x27;s a 10 hair products when I had more hair to pamper! Truly a miracle product that makes even ancient strands soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery, great product!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. On time and a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Leave hair soft. Not oily. I have very thick hair and only wash twice a week. Use this once a week and keeps hair looking great.</li>
    <li> Better than other conditioners I have tried before. Can feel the difference .</li>
