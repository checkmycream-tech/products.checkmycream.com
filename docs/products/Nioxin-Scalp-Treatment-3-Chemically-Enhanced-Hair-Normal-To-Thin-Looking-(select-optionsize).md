<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought the 3 piece set,read all the good reviews,more good..then bad..I like that the product comes out in a stream..so much easier to apply,just got it a couple days ago..so I will update soon..so far,so good..seller said 6 day delivery..I got it in 3 days,nicely packaged too.</li>
    <li> This is the first time using this product but it seems to help as much as the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> My hair is growing in patches right where I use it!  It&#x27;s much thicker and doesn&#x27;t take much to comb in your scalp each day.</li>
    <li> Love this. ..my hair is stronger and thicker than it has been in years</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about this product when I just started losing my hair. I originally bought a set of this product from a private source which also includes a shampoo &amp; a conditioner. After 6 months of use I now have some baby hair growing on my bald spots..it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Really helps my thinning hair grow back. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the real Nioxin product, not a generic.</li>
    <li> The product was reasonable but when you added in the S&amp;H charges, the exchange rate &amp; Customs charges it was not worth the $400 I did end up spending.  I could of bought the products right here in Canada and it would not have costs me as much....OH WELL LESSON LEARNED..</li>
    <li> Good product and much cheaper than instore purchases</li>
    <li> I used this product for the last year and I love it&lt;br /&gt; Even my husband now uses it and he loves it as well. The aroma therapy feeling of the conditioner is fantastic</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this has made my hair thicker in one week. I have been using this for about 1 month now and each time my hair looks and feels thicker than the time before. I highly recommend this to anyone with fine or thinning hair@</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 years and this is the first time that I have received what I believe to be a watered down version.  All my other bottles that I have purchased was a thicker liquid, a strong scent of peppermint and the pump on the bottle was a straight stream.  This liquid in this bottle feels a lot thinner, there is hardly a scent and the pump on the bottle sprays a mist.  I am very disappointed.  I will not purchase this item again on Amazon.  I will go back to the store and purchase it.</li>
    <li> Perfect twice the amount of product and way less expensive than at the salon!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is changing my hair. I like it and am continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> WOW....this came so quickly!  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> worked for mother in law going through chemo</li>
    <li> My husband and I has been using this product for a long time because is very good specially if you also use the shampoo and conditioner. We love it and recommended.</li>
    <li> Have used this for several months after my hair gal and good friend recommended it when she saw my hair had thinned after 3 months of radiation. My hair is thicker and growing back!!!  Que Happy dance!!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Adds body to my baby fine thin hair.  Keeps it from falling out too!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. I use the nioxin shampoo and conditioner also. I was loosing my hair a lot when I would shampoo. I could feel the hair sliding down my leg and it freeked me out. I started using all three products and I only loose a very small amount of hair now. I love the smell of the shampoo and the conditioner also. I separate my hair after I dry it and squirt two pumps every 2 inches or so. It resembles water when applying.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t expect miracles from any product, but I have been using Nioxin System 3 for two years.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of hair loss during that period of time. I like the texture and body of my hair from using this product. The seller was extremely prompt.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working need a couple of more months to tell. Need the other products to go with it.</li>
    <li> Just as described! Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I use this as the third part of the Nioxin hair care system.  It&#x27;s a nice product and using all three my scalp feels really clean and I do see new hairs coming through on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have been using this product for 3 months. Love the smell and I have seen results. Yes very happy with it . I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product made my already thinning hair terribly damaged. After having children my hair was very healthy, but very thin. I used this product in hopes of strengthening and thickening my hair, and it did the complete opposite. My hair fell out in clumps. I read some reviews that said that ones hair may fall out at first and to just keep using it, so I did, but it never stopped falling out. Now, the hair that I have left feels dry and damaged, and even thinner than before. Save yourself some heartache and stay away from this product. I&#x27;m a 35 year old female who looks almost bald from this product. Stay away.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product if you are experiencing a problem with hair loss.  It was recommended to me by my hairdresser and it definitely works for me and has slowed my hair loss problem.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Makes your head tingle a little when it is applied, but it feels good.  I just take it as a sign the hair shafts are absorbing the product...</li>
    <li> Great packaging delivered well before the stated date. Buy with confidence,and buy often</li>
    <li> Regular use of this niacin-powered scalp cleanser will allow some regrowth of hair.  For me, the hairs don&#x27;t get especially long, but these &amp;#34;baby hairs&amp;#34; do a great job of not letting my scalp show through to the world.  I can&#x27;t use the shampoo and conditioner, though, as they are too drying, but the Treatment works very well on its own.  Plus, I love the tingle I get after I use it!  Give it at least 6 weeks, though, and keep using it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Nioxin and I love that I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> It actually works!  I am quite pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> My hair is much softer if I combine with Nioxin System Treatment with the Duo Set. Big difference! More hair coming in at thinned areas. Excellent product.  Just be careful to spray it on your scalp only- it is somewhat irritating to the face, if it drips down.</li>
    <li> At a fraction of the cost of buying it from my hair stylist.  I love and use this product and now I have a way to buy it for less without any hassle.</li>
    <li> Well satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used it for over a year, and my hair is growing in thicker.</li>
    <li> Hard to apply to scalp evenly without soaking entire head and hair??</li>
    <li> love this product, my hair is in the best condition it has been in years love it, glad I started using this</li>
    <li> This is great - I was losing hair and my beautician recommended me this product.  Use it every day and have lots more hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair too curly and flyaway.  I usually like Nioxin, but this one isn&#x27;t working for my haie.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any change since I started using the product.  Hair looks fuller and soft, but no new hair..</li>
    <li> People sometimes buy a product like Nioxin thinking it&#x27;ll regrow hair. WRONG. If you have hair that is weak or follicles that are struggling it CAN reactive it. It provides the perfect environment for hair growth. But I  have used it in another way and it passed an acid test each time. I&#x27;m an entertainer and some summers I travel the country. In several instances due to local water my hair and scalp went into crisis and I faced hair fallout or clearly a lack of growth. I&#x27;d find a salon and buy Nioxin if I was traveling in so many places that I could not get it via Amazon. It has ALWAYS stopped the problem, and normalized my scalp beautifully. But let me be clear: I personally dn&#x27;t like the way Nioxin leaves my hair. I use it once a week at least and more if I&#x27;m in crisis. The product was originally created to help cancer patients and how has many different versions for differing conditions of hair. It&#x27;s used successfully by men and women. It is one of the products I would include on the top 10 products to protect and enhance hair growth. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> I like this product but have not used it enough yet to see if it really works. It takes time</li>
    <li> This product is great! I&#x27;m going through mid life womanhood, and this product works great for hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product does anything other than make my scalp tingle.  I love Nioxin products, so I will keep using it and see if it really helps me re-grow hair long term.</li>
    <li> my hair is coming in very thick</li>
    <li> Great price for the product. Love it!</li>
    <li> a little messy and drippy.</li>
    <li> I feel that this has been waterd down. I still have a little but left from a bottle that I bought at a hairdresser and it smells better and works great on my hair.  But when I used this one there is no odor not feeling (aka sticky) and does nothing for my hair.  Sorry</li>
    <li> Well time will tell.  It is easy to use, hope it works.  If it does it would be a good product for the money, it is quite expensive.</li>
    <li> I have used this product with the Shampoo and Conditioner since March 2015 and I see no hair growth whatsover.  My hair is still coming out by the brush-full.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.  I may need to try Ovation Therapy now....</li>
    <li> Nice big bottles at a small price.</li>
    <li> I am not sure this product works, I have tried it a couple of times but still a little skeptical.</li>
    <li> works great in combination with Nioxin cleanser.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know if it helps thinning yet but it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look bad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and can honestly say it has made me love my hair again.</li>
    <li> Love this leave in hair treatment.  I&#x27;m a regular customer of this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this for many years!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Using this with the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner, I can tell a big difference with my hair! I have thin hair and it is definitely helping my hair thicken and also keeping my hair from breaking as much.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my thinning hair</li>
    <li> Good product will order more in future.</li>
    <li> I am 71 and Propecia stopped my hair loss 10 years ago and Nioxin has helped to keep it looking great.  Nioxin&#x27;s System 3 has a Cleanser bottle, a Scalp Therapy bottle and a Scalp Treatment setting-spray bottle.  These 3 products work together very well. I now have a full head of hair again thanks to a daily Propecia tablet and Nioxin&#x27;s 3 products that work together to keep my hair looking great.  Nioxin makes the texture of the hair really good too.  My hair started to fall out rapidly 10 years ago.  When I started with Propecia in tandem with Nioxin, it grew back and today it is very very thick.  My barber has to thin it sometimes which is amazing at my age.  I still get compliments on my hair even though I am 71.[[ASIN:B000L8GL8G Nioxin System 3 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy Conditioner Treated Hair Set Duo 33.8 oz]]</li>
    <li> Nioxin System 3 Treatment works beautifully to help hair and scalp be more healthy.  I was losing a lot of hair each time I washed my hair.  After using this product for several months, my hair loss has been reduced significantly.</li>
    <li> This product works !! Used with the wash and left in the hair, it has proven to me that my hair has thickened!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  Like it very much.</li>
    <li> Seems to give my hair some body.</li>
    <li> does seem to help my thinning hair</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Difference noted in amt of hair loss. Would recommend for everyone to try.  Cost worth it. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Truthfully i didn&#x27;t notice a single difference after using the whole bottle so magic this is not</li>
    <li> Nioxin has a great product line. I seemed to notice that my hair was thinning. My beautician said she didn&#x27;t think so. I asked a couple times over a span of 3 or 4 months. She finally said, &amp;#34; Hey, if you think your thinning- use Nioxin. It can only help, and won&#x27;t hurt your hair.&amp;#34; I did. I started getting re growth in places that I hadn&#x27;t even noticed thinning. I mean- decent sized patches! It looked like someone took a couple finger fulls of hair and cut it off 2 or 3 inches from my scalp. It was crazy. Now this is using the shampoo, conditioner, intensive scalp treatment. I later got some of the gels and styling helpers. Don&#x27;t waste your time on the small shampoo, bite the bullet and just get the larger size. I have soft fine hair and the only thing I did have trouble with was that the conditioner didn&#x27;t help with the tangles. Just take your time. You do want to massage these products well into the scalp- feels good and helps with circulation- not with tangles. If your diligent with this product line results will follow in a few months. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> GIVES THINING HAIR  BODY. SMELL IS NOT GREAT BUT DISAPPEARS QUICKLY. I USE IT AFTER WASHING MY HAIR. COMB IT THRU AND STYLE</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This really works! My hair looks and feels a lot fuller!</li>
    <li> I use this every time I wash my hair, and I have a much fuller head of hair using this treatment.  I love, love, love it. I didn&#x27;t use it for a while, and my hairline receded in a couple of months time.  Now that I&#x27;m back to using Nioxin System 3 Treatment, my hair is coming back in all over my head.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> great quick to mail out product was perfect!</li>
    <li> Weird allergies from this.</li>
    <li> Hair is healthier and scalp feels better.</li>
    <li> Found out about the Nioxin brand from my new hair cutter.  She sold me on all the items for my hair.  I will never go back to unprofessional brands.</li>
    <li> Hair loss was becoming a problem, so I tried this with the shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is no longer falling out.  It looks great.  Need I say more?</li>
    <li> I use this product on a daily basis to give my hair a fuller thicker look.  It&#x27;s a great product, especially if you color treat your hair. Give it a try I think you&#x27;ll agree!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for about 3 years. Seems to help with hair loss as the &amp;#34;golden years approach&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> After loss of all hair with chemo the Nioxin line was recommended and my hair is back, almost as full as it was before, this product is needed with the cleanser and scalp treatment to get the best advantage of it working - highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and it meets my standards.  The packaging was changed somewhat, so I had trouble identifying that this was the same product I had always used.  But, once I figured it out, it is the same good treatment.</li>
    <li> Along with the Cleanser and Scalp Therapy I have lots of new growth.  I&#x27;ve used it off and on and can really tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  I&#x27;m now committed to using it full time as I&#x27;ve seen for myself that it works.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this line of products is made for my hair type. It gives my hair volume and really conditions it too. It took away the frizziness. Really like this product line.</li>
    <li> product was recommended for my personal situation and it was recommended that it works, but until some time goes by I will not be able to rate its efficiency.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a skeptic who lost a ton of hair... falling out in clumps.  was willing to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t take hair vitamins because they give me acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i started this 3 step program, along with eating an avocado a day, at the end of october.  it&#x27;s now late february. also trimmed off the dead thin ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no one can believe it - it&#x27;s like i have a new, thicker, healthier head of hair.  my hairdresser, friends, even my friend&#x27;s 11 year old daughter noticed.  i&#x27;m sticking with nioxin 3 step program 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hardly any hair falls out when i wash or brush it - and i noticed it helping about 3 weeks into it.  by 6 weeks, i could really tell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you HAVE to be diligent every morning and night with the serum.  don&#x27;t stray!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive and I have used it for over a year but don&#x27;t know that it helps. Makes my head red where I spray it and burns a little so this is my last bottle.</li>
    <li> I love the entire Nioxin System 3 line, it really does help with thinning hair, all you have to do to be convinced is to run out of it for a while.  It&#x27;s so nice to be able to find it here on Amazon and at a much better price than it sells for locally!</li>
    <li> Apparently it takes a while for this product to show any results. Like it so far but have nothing to report.</li>
    <li> Always pleased with Nioxin products. I have spent so much time and money finding a product for fine hair that does not dry my hair out or make it too limp. Nioxin System 3 Scalp treatment paired with the coordinating shampoo and conditioner keeps my fine hair full, soft and sleek.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few months now along with the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner but I only shampoo and condition my hair about 2 times a week. I have noticed improvement in the thickness of my hair and definitely less fall out. Not a miracle spray but slow and steady improvement, I am on my second bottle and I will continue to see if it improves.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Stop the hair loss and new hairs starting to grow, my beautician is amazed. Everybody in my family is now using it.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as decribed.</li>
    <li> excellent deal, have been using it for a long tome. wonderful results. no split ends, hair is always soft</li>
    <li> I went to my stylist asking her what to do with my hair since it was falling out everywhere.  She suggested this product.  I have been using it since October and it has done wonders.  My hair stopped falling out and is now getting thicker.  The only downside is now I have four inches long pieces of hair all over underneath.  But I can live with that.</li>
    <li> Just not for me — made matters worse. Going back to Pravanna.</li>
    <li> Very effective product and great value through Amazon</li>
    <li> Got it on time. Packaged well with other purchase. Good product.</li>
    <li> I have not used a product from Nioxin that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I have thyroid problems and my hair started thinning , emergency! A friend at work told me about this line of shampoo and products started using it within a month immediate difference I will never go back to anything but Nioxin!</li>
    <li> I use the cleanser (shampoo), conditioner and this treatment.  I was suffering from thinning of my hair.  My hairdresser suggested I use this product to help.  I have regrown the hair I lost and the hair I have is in wonderful shape.  It looks and feels thick the way I like it. I also color my hair and this product in the system 3 is made for that.  It does not fade my color. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> Works great for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, it works.......I&#x27;ve used it for over 5 years now and I see improvement in my hair, it is not as thin as before, I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVE IT AND USES IT DAILY</li>
    <li> Nioxin does work, I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. After using it, you don&#x27;t lose as much hair as you normally would.  But the bottle I bought here actually made my hair fall out more than normal.  It was weird; maybe I got a bad bottle?</li>
    <li> I did use the shampoo and conditioner from Nioxin but wasn&#x27;t happy with the fact that it dried my hair.  I have color treated hair so just use their products for color treated.  I do like this product so I skip the shampoo but use this on my hair and have noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t falling out like it was.  I think it really works and I will continue to use it</li>
    <li> Leaves hair greasy and horrible and doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time, simply the item is so great. Highly recommend to others you will love it too</li>
    <li> Was loosing my hair during pregnancy, because hormones are weird. Was recommended this by my hair dresser. It works and stopped the hair loss.</li>
    <li> The product does what it is advertised to do in an excellent manner.  I have been using it for years.</li>
