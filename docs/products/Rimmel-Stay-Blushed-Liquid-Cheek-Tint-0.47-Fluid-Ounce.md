      <li>Happy to answer questions.</li>
      <li>Blends great.</li>
      <li>After many attempts with products that were unsatisfying, I found this Rimmel blush and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>Nice scent!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good cream blush for years, ever since Origins discontinued Pinch Your Cheeks.</li>
      <li>For reference, I have fair, combination-oily skin.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>color is just a nice flush.</li>
      <li>Seems like it might be a nice product otherwise, but can&#x27;t imagine putting it on my face.</li>
      <li>Easy to blend, good product for the price.</li>
      <li>As others have said, &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; is a bit of a misnomer; it&#x27;s creamy, but very light.</li>
      <li>Nice and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>This blush is highly pigmented, but blends beautifully.</li>
      <li>Love the color and the consistency.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more colors.</li>
      <li>It looks adorable but you should keep in mind that it&#x27;s also creamy</li>
      <li>This is my favorite cheek tint.</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and ordered both the Sunkissed Cherry and Pop of Pink.</li>
      <li>A tiny amount packs a lot of punch but nice color</li>
      <li>Topped with my Laura Mercier Translucent Setting Powder, it gives the most natural, lit from within, glow.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the right color for me</li>
      <li>an hour later the smell is very strong.</li>
      <li>This blush is easy to apply - just squeeze out a tiny amount from the tube and smooth it across your cheeks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s natural, easy to apply, and inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Not really a &amp;#34;cherry&amp;#34; but a beautiful flush on medium gold complexion that last all day.</li>
      <li>This blush has a bit of a funny smell when first applied.</li>
      <li>I will note that this is not &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34;—it&#x27;s more like Greek yogurt.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care for it much.  </li>
      <li>Its very pigmented but it will look cakey when you put it over a foundation.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, nice little pop of color that looks natural and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>ALL of the other creme blushes I&#x27;ve tried were too dry, then looked to bright and sticky on my skin.</li>
      <li>This is not your normal creme blush.</li>
      <li>I wish I could find it in my local stores, but it&#x27;s easy enough to order online.</li>
      <li>What I mean is, it goes on really smoothly and doesn&#x27;t grab your skin too fast!</li>
      <li>It goes on evenly and the natural- looking color lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>Looks like I was born with naturally rosy cheeks.</li>
      <li>Just as good as the expensive brands.</li>
      <li>I expected Pop of Pink to look better on me, but they work equally well.</li>
      <li>I think it would be hard to use if it was truly a liquid, so I&#x27;m pleased with the different consistency.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite cheek tint. It&#x27;s natural, easy to apply, and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> would reorder. but it won&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
    <li> Its very pigmented but it will look cakey when you put it over a foundation.</li>
    <li> This blush is easy to apply - just squeeze out a tiny amount from the tube and smooth it across your cheeks. It goes on evenly and the natural- looking color lasts all day.  A great product and inexpensive too!</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good cream blush for years, ever since Origins discontinued Pinch Your Cheeks. After many attempts with products that were unsatisfying, I found this Rimmel blush and it&#x27;s perfect. Easy to apply, nice little pop of color that looks natural and lasts a long time.

    <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t review how the color looks because the fragrance is so intense that I don&#x27;t want to put it on my face. I tried it on my wrist to test it and an hour later the smell is very strong. Seems like it might be a nice product otherwise, but can&#x27;t imagine putting it on my face.</li>
    <li> Creamy consistence with very sheer finish.  Not really a &amp;#34;cherry&amp;#34; but a beautiful flush on medium gold complexion that last all day.</li>
    <li> Great product. Blends great. Looks like I was born with naturally rosy cheeks.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the right color for me and I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the feel of the product. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> This blush is highly pigmented, but blends beautifully. I have the color sunkissed cherry. A very small amount goes a long way. It taked some getting used to on the application end. I like to blend it with my fingers or a stippling brush. Topped with my Laura Mercier Translucent Setting Powder, it gives the most natural, lit from within, glow. I will be purchasing more colors. For reference, I have fair, combination-oily skin.</li>
    <li> This blush has a bit of a funny smell when first applied. It does go away, though. I did not think this blush stayed on very long and was disappointed about that.</li>
    <li> It is a tint but in a paste form.  I didn&#x27;t care for it much.  One needs perfect or youthful skin for the product to flatter.</li>
    <li> Just A Touch Of Color!</li>
    <li> This is not your normal creme blush. What I mean is, it goes on really smoothly and doesn&#x27;t grab your skin too fast! ALL of the other creme blushes I&#x27;ve tried were too dry, then looked to bright and sticky on my skin. NOT THIS ONE. The consistency is like frosting, yet doesn&#x27;t dry and get cakey on. It doesn&#x27;t stay wet either! PERFECT. Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is just a nice flush.</li>
    <li> Great cheek tint. Just as good as the expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was in the Alexa Chung makeup tutorial. Love the color and the consistency. Great product for the price and it definitely gives that flushed look. Perfect for 70s inspired makeup.</li>
    <li> It looks adorable but you should keep in mind that it&#x27;s also creamy</li>
    <li> A tiny amount packs a lot of punch but nice color</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Easy to blend, good product for the price. Nice scent!</li>
