      <li>All in all a great buy</li>
      <li>GREAT deal.</li>
      <li>When I ordered these I didn&#x27;t realize they were mimi polishes, but the polish is very nice.</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful but the polish is too and doesn&#x27;t have good coverage.</li>
      <li>Happy customer! :)</li>
      <li>Scraped off, chipped even with the best (Sechte Vite) top coat.</li>
      <li>These are adorable and the size is perfect.</li>
      <li>Gave as a christmas gift and recipient loved them.</li>
      <li>This is good toenail polish cause</li>
      <li>Loved the ones with sparkles</li>
      <li>but the delivery was fast colors are so beautiful and is perfect with just one coat</li>
      <li>Lovely color palette!</li>
      <li>So cute!  </li>
      <li>Love these colors!</li>
      <li>I got a chip the very first day which never happens to me, but for he price these are very good.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I love the colors, I love nail polish especially cheap ones.</li>
      <li>The package was nice too.</li>
      <li>The colors are nice and it gives you a variety.</li>
      <li>Love the colors and the quality.</li>
      <li>The colors are great but the polish isn&#x27;t very functional.</li>
      <li>The colors are lovely.</li>
      <li>and I love them</li>
      <li>Some require 3 or more coats to achieve an even look.</li>
      <li>I love nail polish</li>
      <li>So even though they are a inexpensive that quality is pretty good.</li>
      <li>Im not really a green addict, but these contrasting shades work beautifully on my ombre effects and water marble nails.</li>
      <li>I wish I could have seen the colors better and knew that they were so light for them to show up</li>
      <li>The four I&#x27;ve tried chipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>When I first got this set, I really liked the colors and couldn&#x27;t wait to use them on my nails because I had purchased this set of polish to add some color to an art project I was working on.</li>
      <li>Great packaging, easy to open and see all colors.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re much safer buying a drugstore brand for a dollar that has more quantity.</li>
      <li>Which wasn&#x27;t cool</li>
      <li>It has the same quality but you&#x27;re able to get more polish.</li>
      <li>So pretty!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun to mix and match.</li>
      <li>I think it is well worth the purchase regardless.</li>
      <li>The bottles are quite small, but the colors are great.</li>
      <li>Vibrant and rich colors that don&#x27;t have to be applied in 3 coats or more to show actual color.</li>
      <li>Put a good coat on and lasts a little longer.</li>
      <li>A Christmas present to be sure...</li>
      <li>and they came fast!</li>
      <li>and I really like these!</li>
      <li>so the use of them will be limited other then that, great colors</li>
      <li>i can only say if you want big bottles by the 48 piece set it is amazing</li>
      <li>I got these to paint some designs on household items, but ended up liking the colors so much that I paint my nails with them too.</li>
      <li>I got it fast.</li>
      <li>And very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>it dries fast even after I used it once the polish inside the bottle became think</li>
      <li>/&gt;The one aspect of this whole episode that was really bothersome was that even though I didn&#x27;t use any of this polish on me</li>
      <li>So much for that bottle of polish.</li>
      <li>I was finally OK by the following day because I had the resources and the knowledge of what to do if I had a major asthma attack.</li>
      <li>Fine for a single night/party wear.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s halfway decent it has a shiney glitter effect.</li>
      <li>All except the glitter one which had many bristles missing inside the Polish.</li>
      <li>Love the colors, but didn&#x27;t last long even with base/top coat.</li>
      <li>My only thing was the bottles were only halfway full, and there mini bottles</li>
      <li>so clear that no sense in putting it on another</li>
      <li>there is only one that I really like</li>
      <li>Bought this for a specific nail design that needs many shades of green.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really understand this whole thing about Klean color smelling stronger than other polishes, but I do my nails ALL the time</li>
      <li>Full size nail polish bottles just go to waste.</li>
      <li>I never had trouble about chipping and stuff because I normally use a full cover artificial nails and a decent top coat, so the polish stays on until I am ready to take of the actual nail.</li>
      <li>They dry fast.</li>
      <li>I just hope the collection has more other green colors.  </li>
      <li>So, later that day, I opened one of the polishes and started painting; I immediately started wheezing and had a major asthma attack.</li>
      <li>But the colors are gorgeous and the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as its made out to be.</li>

<li> But the the polish doesnt last very long.</li>
<li> The pink was  also so clear unless I mix it with a  darker pink</li>
<li> this has the most horrible shades of green you  didn&#x27;t really get to see as the shades really are  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll totally try to buy this in other colors.</li>
<li> and I only painted a small portion of what I want the polish for and immediately used remover to remove it and put the item outside, the fumes from those polishes stuck to me and my clothes.</li>
<li> with bigger gold flecks and little tiny green sparkles.</li>
<li> So, closed that bottle and threw out the set -</li>
<li> so I have to be careful about the vapors I inhale.</li>
<li> But it might just be because I&#x27;m rough with my nails.</li>
<li> It makes me really leary to buy this brand again especially since I bought another box at the same time which was just as bad.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bought other sets of KkeanColor  before</li>
<li> Wish there&#x27;re collections of other colors as well.</li>
<li> Very small bottles but enough polish for a few manicures each.  </li>
<li> I have seen that they are a little prone to chipping.</li>
<li> and it was like a lime green.</li>
<li> Hope they like the color green....</li>
<li> She loves green anything.  </li>
<li> All in all, no I would not buy this again just for the fact that it is too small and</li>
<li> It&#x27;s small, I used 1 bottle twice</li>
<li> I am not sure if I got a fluke package</li>
<li> Two out of the 6 bottles the polish was thick and gummy and looked previously used!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These were the colors I was hoping for but really poor quality polish. Scraped off, chipped even with the best (Sechte Vite) top coat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought other sets of KkeanColor  before and I love them this has the most horrible shades of green you  didn&#x27;t really get to see as the shades really are  there is only one that I really like and it was like a lime green. It makes me really leary to buy this brand again especially since I bought another box at the same time which was just as bad. I wish I could have seen the colors better and knew that they were so light for them to show up you would have to probably 6 coats  on I was very disappointed . again the description and the colors are the picture of the box were not that great I ended up with 3 bottles of glitter.two shades of white one so clear that no sense in putting it on another that&#x27;s halfway decent it has a shiney glitter effect. The pink was  also so clear unless I mix it with a  darker pink there&#x27;s no sense in even trying to putting it on .</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful but the polish is too and doesn&#x27;t have good coverage.</li>
    <li> I got it fast. But the the polish doesnt last very long. I polish my nails n yhe next day it started chipping.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Put a good coat on and lasts a little longer. GREAT deal.</li>
    <li> Every nail polish container that came with this pack had a broken brush. All except the glitter one which had many bristles missing inside the Polish.</li>
    <li> Two out of the 6 bottles the polish was thick and gummy and looked previously used!</li>
    <li> This is good toenail polish cause it doesn&#x27;t last long on the hands. I got a chip the very first day which never happens to me, but for he price these are very good. I think it is well worth the purchase regardless. The colors are nice and it gives you a variety.</li>
    <li> So cute!  So pretty!  Very small bottles but enough polish for a few manicures each.  It&#x27;s fun to mix and match.</li>
    <li> When I ordered these I didn&#x27;t realize they were mimi polishes, but the polish is very nice. The bottles are very tiny though.</li>
    <li> The polish in each bottle was thick and gummy. I could not use it at all. I am not sure if I got a fluke package but I have returned this and will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, but didn&#x27;t last long even with base/top coat. Fine for a single night/party wear.</li>
    <li> Got these for my granddaughters upcoming birthday.  She loves green anything.  The bottles are quite small, but the colors are great.</li>
    <li> Im not really a green addict, but these contrasting shades work beautifully on my ombre effects and water marble nails.</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> Loved Them!  Perfect for St Patrick&#x27;s Day and just in the nick of time!</li>
    <li> Love these colors! Bought this for a specific nail design that needs many shades of green. These also work great for nail stamping. Except the glitter polish of coarse. But the starry meteor glitter Polish in this set is beautiful. Its almost a gold shimmer..with bigger gold flecks and little tiny green sparkles. All of them are great!</li>
    <li> Those nail colors are beautiful.  I just hope the collection has more other green colors.  Wish there&#x27;re collections of other colors as well.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the quality. Great price when I purchased them!</li>
    <li> A Christmas present to be sure...Hope they like the color green....lol</li>
    <li> I love nail polish and I really like these! My only thing was the bottles were only halfway full, and there mini bottles so the use of them will be limited other then that, great colors</li>
    <li> I bought this mini set for my mom and I think I&#x27;m going to have to get a set for myself! These are adorable and the size is perfect. Full size nail polish bottles just go to waste.</li>
    <li> i can only say if you want big bottles by the 48 piece set it is amazing but the delivery was fast colors are so beautiful and is perfect with just one coat</li>
    <li> Keep in mind these are MINI bottles so they aren&#x27;t big at all! But the colors are gorgeous and the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as its made out to be. I too am an asthmatic so I have to be careful about the vapors I inhale. The only reason this product got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the &amp;#34;TLC&amp;#34; color was leaking! Which wasn&#x27;t cool but I cleaned it up and have painted my nails with all the colors! All in all a great buy and they came fast!</li>
    <li> The colors are great but the polish isn&#x27;t very functional. Some require 3 or more coats to achieve an even look. The four I&#x27;ve tried chipped very quickly. There&#x27;s a reason the price is so low.</li>
    <li> The colors go on great! They dry fast. The package was nice too. I don&#x27;t really understand this whole thing about Klean color smelling stronger than other polishes, but I do my nails ALL the time so I&#x27;m used to nail polish smell.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality polishes. The color doesn&#x27;t stay on - with a couple of washes it&#x27;s chipping. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The colors are lovely. I&#x27;ve actually already worn every color already. I have seen that they are a little prone to chipping. But it might just be because I&#x27;m rough with my nails. You really only need two coats. So even though they are a inexpensive that quality is pretty good. I&#x27;ll totally try to buy this in other colors.</li>
    <li> Great packaging, easy to open and see all colors. I got these to paint some designs on household items, but ended up liking the colors so much that I paint my nails with them too. Lovely color palette! And very inexpensive. What else can I say? Happy customer! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small, I used 1 bottle twice and it&#x27;s done. I bought this because I love the colors, I love nail polish especially cheap ones. I never had trouble about chipping and stuff because I normally use a full cover artificial nails and a decent top coat, so the polish stays on until I am ready to take of the actual nail. All in all, no I would not buy this again just for the fact that it is too small and it dries fast even after I used it once the polish inside the bottle became think and mind you I just used it on my finger nails. You&#x27;re much safer buying a drugstore brand for a dollar that has more quantity. It has the same quality but you&#x27;re able to get more polish.</li>
    <li> Gave as a christmas gift and recipient loved them. Vibrant and rich colors that don&#x27;t have to be applied in 3 coats or more to show actual color.</li>
    <li> Loved the ones with sparkles</li>
    <li> When I first got this set, I really liked the colors and couldn&#x27;t wait to use them on my nails because I had purchased this set of polish to add some color to an art project I was working on. So, later that day, I opened one of the polishes and started painting; I immediately started wheezing and had a major asthma attack. So much for that bottle of polish. After taking my emergency inhalers and my breathing eased, I wanted to see if all the polishes were like that. So, I opened another bottle - just opened it and I could feel the effect it was having on my airways. So, closed that bottle and threw out the set - it was too dangerous to keep around.&lt;br /&gt;The one aspect of this whole episode that was really bothersome was that even though I didn&#x27;t use any of this polish on me and I only painted a small portion of what I want the polish for and immediately used remover to remove it and put the item outside, the fumes from those polishes stuck to me and my clothes. I have no idea what chemicals they used in making these polishes and you may have no problems with them at all,,but if you have any breathing problems (or someone in your house does) DO NOT BUY THIS POLISH. After what happened to me, I would not want this reaction to happen to anyone else. I was finally OK by the following day because I had the resources and the knowledge of what to do if I had a major asthma attack. I do not want anyone else to go through this type of scenario because they were not warned.</li>
