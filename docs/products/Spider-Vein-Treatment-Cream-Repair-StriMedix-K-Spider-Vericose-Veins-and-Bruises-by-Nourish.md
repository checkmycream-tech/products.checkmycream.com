### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>After saying that, it is wonderful..</li>
      <li>I have to just stick my fingers into it, which isn&#x27;t the best feeling for me.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve found that coconut oil works great without the acne side effect.</li>
      <li>over time it makes my legs look great</li>
      <li>Be sure to use it every day for the best results.</li>
      <li>The product does give a tingling feeling, when used as indicated, and that does feel good, but the spider veins are still there.  </li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>I sure was IN hopes it would work.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream</li>
      <li>also enjoy the refreshing feeling on my legs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Either you end up with a huge glob or end up trying to dig it out - time consuming.</li>
      <li>Now that winter dryness has set in, I&#x27;ve had to supplement this at night with a light moisturizer</li>
      <li>The ones on my legs are so light they can&#x27;t be seen unless you&#x27;re looking for them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Why do they go to such lengths to make good stuff and then package it so cheaply?</li>
      <li>Purchased it for veins, but used it on a fresh bruise.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff and it is the only cream that I&#x27;ve ever been able to find that not only fades the appearance of veins</li>
      <li>guess there isn&#x27;t anything OUT there that really works.  </li>
      <li>given I&#x27;ve tried many other creams.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement on the spider veins unfortunately, but it works great as a summer moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this repair cream.</li>
      <li>just soft skin...</li>
      <li>- They are almost completely invisible.  </li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s still too early to tell</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need eyeshadow anymore because the spider veins are completely gone.  </li>
      <li>So far I have been using for two weeks</li>
      <li>early days as apparently have to use product for a while&lt;</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve tried several) has pretty much cleared up the black heads.  </li>

    <li> So far I have been using for two weeks and I see no change. I know it&#x27;s still too early to tell so I will keep you posted</li>
    <li> I would no recommend this you can&#x60;t get it out of the bottle,unless you use a Q-tip.I don&#x60;t have time to dig for it twice a day.Does it work ?No not for the little bit I&#x60;ve used it.If I still have time left,I will send it back,If I can.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement on the spider veins unfortunately, but it works great as a summer moisturizer.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and still had trouble with black heads in my t-zone...switching to this instead of a regular moisturizer (I&#x27;ve tried several) has pretty much cleared up the black heads.  Now that winter dryness has set in, I&#x27;ve had to supplement this at night with a light moisturizer and I&#x27;ve found that coconut oil works great without the acne side effect.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it is the only cream that I&#x27;ve ever been able to find that not only fades the appearance of veins but it also provides instant relief if your legs ache and reduces edema.  Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> Used this cream 3 times a day as instructed. Did not work at all.  Did nothing. I have small veins on the side of my nose and they did jot even lighten.  Waste if money!</li>
    <li> This is a very thick cream. I have arthritis and find it hard to squeeze the container.  After saying that, it is wonderful..over time it makes my legs look great...helps with reducing the appearance of varicose veins.  Be sure to use it every day for the best results.</li>
    <li> Not helping divorce for money</li>
    <li> I have used this for two months and do not see any improvement in my spider veins. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for Almost 3 months TWICE a day and it hasn&#x27;t done ONE THING for my spider veins on my Nose what so ever.  So sorry I paid that amount of money I sure was IN hopes it would work.  I even before that bot a spider vein Cream and same thing did NOTHING,  guess there isn&#x27;t anything OUT there that really works.  Thank You Diane Heuring</li>
    <li> Purchased this product, but considering came from the USA, little misleading, as I didnt realise that I had to pay&lt;br /&gt;tax on this for it to be delivered from the PO! another £11! early days as apparently have to use product for a while&lt;br /&gt;before noticing anything remarkable..but fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I have just a few spider veins on my legs and on the sides of my nose.  I also have a place on the right side of my nose where the blood vessels were broken.  I&#x27;ve been using StriMedix-K for a few months and my nose is completely clear of spider veins.  The ones on my legs are so light they can&#x27;t be seen unless you&#x27;re looking for them!&lt;br /&gt;I also had my eyelids and brows lifted 2 years ago.  The scars were visible if you knew they were there, and I had spider veins on my eyelids which I covered with eyeshadow.  I don&#x27;t need eyeshadow anymore because the spider veins are completely gone.  I still wear eyeshadow, but only because I want to, not because I have to!!  And the scars!!! - They are almost completely invisible.  I love, love, love this product.  I bought another bottle so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.  I never want to be without StriMedix-K.  Oh yes, it works on bruises, too:  two or three days and they are gone!!  I highly recommend this repair cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;I like the texture and how it glides on the skin. I&#x27;m seeing a slight improvement, which is encouraging given I&#x27;ve tried many other creams.&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy the refreshing feeling on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I would suggest is to modify the packaging. It is extremely difficult to get out of the bottle. Either you end up with a huge glob or end up trying to dig it out - time consuming.</li>
    <li> Being using the cream for about a month now. Cannot see any reduction in spider veins  :-(  I will finish the bottle and follow up.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a thing!  I used it twice a day for a few weeks, and saw no change. The spider veins are still there...</li>
    <li> You have to squeeze this stuff out, but the bottle is made of such thick, hard plastic that you can&#x27;t squeeze it. I have to just stick my fingers into it, which isn&#x27;t the best feeling for me. Very messy.  Why do they go to such lengths to make good stuff and then package it so cheaply?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used for over a month and cannot see any difference....just soft skin...ugh not the reason I bought it</li>
    <li> I love this cream i just wish the bottle was bigger i also wish the price was lower i have not noticed anything yet will update in a month to give it time to work.</li>
    <li> Purchased it for veins, but used it on a fresh bruise.  The mark was gone in 3 days!  Have noticed improvement on veins, but will take a little while to go completely away - unlike the bruise!</li>
    <li> I have used this product and must say, honestly, I do not see any improvement in my spider veins.  The product does give a tingling feeling, when used as indicated, and that does feel good, but the spider veins are still there.  Maybe it works for some, but I am not one of those that can recommend this product.</li>
