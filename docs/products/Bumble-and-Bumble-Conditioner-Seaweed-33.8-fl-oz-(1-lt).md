      <li>This one was perfect.</li>
      <li>** 06/15/2011&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a good delivery!</li>
      <li>Good product at the best price.  </li>
      <li>B&amp;B products are great, but for some reason not this one sold by Amazon.</li>
      <li>, burnt plastic is a good description, when I used it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried BB seaweed shampoo and conditioner before and I loved it.</li>
      <li>I love mine and will continue to use it as it works wonders for my stubborn hair!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great at keeping my hair clean, tamed and not frizzy.</li>
      <li>It lathers and conditions better.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite condition because it does condition, but is also the lightest I have found on the market.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product, but I think that the Thickening Shampoo and conditioner works much better.  </li>
      <li>After 1-2 days at home no issues any more.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfect daily conditioner for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>This conditioner didn&#x27;t smell foul, it smelled fresh and nice.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for fine hair as it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
      <li>great deal on a solid product</li>
      <li>Heck you may even get some free samples out of it.</li>
      <li>When I spoke with customer service they advised that the product was backordered  but offered to send a replacement when it became available.</li>
      <li>Upon receiving notification that the replacement had been sent, I received instructions on how to return the tainted product with a notice that unless the original was received, my credit card would be billed for the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered from Salon Products NY and not only did it come super fast, but it is fresh and perfect.</li>
      <li>Amazon, I will continue to send this product back until you send me a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bottle was not secured in any way and was free to move around in the too large box it was shipped in.  </li>
      <li>The one from the salon is how it should feel, very tangle free hair.</li>
      <li>The scent is gentle and clean, not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>good deal for the amount of product, smells a little different in the bottle, but smells amazing after you wash your hair with it</li>
      <li>Glad to finally get it over the internet.  </li>
      <li>I really like Bumble and Bumble products!</li>
      <li>However, this is my first time purchasing the shampoo and conditioner from amazon</li>
      <li>First, the shipping/packaging of this product by Amazon was substandard.  </li>
      <li>you get from most hair products used over a long period of time.</li>
      <li>I really like using this conditioner as it rinses out easily and gets out all of the tangles in my long, straight hair.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair, and typically love a thick and rich conditioner that leaves my hair silky feeling.  </li>
      <li>As many of you know from my comments and other reviews that this product appears to have stability issues with distribution.</li>
      <li>Although I questioned this, I was assured it would not be necessary to return the original order.</li>
      <li>However, it is important to know that it is not a moisturizing conditioner, so if you have a dry scalp it may not be for you.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I was able to wash everything off, but I was not happy about it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Buyers, if your product does not smell right, send it back!</li>
      <li>After a few days of sitting in a warm house the contents seemed to separate into a white and clear layer.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and the item sent from amazon is clearly counterfeit.  </li>
      <li>Clearly a counterfeit version has ended up in their supply chain.</li>
      <li>However, the product did make my hair feel soft.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive hair and scalp and no issues with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>but the second bottle had the same exact problems.</li>
      <li>Conditioner was also very watered down and didn&#x27;t do much</li>
      <li>I figured I would give it another shot with a new vendor to see if they can store and ship the conditioner properly</li>
      <li>I know this product and it should have a very light and minimal smell, not a strong chemical or plastic</li>
      <li>Smelled funny and left my hair dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased it several times from salons and directly from the Bumble and Bumble website.  </li>

<li> I am now sending back my 3rd bad bottle of this stuff.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m guessing that either it got exposed to extremely cold temperatures for an extended period of time or the product was diluted with a clear liquid.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to try a small container from the BB website and see if there&#x27;s a difference.  </li>

<li> Looking at past reviews, it looks like this was a common problem.</li>
<li> It was both &#x27;fowl smelling and irritating to skin&#x27; as described by a previous reviewer.</li>
<li> Having used Bumble and Bumble products exclusively for at least 5 years, I was stunned when I opened the bottle of conditioner I purchased from Amazon.</li>
<li> I thought the consistency was very thin - seemed watered down, even.  </li>

<li> Also, It has this awful plastic odor that isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed for various reasons.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this product here is either a fake or diluted with gods-know-what.</li>
<li> Counterfeit products along with poor customer service is a bad combination.</li>

    <li> I love the smell of this product, but I think that the Thickening Shampoo and conditioner works much better.  It lathers and conditions better.</li>
    <li> Having used Bumble and Bumble products exclusively for at least 5 years, I was stunned when I opened the bottle of conditioner I purchased from Amazon. It was both &#x27;fowl smelling and irritating to skin&#x27; as described by a previous reviewer. When I spoke with customer service they advised that the product was backordered  but offered to send a replacement when it became available. When I inquired about returning the &#x27;counterfeit&#x27; version, I was instructed to &#x27;throw it away&#x27;. Although I questioned this, I was assured it would not be necessary to return the original order. Being cautious, I did not follow these instructions, but put the bottle away until the replacement was sent. Upon receiving notification that the replacement had been sent, I received instructions on how to return the tainted product with a notice that unless the original was received, my credit card would be billed for the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as this is settled, I intend to sever my relationship with Amazon. Counterfeit products along with poor customer service is a bad combination.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I&#x27;ve purchased it several times from salons and directly from the Bumble and Bumble website.  It&#x27;s a perfect daily conditioner for my fine hair. The scent is gentle and clean, not overpowering.  I would have rated it 5 stars, except for a few things.  First, the shipping/packaging of this product by Amazon was substandard.  Basically, just the pump part of the dispenser was taped.  The bottle was not secured in any way and was free to move around in the too large box it was shipped in.  During shipping, the dispenser partially unscrewed and leaked conditioner over the entire contents of my package.  Luckily, I was able to wash everything off, but I was not happy about it.  Second, the conditioner itself smells like plastic.  My previous purchases of this conditioner have not even had a hint of this plastic smell.  It could be an isolated incident, but I&#x27;d recommend paying a few extra dollars and buying directly from B&amp;B.  Heck you may even get some free samples out of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried BB seaweed shampoo and conditioner before and I loved it. It&#x27;s great at keeping my hair clean, tamed and not frizzy. However, this is my first time purchasing the shampoo and conditioner from amazon and I&#x27;m very disappointed for various reasons. The packaging is weak. The pump is taped down to the cap and there is conditioner all over the brim of the bottle which seems like its been used before. Also, It has this awful plastic odor that isn&#x27;t normal. I exchanged it for another one hoping it was just a manufacture error but the second bottle had the same exact problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for years including a few bottles I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon and directly from Bumble and Bumble. The last bottle I got from amazon smelled like nail polish and burned my skin. Clearly a counterfeit version has ended up in their supply chain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years, and have had to send many bottles back because of a chemical smell, probably due to poor storage. Looking at past reviews, it looks like this was a common problem. This one was perfect. I&#x27;ll order from this vendor any time.</li>
    <li> Today I purchased this product at an authorized Bumble &amp; bumble. salon. I compared it to what I had left of the one I ordered from Amazon.com:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells completely different. The one from Amazon.com does smell of a harsh chemical and plastic.&lt;br /&gt;2. The feel of your hair after using it is completely different. The one from the salon is how it should feel, very tangle free hair. The one from Amazon.com is, well, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend you do not purchase through amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I really like using this conditioner as it rinses out easily and gets out all of the tangles in my long, straight hair. However, it is important to know that it is not a moisturizing conditioner, so if you have a dry scalp it may not be for you.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite condition because it does condition, but is also the lightest I have found on the market. Does not weigh hair down or cause that inevitable build up you get from most hair products used over a long period of time. I just use a weekly deeply conditioner to supplement if I need it.</li>
    <li> This is the other half of the recommended system of hair care by Bumble and Bumble.  It is recommended if you want to use the Seaweed Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am sorry to have to write this as I have used this product successfully for years now, but Amazon just wont listen and fix this issue with the bad batch. I am now sending back my 3rd bad bottle of this stuff. It must be from a storage/environmental containment issue. The product is foul and smells of plastic. I have gone through many batches and know when something is wrong. Amazon, I will continue to send this product back until you send me a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyers, if your product does not smell right, send it back! Do not take chances on hurting yourself or your skin. I know this product and it should have a very light and minimal smell, not a strong chemical or plastic odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Amazon fixes this issue, I will revise my review. Until then, unless you want to deal with sending it back over and over, I recommend you look somewhere else for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** 06/15/2011&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a good delivery! I figured I would give it another shot with a new vendor to see if they can store and ship the conditioner properly and they did. I ordered from Salon Products NY and not only did it come super fast, but it is fresh and perfect. As many of you know from my comments and other reviews that this product appears to have stability issues with distribution. I am hoping that Salon Products NY sticks with it because I plan to order from them when this batch runs out.&lt;br /&gt;**</li>
    <li> good deal for the amount of product, smells a little different in the bottle, but smells amazing after you wash your hair with it</li>
    <li> great deal on a solid product</li>
    <li> I really like Bumble and Bumble products!</li>
    <li> Received this product after a few days delay in shipment. After a few days of sitting in a warm house the contents seemed to separate into a white and clear layer. I&#x27;m guessing that either it got exposed to extremely cold temperatures for an extended period of time or the product was diluted with a clear liquid.</li>
    <li> Entire family loves this shampoo. I have sensitive hair and scalp and no issues with this shampoo. I travel a lot and take hotel supplied shampoo which gives me the itch after 2-3 days. Further my hair gets &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lifeless&amp;#34;. After 1-2 days at home no issues any more.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and the item sent from amazon is clearly counterfeit.  I was overcome by the smell, burnt plastic is a good description, when I used it.  I still had some from my previous bottle and there is absolutely no doubt that the item sent is counterfeit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for about 3 years and it&#x27;s the best I have ever used.  Perfect for fine hair as it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Use it with B&amp;B thickening shampoo and you&#x27;ve got the perfect combo.</li>
    <li> Good product at the best price.  Glad to finally get it over the internet.  It was hit or miss at the salon, but now, no problems.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, and typically love a thick and rich conditioner that leaves my hair silky feeling.  This conditioner didn&#x27;t smell foul, it smelled fresh and nice.  I thought the consistency was very thin - seemed watered down, even.  I have to use twice as much as usual to get all of my hair, which is the most disappointing part.  However, the product did make my hair feel soft.  I&#x27;m going to try a small container from the BB website and see if there&#x27;s a difference.  I&#x27;ll let you know...</li>
    <li> Afterward a few times using this conditioner, I find it leaves a film on my hair that just keeps building up with each use! I switched to another brand and my hair is perfect again.</li>
    <li> May be knockoff. Smelled funny and left my hair dry. Conditioner was also very watered down and didn&#x27;t do much</li>
    <li> This is a great condition by Bumble and Bumble! I love mine and will continue to use it as it works wonders for my stubborn hair!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this product here is either a fake or diluted with gods-know-what. It has an strage feel to it, and does not have any affect on the air. B&amp;B products are great, but for some reason not this one sold by Amazon. Do not buy it here!!!</li>
