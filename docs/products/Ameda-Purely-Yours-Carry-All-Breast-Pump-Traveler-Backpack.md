### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
      <li>The backpack feature is awesome for moms on the go -</li>
      <li>Great buy!</li>
      <li>Ohh I forgot, the customer service is very good.</li>
      <li>Great pump.</li>
      <li>They have a blog and great information and tips for pumping in their website [...].  </li>
      <li>and that is a great convenience pumping thrice a day.  </li>
      <li>Chances are you&#x27;ll need a pump at some point and this a great pump to have when the time comes.</li>
      <li>At $200, $300, or $400 this would have been a GREAT deal.</li>
      <li>Then it can take batteries - great if you want to take it to the county fair or a sporting event.  </li>
      <li>The bag is very nice, and the cooler system comes in handy.</li>
      <li>Unlike many moms I know, I do not find great ease in pumping.  </li>
      <li>Make your own handsfree bra</li>
      <li>This thing was my best friend for 3 months straight.  </li>
      <li>I love the backpack - it&#x27;s of excellent quality and very discreet when out and about.  </li>
      <li>I Loved this pump for me since it was eay to use and had controls to change the suction and speed very important for beginning sore nipples...ugh!Lightweight and easy to travel with, a bit noisy</li>
      <li>No need to rent a pump - this is a good as you can get without owning a huge cumbersome hospital unit.  </li>
      <li>For a mom-to-be pregnant with twins, I thought purchasing a good hospital grade pump would probably be needed.  </li>
      <li>Purely Yours pump is great.</li>
      <li>I remembered pumping A LOT more with my PIS, so I pulled it out and gave it a try just to test my hunch,</li>
      <li>It does not stimulate the appropriate part of the breast.</li>
      <li>more hind milk and the pumped milk is more whitish than the one I pump with Ameda.  </li>
      <li>I have tried different pumps, and this is the best.   </li>
      <li>Both pumps are comparable and I get probably an ounce more with the Medela Lactina plus.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This may not be the top of the line electric pump, but I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
      <li>but when I called the customer service number they had some great tips that really made a difference in facilitating letdown.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to setup and clean and the motor is quieter than the Lactina that I use at work.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s convenient and easy to use.</li>
      <li>and I have been able to set up the Ameda, pump and clean in that time slot.</li>
      <li>Well, I lucked out and found this one on ebay brand new in packaging for $130 - good deal</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to take with you.</li>
      <li>The cooler is compact and does fit six, four ounces bottles</li>
      <li>Fortunately, my baby likes the sound and goes to sleep to it.</li>
      <li>One thing that I loved the most about this product is pumping in car, it comes with car charger and I have pumped my milk in moving car at 2 different occasions and have saved myself from being engorged.</li>
      <li>I was using a Medela pump I rented from the hospital for the first month after my baby was born and decided it was worth it to go ahead and buy my own.</li>
      <li>I chose Ameda backpack version over others because of price,features and number of parts to clean.  </li>
      <li>Again I am more inclined to giving Purely yours a benefit of doubt as it is not a hospital grade pump unlike Medela Lactina.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended and easy to use!</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this pump, thinking it was going to be superior...</li>
      <li>Overall this is a good pump.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking to pump discretely, this isn&#x27;t the pump for you due to the noise but everything else about it is great.</li>
      <li>It helped up fantastic for the first 6-7 months, then I started having problems.  </li>
      <li>Work from the armpit in towards the nipple, using as much pressure as is comfortable.    </li>
      <li>I like the suction which is soft and with practice I have been able to set it up to mimic my baby&#x27;s suction.</li>
      <li>-pay extra to truly overnight the replacement  -offer refunds so that I could go out and buy my own replacement  -make</li>
      <li>The best thing is the suction and the speed setting which can be set independent of each other.  </li>
      <li>, right?  </li>
      <li>I completely forgot about the whole incidence and the next day I got a call from Ameda and the lady gave me the phone number of an in house lactation consultant and I got great tips about pumping efficiently.</li>
      <li>Moisten the flanges with water or a little milk to create a good seal.    </li>
      <li>sure enough I pumped 5oz in 10 min.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I used a second-hand Medela Pump-In-Style Advance(I know you&#x27;re not supposed to) pump from my sister-in-law to pump for my first child for 2 years</li>
      <li>Overall I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it friends and family.</li>
      <li>You can usually get more &#x27;let-down&#x27; cycles and hence more milk if you think about your baby or look at them while pumping.  </li>
      <li>They also sent me a bunch of extra parts for free!</li>
      <li>Renting other brands (available at locations closer to me) costs more than buying a new pump.</li>
      <li>Overall, it worked fantastic for the first six months before the problems started.</li>
      <li>Purely Yours</li>
      <li>I spoke to two lactation consultants and both of them recommended either Medela PIS or Ameda purely yours or Avent Isis Duo.  </li>
      <li>I called Ameda, they don&#x27;t offer refunds, only replacements, which would have been fine, except that my pump broke on a Friday, and even though they claimed they would overnight it, it won&#x27;t arrive until Monday.</li>
      <li>I am still getting used to this pump, but it functions very well.  </li>
      <li>This one is much cheaper than the Medela pump</li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied....</li>
      <li>It works very efficiently.  </li>
      <li>As with everybody, I did a lot of research before buying this one after the birth of my son before returning full time back to work.  </li>
      <li>I initially chose the Ameda over the Medela Pump In Style because I&#x27;m not pumping full time, and the Ameda had been recommended based upon its function, its hygiene set-up, and its price.  </li>
      <li>I gave this four stars because of the one main thing I have observed, with Lactina</li>
      <li>The flange it comes with is too big for me and would hurt while I was pumping, but I ordered an insert to make it smaller and everything fits better now.  </li>
      <li>I can get more milk from my single \\&quot;Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump\\&quot; than I can by using \\&quot;Ameda Purely Yours\\&quot; double pump.  </li>
      <li>The backpack is stylish although Ameda could have made it little softer.  </li>
      <li>The transition was kind of hard</li>
      <li>SO, I bought a manual pump to tide me over for Monday/until the new pump arrives.    </li>
      <li>Cleaning is a breeze as there are no small parts.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the Purely Yours pump after a friend of mine that used one several years ago highly recommended it.  </li>
      <li>: take a well-fitting (not too tight) sports bra and cut slits horizontally over your nipples, just large enough to fit the flanges through.  </li>
      <li>My girls ended up being born 8 weeks early and this allowed me to pump exclusively until the girls were ready to nurse - 3 months later!  </li>
      <li>I noticed that if the plastic liner/diaphragm between the hose and the cup got wet (for instance if it had a few droplets left on it from washing) it would get very easily stuck to the side wall</li>
      <li>baby is currently 2 months old</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that it&#x27;s loud.</li>
      <li>This obviously is not supposed to happen, because the hose leads directly into the mechanics of the machine and could damage the pump.  </li>
      <li>I increased my milk supply by taking Fenugreek supplement and drinking three cups of Mother&#x27;s Milk tea from my local natural foods store.  </li>
      <li>I would pump for 20-30 mins and barely get 4 oz when after about 10 mins my cheaper pump would be over 5 oz.</li>
      <li>The pump did not have any of the strength I needed, I feel like I wasted a lot of money to go back and use my $25 single pump that I bought for quick usage.</li>
      <li>They would reimburse me for RENTING an AMEDA brand pump until the replacement arrives, but most places don&#x27;t rent Ameda pumps, they rent Medela and other brands, so there were no good options within a 45 minute drive for rental.</li>

<li> The company is not very helpful at all and the product is garbage!  </li>
<li> Something is wrong with the tubing on one side from the first use.</li>
<li> I can usually pump one feeding per sitting in the 30 minute time slot we get at work, but only if I keep adjusting the suction and cycle.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, after only 5 weeks of use it has already lost suction - low marks for reliability, even for someone with limited pumping needs.</li>
<li> I now have to suck up my monetary investment as a loss and decide if I  will just make due with the slightly worn PIS or invest a chunk of change in a newer MEDELA pump.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was using a Medela pump I rented from the hospital for the first month after my baby was born and decided it was worth it to go ahead and buy my own. This one is much cheaper than the Medela pump and it works just as well. It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to take with you. I like the extras it came with (cooler bag, extra bottles, backpack). The only drawback is that it&#x27;s loud. Fortunately, my baby likes the sound and goes to sleep to it. If you&#x27;re looking to pump discretely, this isn&#x27;t the pump for you due to the noise but everything else about it is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading comparisons to the Medela Pump In Style.  I haven&#x27;t used the Medela, but after using the hospital grade pump for a few weeks I found that this one worked almost as well.  I love the backpack - it&#x27;s of excellent quality and very discreet when out and about.  I work with a bunch of guys and they will never guess what&#x27;s inside.  I also have a few general tips to increase milk output that have worked for me:  1. Make your own handsfree bra: take a well-fitting (not too tight) sports bra and cut slits horizontally over your nipples, just large enough to fit the flanges through.  2. Moisten the flanges with water or a little milk to create a good seal.    3. Massage and squeeze breasts while pumping.  Work from the armpit in towards the nipple, using as much pressure as is comfortable.    4. Hand express the last few drops (I can usually get ~10mL) after removing the flanges.  5. You can usually get more &#x27;let-down&#x27; cycles and hence more milk if you think about your baby or look at them while pumping.  I listen to books on tape but take time every so often to think about your baby.    6. I increased my milk supply by taking Fenugreek supplement and drinking three cups of Mother&#x27;s Milk tea from my local natural foods store.  Beware the Fenugreek will make you smell a bit like maple syrup!   7. Drink lots of water!!!</li>
    <li> I am still getting used to this pump, but it functions very well.  The pump meets our needs and the cost was minimal compared to some other pumps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first-time mom who started pumping at week 3, for just one 4-5 oz bottle per day; I have since increased pumping sessions in anticipation of returning to work part-time.  I initially chose the Ameda over the Medela Pump In Style because I&#x27;m not pumping full time, and the Ameda had been recommended based upon its function, its hygiene set-up, and its price.  Unfortunately, after only 5 weeks of use it has already lost suction - low marks for reliability, even for someone with limited pumping needs.</li>
    <li> I brought this pump after the birth of my second child. As with everybody, I did a lot of research before buying this one after the birth of my son before returning full time back to work.  I spoke to two lactation consultants and both of them recommended either Medela PIS or Ameda purely yours or Avent Isis Duo.  I chose Ameda backpack version over others because of price,features and number of parts to clean.  I use this at home over the weekend and Medela Lactina Plus at work which is a hospital grade pump that my office provides.  Both pumps are comparable and I get probably an ounce more with the Medela Lactina plus. It is very easy to setup and clean and the motor is quieter than the Lactina that I use at work.  The best thing is the suction and the speed setting which can be set independent of each other.  I like the suction which is soft and with practice I have been able to set it up to mimic my baby&#x27;s suction. I haven&#x27;t been using it during weekdays so I don&#x27;t know the durability of the motor.  One thing that I loved the most about this product is pumping in car, it comes with car charger and I have pumped my milk in moving car at 2 different occasions and have saved myself from being engorged. The motor is small and detachable from the bag. The cooler is compact and does fit six, four ounces bottles and that is a great convenience pumping thrice a day.  The suction feels stronger while single pumping and the data sheets say the same.  My office has just 20 minutes schedule for lactation room and I have been able to set up the Ameda, pump and clean in that time slot. Cleaning is a breeze as there are no small parts.  With the Lactina personal kit I have to be careful with the membrane which is very fragile, I have almost lost it twice while sterilizing.  Another added advantage is the prevention of milk backing up in the tubes.  With the Lactina I need to inspect the tubes per the manufacturer&#x27;s advise every time after I am done to check for milk backup.I don&#x27;t have that problem with Ameda.  I haven&#x27;t had milk backed up yet with Lactina, but the anxiety of checking the tubes is always there.  The backpack is stylish although Ameda could have made it little softer.  The inside liner is made of polythene and so the bag is stiff.  Other than that many of colleagues have confused my backpack as a regular backpack.  It does have an option of housing batteries and running the motor on that, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it and not sure if I will ever use it.  I gave this four stars because of the one main thing I have observed, with Lactina I get more hind milk and the pumped milk is more whitish than the one I pump with Ameda.  I haven&#x27;t used Medela PIS so don&#x27;t know if that does it.  Again I am more inclined to giving Purely yours a benefit of doubt as it is not a hospital grade pump unlike Medela Lactina.  Ohh I forgot, the customer service is very good. I called their customer service regarding pumping tips and left a voice mail.  I completely forgot about the whole incidence and the next day I got a call from Ameda and the lady gave me the phone number of an in house lactation consultant and I got great tips about pumping efficiently. They have a blog and great information and tips for pumping in their website [...].  Overall I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it friends and family.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Purely Yours pump after a friend of mine that used one several years ago highly recommended it.  I have been EXTREMELY disappointed with it.  After 4 weeks of use, the pump stopped sucking properly.  When I finally got a hold of customer service they sent me a new motor and the replacement worked just as poorly!  As a working mom, pumping is crucial to keeping my milk supply up and due to all these problems my milk production has indeed decreased.  The company is not very helpful at all and the product is garbage!  I wish I had spent a few extra bucks and gotten a Medela pump instead.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PUMP!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried different pumps, and this is the best.   One thing, it is just like the Lansonoh pump.  Made in the same country, probably in the same factory, just different color and different name on the front.  Save yourself some money and buy the Lansonoh!  That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars, because I wish I would have saved myself $65 dollars by buying the Lansonoh pump.    The bag is very nice, and the cooler system comes in handy.</li>
    <li> I used this pump for both of my children, a total of about 12 months of use.  It helped up fantastic for the first 6-7 months, then I started having problems.  I noticed that if the plastic liner/diaphragm between the hose and the cup got wet (for instance if it had a few droplets left on it from washing) it would get very easily stuck to the side wall and I would lose suction.  The machine would get stuck in an \\&quot;on\\&quot; cycle and pump very hard until I removed my breast and dried the diaphragm.  I also had one instance where it went into a very different suction cycle, sucked milk up above the cone where your breast goes, and actually the milk went through the hose.  This obviously is not supposed to happen, because the hose leads directly into the mechanics of the machine and could damage the pump.  Overall, it worked fantastic for the first six months before the problems started.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good pump.  I can usually pump one feeding per sitting in the 30 minute time slot we get at work, but only if I keep adjusting the suction and cycle.  The flange it comes with is too big for me and would hurt while I was pumping, but I ordered an insert to make it smaller and everything fits better now.  The reason I why I chose this over the Medela Pump In Style is because of the price and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about milk backing up in the tubes, unlike with the Medela PIS.  This may not be the top of the line electric pump, but I can&#x27;t complain.  It gets the job done and is saving me tons of $$$ in what could be formula cost.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this pump.  I can get more milk from my single \\&quot;Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump\\&quot; than I can by using \\&quot;Ameda Purely Yours\\&quot; double pump.  I am disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Unlike many moms I know, I do not find great ease in pumping.  For some reason I struggle.  It may have something to do with not being relaxed while performing this art.  However, since I started using this pump, I have become a pro (at least in comparison to what I was before).  This pump is a dream compared to the pumps I have tried in the past.  It works very efficiently.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Working moms don&#x27;t have time for pumps that break.    After using my pump for almost 5 months, it broke in the middle of a pumping session at work. I called Ameda, they don&#x27;t offer refunds, only replacements, which would have been fine, except that my pump broke on a Friday, and even though they claimed they would overnight it, it won&#x27;t arrive until Monday. I need an interim pumping solution for work on Monday, since the replacement pump will arrive sometime on Monday (hopefully). A tip to expectant moms: don&#x27;t buy a pump until late in your pregnancy to maximize the one year limited warranty. Also consider buying a breast pump package w/ both manual and electric pump in case your electric one breaks.    While Ameda is replacing the pump, this is underwhelming. They would reimburse me for RENTING an AMEDA brand pump until the replacement arrives, but most places don&#x27;t rent Ameda pumps, they rent Medela and other brands, so there were no good options within a 45 minute drive for rental. Renting other brands (available at locations closer to me) costs more than buying a new pump. SO, I bought a manual pump to tide me over for Monday/until the new pump arrives.    Ameda should:  -pay extra to truly overnight the replacement  -offer refunds so that I could go out and buy my own replacement  -make pumps that don&#x27;t break!    Working moms don&#x27;t have time for the hassle, and any company that makes breastpumps should understand the importance of not having a gap in pumping so moms don&#x27;t have to worry about screwing up their milk supply. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this pump, thinking it was going to be superior...well, after several days of just getting frustrated with the pumps inability to faciliate a let-down; I decided to buy something else. The shields are not comfortable. It does not stimulate the appropriate part of the breast. The suction is not suffient either. Shop around before spending the money on this pump.</li>
    <li> Something is wrong with the tubing on one side from the first use. Annoying to have donething brand new not need new parts from the start.</li>
    <li> The pump did not have any of the strength I needed, I feel like I wasted a lot of money to go back and use my $25 single pump that I bought for quick usage. I would pump for 20-30 mins and barely get 4 oz when after about 10 mins my cheaper pump would be over 5 oz. Very unsatisfied....</li>
    <li> I purchased this pump through a local medical supply store because the store would accept my insurance, so I only had to pay the deductible vs. retail for the pump.  Too bad I had to pay anything for this hunk of junk...&lt;br /&gt;I used a second-hand Medela Pump-In-Style Advance(I know you&#x27;re not supposed to) pump from my sister-in-law to pump for my first child for 2 years (yep, I BF for a long time).  She used it to pump for her 2 children for 1 year each.  The PIS pump was starting to show some signs of wear (the suction plug to have both pumps used simultaneously will occasionally loosen a bit and reduce suction-which is easily remedied by pressing the plug back into the device, only slightly annoying) so I figured since I could get another pump at a reduced cost through insurance I would treat myself for this baby since I plan to pump at least 1 year and up to another 2 years.  Unfortunately I could not find a local retailer to replace my PIS so I gave the Ameda Purely Yours a try.&lt;br /&gt;My baby is currently 2 months old and I have been BF for nearly all of her meals and pumping with the Ameda for the past 6wks. to build a supply in our deep freezer for my return to work when she is 4 months.  I thought I was having problems with producing milk.  I could only pump 1-3 oz with the Ameda in a 10-20 min. sitting.  I remembered pumping A LOT more with my PIS, so I pulled it out and gave it a try just to test my hunch, sure enough I pumped 5oz in 10 min.  I&#x27;m really disappointed that the new pump does not preform as well as my PIS.  I now have to suck up my monetary investment as a loss and decide if I  will just make due with the slightly worn PIS or invest a chunk of change in a newer MEDELA pump.&lt;br /&gt;If you are debating between an AMEDA vs. a MEDELA pump, go with MEDELA and save yourself some time, money and frustration.</li>
    <li> I Loved this pump for me since it was eay to use and had controls to change the suction and speed very important for beginning sore nipples...ugh!Lightweight and easy to travel with, a bit noisy but I would muffle the noise with a pillow, that works especially when you dont want to wake up baby!</li>
    <li> Great pump. I rented a hospital grade pump until I got this one. The transition was kind of hard but when I called the customer service number they had some great tips that really made a difference in facilitating letdown. They also sent me a bunch of extra parts for free! Love it.</li>
    <li> For a mom-to-be pregnant with twins, I thought purchasing a good hospital grade pump would probably be needed.  I was gunghoe on nursing the girls...not to meantion the savings in formula costs.  Well, I lucked out and found this one on ebay brand new in packaging for $130 - good deal, right?  At $200, $300, or $400 this would have been a GREAT deal. This pump ROCKS!  My girls ended up being born 8 weeks early and this allowed me to pump exclusively until the girls were ready to nurse - 3 months later!  No need to rent a pump - this is a good as you can get without owning a huge cumbersome hospital unit.  Plus, the car adapter was a must with me.  I pumped while driving (not sure what the cops would have thought about that - but mom has to do what she has to do).  Then it can take batteries - great if you want to take it to the county fair or a sporting event.  Plus, it is totally compatible with all hospital pump parts (made by Ameda - my hospital used ameda).  Any way - this pump saved me money on formula (I probably would have given up if my supply dwindled - but this pump kept it up there) and it allowed me to get out of the house.  This thing was my best friend for 3 months straight.  Highly recommended and easy to use!</li>
    <li> The Ameda Purely Yours pump is great. Up until recently I hardly ever pumped just because I never really had the need. We recently started my son on rice cereal and I wanted to mix it with breast milk and in the past week the pump has paid for itself! It&#x27;s convenient and easy to use. The backpack feature is awesome for moms on the go - especially working mothers who want to pump but do so discreetly. It also comes with several storage bottles, a smaller storage bag for the bottles and ice packs to keep the milk cold if you&#x27;re somewhere without a fridge. It&#x27;s awesome. Chances are you&#x27;ll need a pump at some point and this a great pump to have when the time comes. Trust me, you don&#x27;t want to be stuck hand pumping one breast at a time with a manual pump!</li>
