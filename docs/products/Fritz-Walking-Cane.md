      <li>Very light fits nice into your hand.</li>
      <li>The cane is very stable and a very good support.</li>
      <li>comfortable and good looking</li>
      <li>Handsome cane with nice, ergonomic handle</li>
      <li>The cane is finished nicely and looks better in person than on line.</li>
      <li>So I don’t need an industrial strength cane; I just wanted one that looks handsome rather than institutional, and this one fits the bill nicely.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this cane because the price was right,  the cane looked attractive and it had the handle I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>It is also an attractive understated class act cane that is not gaudy, with a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>And the cane is very light yet sturdy.</li>
      <li>He has much more confidence in his ability to stay upright now.</li>
      <li>love the design it has and many people said they like it also</li>
      <li>Also, the handle is not as shiny as what you see in the picture that Amazon has posted--it is more of a matte finish rather than a glossy finish--and the color is blonder (for lack of a better word) than what’s pictured.  </li>
      <li>Still using it although people say thatey can get me a better one.  </li>

      <li>the do a perfect cut, put the rubber tip back on and I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Probably no product could have given me the magic I was looking for.</li>
      <li>BUT MY SPOUSE SAYS IT IS OK</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>It is the materials tend to appear more \\&quot;woodish\\&quot; like in the picture, but they are not.  </li>
      <li>It served its purpose and he was pleased.</li>
      <li>This darker color looks to me more elegant.</li>
      <li>It was able to support my 6&#x27;2 frame and all 215 lbs of me.</li>
      <li>+ Quick and Easy  Great Fast Ship 5 Stars</li>
      <li>I guess you&#x27;d say it is more a maple color than the rich walnut or mahogany</li>
      <li>Strong and well constructed.</li>
      <li>Sturdy can with comfortable, easy to grip handle.</li>
      <li>Cane worked fine but the finish is not durable.</li>
      <li>and it is still fine</li>
      <li>CANE STRONG AND COMFORTABLE</li>
      <li>Over all, I’m very pleased with the fast delivery of the cane, and I’m happy enough with the product.  </li>
      <li>and if I pay shipping, a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I will make the best use of it I can while recovering from surgery.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a cane when you can check it out IN PERSON.</li>
      <li>mainly because it is a light but strong and easy to manipulate.  </li>
      <li>Good looking cane if there is such a thing.</li>
      <li>Just make sure that you cut it off straight.</li>
      <li>It is contemporary and classy and the wood is very nicely stained.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and has met my expectations.</li>
      <li>The finish on the handle is so smooth it feels more like soft leather than wood.</li>
      <li>Very stylish and comfortable to use (the grip is just right) with a nice feel and heft to it; For its&#x27; cost, it would be hard to match.</li>
      <li>; that should tell you a lot; the first one which I still have is in a light color and looks informal which is OK to me since I like to wear my old jeans, I believe is oak.</li>
      <li>The cane is light but very stable.</li>
      <li>Makes my walks much easier and comfortable.</li>
      <li>It was nice but an inch or two too short.</li>
      <li>and I found this cane much more comfortable than the aluminum hospital physical rehab cane with the shepherd (curved) handle.</li>
      <li>This Fritz handle cane was disigned by a German count to make cane use by the arthritic sufferer more comfortable.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a nice wooden cane, and this is it.</li>
      <li>Right size out of the box.</li>

      <li>well this is my first cane</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I just measured the canes and overall length is 35 inches from top of cane handle to bottom of vane with rubber foot in place.</li>
      <li>hahaha!</li>
      <li>A few of the good points:</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as shiny as the one pictured, more of a flat, satin finish.  </li>
      <li>Actually, to me, the cane looks better in real life than it does in the picture.    </li>
      <li>This Kane not only looks elegant, but it is very sterdy.</li>

    <li> Looks great good desl</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes it.</li>
    <li> Being 62 years old and have a slipped disc, I thought on a BAD day I needed a cane to help me out. Didn&#x27;t like all of the adjustable models and wanted a classy cane, Follow the instructions with the cane and cut what is not needed. Just make sure that you cut it off straight. Great looking cane !!</li>
    <li> CANE STRONG AND COMFORTABLE</li>
    <li> This cane looks very nice.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as shiny as the one pictured, more of a flat, satin finish.  Actually, to me, the cane looks better in real life than it does in the picture.    It measures 36\\&quot; from the center of the handle to the tip.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10\\&quot; and thought I would have to trim it, but it fit me perfectly as shipped.  If you are taller than I am you might want to Google \\&quot;cane sizing chart\\&quot; before ordering.    I don&#x27;t use a cane full time, but wanted one on hand for the occasional hip or back pain.  By having this in reserve I won&#x27;t get stuck with one of those ugly drugstore canes. :)</li>
    <li> Very nice for the money</li>
    <li> perfect for my use. good buy.</li>
    <li> A ++++ Quick and Easy  Great Fast Ship 5 Stars All The Way Two Thumbs Up Excellent</li>
    <li> well this is my first cane and hopefully my last.  love the design it has and many people said they like it also</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed once i recieved my cane. It looks nothing like the nice, dark finish as shown. Instead, I recieved a ugly brown cane that looks horrible. WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> First of all, this cane actually arrived a couple of days EARLIER than promised, which I greatly appreciated.  As for the cane itself: I don’t have crippling problems; I just need a cane sometimes when my back and/or hip problems flare up (which they are right now).  So I don’t need an industrial strength cane; I just wanted one that looks handsome rather than institutional, and this one fits the bill nicely.  (I’m old enough that I’m willing to look “distinguished” but not old enough that I don’t care if I look crippled.) A few of the good points: The finish on the handle is so smooth it feels more like soft leather than wood. That was a nice surprise.  Also the shape of the handle really is perfectly designed for a comfortable grip.  The gold colored ring that collars the top of the cane where the handle joins the shaft is a very nice touch.  And the cane is very light yet sturdy. (I’m nowhere near its 250 pound limit, so its strength wasn&#x27;t a worry for me anyway though.) A couple quibbles, although they aren&#x27;t big ones: The rubber tip at the bottom of the cane (which isn&#x27;t pictured here on Amazon) is a bit large and clunky looking.  I understand the utility of a rubber tip, but this one detracts a little bit from the elegant look of the cane.  Also, the handle is not as shiny as what you see in the picture that Amazon has posted--it is more of a matte finish rather than a glossy finish--and the color is blonder (for lack of a better word) than what’s pictured.  I guess you&#x27;d say it is more a maple color than the rich walnut or mahogany I expected.  (Amazon&#x27;s posted picture, then, does make it seem that the vendor is being somewhat deceptive. I have posted my own picture of my cane so you can see what I mean.) That’s a bit disappointing, but I can certainly live with it. Over all, I’m very pleased with the fast delivery of the cane, and I’m happy enough with the product.  The quibbles above are why I’m rating it 4 stars, not 5.</li>
    <li> Awesome cane! Well packaged and delivered before expected. Strong and well constructed. Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> It was a birthday gift.  It served its purpose and he was pleased.</li>
    <li> Very stylish and comfortable to use (the grip is just right) with a nice feel and heft to it; For its&#x27; cost, it would be hard to match.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Awesome! I am SO HAPPY!! Thank you! I got this cane for my 79 year old DAD who was very reluctant about getting a cane but I talked him into trying one. So I ordered it on Amazon &amp; when he got it he told me that he LOVES it &amp; that it makes him feel confident! (Whew! was I ever relieved - I prayed asking God to help make this cane work for my dad and my prayers were answered!). I laughed saying, Now Dad, don&#x27;t get too confident thinking you can run a marathon! hahaha! This cane is the best ever - comfortable, light &amp; sturdy, Dad even read the directions!</li>
    <li> The Fritz walking cane surpasses what I envisioned when I ordered it. Most times you place an on-line order advertizing supercedes reality.</li>
    <li> It was for my brother and he is happy with it</li>
    <li> The info said the cane was 36 to 37 inches.&lt;br /&gt;It was neither, it was 35 inches maybe slightly less.&lt;br /&gt;A hassle to return and if I pay shipping, a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I will make the best use of it I can while recovering from surgery.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a cane when you can check it out IN PERSON.</li>
    <li> Very light fits nice into your hand. Finish is good. It comes too long so you have to shorten it. There were no instructions on how to do this included. I went online to find out. 3 stars for no instructions.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Solid enough without being too heavy. I highly recommend it as a well-designed simple functional item.</li>
    <li> I have a knee problem and I found this cane much more comfortable than the aluminum hospital physical rehab cane with the shepherd (curved) handle. It is a long straight handle which gives more leveraged support for your hand over the range of motion. It is also an attractive understated class act cane that is not gaudy, with a very reasonable price. The only complaint is that the vendor does not cut it to desired length but it can be accomplished by a visit to your lumber store with the desired length one wants it cut to.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, who weighs 220 lbs, and it&#x27;s good and sturdy for him.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I EXPECTED IT TO BE DARKER IN COLOR BUT MY SPOUSE SAYS IT IS OK</li>
    <li> Excellently built cane, nice design and looks great</li>
    <li> The cane is light but very stable.</li>
    <li> cane are too short May 12th 2015. I just measured the canes and overall length is 35 inches from top of cane handle to bottom of vane with rubber foot in place. They advertise the cane at 37 1/2 inches. So I will request for a return</li>
    <li> I had a torn miniscus and needed surgery to repair it. I wanted a cane to support my leg for a few days after surgery. The canes they had in the pharmacies were the aluminum ones which did not appeal to me aesthetically. I got this cane and was very happy with it. It was well built and aesthetically pleasing. It was able to support my 6&#x27;2 frame and all 215 lbs of me. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This Kane not only looks elegant, but it is very sterdy. It&#x27;s a good choice for folks who need a Kane.</li>
    <li> Cane worked fine but the finish is not durable. Within a hour after I start using it  a scratch was noticed on the shaft and within three days of use the handle already showed ware.</li>
    <li> The Fritz walking cane met my needs in every way. Right size out of the box. Makes my walks much easier and comfortable.</li>

Ramirez&lt;br /&gt;Inventor of HotSmart Plates&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001VE1YM2 HotSmart Hot Gourmet Plates - InstaHot 30 minute Plus]]</li>
    <li> comfortable and good looking</li>
    <li> The Fritz Walking cane that I ordered was of the highest quality, and even better than I had expected.  Thanks to those who produce such a fine product.  Stanley Sargeant</li>
    <li> Have purchased two of these, first one was broken when my husband threw it at a squirrel an hit the fence instead so ordered him another&lt;br /&gt;one he is being more careful now about throwing it and it is still fine</li>
    <li> I ordered this cane to use while I am recovering from a broken leg.  I purchased this cane because the price was right,  the cane looked attractive and it had the handle I was looking for.  Well, once the cane arrived, it was nothing like the picture.  The wood has knots with putty in them, deep scratches where a sanding machine went over it, a light brown stain showing the light and dark wood grain and accenting the variations in the wood, and a poorly applied top coat finish.  I was expecting the brown, even colored finish in the picture.  The handle on the cane looks like grandpa whittled it.  Nothing like the picture.  The brass collar between the handle and shaft was tarnished.  It looks as though it sat in a warehouse for quite some time.  The length of the cane was good for my 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; height.  The one bright spot...the tip on the bottom of the cane seems to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> Really good looking cane a but little to thin. Scared to put all my weight on it. I weigh 188 lbs and will be looking for something stronger. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have a bad ankle and need a cane on a daily basis. I can&#x27;t stand the adjustable metal canes than clack when you walk with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the nicer finished canes I have seen. It is sturdy and nicely sanded smooth. It is plain looking with an even but boring stain. But it still looks nice, just plain. One nice touch is the brass ring near the handle is a thicker, one piece of solid metal. Not a thin sheet metal piece wrapped around the cane and held by a nail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay attention to the weight restrictions. I am a big guy and probably at the limit for this cane. A 250 lb cane supports a 250lb man in normal use, not 250 lbs of weight on the cane.</li>
    <li> Still using it although people say thatey can get me a better one.  Lightweight.  Nice wood finish.  It&#x27;s wearing a bit but I&#x27;ve had it for a ear now.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> We got this cane to replace my dad&#x27;s metal cane and he absolutely loves it.  It is very stylish and exactly the perfect size.  It is contemporary and classy and the wood is very nicely stained.</li>
    <li> It is not as pictured, still it is not an ugly cane.  It is the materials tend to appear more \\&quot;woodish\\&quot; like in the picture, but they are not.  It is plastic (not a cheap one), nevertless my grandma loves it! mainly because it is a light but strong and easy to manipulate.  That&#x27;s what really matters.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy cane and provides the balance I need. Not fancy but does the job.</li>
    <li> Ive had this cane about a week and use it ever day.The cane is very stable and a very good support.The cane is finished nicely and looks better in person than on line.I highly recomend this cane if you need support.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased when i opened the box and saw how beautiful this cane is. It is a beautiful color and the finish smooth and sleek. I have been looking for a nice wooden cane, and this is it. The handle is shaped so it is very comfortable to hold and your hands dont get tired or sore when using for long periods of time. I like the fact that it comes in a longer length, because it leaves plenty of room for my Dr to properly measure it for my height and then I take it to the hardware store and the do a perfect cut, put the rubber tip back on and I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;I will definately use this seller again.</li>
    <li> If one must use a cane, the Fritz Walking Cane is about the best one can do. It&#x27;s an attractive and sturdy item.</li>
    <li> This is a simple and sturdy cane for those who have to use one.  I shortened mine a bit and am pleased as I can be with the adjustment.  The rubber tip slipped right back on.</li>
    <li> It was delivered in a timely few days. I paid extra for fast shipping. It was very well packaged. A beautiful cane. It had a flat Matt medium tan finish (no shine). I put a coat of wax on it for protection and some shine. It looks good. It has a formal look to it. I use it to hop around my over 55 Trouse (Trailer/House) Del Tura complex billiard room. I wish that I didn&#x27;t need it. Possible back surgery might be next?. I&#x27;m only 71!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to give any item a low rating unless I hate it or believe I have been swindled. Neither is the case with this walking cane. In my particular situation: an athlete who ran marathons and rode century (100 mile) bike rides, I was trying to accept the unacceptable: I had to have my hip replaced and revised for the third time. Now a cane was a necessity. Probably no product could have given me the magic I was looking for. So I hesitate to give any item a bad ratng here, based on my own experience of hoping to become Superwoman once more</li>
    <li> what can you say about a cane?</li>
    <li> I actually ordered it for my husband. He loves it!  It is lightweight, and gives him great support. He has much more confidence in his ability to stay upright now.</li>
    <li> Good quality cane but their logistics are lousy to say the least</li>
    <li> The cane is beautiful and just as described in the ad.  My husband has used it many times and enjoys it each time.</li>
    <li> Cane was delivered a day early and it is sturdy. But it is lighter in color then I expected. I would have preferred it to be darker.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and has met my expectations. Good looking cane if there is such a thing. Hope I don&#x27;t need it for long!</li>
    <li> This was for dad, he likes it. Looks nice, handle is good for grip and stability. I recommend it for anyone looking for a quality cane.</li>
    <li> Had i knew it was not made in USA i would not have brought it. Limited quality.</li>
    <li> Sturdy can with comfortable, easy to grip handle.</li>
    <li> It was nice but an inch or two too short.</li>
    <li> I only used it once since my problem has cleared up. Only complaint it was pain to cut to size of use.</li>
    <li> Handsome cane with nice, ergonomic handle</li>
    <li> The person this was for was satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Color quality and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not open up into a sword.</li>
