<li> If you have dry skin, this is a must.</li>
<li> I am normally a user of almost oil, but lately have been reading about the wonders of apricot oil.</li>
<li> but I am confident there was something wrong. :-/</li>
<li> Simply add a few drops to your finger tips and massage on your eyes.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s light enough to use on my face and not clog my pores, but still moisturizes like crazy!</li>
<li> like that it doesn&#x27;t stain my bed linen comparing to some other massage oil on the market.</li>
<li> I am on my second bottle of this Beauty Aura 100% Pure Apricot Kernel Oil Cold Pressed.</li>
<li> It does not leave a greasy mess.  </li>
<li> Dampen a cotton round and rub off even the hardest to remove eye makeup.</li>
<li> My only issue is that my lid was broken upon arrival and about 1/3 of the bottle had spilled in the box.</li>
<li> Feels heavy on the skin.</li>
<li> I also use this to mix a few drops of Thieves oil for immune system boost.</li>
<li> Since it was my 1st time ordering this product I don&#x27;t know what it usually smells</li>
<li> but I hate FRESH oil.&lt;br</li>
<li> I add a small amount of oil to my body lotion, I use on my face under my moisturizer and as a night rejuvenator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Product itself did not good quality.</li>
<li> Broken, no use for it</li>
<li> I use this after every shower since the winters are so cold here in Minnesota.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have any artificial fragrances</li>
<li> It was probably just bad luck, but the bottle I received looked like it might have been sitting in the warehouse for a while and might have been exposed to heat (the barcode label was all faded).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it but next time will buy an organic product. It doesn&#x27;t seem to keep me that moisturized...</li>
    <li> It mixes easily. The bottle is easy to work with. The oil leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> My sister asked for this for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Bought to use as carrier oil for my essential oils and to use for OCM.  I received my order quickly and it definitely met with my expectations.  High quality at a great price.  I recommend and plan to repurchase.</li>
    <li> oil is great as an addition to my homemade spa products. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Locely.  I use it to make face cream.</li>
    <li> I will order again. It works great for my face, skin and hair. It has NO scent and is very lightweight. I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I am normally a user of almost oil, but lately have been reading about the wonders of apricot oil. I have to share that this oil is simply amazing. It hydrated my skin very well without leaving the usual oily feeling that others oils tend to leave. I put some on after the shower and stood naked in the bathroom doing my make-up and hair. By the time I was done, I felt my skin and it felt silky smooth without that heavily oiled feeling. A must for dry or flaky skin, this natural product is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> no problems at all, just that it has no  apricot scent, its not organic</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Will buy again. Very moisturizing in my body product mixtures. I have even used it in my hair mixtures. I have had it well over 6 months and it is still going strong, but only have a little left. I wish it was sold in bigger quantity like 7 lbs. It is cold pressed, light and hexane free. It has no preservatives, just straight oil. I has no scent so you can scent it if you like with no problems. I have used essential oil and fragrance oil in my body and hair mixtures, there was no problems. This oil is very versatile. I would recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this oil. I use it daily mixed in with my hand lotion. I add drops of it to my moisturizer, as well. I&#x27;ve mixed up a wonderful blend of oils to use for my grandson&#x27;s eczema. It worked when nothing else did. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Broken, no use for it</li>
    <li> This is great oil and a very reasonable price. I am very happy with the product. My only issue is that my lid was broken upon arrival and about 1/3 of the bottle had spilled in the box.</li>
    <li> It was probably just bad luck, but the bottle I received looked like it might have been sitting in the warehouse for a while and might have been exposed to heat (the barcode label was all faded). As a result the oil was pungent and rancid. Since it was my 1st time ordering this product I don&#x27;t know what it usually smells like but I am confident there was something wrong. :-/</li>
    <li> Excellent product and a great value for all it does. I add a small amount of oil to my body lotion, I use on my face under my moisturizer and as a night rejuvenator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a must have for my daily regimen.</li>

It&#x27;s not greasy, absorb quickly into the skin and at an excellent price point of around $10 per bottle of 16 oz. I think it&#x27;s close to scent free so if you wanted to, you can add your own scent to it. I have a variety of essential oils on hand that if desired, I could add into this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t stain my bed linen comparing to some other massage oil on the market.</li>

    <li> A perfect base for essential oil recipes! I use this on a daily basis and LOVE it. It&#x27;s light enough to use on my face and not clog my pores, but still moisturizes like crazy!
