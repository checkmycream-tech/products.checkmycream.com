      <li>I think they work great, but they&#x27;re more like foam blocks than an actual sponge.</li>
      <li>They worked fine</li>
      <li>I gave it a 2 because it was cheap and there are 32, so I won&#x27;t need to wash them.</li>
      <li>I love love love using these sponges with my mixed media products and I love the price.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>flimsy &amp; cheap...</li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>These do a better job of actually applying the foundation not just kind of smearing it around this skin.</li>
      <li>You can see the makeup coming right off!</li>
      <li>, i guess it is really sellable, since i didn&#x27;t find it at any store, i go ahead and ordered it here. :)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t actually use them for makeup , I use them for ombre nails but they feel like really good quality</li>
      <li>If the company would double the size of the wedges, they would have a good product.</li>
      <li>been using this wedges for months now, and i love this product, non-latex and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my face, its soft, reusable and it doesn&#x27;t rip easily.</li>
      <li>While these came quickly, they are of a lower quality.</li>
      <li>They came quickly.</li>
      <li>Soft and very easy to use for blending.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and the price was right.</li>
      <li>It can be VERY costly to have a blender tool for each color and the replacement sponges aren&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
      <li>They worked okay for that, but the sponges absorbed more product that I expected them to</li>
      <li>Went to Rite Aid and bought 2 their own brand of face sponges for the same price as this bag -- the difference is uncanny.</li>
      <li>I use them for nail art gradients and firmer sponges work better that soft.</li>
      <li>do yourself a favor &amp; pay a little more for a better product.</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor and spend a few cents more on something more substantial.</li>
      <li>It was delivered super fast</li>
      <li>I am used to nice firm latex sponges -- these are like someone cut up a cheap sponge.</li>
      <li>I will use these when I travel for the sole purpose of being able to throw it right away.</li>
      <li>Amazing for foundation and loose powders.</li>
      <li>A little softer than I expected but very easy and pleasant to use.</li>
      <li>They were exactly what I thought they would be.</li>
      <li>Third, the shipping and handling is MORE than the item price.  </li>
      <li>They completely break apart when you try to clean them after ONE use.  </li>
      <li>The wedges are not as sturdy as I expected, but still soft and good for one use.</li>
      <li>For the price, don&#x27;t expect high quality, but it&#x27;s worth paying the $2 for it.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them for makeup.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>

      <li>They worked great for a little while but after applying my makeup the sponge started to break down.</li>
      <li>Most of the sponges were missing and the rest were all over the inside of the box.  </li>
      <li>Obviously this is not the right brand to buy.</li>
      <li>First, these are poor quality and are only good for one use.</li>
      <li>I am throwing them in the garbage and buying new ones</li>
      <li>These are very flimsy and small, and break apart easily.</li>
      <li>These sponges are more porous than the ones I usually get at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>The actual material these are made from is exactly what I want.</li>
      <li>I pull out the bag, ripped almost entirely by the bottom, and my first thought is: &amp;</li>
      <li>They might be good for art applications or perhaps eye shadow, but I found them extremely difficult for foundation and powder.</li>
      <li>they are also very small &amp; most of the make-up gets soaked up by the sponge.</li>
      <li>Probably a little over-priced given the quality, but how much can you really ask for from a spongy wedge?</li>
      <li>More expensive wedges seem to soak up too much of the foundation, wasting it.</li>
      <li>Wedges\\&quot; are very very small and the break apart easily when I apply my makeup.  </li>
      <li>I also gave one a sharp tug and it stayed together, until I really decided to test the power of my bicep</li>
      <li>These sponges are half the size as the typical makeup sponges, they are rough and don&#x27;t spread makeup well, and they tear very easily.  </li>
      <li>I first used a few to blend nail polish colors together and then put them on my nails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> been using this wedges for months now, and i love this product, non-latex and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my face, its soft, reusable and it doesn&#x27;t rip easily. I went to Ulta and tried to buy for another pack but they ran out, i guess it is really sellable, since i didn&#x27;t find it at any store, i go ahead and ordered it here. :)</li>
    <li> First, these are poor quality and are only good for one use. They completely break apart when you try to clean them after ONE use.  Second, they are TINY and don&#x27;t look like the photo. Third, the shipping and handling is MORE than the item price.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This is an inferior product and a total rip off.</li>
    <li> Works great for applying my foundation.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> They worked great for a little while but after applying my makeup the sponge started to break down. I would recommend this product only if your not using it to apply a lot of makeup.</li>
    <li> These actually work impressively well.</li>
    <li> i thought these would be firmer</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. I used to wash my make up sponges before and now I just throw them out after each use. For the price, don&#x27;t expect high quality, but it&#x27;s worth paying the $2 for it.</li>
    <li> Good wedges for the price! A little softer than I expected but very easy and pleasant to use. It was delivered super fast and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> The actual material these are made from is exactly what I want. They are so small, though, that they sort of crumple up, the makeup bleeds all the way through immediately, and I can&#x27;t get the makeup blended properly. To add insult to injury, the makeup still gets all over my fingers. If the company would double the size of the wedges, they would have a good product. As it is, they&#x27;re a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with my foundation. They work great, but suck up a lot of it as well.</li>
    <li> serve the purpose, but low quality and smaller than they look in the picture</li>
    <li> I think they work great, but they&#x27;re more like foam blocks than an actual sponge. They still work hard and get the job done though</li>
    <li> Too small and way too flimsy</li>
    <li> they charge shipping per item, even if you order it all together. not worth it at all, just go to a local drug store. product was very poor quality and smelled weird.</li>
    <li> I use these for art projects! Excellent quality...smooth finish for clean sponging...totally recommend! Superfast shipping ~ Secure packaging! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> These makeup wedge sponges suck. They crumble and fall apart just working on one area of my face. I will use these when I travel for the sole purpose of being able to throw it right away. Went to Rite Aid and bought 2 their own brand of face sponges for the same price as this bag -- the difference is uncanny.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re thinner than I thought. But they work great. I use them for applying liquid foundation, and it it the perfect material. Product came how it was supposed to, with 32 in the bag. And it came on time shipping. Yup. Happy with my purchase. 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> I am used to nice firm latex sponges -- these are like someone cut up a cheap sponge. Leaves streaks on my face, doesn&#x27;t blend well at all.</li>
    <li> Not the best sponges ever purchased. They worked fine but I use these for nail gradient finishes and they stamped like seasponges. Good for foundation. I recommend buying a finer sponge if you are looking to do nails. Check out Rite Aid. Otherwise product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> While these came quickly, they are of a lower quality. Some of them are still attached to one another. I purchased them as a way to &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; powder on my face. A tutorial suggested using these sponges to place powder in specific areas I wished to highlight. The quality of these make it impossible for precision work, because they are very flimsy and thing. I essentially have to take a corner, use my finger, and hold it tightly in order to get it to do what I want. I&#x27;m also guessing that after a few uses, I will need to toss it, since these definitely will not hold up to being washed like some make up sponges. I gave it a 2 because it was cheap and there are 32, so I won&#x27;t need to wash them. If you want something of more substance, purchase elsewhere. If you&#x27;re okay with this description, then buy them! They came quickly.</li>
    <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s what these sponges are meant to do, but I was looking for something a little more durable. The sponges are very small and very thin. I feel like I have makeup on my hands after every time I use them. If you use them more than 2 or 3 times, they will start ripping and coming apart. You do get several sponges for the price, so that is why I gave 3 stars. And if you only want these sponges for one-time use, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;d work well.</li>
    <li> They are VERY PRACTICAL WHEN APPLYING THE BASE DROP EVERYTHING VERY SLICK</li>
    <li> A little too soft.  I use them for nail art gradients and firmer sponges work better that soft.</li>
    <li> More expensive wedges seem to soak up too much of the foundation, wasting it. These do a better job of actually applying the foundation not just kind of smearing it around this skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are very flimsy and small, and break apart easily.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.  Tear apart easily.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something similar to the sponges that I buy from Target (Up&amp;Up brand), but these were extremely flimsy and small.  They might be good for art applications or perhaps eye shadow, but I found them extremely difficult for foundation and powder.</li>
    <li> These wedges are ridiculously small.  Quality - good.  Size - not good.</li>
    <li> These sponges are more porous than the ones I usually get at the drugstore. More makeup goes into the sponge than on my face. It&#x27;s hard to apply foundation without streaks using these.</li>
    <li> These are not good sponges..they are too small and too rough and I see streaks on my face when I apply my foundation/concealer, etc. I really do not recommend these at all - buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I used these to do gradients for my nail polish. it worked great and I got a TON of them! They were exactly what I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> The sponge breaks a part when u use it. It sucks all the make up in instead of helping to apply it plus it feels very rough on your skin.</li>
    <li> These work much better than cotton. They arrived quickly and the price was right. I highly recommend them for makeup.</li>
    <li> So I just got this in the mail today. I pull out the bag, ripped almost entirely by the bottom, and my first thought is: &amp;#34;Really?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the cheesy writing in the back: &amp;#34;is a high quality make-up sponge..&amp;#34; and I roll my eyes. Until I opened the bag and grabbed hold of one of these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW LUSCIOUS! WOW! They are so soft and delicious to squeeze! I also gave one a sharp tug and it stayed together, until I really decided to test the power of my bicep and it ripped in two, of course. No worries, there are 31 more to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the suspicious packaging (a piece of tape holding the top, the bottom almost fully ripped open), the contents are wonderful!</li>
    <li> These are very flimsy and small compared to cosmetic wedges that I&#x27;ve had previously. Obviously this is not the right brand to buy.</li>
    <li> Horrible sponges super flimsy. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these. I am throwing them in the garbage and buying new ones</li>
    <li> Love that they are biodegradable.</li>
    <li> Rough sponges, do not soak up makeup well for application. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> these wedges are too small to do anything with and the material crumbles as I put my liquid foundation on. Perhaps it has better uses, but a &amp;#34;wonder wedge&amp;#34; for liquid make-up it is not...</li>
    <li> These wedges spread my liquid foundation great, and I am able to reuse them several times because they&#x27;re easy to wash! To wash them, I wet them, squirt some liquid soap on it, and vigorously scrub it between my hands for a couple seconds. You can see the makeup coming right off! Easy! I&#x27;m very satisfied with these wedges.</li>
    <li> Probably a little over-priced given the quality, but how much can you really ask for from a spongy wedge? This item would probably be cheaper at the drug store.</li>
    <li> The wedges are not as sturdy as I expected, but still soft and good for one use.</li>
    <li> Small for my fingers, small for coverage area, a little flimsy. Wish I would&#x27;ve gotten a blending sponge instead.  Boo.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for somebody that I knew, and they told me that they worked well. They still use these. There is still some left.</li>
    <li> Soft and very easy to use for blending. purchased some in the past that were a bit rough.  I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> These are small and VERY flimsy. Do yourself a favor and spend a few cents more on something more substantial.</li>
    <li> No complaints, cheaper than drugstore</li>
    <li> Amazing for foundation and loose powders.</li>
    <li> These are inexpensive, disposable and work great for applying liquid foundation.  I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> This product is the 99 cent store quality. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use to apply foundation instead of a brush. They worked okay for that, but the sponges absorbed more product that I expected them to so I stopped using them. I do think that they are good quality and I would buy them again to use for a different purpose.</li>
    <li> I love love love using these sponges with my mixed media products and I love the price. Now I can use one and throw it away with feeling regret. I can&#x27;t believe I use anything else. I also use this product in place of my blender tool. If you have one you know what I am talking about. It can be VERY costly to have a blender tool for each color and the replacement sponges aren&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t actually use them for makeup , I use them for ombre nails but they feel like really good quality and I would use them for makeup if I wore it.</li>
    <li> my daughter used them for doing my nails and she said they works perfectly! so i recommend for that!</li>
    <li> This is not at all what i expected.  I thought makeup sponges were universal in size and quality.  These sponges are half the size as the typical makeup sponges, they are rough and don&#x27;t spread makeup well, and they tear very easily.  Worst of all the package was opened and half of them were gone.  I threw the rest in the trash after trying to use them for two days.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Wonder Wedge Cosmetic Wedges\\&quot; are very very small and the break apart easily when I apply my makeup.  I returned them.  DO NOT BUY!!!  Cheap</li>
    <li> flimsy &amp; cheap... but you get what you pay for. they are also very small &amp; most of the make-up gets soaked up by the sponge. definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy again -- do yourself a favor &amp; pay a little more for a better product.</li>
    <li> AWFUL!!  Would never buy again.  Soaks up my make up.  Cheaply made.</li>
    <li> great price.&lt;br /&gt;Came open but everything was there.  Didn&#x27;t look like it was tampered with.</li>
    <li> I love these wedges. I use them every day!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. They work just like I need for them to work. Got them in a very short amount of time - great shipper!</li>
    <li> This was ordered with several other items, but when I saw this bag of cosmetic sponges I was shocked.  Both ends of the package were opened although one end was rolled up and taped closed.  The plastic bag they were in was all stretched and torn from being pulled open. Most of the sponges were missing and the rest were all over the inside of the box.  There is noooo way the packer couldn&#x27;t see the package was not something that should be used in order fulfilment!!!  Somebody was in a hurry to get to their cigarette break!!  Lost my money on that one!</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they would help put on my make up easier. I was wrong. They are small and it absorbs too much make up.</li>
    <li> These are great for make up and nail polish! I first used a few to blend nail polish colors together and then put them on my nails. I am now using the wedges for my foundation make up for my face. Works great!</li>
