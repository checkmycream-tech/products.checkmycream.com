      <li>I am impressed with this product and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because of the weight of the dryer.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to pick it up yet</li>
      <li>All in all I am satisfied with my purchase and blame that on a design flaw.</li>
      <li>and leaves it smooth!</li>
      <li>Awesome for the price, the heat can become pretty hot to the touch of the blowdryer.</li>
      <li>It could not be any more pleasurable to use.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been straighter and even better after a relaxer.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for many years and like the product.  </li>
      <li>Very sleek, beautiful coloring and easy to handle with Turbo feature.</li>
      <li>Even so I still think its a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>When I first purchased this product in March of 2009 I loved it.  </li>
      <li>Dries quickly and straightens hair nicely.</li>
      <li>Produces a lot of heat and great for straightening natural hair!</li>
      <li>This was a surprise(turbo) which I&#x27;m enjoying, coupled with the smooth and strong drying.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle and a pleasure to use.</li>
      <li>I like the older model, but this newer version is just as good.</li>
      <li>strongly suggest that you buy the replacement combs now:</li>
      <li>I was really depending on this to be a great product since all my other Andis products work great.</li>
      <li>I have been looking all over for a convenient hair dryer with a comfortable fit.  </li>
      <li>I was wondering if this was a manufacturing defect and if anyone else experienced the same issue.</li>
      <li>The concept of the side usage is fantastic and that is what I am searching for.  </li>
      <li>The results are straight, smooth light hair with a nice glow.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>I immediately tried it out and so far so good</li>
      <li>AND IT&#x27;S VERY POWERFUL</li>
      <li>The first one made a popping sound and quit so hopefully this one will do better.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the detangler and smoothing combs - perfect for straightening my thick coarse curly hair easily!</li>
      <li>But I was impressed with this dryer because it dried my hair in about 20 minutes!</li>
      <li>The dryer still would turn on and not wanting to let go of such a good dryer, I gave it some time before trying again.</li>
      <li>and I do like to spin around alot just to make sure my hair comes out straight</li>
      <li>I give it 4 stars because the teeth broke on one if the comb and I have to buy the replacement comp, luckily they have them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made a popping sound twice, like it&#x27;s shorted out, but it still works and is still quite hot.</li>
      <li>I LIKE IT VERY MUCH!</li>
      <li>Gets hot and straightens well!</li>
      <li>I bought it in December, it was awesome at first, but after nine months, not sure what happend, the comb attachment broke first</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t think I will use the higher setting unless I am in a rush!</li>
      <li>I upgraded from a Gold N Hot 1200 for this one as was so excited to try it.</li>
      <li>The response was quick and I was given an address to send my blow dryer back to at my own expense.  </li>
      <li>I just love the soft brush that you can run through your hair while drying.  </li>
      <li>So I changed it to the bigger comb, which I liked.</li>
      <li>Worth Every penny.</li>
      <li>Better than the old style too because it doesn&#x27;t blow your hair all over.</li>
      <li>When he mentioned it, I immediately went to Amazon, found just the right hair dryer</li>
      <li>It has just the right heat and accessories for both of us.  </li>
      <li>I prefer Styler Dryers over all others because they make it possible to get nice straight results</li>
      <li>I had to press very gently when drying my hair so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly...</li>
      <li>The genuine boars bristle brush is too soft and will not turn or lift my hair.</li>
      <li>And it got really hot for styler/dryer.  </li>
      <li>Like salon hot.</li>
      <li>but I hope it lasts longer than the first one.</li>
      <li>TO CHECKING OUT MORE OF ANDIS PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE!!</li>
      <li>(can&#x27;t remember the exact date, but so I could track it</li>
      <li>I bought this item and within the first couple times I used it, it made a crackling noise and then shut off.  </li>
      <li>The first popped, sparked and flashed out of the box.  </li>
      <li>This was my first hair dryer, and while I didn&#x27;t feel intimidated by it (unlike the \\&quot;gun-style\\&quot; dryers), I could never find any attachments for it in the stores.  </li>
      <li>It blew my hair extremely straight!</li>

    <li> Awesome for the price, the heat can become pretty hot to the touch of the blowdryer. My hair has never been straighter and even better after a relaxer.</li>
    <li> BEST BLOWDRYER for NATURAL GIRLS. I Never use anything else</li>
    <li> Love this dryer!! Dries quickly and straightens hair nicely.</li>
    <li> The genuine boars bristle brush is too soft and will not turn or lift my hair. The bristles just squish out and do not stay stiff enough to work hair. I think the boars bristles would be even worse with thick hair. They need a stiff nylon brush option.  They also need a medium speed for drying. You get slow low and fast high and if you can hold your finger on the quick heat button then maybe you can get to medium heat and blowing speed from the low setting but you can&#x27;t hold the button for long. There should be some sort of trigger with the quick heat button built in or a way to lock it down. I don&#x27;t use the other two attachments. I&#x27;d swap them for two different brushes or one good stiff brush attachment.</li>
    <li> Really good blow dryer my first 1 finally just burnt out after 4 years, and I refuse to use a different blow dryer besides this 1... So I&#x27;m onto my second 1 but hey after 4 years its about that time!</li>
    <li> This is one great dryer! I am African-American with natural (not relaxed) hair.  This styler/dryer dried my hair faster than any gun-dryer ever has! And it got really hot for styler/dryer.  I was very pleased with the detangler and smoothing combs - perfect for straightening my thick coarse curly hair easily! I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal, it heats up quick. The shape it blows is perfect! Who dries in a circle? Not I, Easy to handle and can be stroked like a brush! Best part: intake screen is an ease to clean! Worth Every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought it in December, it was awesome at first, but after nine months, not sure what happend, the comb attachment broke first and then there was a loud pop noise, I tried to turn it off but the button was stuck so I unplugged it, thought maybe it over heated, waited an hour and tried it again, it was done, couldn&#x27;t move the button and wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
    <li> I have owned many style hair dryers in my time and this is definitely the best. I am a 63 year old man with short hair and like the brush style of a hair dryer. All the other dryers I have owned had a brush attachment that was uncomfortable to use because they had stiff nylon bristles. I had to press very gently when drying my hair so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt. This hair dryer has a 100% boar bristle attachment and it is terrific. It is actually a pleasure to brush across my head. It is so soft but firm. It could not be any more pleasurable to use. It also has a good switch design. You move the switch up to go from low speed to high speed. You move it down to go to low speed with no heat. It has a turbo button, but I doubt I will need it. I do not think it is too loud or to heavy. It has the feel of a well made device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of Luck,&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
    <li> No dryer that I have ever owned got my hair as shiny, bouncy, and straight as this dryer. I thought I had found a winner. However, the second time I used it, it made a popping sound and sparked inside the dryer part itself. The dryer still would turn on and not wanting to let go of such a good dryer, I gave it some time before trying again. It worked for awhile but then popped again and sparked. This time I had to give it up. I am too hurt.  This dryer worked wonders on my hair but is a safety issue. Anyone know of any dryers with as good results as this one but better electrical makeup?</li>
    <li> I guess I got a bad one too because I just purchased this 2 days ago and its make loud popping noises when on the high setting. It didn&#x27;t throw any sparks but it turned it self off. I too was able to finish my hair, but after reading the previous reviews about this joker throwing sparks, Im getting ready to return it and get my money back. Do not purchase, dangerous and unsafe appliance that needs to be pulled off the market.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a Gold N Hot 1200 for this one as was so excited to try it. Unfortunately, like the rest of the 1 star reviews, the dryer frequently overheats and then POP! it stops working.</li>
    <li> This dryer DOES NOT have 3 heat setting. It only has hot, with 2 air flow settings. Set on HIGH, it may burn your hair, hands, and/or scalp. It&#x27;s probably good for thick, coarse hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for thin or fine hair. The cool button is useless since it only has one speed (low). Go for the Revlon amber waves instead.</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over for a convenient hair dryer with a comfortable fit.  This dryer is the greatest and stylish.  It drys my hair quick and perfectly.  It is great for blowing out my hair too!  It&#x27;s unfortunate that some of the other reviewers have had issues with theirs, but mine works great and has been for over a year now.  I will say I had to order several of the attachments because mine kept breaking, but the actual hair dryer itself is very sturdy and dependable and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I got this hair dryer as a gift for my daughter, especially since she would leave her home to borrow mine, which has a similar style.  She loves the results and tells me she thanks me every time someone compliments her on her hair.  My daughter and I both like the ability to hold the hair dryer as a comb or brush for drying and styling.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this product in March of 2009 I loved it.  Less than 90 days later the item made a popping sound and now only works on the high setting.   There are several similar comments about this product only working for a short period of time, or the product starting to spark.  Buyer beware.   This item is probably not safe.</li>
    <li> I amd black and I have natural hair and I can tell you that this blowdryer will be perfect for anyone!</li>
    <li> Love it! Produces a lot of heat and great for straightening natural hair! The lower temperature worked great on my 4c hair so I don&#x27;t think I will use the higher setting unless I am in a rush! I wish you had the option to not get the brush attachments as they are not good for ethnic hair but overall a great deal! Fits well in the hand to prevent fatigue in drying!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once on my type 4A hair. At the time I was 4 months post relaxer and because of my extremely thick hair the dryer did not give me the look I anticipated though it was good enough. Even so I still think its a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> gives me the perfect curve in for my shoulder length bob. I will recommend this to anyone - just because it takes such a short time to blow dry hair</li>
    <li> I just recieved this blowdryer today. I immediately tried it out and so far so good I am very pleased with this item. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s lacking a swirvel cord and I do like to spin around alot just to make sure my hair comes out straight but other then that this product is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these dryers.  The first popped, sparked and flashed out of the box.  The second developed the same problem within a week.  Frankly, they are dangerous.  Steer clear.</li>
    <li> i purchased this thinking it would have been a great investment, but it wasn&#x27;t!! First off it took way to long to receive it in the mail! Second, it started to make a weird weird pop noise when I would turn it on after the second use. Then it started to make a rattle noise. And finally it just stop working!! I was really depending on this to be a great product since all my other Andis products work great. However, this was not. I&#x27;m a stylist that depends on my tools to work properly. I do not recommend purchasing this!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Much quieter than I expected.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to blow as hard as the old style but it dries faster.  Better than the old style too because it doesn&#x27;t blow your hair all over.</li>
    <li> the first time I used it, I cut it on high and the motor popped.</li>
    <li> Great buy, I love it.  I looked at several stores after my dryer of 10 years expired.  I am so grateful to have purchased the Andis 80345 Styler Hair Dryer .... I love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing...doesn&#x27;t look at all fancy but does the job superbly!  I have thick 4a hair and when I use this dryer, it&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m using a flat iron. The results are straight, smooth light hair with a nice glow. I will def recommend. I give it 4 stars because the teeth broke on one if the comb and I have to buy the replacement comp, luckily they have them.</li>
    <li> As a kid, my mom went through attachments like a kid went through candy, especially when it was my hair.  This was my first hair dryer, and while I didn&#x27;t feel intimidated by it (unlike the \\&quot;gun-style\\&quot; dryers), I could never find any attachments for it in the stores.  It was no big deal when I broke my first one, because I didn&#x27;t use it all that much, but when I broke the fine-toothed one, it lost half its use for me.  I couldn&#x27;t even find any on the Andis site.  I submitted an inquiry and am hoping for a response, but the only reason this isn&#x27;t a five star is the lack of attachments.</li>
    <li> WHY IS THIS ITEM GETTING SUCH BAD REVIEWS ?!?!? I HAVE THIS BLOW DRYER IT&#x27;S THE ONLY BLOW DRYER THAT REALLY WORKS ON MY HAIR &amp; DOESN&#x27;T BREAK OR BLOW OUT WHILE DEALING WITH MY THICK HAIR. I ONLY WISH THE COMB WAS MORE STRONGER &amp; IT CAME IN PINK :)  OTHER THAN THAT NO COMPLAINTS !!!</li>
    <li> The switch on the dryer failed within a week.  I had to take it in for warranty service and it took almost two weeks to get another one.  I haven&#x27;t been able to pick it up yet but I hope it lasts longer than the first one.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer enough to buy a second one. The first one made a popping sound and quit so hopefully this one will do better.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer on 5-17-12 and it stopped working on 5-30-12. Only used it twice. It overheats way to quick when using the high setting. The dryer started smoking and then starks start flying everywhere. Not to mention it blew out my bathroom plug. I definitely don&#x27;t plan on buying this brand again, definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> Extremely loud.  The concept of the side usage is fantastic and that is what I am searching for.  This product is just too loud.</li>
    <li> Best Dryer for Men&#x27;s Barbershop</li>
    <li> Bought this product April 13.  It stopped working June 13.  At the High setting, the dryer makes a horrible noise.  After about 6 weeks of use, the dryer began to overheat and cut off when at the high setting.  Finally, it overheated and would not turn back on for two days.  If the manufacturer does not want me to use the high setting, why put it on the hair dryer?  For years, the only type of hair dryer that leaves my hair frizz free is this type of brush dryer.  This type has become very hard to find.  I never tried this brand before.  I will not waste my money on it again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t have the same experience as the prior reviewer(s).  About 5 minutes after use, a loud popping noise came from near the outlet and the dryer shut off.  I was too apprehensive to make another attempt w/ this product, so instead I returned it.</li>
    <li> Works great and fast too! Design is easy to handle and manages my medium length hair without tangling, hair damp to dry in less than 20 mins. Great value.</li>
    <li> I only got to use it 1.5 times when I was in the middle of using it the second time when it sparked and burned out.... I would like a refund but don&#x27;t know how to go about it. I used to have one that lasted for 10 years befo re ti burned out</li>
    <li> After 4 uses the power switch started sparking and give the smell of burnt electrical component</li>
    <li> I went on the product name as I had, had an Andis dryer before.  Not this same one, but made by Andis which is still working, but I gave it to my daughter.  So I ordered this to replace the one I gave her.  First use it stopped.  I reset it a few times and it started up.  Next time it was fine.  Now just over my being able to return it (34 days) it stopped working.  Reset/test doesn&#x27;t work....just stopped.  Don&#x27;t waste  your money on this particular model.  It dried well, but there is something wrong with the heat settings and the electrical wiring within the unit that causes it to shut down and not just won&#x27;t work.  UPDATE: 6/24/15 -Since I could not return it to Amazon because it was just past the 30 days I contacted Andis directly on May 7th.  The response was quick and I was given an address to send my blow dryer back to at my own expense.  I shipped it (can&#x27;t remember the exact date, but so I could track it, it cost ~$9), but they received it May 26th.  I just received a replacement blow dryer today (had bought another one in the interim).  Different Model (82105) and I have already used it. So far so good.  This one isn&#x27;t as loud as the 80345 model and doesn&#x27;t seem to be running as hard as the other one.  Andis&#x27; Customer Service was very responsive so they get five stars for that.</li>
    <li> Drier works well, powerful, but it is loud and the biggest problem is the brush attachment...it is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t comb through my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it broke the second time I used it!  I do not use my blow dryer often, so when I finally used it again the second time, it made a very loud noise and then would not power on again</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it is a good reliable product but the power switch has started to stick.  I think that a shot of WD-40 would fix it, though.  I have been using it for many years and like the product.  I would buy another and recommend it highly to others.</li>
    <li> Works great. Will shut off if it gets too hot &amp; will not turn back until it has cooled enough. Decent hair dryer &amp; I found that it cut my drying time by at least half.  Happy I chose to buy.  UPDATE ** I purchased this dryer April 1, 2014 as of a week ago it started to spark and smoke and continues to shut off. Time for another one. I wish they lasted longer because I like how fast it dries I just don&#x27;t want to keep buying one yearly.</li>
    <li> My only objection is how large it is.  Why can&#x27;t they make a travel sized dryer with a brush attachment?</li>
    <li> Well, I bought this for a friend and I haven&#x27;t heard her complain about it so I guess it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> Having had three Vidal Sassoon driers similar in design to the Andis 80345, I   decided, based on reviews, to try the Andis. I am very happy with its performance &amp;  power. Having had three fires with the Vidal, I look forward to years of use with the Andis.</li>
    <li> cost more than in regular store....should have check around other place instead on one store before I bought this one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
    <li> The product comes as described, HOWEVER what&#x27;s missing in the description is how heavy, encumbered and loud it is.  Have I tried it in a store, I would not have bought it.  Still, it does the job.</li>
    <li> The brush is way too soft. It doesn&#x27;t make it through my hair, wet or dry. Had to send it back.</li>
    <li> Would have liked to have more speed choice</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and it came faster than expected!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome. Dries my hair in 10 min. and leaves it smooth! Other dryers I&#x27;ve tried either overheat before I&#x27;m done drying, or take at least double the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually had to order one for my mother after she tried mine.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the  attachments, which is what I bought it for.  the brush is flimsy.  the handle design makes styling difficult.</li>
    <li> Very good hair styler. I like that you can buy tools for it if you need them. It has just the right amount of power to easily dry hair</li>
    <li> This dryer has a lot of power. It blew my hair extremely straight! I like the older model, but this newer version is just as good. This product is lighter and easier to handle. My only issue is - the shipping was slow.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is truly a professional, salon type dryer. Many dryers are advertised as such, but this one lives up to that reputation. Very sleek, beautiful coloring and easy to handle with Turbo feature. This was a surprise(turbo) which I&#x27;m enjoying, coupled with the smooth and strong drying. The sound is even pleasant, not too loud, and it works quickly.(especially since I have very thick hair) &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this dryer as an excellent buy for the inexpensive price. &lt;br /&gt;AJ in NC</li>
    <li> Connectors always comes off. Overheats. Put on medium setting and it gets the job done. Not 100% what I wanted but it works.</li>
    <li> the hair dryer is good,but the brush bristles are too soft!</li>
    <li> I have waist length hair and I have always dreaded blow drying my hair because it would take me a complete hour! But I was impressed with this dryer because it dried my hair in about 20 minutes! I first started with the brush adapter, but I didn&#x27;t like it at all. The bristles are too soft. So I changed it to the bigger comb, which I liked. But while drying my hair it then made a crackling popping noise that scared the hell out of me. Then I changed it to the smaller comb, which I also liked, and again it made that horrible scary crackling popping noise! I&#x27;m assuming that a hair strand must of gotten inside the vent and that is what cause the popping noise. Also the reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5! All in all I am satisfied with my purchase and blame that on a design flaw. I will be careful using it the next time and hope it doesn&#x27;t do that again. Also I tried changing the dual voltage. But the button didn&#x27;t budge!</li>
    <li> This Andis hair dryer is toooooooo big. &lt;br /&gt;Very difficult to handle. &lt;br /&gt;Not recommended!</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this product and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because of the weight of the dryer.</li>
    <li> Two words: noisy and dangerous!&lt;br /&gt;It is not necessary to explain noisy...&lt;br /&gt;Dangerous because the inner part is definitely not well protected.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it takes too long to dry a hair that should had being completely dried in 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I send my back.</li>
    <li> Worked very well  a few problems due to sparks when changing from low to high but it works really well</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  Using the attached comb makes it very easy to dry my hair. Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this was a major disappointment. After reading some positive reviews, I was hoping this type of dryer would help dry my hair faster and sleeker. I followed the directions exactly...doing the test before use. Everything was fine at first until I changed the speed from low to high. As soon as I did there was a large spark, pop and the power went out in my bathroom. I live in a updated luxury apartment building (built in 2010). I read the box and looked at my outlet. It said my outlet was compatible with the voltage. I then decided to try it again but leave it only on the low setting this time around... there weren&#x27;t any issues but my barely shoulder length hair took an hour to dry...over an hour to dry completely. I was wondering if this was a manufacturing defect and if anyone else experienced the same issue.</li>
    <li> Only one I could fine that worked from the side</li>
    <li> I wanted a hair dryer shaped like this, not the &amp;#34;blow dryer&amp;#34; design.  The brush attachment is perfect, but it is nice to have the comb attachment also.</li>
    <li> Return is no longer needed</li>
    <li> I love the speed with which I can dry my thick, medium length hair and really like having a brush attachment.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the bristles of the brush are so soft that they flatten with the first use and are not at all effective in separating my hair while drying it.  If they would only make the bristles firmer, I would give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I prefer Styler Dryers over all others because they make it possible to get nice straight results single handed. But this is the hottest dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. Like salon hot. It&#x27;s made a popping sound twice, like it&#x27;s shorted out, but it still works and is still quite hot. Once my head started smoking, I got a bit worried and lowered the temp. But the low setting won&#x27;t get your hair dry. Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily, the heat shouldn&#x27;t be such a problem as far as damage... but it would be if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest that you buy the replacement combs now: [[ASIN:B0012QLSYS Andis Company 85010 Replacement Combs/ 80345]]&lt;br /&gt;A dryer this hot will make the tines break off sooner rather than later. Don&#x27;t view this as too much of a drawback. ALL styler dryers will suffer broken combs eventually.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. On my Second use, it burned out. I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
    <li> Didnt last long maybe a month. Made a weird noise. And knocked the electric out, guess i brought a bad one!!!</li>
    <li> The product has met my expectations. It has a variety of drying settings and and combs. Easy to handle and a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> I USUALLY BUY VERY KNOWN NAME PRODUCTS BECAUSE I&#x27;M CONCERN ABOUT WASTING MY MONEY ON NOT SO UNKNOWN BAD PRODUCTS! HOWEVER I READ ABOUT THIS ITEM AND DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY! I LIKE IT VERY MUCH! IT&#x27;S VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMPACT COMPARE TO A REGULAR BLOWER AND IT&#x27;S VERY POWERFUL FOR IT&#x27;S SIZE!! THEREFORE I&#x27;LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO CHECKING OUT MORE OF ANDIS PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item and within the first couple times I used it, it made a crackling noise and then shut off.  After a few minutes it started again, I was able to finish my hair. That scared me, so I only used the High setting for short periods of time.  A couple weeks later, I was drying my hair, it made the crackling noise and started throwing sparks.  Not worth the money in my book.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using a hair dryer with broken teeth off the comb for what seems like forever.  When he mentioned it, I immediately went to Amazon, found just the right hair dryer and it works perfectly.  It has just the right heat and accessories for both of us.  I would suggest to others to buy this  one.</li>
    <li> Blow dryer over heats and stops working in less than 3 minutes using the HIGH option. My sister had this same blow dryer in her amazon cart and I told her to delete it immediately. If you are thinking about buying forget it.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Gets hot and straightens well!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product before and received the wrong order. This time I got the product and it has a malfunction, when you use the low setting you get electrical sparks..too frustrated to do another return. Too bad because because I always liked Andis hair dryers.</li>
    <li> Great dryer!! I just love the soft brush that you can run through your hair while drying.  Might even buy another one!!!</li>
    <li> The brush is too soft, I had to use one off my old hairdryer, luckily it fit.</li>
