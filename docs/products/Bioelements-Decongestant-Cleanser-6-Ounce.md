      <li>Also came right when they said it would.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to cleanse all that well might be good for skin less pourous than mine</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, I&#x27;ve been buying this full line for over a year.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Some oil on your skin is essential for maintaining a healthy balance.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and works as it should.</li>
      <li>I love the entire Bioelements line!  </li>
      <li>I was pretty sure that my skin was always going to be the same no matter what I used</li>
      <li>I first wash my face with the mud soap on a loofah sponge, then follow it up with a sprits of this cleanser, then was them both off.</li>
      <li>Not my first time to buy this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been you using it for the last year and have been continuously pleased with the result.</li>
      <li>I would wake up with a blemish here and there during the first month</li>
      <li>I love it and it brought back memories</li>
      <li>Exactly what I use from my esthitician, but at a much better price than offered locally.  </li>

      <li>The skin feels clean but not dry.  </li>
      <li>Like that it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sadly, the last time I bought it, the order was filled through Amazon - they packed it.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s my whole face regimen.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores.</li>

      <li>(this has happened TOO MANY times to me with Amazon - with other products as well - they really need to get their act together when it comes to packing)&lt;br</li>
      <li>, then I follow up with the really rich moisturizer cream especially around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin and allergies combined with adult acne.  </li>
      <li>My skin was pretty clear before I started using this cleanser.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am liking it a lot. My skin is a bit oily with few brake outs... It leaves my skin clean without over dry</li>
    <li> wonderful. Not my first time to buy this</li>
    <li> Great face cleanser! Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years! It does a great job without completely drying out my skin. It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know this was for oily skin, as I have combination dry skin, but works just as well and doesn&#x27;t over-dry your skin or is too harsh for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with acne for 13 years.  I have very oily combination skin and let me tell you this cleanser does the job and then some.  I have been using it for about 1 month now and can already say it&#x27;s the best I ever used.  Leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed just like the bottle says.  It doesn&#x27;t feel irritated or dry like other cleansers.  Most importantly it helps prevents oil build up and breakouts.  Thank you bioelements for making products with integrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Bioelemts beyond hydration gel moisturizer afterwards and it moisturizes and soothes without the oily, sticky feeling afterwards.  Both products are a lethal combination for breakouts.  Wish I found this duo 13 years ago, that&#x27;s the only thing I regret.  This is an honest review and trust me you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply dessert essence blemish touch stick to active pimples in the night.  That&#x27;s my whole face regimen.  The cleanser has a subtle smell of lavender and the moisturizer smells like pine.</li>
    <li> Great cleansing product. Great shipping speed.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and was surprised that this actually stripped my face and completely dried it out. Maybe all the weird chemicals in this product were just too harsh for me. Resulted in parched skin that was very tight, and even more breakouts.</li>
    <li> Its fine, Bt make my skin dry! I use Jurlique Calendula Cream after this &amp; that is pretty thick. But it does work right away.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had few painful zits &amp; after I use it, it starts working as soon as I use it &amp; I can feel the pain reduced.</li>
    <li> Let me say this is my all time favorite cleasner!!!!🌷🌷🌷 I have combination skin and &amp;#34;HAD&amp;#34; large pores before this product. My skin feels like silk after using this❤️. NOW FOR SELLER..... SUPER DUPER SALES has the best customer service🌺🌺🌺. Jessica is soooo sweet and was on the ball helping me with a broken pump. So happy a company stands behind their sales in this fashion🌷😊🌷</li>
    <li> When I was in beauty school the skincare line was Bio elements and it was amazing. I haven&#x27;t found a skincare that was comparable and had to buy this again. I love it and it brought back memories</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all.  Made my skin much more oily and broke me out.  sorry. I can cannot recommend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for over 7 years and it&#x27;s the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>
    <li> My facialist turned me on to bioelements products. They are so good for sensitive and combination skin (dry and oily) I use this product in combination with the mens Mud Soap. I first wash my face with the mud soap on a loofah sponge, then follow it up with a sprits of this cleanser, then was them both off. The mud soap gets a lot of my makeup dirt and oil off and this cleanser further cleans the residue but also moisturizes, then I follow up with the really rich moisturizer cream especially around my eyes. Love them, these products have kept me young looking, At least by 10+, yay! years younger than I am</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to cleanse all that well might be good for skin less pourous than mine</li>
    <li> This cleanser is amazing. As long as I use this everyday my face doesnt break out. I use other Bioelements products as well but if I could only afford to buy one Product this is the one i would get</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and it&#x27;s the best non-drying cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. I actually feel my face produces less oil and less breakouts with this product. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Like that it&#x27;s gentle. Like that it has a nice smell. May try other products later.</li>
    <li> Work stress and awful weather was wreaking havoc on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per some recommendations I tried using Cera Ve in the morning and this at night. My face was cleared up in 2 days. I hadn&#x27;t gone 6 months without crazy breakouts and now my face looks better than it has in 15 years (I&#x27;m 28!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS! I am also using Bioelements Beyond Hydration for my moisturizer and am in love.</li>
    <li> It cleans my face.  I enjoy the smell.  I wish it would last forever.  But, when I  run out, I will need to order more.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, aging, acne-prone, combo skin, and this cleanser has been amazing! Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave any weird films on it, and it has really worked to help keep my skin clear. I use it with the Bioelements Beyond Hydration and Bioelements Probiotic Anti-Aging Serum.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It smells so good that a guy OR a girl can use.  It is VERY effective, especially with Bioelements Power Peptide, and Bioelements Beyond Hydration.  I live in the desert southwest and these are exceptional products.  Buy them.  you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use the clay, then this decongestant cleanser and my face feels fantastic.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ordered from this site but distributor was exquisite beauty.  something wrong with the product from them. I have been ordering this for over 5 yrs and generally it has a fresh clean scent.  This bottle smells very bad. I have to reorder the smell is intolerable but will not order from that company</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have issues with oily skin and random blemishes. It makes my skin feel very clean without over drying. Also the seller worked very hard when they found out the pump was jammed in the down position. Best employees ever!</li>
    <li> Very good cleanser.I have an oily skin. The skin feels clean but not dry.  In general, I like Bioelements&#x27; products.</li>
    <li> Great effective product!</li>
    <li> It dried my skin out, smells medicinal and is full of chemicals. It also did not help with acne at all. My 29 year old skin is prone to clogging and all the Bioelements products that I bought (about 7 of them) just broke me out and clogged my pores. Even thought I was using their moisturizer,  my skin would be dry after washing yet feel oily a few hours later.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t dry me out as badly as other cleansers, but still feel clean. about halfway through first bottle and still trying to figure out if it does anything remarkable.</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Great for your skin!</li>
    <li> Finally found a face cleanser that wasn&#x27;t harsh and did its job!!  I have super sensitive skin and allergies combined with adult acne.  I love this cleanser!</li>
    <li> Love this facewash. It&#x27;s a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> The only cleanser I have found that cleans a combination skin without leaving a tight feeling.  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> The cleanser was recommended by my salon.  I have used it for two years.  Very good quality and feel great after cleaning.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleanser for all skin types!</li>
    <li> I love the entire Bioelements line!  The cleanser is very gentle yet effective for oily skin.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel stripped of all oils after I use it.  Some oil on your skin is essential for maintaining a healthy balance.</li>
    <li> This face wash is worth the price.  Lasts forever, I bought it several months ago &amp; haven&#x27;t even gotten half way through the bottle.  I have extremely oily skin and live in hot, humid FL, so by the middle of a typical work day I have a super shiny T Zone.  This is the first time i&#x27;ve visibly noticed a difference in my skin &amp; is way less oil production.  I&#x27;ve used dermatologist Rx face washes, Proactive (which just over dried my skin) &amp; so forth.  Hands down best face wash yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note; I use it in conjunction with the Clarisonic Mia.  Had been using the Mia for several months prior to trying this product without any change in oil production until face wash.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and works as it should. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT face wash if you have breakouts. Definitely worth the cost. I used it when I was in my late 20s and getting hormonal breakouts on my chin and I started buying it again when my son became a teenager and started getting breakouts - it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the last time I bought it, the order was filled through Amazon - they packed it. They threw two boxes of this face wash into a box with almost no packing materials and the glass bottles were smashed in route - I received a soggy, sticky box on my steps and opened it to find soap EVERYWHERE and broken glass. (this has happened TOO MANY times to me with Amazon - with other products as well - they really need to get their act together when it comes to packing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad for the seller because they pay Amazon to distribute product for them - I&#x27;ll never buy from them again because I need them to arrive intact - Amazon is losing sales for them. Terrible!</li>
    <li> This product was great. I recommended that the seller work on packaging the product better.</li>
    <li> Deep cleans without stripping skin of moisture.  I&#x27;ve been you using it for the last year and have been continuously pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> My skin was pretty clear before I started using this cleanser. I gave it a try for a week but I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore after that. I have extremely oily skin but this cleanser was drying even in this 90 degree humid June NJ weather..then my skin would over produce oil like crazy to compensate. I don&#x27;t mind that so much as it irritated my skin a lot. I guess there&#x27;s an ingredient my skin doesn&#x27;t like. I&#x27;ve continuously broken out after using this, most of it around my mouth and chin. I haven&#x27;t used any other new products recently so I must attribute these strange breakouts to this product. The pimples are different, they feel very painful and swollen and normally I don&#x27;t experience that kind of acne. Also the first time I used this my eyes stung even though the cleanser was not applied near the eyes. This cleanser may be great for most people with oily skin but I would beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have awesome beautiful skin because of this product!  I highly recommend this product, I&#x27;ve been buying this full line for over a year.</li>
    <li> *****.. I really like this product, works great.</li>
    <li> love this but I do rotate my facial products- this is very cleansing but not a moisture based cleanser… best in summer.</li>
    <li> This works great with the sleepwear oil control and the quick refiner. Best products I used for my oily skin and I have tried Estee Lauder, Dior,Lancome and other high-end products.</li>
    <li> I have had problem skin since my teens, subject to frequent breakouts. Bioelements Decongestant Cleanser is an amazing product that helps keep my skin clear. In fact, I told my dermatologist that it works like magic. No other cleanser that I have tried (and I usually invest in some expensive ones) or even my prescription topical medicine is as effective at keeping my skin clear. I use it morning and night, and it doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin as long as I moisturize as well. Highly recommended for people with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for combination skin.</li>
    <li> This is excellent. It&#x27;s the one cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. It controls oil, breakouts, yet doesn&#x27;t leave it too dry.&lt;br /&gt;Made with natural ingredients, although I believe they use EDTA which is unfortunate.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. I&#x27;m older (late 50&#x27;s) and have very sensitive skin that still breaks out. This cleanser is gentle and effective, and not drying.</li>
    <li> I started using this cleanser 6 weeks ago after spending the past 13 years using Dermalogica.  I am so happy that I did.  I never switch up my skin care line b/c I was pretty sure that my skin was always going to be the same no matter what I used and I thought my Derm. products were right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a sample I was convinced that this cleanser was great for me.  Interestingly I have aging/dry skin, not particularly oily; I feared that this product might be too drying for me, but it is not.  It does an amazing job of purging all of the junk out of my pores promptly.  I would wake up with a blemish here and there during the first month but the zit would be an instant pustule that would pop and clear within a day.  I no longer have cystic acne or zits that take a week to purge and heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also dont slather on the moisturizer at night.  This cleanser does a great job without over-drying and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I use from my esthitician, but at a much better price than offered locally.  Also came right when they said it would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bioelements Decongestant Cleanser for about four years. It&#x27;s non-greasy and non-stripping yet removes makeup, dirt and oil cleanly. I love the fresh lavendar scent too. I have seen a marked improvement to the congestion I used to have,especially along the jaw line. Also, my aesthetician uses this product to cleanse during my facials. (She&#x27;s the one who originally recommended it to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
