      <li>I was thrilled that this was a two pack as I kept one brush here and gave one to my daughter.</li>
      <li>She liked the look of it and the feel.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so nice.</li>

      <li>They work great and are a much more eco friendly option than the plastic combs and brushes you see everywhere.</li>
      <li>It is a baby&#x27;s brush…but it will be good if your child has fine or thinner hair.  </li>
      <li>This one is very good (and quite a good value, in that there are two!), and we keep one at home, and the other in our bag.  </li>

      <li>They are a perfect size with soft bristles.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect size and soft.</li>
      <li>These hairbrushes are great, perfect small size for a baby.</li>
      <li>I love these for baby gifts.</li>
      <li>-I think it&#x27;s more wood smell, witch I like), and it s making the baby hair</li>
      <li>For that reason, I&#x27;d classify this as more of a prop than a useable product.  </li>
      <li>This is a great hairbrush that seems to be gently on my babies head.</li>
      <li>After using these brushes their hair looks so healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>That can&#x27;t be safe for use on a infant.</li>
      <li>My kids absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>It works wonderfully, and my Chihuahuas love being brushed with it</li>
      <li>like it s supposed to do it: nice and smooth:)</li>
      <li>Love that it comes in a 2 pack so that I can keep one in the diaper bag.</li>
      <li>This brush is perfect for engraving the back side.</li>
      <li>It is so much better than the drugstore plastic ones.</li>
      <li>Loved the brush when my baby was born and through her first year.</li>
      <li>Nice and soft, good quality, my baby loves it.</li>
      <li>Great soft brush for my baby.</li>
      <li>Very nice brushes for young children.  </li>
      <li>Way better than the cheap plastic brushes at getting out tangles and smoothing her fine and silky baby hair.</li>
      <li>Overall a really good product!</li>
      <li>The wood feels very smooth and the bristles, while soft, brush beautifully and gently.</li>
      <li>His little hairs can get frizzy and this tames them perfectly.</li>
      <li>but whenever he grows more I&#x27;ll be ready to brush it!!</li>
      <li>I think this is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why this is, they are supposedly manufactured in Germany and distributed by a company in WI, but they have this bizarre odor.</li>
      <li>one for later is great.</li>
      <li>Now there&#x27;s two cracks on the head of brush, so far still good for use.</li>
      <li>He has a bit of cradle cap and it is great for brushing after a bath to loosen some of the crust (gross, but true).</li>
      <li>Perfect little brushes for baby!</li>
      <li>It is a smell I am familiar with from traveling in India.  </li>
      <li>First off, I love that you get two hairbrushes for the price of one.</li>
      <li>This would be a perfect brush for a child with small hands.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why this brush is only sold as a two-pack, but it&#x27;s still a good deal and if something happens to one brush you have a backup.</li>
      <li>Good buy, especially for two; one will always disappear.</li>
      <li>They are soft and have a nice wood handle.  </li>
      <li>Soft bristles, nice quality.</li>
      <li>I looked all over and in natural health food stores as well and nothing is this nice.</li>
      <li>It works as well as the full size brushes on collar length hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27; s natural hair, doesn&#x27;t have any kind of smell</li>
      <li>As mentioned in the title it took a full week to make it to me...</li>
      <li>Till now, the baby is three months old, we never had any kind of problems.</li>
      <li>I use the adult size Ambassador brushes, so I knew the baby brushes would be nice.</li>
      <li>They came two in a pack so that was extra nice.</li>
      <li>With most brushes with natural bristles</li>
      <li>Adult pocket hairbrushes are more ergonomic (but perhaps stiffer).</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>so I was in need of hairbrush right away.</li>
      <li>of course he still has to figure out the right direction, but he enjoys having a brush his size that he is allowed to have all to himself.</li>
      <li>BUT when I took them out of the package dozens and dozens of bristles fell right out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is the perfect size and soft.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t  believe all these positive reviews. This brush is very course for baby&#x27;s head. Bristles are poor quality as well.&lt;br /&gt; I returned it.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I thought for sure I found the perfect set of wodden baby brushes. BUT when I took them out of the package dozens and dozens of bristles fell right out. That can&#x27;t be safe for use on a infant.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece when she was born, and that girl was born with a LOT of hair!! Came in a 2 pack which was perfect, one for her bedroom and one for the diaper bag. My sister said that the brushes are very well made. I use the adult size Ambassador brushes, so I knew the baby brushes would be nice.</li>
    <li> First off, I love that you get two hairbrushes for the price of one. My daughter was born with a lot of hair so I was in need of hairbrush right away. I love the natural wood and soft bristles of this brush. Best of all, my daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to mind when I brush her hair so I know it doesn&#x27;t hurt her.</li>
    <li> This brush meets my needs and expectations.  Others have complained about the smell, and it does have a smell, but I don&#x27;t find it objectionable.  The smell reminds me of the smell of CD jewel cases back in the 90&#x27;s.  Definitely worth the money. The description is a tiny bit confusing.  It is two individually boxed brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very cute and would be great except that they smell very bad.  It is a smell I am familiar with from traveling in India.  I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and not been able to remove the odor.</li>
    <li> So, you get two brushes with this order, which is a little weird because why would you need two? But the price is really good and cheaper than the same brush on other websites where you only get one. It&#x27;s a really cute wooden brush that looks it&#x27;s made well and looks so much better than the usual plastic-y baby brushes. It&#x27;s soft, but not so soft that it doesn&#x27;t actually do any brushing. It&#x27;s pretty small, but just right for a baby head. My son doesn&#x27;t really have much hair yet..but whenever he grows more I&#x27;ll be ready to brush it!!</li>
    <li> This baby hairbrush is well  made and with natural products.  I really have no complaints.  Would recommend.  After owning this brush for just under a year, there is no longer a bad smell as one reviewer had complained about.  It is still in great shape and works well.</li>
    <li> A little harsh for babies soft head</li>
    <li> Too small for toddlers/kids but it works really well. Wish it was a little bigger in size. Perfect for babies!</li>
    <li> I got this brush for my short haired Chihuahuas.  I couldn&#x27;t find a natural brush that was as soft as what I wanted made for dogs, so I decided to try this brush.  I figured if it soft enough for human babies, it would be soft enough for a dog too.  It works wonderfully, and my Chihuahuas love being brushed with it, they think they are getting a massage...and they usually hate grooming.</li>
    <li> This is a good travel brush.  It works as well as the full size brushes on collar length hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this 2 pack of brushes for my 2-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son. They both love them and so do I! They&#x27;re small enough for the kids to brush their own hair and strong enough to tame my daughter&#x27;s very fine hair that tends to knot easily. After using these brushes their hair looks so healthy and shiny. Plus I was pleasantly surprised by the light floral scent of the brushes. You also can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> My kids absolutely love it.  It takes a little longer but it doesn&#x27;t hurt them like the regular brushes. Bought several of these.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very attractive, functional and just what I was looking for. I had a similar brush when I was a child-which I still have-its just a little worse for wear. I specifically wanted a wooden brush like this so I could have my son&#x27;s name engraved on the back as was the case with my name on the back of my brush. This brush is perfect for engraving the back side. it has a broader paddle than my old one and is just as long and of course flat on the back. I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;ll keep the second brush for my next child or gift it to my next niece or nephew. Either way, I will be engraving  the back with a name.&lt;br /&gt;The brush functions well for my son&#x27;s 18 month old clutch of hair, it is easy for him to hold and use-of course he still has to figure out the right direction, but he enjoys having a brush his size that he is allowed to have all to himself. The bristles will distribute his natural oils from his scalp to the tips of his hair, giving him healthier shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;this was an excellent purchase for two brushes of this quality.&lt;br /&gt;The one weird thing though, is that they smell funny, kinda like Indian manufactured products-a sweet rosy incense like smell-I don&#x27;t know why this is, they are supposedly manufactured in Germany and distributed by a company in WI, but they have this bizarre odor. Maybe if they are left to air out or are wrapped in newspaper sprinkled with baking soda for a while, it will go away. I don&#x27;t want to give a brush as a gift that smells suspiciously like India as a gift.</li>
    <li> I bought these to brush my cats.  The bristles are very soft, don&#x27;t cause static buildup, and leave their fur very, very soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;However, the handle is not sized for adult hands, so it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use.  Adult pocket hairbrushes are more ergonomic (but perhaps stiffer).</li>
    <li> Great soft brush for my baby. He has a bit of cradle cap and it is great for brushing after a bath to loosen some of the crust (gross, but true). I don&#x27;t know why this brush is only sold as a two-pack, but it&#x27;s still a good deal and if something happens to one brush you have a backup.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled that this was a two pack as I kept one brush here and gave one to my daughter. My granddaughter&#x27;s hair just got long enough to be messy and this brush keeps it nice and gets out knots. She loves it and wants to use it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality bristles and wood.</li>
    <li> I bought this for an 18 month old. The bristles were so soft they didn&#x27;t brush the hair. The brush is well constructed and would be nice for a newborn.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was going to be a package of two brushes - somehow I thought it would be a brush and a comb.  ANYWAY - the brush(es) are very, very nice.  My son loves having his hair brushed with these, and he even carries one around with him sometimes brushing his stuffed animals!  Soft bristles, nice quality.</li>
    <li> Loved the brush when my baby was born and through her first year. But fyi her hair got longer and curlier and bc the bristles are soft, it doesn&#x27;t really brush through her curls and it&#x27;s hard to brush out her baby tangles (she turned 2 a couple months ago). But the soft bristles are a big plus with a newborn or for fine straight hair. Good quality and size. Overall a really good product!</li>
    <li> Quality Hair Brush for a reasonable price, Plus you get two :) Best Toddler/baby brush ever! Made in Germany of responsibly harvested wood. Natural bristles are perfect; not too hard &amp; not too soft. It gets the job done. This is an heirloom brush to pass down- it is so well-made. Since they sent two, I am giving one as a gift to a couple who are expecting.</li>
    <li> I have 16 month old boy/girl twins.  I really like the brush for my son, in fact when I go to brush his hair he sits very quietly and really enjoys getting his hair brushed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my daughter has slightly longer (not yet at her shoulders), very fine hair that tends to knot in the back from sleeping, so she wakes up with knots at the back of her head.  This brush does not touch those tiny little knots.  I need to use my brush to get rid of the knots so they don&#x27;t get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for hair that does not knot, it is a pleasure, but for hair that knots (even little knots) this brush is not sufficient.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to tame my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  She liked the look of it and the feel.  She wanted to try it herself which is a change. She used to not like people to fuss wit her hair because it is long, fine and tangles easily.  It is sized for a child.</li>
    <li> Love it! I wish I had bought this brush since my baby was a newborn.  It feels soft but it definitely takes care of my 10 month old curly hair. I think this is a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Bristles fell off within minutes of opening the box.</li>
    <li> Superb quality; not one bristle lost after multiple hours of crazy toddler shenanigans. Good buy, especially for two; one will always disappear.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!  Great bristles and nice quality wood handles. Made in Germany. Works great on my infant son.</li>
    <li> I love these for baby gifts. I get them engraved with the baby&#x27;s name. It is so much better than the drugstore plastic ones.</li>
    <li> I went back and forth for quite some time, trying to figure out what sort of brush I should use on my baby.  Her hair is different than my other child, and would tend to stick straight up in a mohawk…However, I didn&#x27;t want a brush where the bristles bothered her baby scalp.  This one is very good (and quite a good value, in that there are two!), and we keep one at home, and the other in our bag.  She loves the way it feels on her head, and it sort of relaxes her whenever I brush her hair.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes! Thank you so much . The material is wonderful for baby&#x27;s head. One in my diaper bag and one in the house</li>
    <li> A great brush. Stronger bristles than the average &amp;#34;baby brush.&amp;#34; Going on two years and we&#x27;re still using ours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfaed with this hair brush.  Till now, the baby is three months old, we never had any kind of problems. It&#x27; s natural hair, doesn&#x27;t have any kind of smell ( like I read on another reviews-I think it&#x27;s more wood smell, witch I like), and it s making the baby hair like it s supposed to do it: nice and smooth:)</li>
    <li> While it took a while to get here, this pack of two hairbrushes is the cutest thing and it&#x27;s so nice. It is made in Germany and the size is just perfect for a baby or toddler, or even just to toss in a purse. I looked all over and in natural health food stores as well and nothing is this nice. I&#x27;ll have to find one in an adult size now.</li>
    <li> Initially I order it by their description, then found out its very gentle on my daughter&#x27;s hair since she was toddler. I am glad I had it for her hair, especially in the back after each morning wake up, it never pull the hair like other brush her friends have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for people I know.</li>
    <li> Perfect little brushes for baby! Love that it comes in a 2 pack so that I can keep one in the diaper bag.</li>
    <li> With most brushes with natural bristles the problem is they fall out - not this one.  Stiff enough that it can comb through baby hair, but not too soft that I feel like I&#x27;m just rubbing her hair.  its not a baby size either.  Fits well I&#x27;m my hand.</li>
    <li> Great brush. This brush is my second pick to the Green Sprouts Wooden Brush.</li>
    <li> 2nd time purchasing the same 2pk set because we lost one on a trip (her baby cousin used the wooden handle as a teether).  Been using them for over a year.  No shedding or loss of bristles.  Soft and gentle.  Way better than the cheap plastic brushes at getting out tangles and smoothing her fine and silky baby hair.</li>
    <li> I was specifically looking for a brush that is natural and soft. When I got this brush I was a little bit disappointed that boar bristles are not as soft as I expected them to be.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it looks great and it works great.</li>
    <li> We are using this hair brush with our infant and he loves the feel of the brushes against his scalp.  His little hairs can get frizzy and this tames them perfectly.</li>
    <li> My baby has very fine hair and this brush is gentle and soft. Combs well. They came two in a pack so that was extra nice.</li>
    <li> The double pack creates a great bargain for one of the best brushes available.</li>
    <li> As a brush for my toddler this product looks the part.  The wood handle is of nice quality and seems fairly sturdy.  Unfortunately the bristles come out on every use and trying to pick tiny bristles off a wet toddler&#x27;s face is more inconvenient than not brushing his hair at all. For that reason, I&#x27;d classify this as more of a prop than a useable product.  Would not buy this brand again.  As mentioned in the title it took a full week to make it to me... maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled by prime, but wouldn&#x27;t have ordered at all if I&#x27;d known it&#x27;d take so long to ship.</li>
    <li> My baby use it every day since he was born.  Now he&#x27;s 14 months old. The brush is gentle and comfortable on his head, and almost does not loose it&#x27;s hair over time. Now there&#x27;s two cracks on the head of brush, so far still good for use.</li>
    <li> Nice soft brushes with wooden handle.</li>
    <li> This is a really great brush. Nice and soft, good quality, my baby loves it. But it does shed bristles like a blowfish on fire. I rumpled it up for longer than 10 minutes trying to get all of the loose bristles out, and only got most of them. When my daughter plays with it, she wants to eat any loose bristles she finds, and i don&#x27;t think that would be good for her at all as they are pokey. Really wish that wasn&#x27;t a problem!</li>
    <li> These hairbrushes are great, perfect small size for a baby. They had a funny smell like incense when they arrived but that was no big deal as they were wrapped in plastic. They work great and are a much more eco friendly option than the plastic combs and brushes you see everywhere.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and I love that we got two brushes! One in the bathroom and one in the diaper bag!</li>
    <li> I thought the bristles would be soft... being a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brush I thought they would be made with horse hairs... the fibers also fall out a lot</li>
    <li> The perfect toddler hairbrush...just right for their in-between hair.  The brush is very attractive and easy to hold.  Packaged two in a box, perfect for one at Mom&#x27;s and one at Nana&#x27;s house.</li>
    <li> good hairbrush for babies..soft</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes for young children.  They are soft and have a nice wood handle.  They are small enough that my kids (2 &amp; 3 yrs) can use them by themselves.  Great product.</li>
    <li> No shedding and soft. Love it! I&#x27;d heard bad things about other brands, but this one is great. Comes with 2 brushes, seems excessive but handy.</li>
    <li> Great brush for baby. Two brushes are included in the order.  They are a perfect size with soft bristles.</li>
    <li> bought this for a two pound Chihuahua and it is perfect.  Doesn&#x27;t scratch and must feel good because she leans into it.  Works great on her fine silky hair.  You also get two for this price so I put one away for later.  She does tend to bite on it, being she is a puppy, so one for later is great.</li>
    <li> I have bought two sets of these brushes because they are so great. They are durable and work very well for babies and young children.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and do well in babies hair. I have been using them for almost 9 months now and would recommend them to anyone with a child with a lot or little hair! My kiddo has a good amount of hair always has and these make it look nice and smooth and does not leave his hair oily! Love them!</li>
    <li> You will receive two brushes in each package that you order. I bought these for our little dog. She has long but fine silky hair much like a baby&#x27;s…and the regular dog brushes are too stiff for her. These brushes are wonderful! Great quality and not one bristle has fallen from either brush. Great quality and an excellent price too. This would be a perfect brush for a child with small hands. The wood feels very smooth and the bristles, while soft, brush beautifully and gently. I do not recommend for thick or tangled hair but then my dog has neither. It is a baby&#x27;s brush…but it will be good if your child has fine or thinner hair.  We own other Ambassador brushes and I always look for this brand since I know we will get something that will last for a long time.  This is an excellent value!</li>
    <li> This is a great hairbrush that seems to be gently on my babies head.</li>
