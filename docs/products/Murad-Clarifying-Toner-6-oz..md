      <li>excellent, fast shipping good product.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Very satisfied with this purchase and hope they also have more of this toner along with the cleanser because the price beats any comparison</li>
      <li>I have tried many products out there, trying to control outbreaks and redness on my face.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love this line for my skin type.  </li>
      <li>Love the tingling feeling.</li>
      <li>Love this toner.</li>
      <li>and that is the reason i can not use any toner any  more.</li>
      <li>It is my favorite toner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to the main ingredients in over the counter acne medications, so I&#x27;m really happy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve discovered this item on Amazon and it is significantly cheaper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product mostly to help control break-outs for about 6 months now; I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>Just because it is cheap, does not make it real.</li>
      <li>I used witch hazel alone for a long time and this is much better!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>I love using this after the shower for a more dramatic effect since your pores are more open after a warm shower.</li>
      <li>My &#x27;acne&#x27; has not come back in 3 months and my skin looks fresh, hydrated, and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Works well after cleansing and is very gentle.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also not too strong, but powerful enough to work on pimples and toning your skin.</li>
      <li>This was not a problem I encountered as I applied moisturizer after using this, but ultimately this product didn&#x27;t do any good especially not for $14.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry it out or make it more oily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used most of the product hoping that my skin was simply &#x27;purging&#x27;, or otherwise adjusting to the new product.</li>
      <li>but I can really see an improvement in my skin after using it for just a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>I would really reccommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it really, really helps.</li>
      <li>You really see a difference when you use this product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m an adult acne sufferer, so I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive so I can only use certain products.</li>
      <li>Within a week my acne was nearly all gone</li>
      <li>I had what the dermatologist coined &#x27;adult acne&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>We use the whole line of Murad and this is a mainstay in our facial regimens.</li>
      <li>I know that there is a seal of approval, but this is the second time I have ordered this product from Amazon, and the seal was clearly torn off.</li>
      <li>This toner hurts like a mother, seriously when you first use it, it really stings</li>
      <li>It does not dry out your skin.</li>
      <li>However, while overall it reduces my break-outs (along with very strict skin-care routines) it does not clear up my skin completely, especially during times of stress and other times when my skin is particularly prone to break-outs.</li>
      <li>Murad, generally, has decent products that have previously worked well on my skin.</li>
      <li>It had a little too much witch hazel.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, refreshing.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this purchase and hope they also have more of this toner along with the cleanser because the price beats any comparison and I&#x27;d rather buy from here than anywhere else!</li>
    <li> I had what the dermatologist coined &#x27;adult acne&#x27;.  I had never experienced any acne as a teen and was very frustrated. After trying every type of cleanser and toner, I ran across the reviews on this product and thought I would give it a try.  Within a week my acne was nearly all gone and my skin looked great.  I continued to use it for another month and then switched to the Murad hydrating toner.  My &#x27;acne&#x27; has not come back in 3 months and my skin looks fresh, hydrated, and healthy.  I am thrilled I found Murad and will continue to use thier products!!!!</li>
    <li> You really see a difference when you use this product. It clears your pores and takes away the daily gunk that lays on your face. I love using this after the shower for a more dramatic effect since your pores are more open after a warm shower. Love the tingling feeling. Must have beauty item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product mostly to help control break-outs for about 6 months now; I have very oily skin. I&#x27;m allergic to the main ingredients in over the counter acne medications, so I&#x27;m really happy I found this product. However, while overall it reduces my break-outs (along with very strict skin-care routines) it does not clear up my skin completely, especially during times of stress and other times when my skin is particularly prone to break-outs. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it really, really helps.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It reduces pore size and it tingles after you put it on because it contains witchhazel which is what is used to reduce pore size.    Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Love this toner. It works great on my oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out or make it more oily. It&#x27;s just right. It&#x27;s also not too strong, but powerful enough to work on pimples and toning your skin. I would recommend this product to anyone whos tried everything out there!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Murad for years.  It works for me.  I also purchase other Murad products from the amazon website.</li>
    <li> It had a little too much witch hazel. Felt like it was burning my skin a bit. It did seem to work well on under eye puffiness</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of paying this much for toner that&#x27;s mostly just witch hazel, but I was wrong. I used witch hazel alone for a long time and this is much better! Cleared up my acne without over-drying. Must have!</li>
    <li> This toner is really great at tightening up pores. Use Murad Clarifying Cleanser 1st, followed by this toner, and end with a Murad Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Murad Toner for over five years. I&#x27;ve been getting it from Sephora. I&#x27;ve discovered this item on Amazon and it is significantly cheaper. I ordered two bottles. My skin is sensitive so I can only use certain products. This product turned my skin red and itchy. This has never happened before. I already called Murad and notified them of this fake product. I&#x27;ve purchase the same toner from an authorized retailer and it works like it did before. This product is fake. Do NOT buy this.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products out there, trying to control outbreaks and redness on my face.  Nothing compares to this!!!  I took a chance and ordered it, and wish I would have discovered it a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Murad, generally, has decent products that have previously worked well on my skin. I thought adding a daily or bi-weekly toner would help prevent breakouts, however, this product had the opposite effect. I didn&#x27;t have a dramatic volcanic eruption from using this, but it seemed to worsen breakouts and cause new ones. I&#x27;ve used most of the product hoping that my skin was simply &#x27;purging&#x27;, or otherwise adjusting to the new product. Not so. Beware of the alcohol in this product as it can be drying. This was not a problem I encountered as I applied moisturizer after using this, but ultimately this product didn&#x27;t do any good especially not for $14.</li>
    <li> This toner hurts like a mother, seriously when you first use it, it really stings but I can really see an improvement in my skin after using it for just a couple of weeks. I would really reccommend it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting.  Works well after cleansing and is very gentle.  Love it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several yrs and have not had one problem from it and I&#x27;m an adult acne sufferer, so I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love this line for my skin type.  Best price I could find for this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is with Murad products. I know that there is a seal of approval, but this is the second time I have ordered this product from Amazon, and the seal was clearly torn off. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. Just because it is cheap, does not make it real. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> It is my favorite toner. My skin started to brake out a lot recently and that is the reason i can not use any toner any  more. This one removes the grease and keep the skin moisture. That is what i like about it. I use it for 6 months already.</li>
    <li> This product works great. It does not dry out your skin. We use the whole line of Murad and this is a mainstay in our facial regimens.</li>
    <li> This toner is the best of all others I have used. I ran out and I am going crazy!! I also use the sunscreen spf 15 for face and body. Great during the summer!</li>
    <li> excellent, fast shipping good product. reduced acne &amp; cleared up my face. i m very satisfied with this order. yes i would recommend it</li>
