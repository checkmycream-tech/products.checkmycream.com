    <li> These brushes are GREAT...but I didnt receive my beauty sponge with this purchase.  I was high disappointed about that but I can&#x27;t deny that brushes are very sofy, and the packaging was very nice and I receive them quickly.</li>

    <li> Wonderful brushes at a great price!</li>
    <li> Received this as a Christmas present and it is just what I needed.  These feel great again my skin.  In the past I&#x27;ve used brushes and the bristles were not this soft.  If you&#x27;re looking for a quality set of brushes then I suggest this one.  Plus you have a good variety of brushes to choose from for every need when applying your makeup.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this makeup set: it is affordable, effective and above all professional! I also loved the free e-books!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Angeles</li>
    <li> LOVELOVELOVE this set! All of the brushes are extremely soft and very high quality. The bag that they come in is great for travel and the faux-leather cover is so sleek! The &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; dupe that they have is really great and doesn&#x27;t absorb a lot of the product like some replicas. I received my package on time and they sent the set wrapped in a purple metallic wrapper that matched the sponge. The only complaint I have is that when I opened it it had a strong chemical smell but that disappeared in a few days. This set is so cute and I&#x27;d definitely highly recommend it to a friend!</li>
    <li> I am a professional make up artist that saw a review for this brush set on youtube. I am all fro trying new products and stepping outside the big name companies and seeing what other companies are out there. I recieved my brush set two days after I ordered them and could not wait to try them out. I washed them with a water and cetaphil and let them sit over night. The next day I was so impressed with how well the brushes picked the make up products!!! They are so easy to use and very precise. This set can easily rank high with some the top brands out there. The only thing I could say that I didnt like was the beauty blender I thought it was a bit to hard for my liking and the blender brush was a bit larger than any others that I have. All in all I love this brush set and would reccommend them for anyone who wants a quality brush set without spending hundreds of dollars. I am planning to order another just because you can never have too many! i cant wait to see what else phenomenal beauty will add to their product line. They also have great customer service. Right after ordering they sent me a welcome email explaining what to expect once my package arrived which was a good feeling knowing that they are working hard to build an keep customers for the long run</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. For the money they were great. Haven&#x27;t had any problems cleaning or using them. The only reason I&#x27;m doing a 4 is that I&#x27;m having a difficult time with get the the e-book.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, and very, very soft! Awesome deal!</li>
