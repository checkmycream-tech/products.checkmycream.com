      <li>I bought this as a gift and it is good product.</li>
      <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
      <li>the price I think is good, but when I got the items, I found the items will expire on May 2012.</li>
      <li>It is a good wrinkle filler and helps with puffiness, also.</li>

      <li>Thanks, great product!</li>
      <li>All in all this is great cream I&#x27;ve really been happy with.</li>
      <li>So the first thing I ordered off of Amazon was some hydro-gel eye patches because I read great reviews on them; then I purchased the Garnier Eye Roller, and then the L&#x27;oreal Collagen Filler.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for a couple of years.</li>
      <li>We love this product.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love it ....</li>
      <li>Since Lancome discontinued my favorite face cream with collagen, I have been using the Loreal one exclusively.</li>
      <li>There are better line fillers out there.</li>
      <li>I bought this to try just like I have tried many many product before and to my surprise</li>
      <li>the product do its job even more.</li>
      <li>If you use this morning and night, you should start to notice the area around your eyes get better.</li>
      <li>&quot; I am so pleased with this</li>
      <li>It works just as well, at a much better price.</li>
      <li>Love the Collagen Filler and Collagen Filler Eye Treatment.</li>
      <li>but my eyes look better over all )</li>
      <li>It gives a nice refresh look to my eyes specially in the morning.</li>
      <li>Collagen Filler Eye Illuminator Targeted Eye Treatment,  0.5-Ounce Tube]]It is an excellent product for covering dark circles underneath the eyes.</li>
      <li>That is actually pretty nice.</li>
      <li>I see the fine lines I have are diminishing as well.</li>
      <li>x&#x27;s a day and have noticed no change in the fine lines under my eyes</li>
      <li>Currently, they are available online at a great price.</li>
      <li>Product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous product and I cannot believe that L&#x27;oreal has discontinued it.  </li>
      <li>so far I love it!</li>
      <li>I will not purchase anything like this product again, I had purchased something similar to this product and it worked good</li>
      <li>Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I love it and will be back for more soon.  </li>
      <li>I find it does an adequate job without paying a fortune, or getting &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done.</li>
      <li>It is not extremely thick, but also not runny like most eye serums.</li>
      <li>This is the first product I have ever used that does what is said that it would do!</li>
      <li>Given the price range (there are many products that do basically the same thing that cost much, much more), it is a real bargain.</li>
      <li>4/5 stars since I don&#x27;t know how it really compares to others or how much my circles and lines are able to improve.</li>
      <li>I use it right after my shower in the morning and right</li>
      <li>When I first got this I thought it worked great on my very dark circles.</li>
      <li>So smooth and definitely eliminates fine lines around the eye area.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is so hard to find - but great when you find it.  </li>
      <li>Between these three products, drinking more water, and off that medication, I saw a big improvement within 5 days.</li>
      <li>I intend to continue using it till I run out and then will decide whether it makes enough of a difference to order more of it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason I think the L&#x27;oreal Collagen Filler had more to do with my results, because it was the last order I received</li>
      <li>, you see better results; same analogy with The Collagen Filler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty descent.</li>
      <li>It works great to lighten dark circles around the eyes and keeps the skin soft.</li>
      <li>It also might just be that I need to use it for several more weeks to start seeing more long term results.</li>
      <li>and already have noticed my eyes looking older and crows feet!</li>
      <li>It stays on and kind of fills in the little wrinkles under the eye.  </li>
      <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for years and really hope that L&#x27;OReal will continue to make it.  </li>
      <li>I am waiting for the results, i now it will take a while, but I am hopeful cause i really believe in the brand.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone who want fast results and refreshed looking</li>
      <li>Thanks a million.</li>
      <li>very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really recomend it.</li>
      <li>I realize it has a reasonable price</li>
      <li>really well, I&#x27;ll have to find something else to replace the discontinued product.</li>
      <li>This one is really working wonders under my eye</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any dark corrective issues to deal with, but the areas around my eyes do seem brighter and just gives a &#x27;healthy&#x27; glow appearance in which I appreciate.  </li>
      <li>But my dark circles are gone and most of the puffiness.</li>
      <li>I bought this product and a week later i noticed my eyes looking brighter and more younger looking...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like taking a diet pill: if you do not work out and eat right, the diet pill will only do so much, but if you work out, eat well, and take the pill</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This is far better than the other loreal revitalift one I tried.  </li>
      <li>Then after a while I thought it worked better on my fine lines and less on my dark circles.</li>
      <li>Also not irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I will write another review after a few more weeks.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and everything else I used so far made it look even thinner.</li>
      <li>My dark circles were gone completely, and my puffiness has reduced by a significant amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>like what I see so far.</li>
      <li>but so far it is doing what I needed it to do.</li>
      <li>I am one who thought I would never have to purchase these kind of products because I&#x27;m black and you know the saying \\&quot;black do not crack.\\</li>
      <li>Also, by applying enough where the eye area didn&#x27;t feel dry anymore, I felt the tube disappeared rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love this product,I had the shallow look under my eyes before using this product and the first time I used it plumped the shallow look right a way.</li>
      <li>I almost sent it back because it was supposed to be new but looked as though it had been in someones trunk.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a while and barely have any wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I had developed very noticeable dark circles, with lines under my eyes, and puffiness, due to too much salt intake and a medication I was taking that dehydrated me for fluid retention.</li>
      <li>I have only been using this for about a week, but I have noticed my eyelids seem to look a little thicker right after I put it on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works the best with my eye area. My skin is very sensitive and everything else I used so far made it look even thinner. Unlikely other products this product does not cause eye irritiation if you contact eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month 2 x&#x27;s a day and have noticed no change in the fine lines under my eyes and I still have the same dark circles. This was a waste.</li>
    <li> The product so far seems to work well, I&#x27;ve only had it for a little while but so far it is doing what I needed it to do. My only issue was the packaging. I almost sent it back because it was supposed to be new but looked as though it had been in someones trunk. I know its crazy that I kept it but I opened it to look and see if there were any obvious signs of use and there were none.</li>
    <li> the price I think is good, but when I got the items, I found the items will expire on May 2012.</li>
    <li> I got this because collagen is supposed to be key for lines and circles. When I first got this I thought it worked great on my very dark circles. Then after a while I thought it worked better on my fine lines and less on my dark circles. All in all this is great cream I&#x27;ve really been happy with. I am 31 and have only started using eye cream in the last couple of years and this is the second one I have tried. This is far better than the other loreal revitalift one I tried.  Also not irritating to my sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend this.    4/5 stars since I don&#x27;t know how it really compares to others or how much my circles and lines are able to improve. Also, by applying enough where the eye area didn&#x27;t feel dry anymore, I felt the tube disappeared rather quickly.  I think it said to use under the eye but of course you want to use all over the eye.</li>
    <li> I had developed very noticeable dark circles, with lines under my eyes, and puffiness, due to too much salt intake and a medication I was taking that dehydrated me for fluid retention. I am only 33 years old and my eyes made me look late 30s--very embarrassing and does damage on one&#x27;s self esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concealers were only a quick fix and made the problem look worse once the makeup settled into my skin. I decided to do something. So the first thing I ordered off of Amazon was some hydro-gel eye patches because I read great reviews on them; then I purchased the Garnier Eye Roller, and then the L&#x27;oreal Collagen Filler. Between these three products, drinking more water, and off that medication, I saw a big improvement within 5 days. No Lie! My dark circles were gone completely, and my puffiness has reduced by a significant amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I think the L&#x27;oreal Collagen Filler had more to do with my results, because it was the last order I received and I noticed a difference after the day I used it. I am one who thought I would never have to purchase these kind of products because I&#x27;m black and you know the saying \\&quot;black do not crack.\\&quot; I am so pleased with this and it does get rid of the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, use a great nutritional plan with this product: i.e drink plenty of water, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, and you will see a significance improvement to your eyes. Now those concealers are looking good on me. It&#x27;s like taking a diet pill: if you do not work out and eat right, the diet pill will only do so much, but if you work out, eat well, and take the pill, you see better results; same analogy with The Collagen Filler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my lines are not completely gone but were significantly reduced, and I believe will disappear within the next few weeks. But my dark circles are gone and most of the puffiness. I recommend this product to anyone who want fast results and refreshed looking eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to eat well and drink plenty of water as well, as it would help the product do its job even more.help the product do its job even more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month. I use it right after my shower in the morning and right after I wash my face before bed. I have noticed little to no difference in the appearance of my eyes.  At least the skin around my eyes is softer?  That&#x27;s all I have to say. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am 27 y/o and already have noticed my eyes looking older and crows feet! I bought this product and a week later i noticed my eyes looking brighter and more younger looking... so far I love it! (not sure if it will fix the crows feet when i smile but my eyes look better over all )</li>
    <li> Product is fantastic. I have used this product before i would recommend it to anyone. The delivery came in great time i wasnt expecting that response. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> If you use this morning and night, you should start to notice the area around your eyes get better. I&#x27;m only in my 20s however I did notice my skin change a lot since using this.</li>
    <li> The cosmetics had expired,I have buy 3 products in  Gregory S Parks.All of them had expired.Two L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Filler Eye Illuminator Targeted Eye Treatment, 0.5-Ounce Tube and 1 skin genesis daily moisturizer.   The code are FD221AAV  FF155  FC363.  If you don&#x27;t believe meyou must have a try!!!!</li>
    <li> I have only used the product for 3 weeks.  I really haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet.  I intend to continue using it till I run out and then will decide whether it makes enough of a difference to order more of it.  It does make the skin around the eye feel softer, but I have not seen any decrease in the depth of wrinkles. I will write another review after a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try just like I have tried many many product before and to my surprise it is awsome. I love this product,I had the shallow look under my eyes before using this product and the first time I used it plumped the shallow look right a way.This is the first product I have ever used that does what is said that it would do! So I am going to sock up so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any dark corrective issues to deal with, but the areas around my eyes do seem brighter and just gives a &#x27;healthy&#x27; glow appearance in which I appreciate.  I am happy with the purchase and will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is a piece of crap. Absolute waste of money. Save yours. Doesn&#x27;t work at all, not even for the smallest little lines.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this cream for undereye circles and a few blue veins showing on my eyelids. I have only been using this for about a week, but I have noticed my eyelids seem to look a little thicker right after I put it on. This helps some with the veins because having fuller skin helps make the blue lines less noticeable. However, the fullness does not seem to last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been putting it on at night and by the next morning my eyelids are back to looking thin. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my dark undereye circles, but that may take some time. I think I may start using it twice a day and see if that helps. It also might just be that I need to use it for several more weeks to start seeing more long term results. Regardless, $6 for an eye cream is a really great deal. The downside is if this ends up working really well, I&#x27;ll have to find something else to replace the discontinued product.</li>
    <li> I am waiting for the results, i now it will take a while, but I am hopeful cause i really believe in the brand.</li>
    <li> This product is like using water, it does not fill in any wrinkle or does not cover dark spots. I will not purchase anything like this product again, I had purchased something similar to this product and it worked good but this does not.</li>
    <li> The cosmetics had expired,I have buy 3 products in Gregory S Parks.All of them had expired.3 L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Filler Eye Illuminator Targeted Eye Treatment, 0.5-Ounce Tube .  If you don&#x27;t believe me&#x27;you must have a try!!!!</li>
    <li> This cream made a noticeable improvement in a few days. I would get it again in a minute especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product that I purchased. It does the job I hoped that it would.[[ASIN:B0014ZWHZ6 L&#x27;Oreal  Collagen Filler Eye Illuminator Targeted Eye Treatment,  0.5-Ounce Tube]]It is an excellent product for covering dark circles underneath the eyes. The best product I have tried and I have tried a few.</li>
    <li> This item works as well as I hoped it would. It seems to instantly reduce lines and puffiness under my eyes, and works for hours. Given the price range (there are many products that do basically the same thing that cost much, much more), it is a real bargain.</li>
    <li> Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described. Thanks a million.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product it is original Lóreal, I know them and used all my life. I really recomend it.</li>
    <li> I have hollow eyes and this is the only cream that has made a difference for me. I tried Olay, Shiseido, Neutrogena, Avon, Mario Badescu you name it with no difference at all. Will buy this forever! I see the fine lines I have are diminishing as well.</li>
    <li> Very good!  The product is powerfull.&lt;br /&gt;I bought for a gift and the person loverd it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> I am using this in combination with the Collagen Filler Moisturizer.  I find it does an adequate job without paying a fortune, or getting &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done.</li>
    <li> I am in my 20s, but I have these deeps lines underneath my eyes. I have been using it on these lines for a week now, and there is a slight shallowing of the lines. I will say that the bags underneath my eyes now are not so purple-ish/blue-ish. That is actually pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams, some really expensive. This one is really working wonders under my eye and I really notice it when I change to another eye cream and realize how much tired and older I look with the other brands. Then, I change back to this cream and in a few days, under my eyes are back to normal which means less dark circles and really smooth with lines fading. I wish they had not discontinued this cream because amazon is the only place that I can get it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and it is good product. Recommend if you want something as a gift or want to use it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think it does much unfortunately.  There are better line fillers out there. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Excellent I love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought four tubes, two for me and two for my mother.  We love this product.  So smooth and definitely eliminates fine lines around the eye area.  I even use it on between my eyebrows on my worry lines.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like l&#x27;oreal products.  Haven&#x27;t used this long enough to judge cumulive results but like what I see so far.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to use on the eye area.  I have been using it for years and really hope that L&#x27;OReal will continue to make it.  It is a good wrinkle filler and helps with puffiness, also.</li>
    <li> \ive been using this for a month but still havent seen any difference.It doesnt fill anything and doesnt illuminate anything.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference after ordreing and using this product. I would not recommend it. I realize it has a reasonable price but in my opinion is just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have a thin face, and with this product, my undereye area doesn&#x27;t look sunken in. I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I wish they have a bigger size. I ordered thinking that I will received the bigger one, but instead I got the small one</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for a couple of years. It works great to lighten dark circles around the eyes and keeps the skin soft. However, it has become increasingly hard to find and the price went from less than $10 up to $25 over the last 6 months. What the heck?</li>
    <li> it´s work quiicly, in 3 weeks you can see the effects in the eyes, good product, and i ask por more</li>
    <li> This stuff is so hard to find - but great when you find it.  Eases the creases under eye, a little goes a long way... I love it and will be back for more soon.  Too bad it&#x27;s not in the stores at all, can&#x27;t find it anywhere except on Amazon.  Thanks, great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Loreal collagen fillers for years and they work for me.  They are becoming impossible to find in stores.  Currently, they are available online at a great price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty descent. I have been using this for a while and barely have any wrinkles. I wish the moisture would last longer.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  It stays on and kind of fills in the little wrinkles under the eye.  It doesn&#x27;t take my mascara off, either.</li>
    <li> El producto me llego en buen estado, estoy satisfecho con la compra lo recomiendo 100% no tengo quejas,&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias por el servicio.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product and I cannot believe that L&#x27;oreal has discontinued it.  So disappointed in them. What is the replacement?</li>
    <li> I like that it diminishes my black circle under the eye. It gives a nice refresh look to my eyes specially in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is the best OTC eye cream on the market today -  and I have tried them all!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time finding this product locally so I bought 2 and it was just what I needed</li>
    <li> Love it .... it works great  :-)</li>
    <li> Love the Collagen Filler and Collagen Filler Eye Treatment. I have severly dry skin, adult acne, and wrinkels, and I cannot use any products containing retinol because they make me brake out, so my choices for a moisturizer that also treats wrinkles are limited. The Loreal Collagen filler does not irritate my skin, it is very moisturizing and has the perfect consistency. It is not extremely thick, but also not runny like most eye serums. Since Lancome discontinued my favorite face cream with collagen, I have been using the Loreal one exclusively. It works just as well, at a much better price.</li>
    <li> I am 47 and use this product religiously because it plumps and makes my skin look younger all day long.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Loreal Collagen Filler Eye Treatment was not good as I could not tell that any did any thing at all for the under eyes</li>
