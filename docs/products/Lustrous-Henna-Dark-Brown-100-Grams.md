      <li>no harmful chemical smooth works good</li>
      <li>It appears to be a very ecological and healthy alternative to hair dye.</li>

      <li>I always color my hair one to two days before a function just to make for sure that it is all gone from my hair line.  </li>
      <li>I love Amazon</li>
      <li>how glad I am</li>
      <li>and I still look at my hair every day in the mirror and marvel at how much I love it and</li>

      <li>I went to a family gathering afterwards and got many compliments on my hair.</li>
      <li>I always got so many compliments.  </li>
      <li>Ok, people say it smells earthy.  </li>
      <li>but this, to me is one of the better Henna&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves hair healthy and voluminous.</li>
      <li>People comment on how beautiful my hair looks and assume its natural.</li>
      <li>It looks so healthy and full of body.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and as advertised, I will be ordering more from this seller.</li>
      <li>Saba botanical provides a great alternative to regular hair tints that come in a box.</li>
      <li>Absolutely FURIOUS at this product!!!</li>
      <li>I was excited to use this</li>
      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be allergic to an ORGANIC, ALL-NATURAL Product, but I guess I&#x27;m a rare situation..!?</li>
      <li>I mixed this with indigo and applied it and let it stay on for a good 4 hours.  </li>
      <li>BOIL WATER THEN COOL IT, MIX ALL TOG LIKE CLUMPY YOGOURT.</li>
      <li>I put the (included) shower cap on and took it easy for about an hour, I did everything exactly as the directions said.</li>
      <li>I lucked out and googled the word henna for men, and this is the first product which caught my eye!</li>
      <li>worth the effort...</li>
      <li>The smell reminds me of fresh mown hay which is stacked in a barn.</li>
      <li>I sent for some right away.        </li>
      <li>To get the best results one must use more water first and add the powder little by little.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous rich brown color with not a single hair of grey showing.      </li>
      <li>Now as I get more greys the product turns my hair red.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian henna strarght from Egypt for 25 years since my first visit there.  </li>
      <li>If you use too much water, the shade won&#x27;t be as powerful.</li>
      <li>If anyone wants pics of what my skin looked like after using it, I&#x27;ll send them!</li>
      <li>not only does it color hair, but it leaves it in much better condition than without using it.</li>
      <li>I first used pure unprocessed Henna from my favorite online herb store.</li>
      <li>I am pretty sure this product is just a repackaged bag of indigo and does not even contain the other ingredients on the label.</li>
      <li>But that doesn&#x27;t really matter, it&#x27;s dealable.  </li>
      <li>It covers the gray very well.</li>
      <li>rich lasting color...</li>
      <li>It has high lights, low lights and every light imaginable.</li>
      <li>Compared to what PPD in chemical dye does, that is a small sacrifice for something that is all natural and GOOD for you and your body.  </li>
      <li>When applying you have to make for sure that you cover all of the hair you want to color because it doesn&#x27;t drip down and just color on</li>
      <li>Anyways, make SURE you are not allergic to Henna or any of the other ingredients in this product!</li>
      <li>It is now weeks later, my hair feels thick, strong and healthy.</li>
      <li>It is a gentle product and leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be better off grinding up some black chalk and rubbing it on your head instead for as natural as this looks.</li>
      <li>I did a second one after this one with Chestnut Henna to get the right color.</li>
      <li>The grey is well covered on both cases, and the final color could not be more natural.</li>
      <li>The coloring process must be repeated a little more often that the old chemical dyes</li>
      <li>As soon as it came I mixed it exactly as the directions said.</li>
      <li>I could not possibly love this product more.</li>
      <li>Like all cheap brands of indigo, when you add hot water it releases a blue sheen, turns a chalky blue on your head, then green (and rubs off all over anything it touches) and then washes right out, leaving your hair gray again.</li>
      <li>My color is holding, its a rich dark mahogany brown.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid, if you&#x27;re looking to replace chemical dyes, this is a great way to do that.  </li>
      <li>I found my first grey hair at 18 years old.</li>
      <li>It does not look dyed, no hair dye color would ever look this natural.  </li>
      <li>After years of coloring my hair, I recently developed an allergy to hair dye.  </li>
      <li>My whole face turned red...</li>
      <li>I wanted something natural.  </li>
      <li>I have three young kids and do not want to look like their grandma.  </li>
      <li>Also, it covers all the gray completely.  </li>
      <li>My hair, lost all of its natural curl with the repeated bleachings.  </li>
      <li>And by age 22  my hair was liberally sprinkled with grey and that is when I first started using Henna.      </li>
      <li>By this time I was 30 years old and even tho</li>
      <li>I was very intrigued to see that Lustrous Henna covers more grey then regular Henna, in a lot less time.</li>
      <li>I mean, HUGE, itchy, burning, sore-to-the-touch BLISTERS!</li>
      <li>However,  Lustrous Henna Dark Brown has indigo and other all natural and safe ingredients formulated to produce dark brown full coverage.  </li>
      <li>Even after doing a deep conditioning, my hair was much dryer and harder then normal.</li>
      <li>It is so natural looking and finally</li>
      <li>I did a ton of reading and research, and after reading that you can&#x27;t use regular dye after doing a henna, I decided to get it professionally done at an Indian salon</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian henna strarght from Egypt for 25 years since my first visit there.  Now as I get more greys the product turns my hair red.  However,  Lustrous Henna Dark Brown has indigo and other all natural and safe ingredients formulated to produce dark brown full coverage.  I have my younger hair back.  My hair feels great and looks healthy too.  No going back....</li>
    <li> I found my first grey hair at 18 years old. And by age 22  my hair was liberally sprinkled with grey and that is when I first started using Henna.      I first used pure unprocessed Henna from my favorite online herb store. It has always worked great to hide my greys. I would use it every few months and leave it on for a few hours. So tho I loved how healthy it kept my hair, I did not love the time I spent applying it and eventually turned to chemical rinses to color my hair.  The chemicals made my hair fall out, break, split and lifeless. My hair looked dry and generally quite unhappy.       By this time I was 30 years old and even tho I am quite a spring chicken inside yet, my outside was starting to look a little frayed around the edges. Dry brittle hair and about %15 grey throughout. Plain regular Henna was no longer covering my grey hair at all. I sadly decided I must choose to either have healthy grey hair or brittle lifeless brown hair.      Finally one day I had enough, I started searching for another option and that is when I found the lustrous Henna. I was very intrigued to see that Lustrous Henna covers more grey then regular Henna, in a lot less time. I sent for some right away.        As soon as it came I mixed it exactly as the directions said. I put the (included) shower cap on and took it easy for about an hour, I did everything exactly as the directions said. When I stepped out of the shower, I felt quite nervous and fearful that it did not do what it promised, but when I took the towel off, I could hardly believe my eyes. Gorgeous rich brown color with not a single hair of grey showing.      It is now weeks later, my hair feels thick, strong and healthy. My color is holding, its a rich dark mahogany brown. I get compliments on my hair. My hair shimmers and shines. It has high lights, low lights and every light imaginable. I could not possibly love this product more.</li>
    <li> I used this a long time ago.  I always got so many compliments.  Then, I wanted to go blonde, so I stopped using Henna.  My hair, lost all of its natural curl with the repeated bleachings.  Also, it looked thin and lifeless.  Then, I had a terrible, near-fatal stroke at the age of 36.  Due to the following brain surgery, my head was shaved.  When it started to grow back in, I was amazed at how gray I was.  I have three young kids and do not want to look like their grandma.  I wanted to color the gray away but without chemicals, so I went back to the Henna.  My hair is below my chin now.  It looks so healthy and full of body.  Also, it covers all the gray completely.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  It is like a miracle product:  not only does it color hair, but it leaves it in much better condition than without using it.</li>
    <li> I have no problem covering my gray  hair with this product.. I appreciate the fact that it is &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34; I actually like the smell that it leaves on my hair, which (smell) fades in a few days. It is a gentle product and leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I will buy this one again and again.</li>
    <li> It did not darken as stated.  It faded in a day.  I didnt have any bad skin reactions like most hair dyes give me.</li>
    <li> Good for coloring, not so good for conditioning.  This product can leave some hair types left with a hard and dry feeling after use (that with following the directions in all detail). Even after doing a deep conditioning, my hair was much dryer and harder then normal. Beware if you have dry or semi-dry hair when using this product.[[ASIN:B003X8V2OE Lustrous Henna Dark Brown - 100 Grams]]</li>
    <li> This is the best Henna product that I have ever used.  I used a different one for years from Sally&#x27;s then found this one.  It covers the gray very well. I am 53 and get a lot of compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> This henna produces an amazing color. It appears to be a very ecological and healthy alternative to hair dye. I like that it fades slowly; so, there is never a line of dyed hair/not dyed hair. People comment on how beautiful my hair looks and assume its natural.</li>
    <li> I love Amazon and I love this product no harmful chemical smooth works good</li>
    <li> Absolutely FURIOUS at this product!!!! I&#x27;m not saying no one should use it, but if you have sensative skin or are allergic to plant-based products, DO NOT use this!!!!! Aside from the coverage and color results being crap, I put this pastey mess on my hair and within an hour , my head, face, neck, shoulders and ears broke out in wealts the size of soybeans! I mean, HUGE, itchy, burning, sore-to-the-touch BLISTERS! My whole face turned red... My head was covered in ths same mess! I actually took pics because I wanted to document how bad my reaction to this product was, and let me tell you, it was HORRIBLE! And the WORST part is, the rash continues to flare up until the hair dye is  practically 100% STRIPPED from your hair! I never thought I&#x27;d be allergic to an ORGANIC, ALL-NATURAL Product, but I guess I&#x27;m a rare situation..!? Anyways, make SURE you are not allergic to Henna or any of the other ingredients in this product! I had NO idea I was until too late and the aftermath of using it is absolutely shocking! If anyone wants pics of what my skin looked like after using it, I&#x27;ll send them! email me at : crys1218@gmail.com ... It might have been a fluke for me, but whatever the case, it was a VERY NEGATIVE  EXPERIENCE!!!  And the smell isn&#x27;t pleasant either, might I add.. Long process just to dye your hair! And like I said earlier, the color sucked when it was all said and done. I will never ever EVER use Saba ANYTHING ever again!</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT, LEAVE ON FOR 3 HOURS, MIX WITH LEMON JUICE AND WATER., BOIL WATER THEN COOL IT, MIX ALL TOG LIKE CLUMPY YOGOURT.</li>
    <li> After years of coloring my hair, I recently developed an allergy to hair dye.  Doesn&#x27;t matter what brand, I was using the good stuff with no ammonia or resourcinol I&#x27;d get at Whole Foods or on Amazon, it doesn&#x27;t matter, my head would itch like crazy and I was finding scabs in my scalp.  That scared me to finding an alternative for not only my health, but my head.  I wanted something natural.  I did a ton of reading and research, and after reading that you can&#x27;t use regular dye after doing a henna, I decided to get it professionally done at an Indian salon so I could learn how to do it and also get it to work effectively.  They used this brand.  I ABSOLUTELY love my hair!  I have medium/dark brown hair, and I decided to go to a brownish red color.  They mixed dark brown with red henna 3/4 to 1/4 ratio.  It does not look dyed, no hair dye color would ever look this natural.  And it covered my gray way better than dye ever did!  And no allergy!  Ok, people say it smells earthy.  Yeah, it does.  Smells just like the ends of cut flowers.  But, you can always add a few drops of lavender oil or something you like in the mix and that will help.  But that doesn&#x27;t really matter, it&#x27;s dealable.  And the results are breathtaking.  As for the woman saying her hair was a little crunchy, that goes away once you wash it after a few days.  Compared to what PPD in chemical dye does, that is a small sacrifice for something that is all natural and GOOD for you and your body.  I&#x27;m only taking the time to write this to let everyone know how wonderful this product it.  Don&#x27;t be afraid, if you&#x27;re looking to replace chemical dyes, this is a great way to do that.  It&#x27;s been 2 1/2 weeks and I still look at my hair every day in the mirror and marvel at how much I love it and how glad I am I found this and took the plunge. I will never use chemical dye again.</li>
    <li> After using Just for ___ to cover my grey hair for about 3 years, I started getting a severe allergic reaction to it. I also was using their mustache and beard color and was getting swelling around my lips ! I lucked out and googled the word henna for men, and this is the first product which caught my eye! I have used it both on my hair and my mustache and the results in both cases are spectacular! The grey is well covered on both cases, and the final color could not be more natural. The coloring process must be repeated a little more often that the old chemical dyes BUT the hair looks healthier and far more natural without the terrible itching and scabs and swelling that the chemicals gave me. As far as the \\&quot;brittle\\&quot; hair, this company also makes a wonderful conditioner which is suggested for use with the henna. I bought some and it is the best conditioner I have found and even lengthens the time between henna treatments. It seems to make each application last about a week longer before another application is needed. GREAT product! And FAR cheaper than those other chemical dyes. The smell reminds me of fresh mown hay which is stacked in a barn. Definitely \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; but natural and certainly not obnoxious.</li>
    <li> Saba botanical provides a great alternative to regular hair tints that come in a box. This product leaves hair healthy and voluminous. To get the best results one must use more water first and add the powder little by little. You want to create an even mixture (sort of like cake batter) in order to end up with an even color. If you use too much water, the shade won&#x27;t be as powerful.</li>
    <li> This worked so well. I hope they keep the price down and not go up. But this has solved my problem and it totally covered all of my grey hair. When applying you have to make for sure that you cover all of the hair you want to color because it doesn&#x27;t drip down and just color on it&#x27;s own. You should follow the directions and you have no problems. I am so happy with this color. It is so natural looking and finally no chemicals. I left the color on for 3 hours while working in my home. There are other brands but this, to me is one of the better Henna&#x27;s.  I have used Henna years ago for just a conditioner. At that time my hair was not greying. I had not thought of it for color. I was desperate to stop putting the other kinds of color and this is a permanent replacement for me. I went to a family gathering afterwards and got many compliments on my hair. I always color my hair one to two days before a function just to make for sure that it is all gone from my hair line.  This product didn&#x27;t leave the massive stain that the other name brands have on my hair line either. Have fun staying beautiful.</li>
    <li> It gives a beautiful shine and color to my hair.  I did a second one after this one with Chestnut Henna to get the right color.</li>
    <li> Your hair will NOT be like the woman on the package - she is a piece of clip art. I am pretty sure this product is just a repackaged bag of indigo and does not even contain the other ingredients on the label. Like all cheap brands of indigo, when you add hot water it releases a blue sheen, turns a chalky blue on your head, then green (and rubs off all over anything it touches) and then washes right out, leaving your hair gray again. You&#x27;d be better off grinding up some black chalk and rubbing it on your head instead for as natural as this looks. I have a photo of the results but don&#x27;t know how to submit it.</li>
    <li> Perfect every time...rich lasting color...worth the effort...</li>
    <li> If your allergic to hair dye like myself this product is for you.  I mixed this with indigo and applied it and let it stay on for a good 4 hours.  The color is great I even applied it to my eyebrows....  Arrived quickly and as advertised, I will be ordering more from this seller.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this but it was messy and a pain to prepare and apply to my hair! I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair at all! It did made a mess in the bathroom!</li>
