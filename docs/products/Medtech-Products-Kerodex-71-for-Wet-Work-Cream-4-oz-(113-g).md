      <li>Just about to order some more!</li>
      <li>Kerodex is amazing stuff.  </li>
      <li>and it was amazing.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for more than 15 years now, and I have shared it with many family and friends.</li>
      <li>It helps more than the prescriptions and my hands look much better.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product</li>
      <li>I just bought some more.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love that this company has continued making this product after all these years and never changed a thing.</li>
      <li>I can do so much more without the pain, itch or frustration.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing the difference you feel right away.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the most amazing product on the market that I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>It works as a great barrier for your hands when I work outside or indoors.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing and my hands are now soft and smooth...</li>
      <li>The doctor recommended a couple of really good over-the-counter products, which worked well enough for me for a couple of years.  </li>
      <li>This cream is super as a protection for pottery wheel work.</li>
      <li>It is a great barrier cream but the real plus is that it also heals cracked raw hands.</li>
      <li>I first started using it when I was working in ceramics and still use it now in my job as a baker.</li>
      <li>I tried this product as my friend suggested and it really does work!</li>
      <li>After years of having peeling skin on my hands (mostly on the webbing between my thumb and index finger), I finally had a doctor explain that what I needed was a \\&quot;water barrier\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It turns out that when I space out and forget to apply it, it doesn&#x27;t work by magically sitting on the desk next to me.  </li>
      <li>As a potter I spend many hours per day with my hands in water and wet clay and Kerodex has saved my skin from dying out and chapping.</li>
      <li>use it for a child with eczema/psoriasis and skin breakdown, and it&#x27;s very helpful - goes under his&lt;br /&gt;medicated ointments.  </li>
      <li>This saves me much discomfort.</li>
      <li>Have very sensitive skin that some soaps really effect.</li>
      <li>I work in a field that requires me to wash my hands frequently, which can lead them to dry out easily.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, my wifes hands were cracked and chaffed badly, she went to the Dermotoligist and he perscribed this product to her.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more when these run out, but the tubes are large and you don&#x27;t need to use much cream so it&#x27;ll be fairly economical - definitely cheaper than huge amounts of expensive hand</li>
      <li>If you are in Healthcare you have tow ash your hands a lot and Kerodex 71 helps tremendously with those of us that have dry cracked hands from often handwashing!</li>
      <li>I used this cream years ago and recently developed a hand rash when gardening.  </li>
      <li>My hands frequently crack and split</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for individuals that have to frequently wash their hands.</li>
      <li>The clay causes a lot of irritations and if the cream is used first, the dryness is minimal.</li>
      <li>Since the moisture barrier of my own hands was practically non-existent, I had to deal with this problem with creams and expensive prescription lotions.  </li>
      <li>This product was recommended to me by another RN who had been placed on disability because of ongoing problems with dry cracking hands from frequent washing.</li>
      <li>Also used a single layer of 71 for work with formaldehyde, with complete protection.</li>

<li> Also used a single layer of 71 for work with formaldehyde, with complete protection.</li>
<li> With constant hand washing and dry Colorado climate, our hands were so dry !  </li>
<li> I especially like it for all wet work and gardening!  </li>
<li> There is a dry Kerodex product too.</li>
<li> A smooth creamy base - you have to really rub it in, but</li>
<li> Naturally I wash my hands a lot which was causing my hands to rash and itch (and growing strange alien looking bumps).  </li>
<li> I later started finding other uses for it like preventing my hands from drying, Cracking and bleeding from working with my hands out doors and in wet environments for extended periods of time.</li>
<li> After the initial greasy feeling (slight, and less bad than many other products) goes away, it&#x27;s nearly undetectable and lasts for hours.  </li>
<li> I have had hand/skin problems for years as I do quite a bit of wet work.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Update Sept 2013: I bought 4 tubes a year ago and have just run out now - in total, given the application rate of 3-4 times a day throughout the season, it has lasted approx 11-12 whole months of working in cold water and salt\chemicals.</li>
<li> Helps him to have less burning and other reactions from his other meds.&lt;br</li>
<li> A few years ago, I was diagnosed with dermatitis and had to suffer from pomphlox blisters due to overexposure of moisture.  </li>
<li> At the time I purchased this I worked in latex gloves for 12 hour shifts and my hands started to show a slight allergic reaction to latex.</li>
<li> After a lot of expensive meds that didn&#x27;t clear it up, I decided to try this again.  </li>
<li> Follow the instruction and apply every few hours.</li>
<li> Thank you Medtech Products for being one of the few companies that makes a quality product that works and keeps on making it!</li>
<li> I have tried two different prescription products that are supposed to help but are not very effective and are expensive!</li>
<li> No more winter time Crypt Keeper hands!</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s especially helpful for protecting skin that reacts badly to being put into water.</li>
<li> something that I never experienced for years.  </li>
<li> Then about 3 months ago a friend with much worse skin problems (caused by his diabetes) recommended Kerodex 71.  </li>
<li> My hands would itch horribly, the areas between my fingers turned raw and there was little relief except for steroid creams.  </li>
<li> I work with my hands in cold water\saline\chlorine all day and was suffering badly from dryness\itching\dermatitis.</li>
<li> My hands were getting so bad</li>
<li> Kerodex 71 works like an invisible water repellent glove - a barrier against wetness.  </li>
<li> Using this to protect my hands has kept them from cracking and making me miserable all winter.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I suffer from Psoriasis on my hands and using this coupled with a lotion keeps my hands protected for 8hrs. It allows for my hands to heal while it protects. Cannot recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kerodex 71 and 51 for years now.  It works as a great barrier for your hands when I work outside or indoors. I just bought some more.</li>
    <li> What a great hand cream!!  I especially like it for all wet work and gardening!  I used this cream years ago and recently developed a hand rash when gardening.  After a lot of expensive meds that didn&#x27;t clear it up, I decided to try this again.  It helps more than the prescriptions and my hands look much better. There is a dry Kerodex product too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with my hands, especially in the winter.  My dermatologist recommended I try this and it was amazing.  Using this to protect my hands has kept them from cracking and making me miserable all winter.</li>
    <li> This cream is super as a protection for pottery wheel work. The clay causes a lot of irritations and if the cream is used first, the dryness is minimal.</li>
    <li> Best work cream you will ever own</li>
    <li> I used to use this product when I was  dental assistant...only had to use once in morning and again at noon.  All the hand washing didn&#x27;t cause my hands to get chapped...LOVE this product</li>
    <li> After years of having peeling skin on my hands (mostly on the webbing between my thumb and index finger), I finally had a doctor explain that what I needed was a \\&quot;water barrier\\&quot;.  The doctor recommended a couple of really good over-the-counter products, which worked well enough for me for a couple of years.  Then about 3 months ago a friend with much worse skin problems (caused by his diabetes) recommended Kerodex 71.  It was like the skies opened up and the angels sang. After the initial greasy feeling (slight, and less bad than many other products) goes away, it&#x27;s nearly undetectable and lasts for hours.  Meanwhile, it&#x27;s like wearing invisible waterproof gloves.    The only criticism I have of it is that you have to actually put it on, for it to work.  It turns out that when I space out and forget to apply it, it doesn&#x27;t work by magically sitting on the desk next to me.  Maybe the next generation of Kerodex will do that.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and its sister cream #71 for 30 years. It is a great barrier cream but the real plus is that it also heals cracked raw hands. I first started using it when I was working in ceramics and still use it now in my job as a baker. Best winter solution around.</li>
    <li> Just as I remembered it.</li>
    <li> A+++ Recommended by a co-worker...is as great as she said. Great product for anyone that has to wash their hands alot or works with water...Nurses, healthcare workers, carwash employees.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are both nurses and several years ago a co-worker introduced us to the miracle of Kerodex!  With constant hand washing and dry Colorado climate, our hands were so dry !  You put on the cream, rub it in and then run your hands under water to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the moisture locking lotion.  It&#x27;s truly amazing the difference you feel right away.  One tube last forever so the four pack that we order is handy as we can keep some at work and home and generously give away a tube to another nurse to get them hooked!</li>
    <li> At the time I purchased this I worked in latex gloves for 12 hour shifts and my hands started to show a slight allergic reaction to latex. I bought this at the suggestion of a nurse and applied it every day and after breaks before putting on the gloves and it seemed to work great. I later started finding other uses for it like preventing my hands from drying, Cracking and bleeding from working with my hands out doors and in wet environments for extended periods of time. I think it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 30 years. Have very sensitive skin that some soaps really effect. This saves me much discomfort.</li>
    <li> Kerosene 71 is the only product that helps keep my Eczema under control!  I have tried two different prescription products that are supposed to help but are not very effective and are expensive! Please keep making it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product now for over a year. I work in a field that requires me to wash my hands frequently, which can lead them to dry out easily. Kerodex works great to prevent chapping/chaffing of my hands. Each application for me lasts about 6-8 hours.</li>
    <li> This feels so good!  I&#x27;d heard about it 20+ yrs ago (!) but couldn&#x27;t find it.  Someone steered me to Kerodex again and I&#x27;m so happy to use it while working with clay.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Have been without it until I decided to look on Amazon for it. I am a retired Hair Dresser and always used this while I was working. My hands were getting so bad I decided to find this product again.</li>
    <li> If you are in Healthcare you have tow ash your hands a lot and Kerodex 71 helps tremendously with those of us that have dry cracked hands from often handwashing!</li>
    <li> I have had hand/skin problems for years as I do quite a bit of wet work.  My dermatologist told me to get this product and it is a lifesaver.  All my co-workers use it now and we are so grateful.  I have tried everything on the market and nothing works like this cream.  It&#x27;s not greasy, it is soothing to your skin immediately, and lasts for several hours before reapplying is necessary.</li>
    <li> BEST STUFF EVER FOR HANDS!</li>
    <li> This is by far the most amazing product on the market that I have ever used.  Kerodex 71 works like an invisible water repellent glove - a barrier against wetness.  A few years ago, I was diagnosed with dermatitis and had to suffer from pomphlox blisters due to overexposure of moisture.  My hands would itch horribly, the areas between my fingers turned raw and there was little relief except for steroid creams.  Since the moisture barrier of my own hands was practically non-existent, I had to deal with this problem with creams and expensive prescription lotions.  I went back to my dermatologist for refills and he actually recommended this.  I was not convinced that anything would work, but this cream has literally changed my life.  I can do so much more without the pain, itch or frustration.  I wish I had known about this sooner!!!</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders! As a potter I spend many hours per day with my hands in water and wet clay and Kerodex has saved my skin from dying out and chapping.</li>
    <li> I work with my hands in cold water\saline\chlorine all day and was suffering badly from dryness\itching\dermatitis. The Kerodex 71 is excellent, just follow the instructions to the letter and it works perfectly. I reapply every 3hrs on hands and forearms for best effect. Will definitely buy more when these run out, but the tubes are large and you don&#x27;t need to use much cream so it&#x27;ll be fairly economical - definitely cheaper than huge amounts of expensive hand cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Sept 2013: I bought 4 tubes a year ago and have just run out now - in total, given the application rate of 3-4 times a day throughout the season, it has lasted approx 11-12 whole months of working in cold water and salt\chemicals. One of the best product i have ever bought. Just about to order some more!</li>
    <li> My hands frequently crack and split and I could never find a product that would help.  This product is amazing and my hands are now soft and smooth...something that I never experienced for years.  I would recommend this product for individuals that have to frequently wash their hands.</li>
    <li> A smooth creamy base - you have to really rub it in, but it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;We use it for a child with eczema/psoriasis and skin breakdown, and it&#x27;s very helpful - goes under his&lt;br /&gt;medicated ointments.  Helps him to have less burning and other reactions from his other meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s especially helpful for protecting skin that reacts badly to being put into water.</li>
    <li> I am a housewife who&#x27;s baking, cooking, cleaning, playing with the dog all at the same time.  Naturally I wash my hands a lot which was causing my hands to rash and itch (and growing strange alien looking bumps).  Doctor recommended me this product when I was working in restaurant business years ago.  It coats and protects the hands.  Follow the instruction and apply every few hours.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by another RN who had been placed on disability because of ongoing problems with dry cracking hands from frequent washing. After using many prescription products, a dermatologist recommended Kerodex 71, and it worked great for her. I have been using it for more than 15 years now, and I have shared it with many family and friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my wifes hands were cracked and chaffed badly, she went to the Dermotoligist and he perscribed this product to her.  One week later there was no redness or cracking.  Excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Kerodex is amazing stuff.  Have cleared poison ivy using only a triple layering of 51, then 71, then 51, and had no problem. Also used a single layer of 71 for work with formaldehyde, with complete protection.</li>
    <li> Thank you Medtech Products for being one of the few companies that makes a quality product that works and keeps on making it! My friend was introduced to this back in the 70s while she was working as a hairdresser. She told me it saved her hands for years. One of my jobs involves cleaning, so I am constantly washing my hands. I tried this product as my friend suggested and it really does work! I was amazed! No more winter time Crypt Keeper hands! Hooray! I love that this company has continued making this product after all these years and never changed a thing. My friend says that even the packaging is still the same! I could not be happier with this purchase. Thank you Medtech and Amazon!</li>
