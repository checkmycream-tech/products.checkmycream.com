      <li>I feel better using this product since I probably inhale a lot when spraying all over my hair.</li>
      <li>I used it and love it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as great as I anticipated and the hair doesn&#x27;t look better by much applied.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to go longer between washing it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use very much, and it lasts a fair amount of time.</li>
      <li>THE FIRST TIME I ORDER THIS PRODUCT, I LOVED IT.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo i have used.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s an awesome dry shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo out there.</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo on the market!</li>
      <li>This product is the best dry shampoo that I have ever tried!</li>
      <li>And -- on top of everything -- it smells very fresh.</li>
      <li>However, after trying other brands I realized it&#x27;s not the best.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo on the market!!!</li>
      <li>Therefore it runs out very quickly and for the price</li>
      <li>I have fine, blond hair that looks greasy within 24 hours of washing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands, and this one wins.</li>
      <li>I PLACED AN ORDER FOR 2 LARGER CANS, AND HAVE NOT BEEN HAPPY ANY TIME I&#x27;ve USED IT</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have found, as it is not sticky, works really well, and is easily applied via aerosol.</li>
      <li>Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo is great for my hair!</li>
      <li>It stays looking good for several days.  </li>
      <li>So overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>and it was the most amazing dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo in the world as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many dry shampoos, and have yet to find one that I actually love and would buy again.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and smooth and I can easily run my fingers through it.</li>
      <li>My most favorite dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Both were effective at cleaning my hair quickly, but Klorane was overall nicer.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is the &#x27;butane&#x27; kind of smell, but that dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>Fresh smelling, absorbs oil well gives some volume..</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m really not crazy about the smell either...</li>
      <li>This sounds like a very nice and gentle dry shampoo when all it does is make your hair look drier and dirtier!  </li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s great for added volume in an updo and helps fixate or tame hair.</li>
      <li>Just okay, I have used other, better products.</li>
      <li>I work out a lot and have tried many dry shampoos for that after gym errands run or just a second day hair, looks too good to wash.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair which has always had to be washed daily.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to Vogue!</li>
      <li>Like it better than all the others - actually gives my hair body.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 40 and for the first time since I was a pre-teen, I can get by without washing.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the best dry shampoo on the market!!</li>
      <li>In order to get a clean look in your hair you have to use a considerable amount of this bottle.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and feeling clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this one is the best!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>This dry shampoo used to be my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo!</li>
      <li>After reading a ton of reviews, I decided to risk it and buy yet another one and had very high hopes for it.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re going to share with someone else it&#x27;ll run out fast</li>
      <li>It actually leaves my hair feeling clean, not greasy or oily or anything, without leaving flakes</li>
      <li>Only problem is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be very much in the can, so I go through it very fast.</li>
      <li>Not only that, but my hair curls/irons and holds style even better on the 2nd day.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I spray it on my dry clean hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra</li>
      <li>I have tried many dry shampoos but keep coming back to Klorane.  </li>
      <li>Gives me full volume, and does not leave my hair looking dry and lifeless.  </li>
      <li>Birchbox first introduced me to this wonder - and there&#x27;s no going back.</li>
      <li>On the third day, I just spray a bit of this dry shampoo along the visually greasy parts (around my part) for a refreshing &amp;#34;just washed&amp;#34; look.</li>
      <li>my to-go on busy mornings.  </li>
      <li>I was early to work</li>
      <li>usually, I have to wash my hair daily to restyle it, but I was able to restyle my hair with my flatiron in about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised (held out no hope, actually)</li>
      <li>when this Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo seemed to really make a difference when I had absolutely NO TIME to wash my oily hair!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brand of dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Susan Borth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m blonde and a busy nurse as well as being very picky when it comes to hair products, especially Dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>My new go-to dry shampoo spray.</li>
      <li>It clearly shows on the graphic that it&#x27;s buy 1 get second 50% off.</li>
      <li>We have also tried Tresemme, and this one is preferred because the scent is clean but not overpowering, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick feeling in your hair.</li>
      <li>It sometimes likes a slight white residue on hair that easily comes off with a little bit of water.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t do anything more than other much cheaper ones did.</li>
      <li>also has a clean, barely there scent, which is such a big improvement from all the other heavily scented dry shampoos on the market.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very unpleasant smell. Ick!!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised (held out no hope, actually) when this Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo seemed to really make a difference when I had absolutely NO TIME to wash my oily hair! Now, it doesn&#x27;t make it look like I just washed it, but when I am that desperate, ANY improvement is greatly appreciated. My hair looked better. I recommend this dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  No other dry shampoo compares.  I&#x27;ve purchased many less expensive ones and didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I could use this without washing my hair for probably a week.  Feels so good.  Great if you get a keratin treatment.  Only thing is you definitely have to brush it though after one minute, or it will look like you&#x27;ve sprayed white paint in your hair.</li>
    <li> Just okay, I have used other, better products. This one tends to leave a white powder in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t brush through and made my hair look very dull.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo on the market!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have found, as it is not sticky, works really well, and is easily applied via aerosol.</li>
    <li> It clearly shows on the graphic that it&#x27;s buy 1 get second 50% off. That&#x27;s not $27 dollars. It should be more like 22 and then charging shipping per unit on top of that... come on!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product through a Vogue magazine article. I found it on Amazon at a great price. I used it, and it works wonders! usually, I have to wash my hair daily to restyle it, but I was able to restyle my hair with my flatiron in about 5 minutes. This never happens! I was early to work and I was telling my friends because my hair looked like I had washed it and blew out my hair. This product is the best dry shampoo that I have ever tried! Thanks to Vogue!</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo used to be my favorite. However, after trying other brands I realized it&#x27;s not the best. In order to get a clean look in your hair you have to use a considerable amount of this bottle. Therefore it runs out very quickly and for the price it&#x27;s not worth it. Many other dry shampoos require a lot less product to get your desired look and cost much less. So overall it&#x27;s a good product but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the price and efficiency.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I am over in Afghanistan, and never know if I am going to get a shower the next day or not.  Plus, I am required to wear a hat some days, and sometimes not.  I have tried a number of other dry shampoos in the past, and they can leave me sticky or with a white residue that is hard to brush out.  This product does it all; spray it in and brush it out after 2 mins just like the bottle says.  The whtie powder brushes out along with any oil or dirt.  Gives me full volume, and does not leave my hair looking dry and lifeless.  Only thing I wish it had was a fragrence, but since it has none I can just add that to my routine.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo is great for my hair! I&#x27;m able to go longer between washing it and it still looks great!</li>
    <li> I like this dry shampoo a lot, but realized my hair is oilier than I thought and have since ordered the one with Nettle. We shall see!</li>
    <li> Love it! It adds volume and cleanses your hair. And -- on top of everything -- it smells very fresh. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This sounds like a very nice and gentle dry shampoo when all it does is make your hair look drier and dirtier!  Left a film in my hair and did not do the job I was looking for at all!  Suave is a better product than this!</li>
    <li> Love love love! I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this one is the best!&lt;br /&gt;This dry shampoo does double duty.&lt;br /&gt;1) it cleans your hair (just spray, let it absorb for a few minutes before brushing your hair)&lt;br /&gt;2) it gives your hair incredible body. I spray it on my dry clean hair. I&#x27;ve never had such thick looking hair! It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used.  It smells wonderful and leaves my hair looking fresh and clean.  I have some health issues and cannot always get my hair washed and dried.  Using Klorane keeps my spirits up.</li>
    <li> Love it!  my to-go on busy mornings.  It sometimes likes a slight white residue on hair that easily comes off with a little bit of water.  One of my must-have products on my bathroom shelf.</li>
    <li> but empties too soon I&#x27;ve used maybe 6-7 times and can is nearly empty, tho it does work great, smells good too.</li>
    <li> I feel better using this product since I probably inhale a lot when spraying all over my hair. Works well to absorb grease and doesn&#x27;t leave a gritty texture behind. It is a little white on my brunette hair, but I just brush a little and it blends in. I&#x27;ll probably order again even though it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
    <li> THE FIRST TIME I ORDER THIS PRODUCT, I LOVED IT. I PLACED AN ORDER FOR 2 LARGER CANS, AND HAVE NOT BEEN HAPPY ANY TIME I&#x27;ve USED IT.. iTS SITTING ON THE SHELF.....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as great as I anticipated and the hair doesn&#x27;t look better by much applied. However, it&#x27;s great for added volume in an updo and helps fixate or tame hair. I don&#x27;t like to use it in the morning when I&#x27;m running late for work and would rather wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dry shampoos but keep coming back to Klorane.  It is a little pricey, but you do get what you pay for.  It cleans your hair and adds volume to my thin flat hair.</li>
    <li> We have also tried Tresemme, and this one is preferred because the scent is clean but not overpowering, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick feeling in your hair. Both were effective at cleaning my hair quickly, but Klorane was overall nicer.</li>
    <li> I bought this not for cleansing my hair but for adding a bit of poof to my thinning hair. I read reviews that other women used it for that purpose, so I decided to try it. It works!</li>
    <li> Birchbox first introduced me to this wonder - and there&#x27;s no going back. I have thick, wavy, frizzy, dry hair, so I wash it just 2-3x per week to keep it from drying out. On the third day, I just spray a bit of this dry shampoo along the visually greasy parts (around my part) for a refreshing &amp;#34;just washed&amp;#34; look. It sprays out about the rate of hair spray - so be careful not to hold down the nozzle too long! Just a few 1 second-long taps in the needed areas will work wonders. Once you spray it on, leave it for a minute or two, and then work it in with your fingertips. It goes on white but disappears once you work it in. It leaves my hair silky and fluffy (not thick and weighted).</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an awesome dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Best I have used. but if you&#x27;re going to share with someone else it&#x27;ll run out fast and it&#x27;s definitely not cheap</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo. It actually leaves my hair feeling clean, not greasy or oily or anything, without leaving flakes everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep repurchasing these forever. This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a clean, barely there scent, which is such a big improvement from all the other heavily scented dry shampoos on the market. I love it!</li>
    <li> Only problem is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be very much in the can, so I go through it very fast. Like it better than all the others - actually gives my hair body. Just wish a can lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best dry shampoo on the market!! I work out a lot and have tried many dry shampoos for that after gym errands run or just a second day hair, looks too good to wash. Many dry shampoos have left my hair sticky or waxy feeling and my hair would still look dirty. One on the market even makes my hair hard and crust like-Eww!! I received Klorane in my Birchbox one month and it was the most amazing dry shampoo. Spray it in and comb through a few second later- you can&#x27;t even tell I have dry shampooed my hair!! My hair is soft and smooth and I can easily run my fingers through it. I love this dry shampoo! A must have!</li>
    <li> My most favorite dry shampoo. With a little brushing this shampoo disappears in my medium brown hair. It soaks up the oils and gives me &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; hair when I just don&#x27;t want to take the time to wash it. Also great for building body at the roots when styling.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair which has always had to be washed daily.  I&#x27;m 40 and for the first time since I was a pre-teen, I can get by without washing.  Not only that, but my hair curls/irons and holds style even better on the 2nd day.  This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite dry shampoo. I don&#x27;t need to use very much, and it lasts a fair amount of time. It leaves my hair soft and feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this dry shampoo several months ago.  I used it and love it.  I have purchased several can of this and will continue to use it.  My hair can be limp and life less looking, I spray this gentle dry shampoo and my hair looks like I have just washed it.  It stays looking good for several days.  I highly recommend this brand of dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Susan Borth</li>
    <li> Wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many dry shampoos, and have yet to find one that I actually love and would buy again. After reading a ton of reviews, I decided to risk it and buy yet another one and had very high hopes for it. Unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t do anything more than other much cheaper ones did. And I&#x27;m really not crazy about the smell either...</li>
    <li> My new go-to dry shampoo spray. This is very good, not heavy at all. The only drawback is the &#x27;butane&#x27; kind of smell, but that dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo out there. I have fine, blond hair that looks greasy within 24 hours of washing. I&#x27;ve tried many brands, and this one wins. The scent is not cloying, and it actually helps build volume. Great for updos. At this price for a two-pack, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo i have used.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind in your hair as others I have tried leave some white powder behind.  I have tried a few others to save, but I think I will be going back to Klorane.  It&#x27;s worth the extra</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo on the market!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo in the world as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I&#x27;m blonde and a busy nurse as well as being very picky when it comes to hair products, especially Dry shampoo. I&#x27;ve tried the sebastian dry clean shampoo, Dove, Victorias Secret and Tresemme dry shampoo brands. This beats them all. It is a very small can, however it lasts longer than you expect it to just by looking at the size. Fresh smelling, absorbs oil well gives some volume..what more can you want!?? Victorias secret is my next Fave after this if you don&#x27;t want to dish the cash though.</li>
