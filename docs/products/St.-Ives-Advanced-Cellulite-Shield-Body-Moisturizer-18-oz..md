### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very happy with this product!</li>
      <li>probably the best &amp; cheapest way to deal with that issue anyway.</li>
      <li>I was scraping out the inside of the bottle as best</li>
      <li>I read all the reviews and thought that this would be a good product, NOPE!!</li>
      <li>I was just telling my coworkers about this lotion and how I am REALLY impressed with it.</li>
      <li>Having said that, it is wonderful at what it does.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m amazed and happy that this cream has done what exercise can&#x27;t!!</li>
      <li>Awesome stuff.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>Perfect wording, perfect results, perfect everything.</li>
      <li>So I took to to the internet and was so glad to find it on Amazon!!!</li>
      <li>This stuff smells good, it moisturizes well, and with my diet and exercise I think it&#x27;s working for me!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but for cellulite.. find something else.</li>
      <li>Smells great too.  </li>
      <li>A great product.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was a great deal, but for what it does, I might&#x27;ve paid 15.</li>
      <li>Lol.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>I honestly noticed a difference after 1 day of use!</li>
      <li>In order to get the biggest bang for your buck and to see the best results the fastest, make sure you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, it lasts a good while.</li>
      <li>Works great as a hand and foot cream, too, and everything stays nice and moisturized overnight.</li>
      <li>B002UUT43W Nivea Good Bye Cellulite Serum, 2.5-Ounce Tube]]</li>
      <li>I am oh so proud that my review now gives this fabulous phenomenal cream FOUR 5 star ratings, and I hope the 5 stars keep coming!!</li>
      <li>And on top of all that, it smells great</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>(gotta love the differential pricing model!)</li>
      <li>They was talking about how great it worked and would made your legs smooth for your Valentine&#x27;s date.</li>
      <li>The smell of the product is amazing - citrus.</li>
      <li>This product has an amazing smell and it does tighten your skin.</li>
      <li>However, it does smell really nice</li>
      <li>It smells really nice though, which is why I gave it three stars.</li>
      <li>It feels nice on the skin, has a nice smell</li>
      <li>It smells great, very much like citrus, and my skin feels better than when I use Jergens or Vaseline brands.</li>
      <li>I should know better that anything at this price point is not going to work miracles on my cellulite :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using it in hopes that by doing so will diminish more, if not the rest of my cellulite.</li>
      <li>It does. :)</li>
      <li>But overall VERY SATISFIED!!</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure it will take some to tell.</li>
      <li>[This will draw more blood to the area you&#x27;re applying this to (assuming it&#x27;s legs and butt like me), helping reduce cellulite.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You are better off buying Jergens smoothing lotion.</li>
      <li>This is no miracle product though, and shouldn&#x27;t be substituted for a healthy lifestyle.</li>
      <li>I should have known better than to buy this item.  </li>
      <li>I have had better luck with the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>but, I like the lotion better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!..</li>
      <li>It is a must try and you will fall in love.</li>
      <li>You do have to vigorously put it on..since you&#x27;re expecting something more out of this lotion you have to follow the directions.</li>
      <li>On that note, I do continue to exercise and eat healthily</li>
      <li>I love it and make sure I keep purchasing it.</li>
      <li>It smells like a nice clean citrus as well</li>
      <li>love the scent of this lotion, I enjoy using it..</li>
      <li>I do have to say that the lotion does smell fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It made my thighs smooth however, I can just use lotion for that.</li>
      <li>but it does smooth it out for about 5-7 hours or so.</li>
      <li>And you can&#x27;t beat the fantastic price, $5.03 for an 18oz.</li>
      <li>and so I actually enjoy putting it on for the smell too.</li>
      <li>And it smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>I have used this twice a day for one week, so far so good my legs are looking smoother already by summer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super soft and feels amazing!</li>
      <li>, citrus-y without being overwhelming, a light, pretty scent.</li>
      <li>and I can already see a significant change.</li>
      <li>so I really can&#x27;t tell you if it is a spectacular success.  </li>
      <li>I am glad to have this product to battle the issue and would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s about the only good thing I got from it.</li>
      <li>I said it smells fantastic, right?</li>
      <li>And thanks to another review, I found out that in Walmart it is indeed cheaper, and when I bought it had free shipping.</li>
      <li>This helped smooth it out and had me ready to wear shorts all spring and summer.</li>
      <li>It really does sound like it works.  </li>
      <li>it also smells really nice, especially for summertime!</li>
      <li>Also it has a fresh citrusy smell.</li>
      <li>Note that right now it&#x27;s selling for about 15 bucks.</li>
      <li>I do see positive results!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for dry skin, but it does moisturize nicely.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love with it back on my first bottle.</li>
      <li>I thought I noticed improvement when I first started using it, but if I did then it&#x27;s gone now.</li>
      <li>Well, no, depending on the amount of cellulite you&#x27;ve got, but it will definitely look better than it did.</li>
      <li>Four weeks later, my thighs are baby-skin smooth, no longer dimpled all over the place, and several people have commented on how nice and lean my legs look.</li>
      <li>and WHY you have it in the first place.  </li>
      <li>It really works, within reason!  </li>
      <li>I recieved this stuff pretty fast, which is always a plus..</li>
      <li>I very highly suggest this product.</li>
      <li>I have really large thighs and alot of cellulite and my legs are so much firmer now.</li>
      <li>However, its not all that great for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used to apply it to my skin everyday, but I noticed it left a residue on my skin and had&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you really want to try this cream then go to wal mart</li>
      <li>Considering all the rave reviews, I was really looking forward to this being an answer to my cellulite problem.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much smoother my thighs and butt looked.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and smells excellent.:D</li>
      <li>I went through the whole container.</li>
      <li>but this has really helped and my boyfriend was admiring my legs and saying smooooooth.</li>
      <li>Besides, it seems to really moisturize the skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really reduce cellulite or the appearance of it, really.</li>
      <li>This product does absolutely nothing</li>
      <li>They all sound like they were written by the same person.</li>
      <li>If you are like myself and want something that will help your cellulite, don&#x27;t expect much from this cream.  </li>
      <li>I had used this product for about 2 years until I could no longer get in local drugstores; emailed St. Ives and was told  it was no longer available.  </li>
      <li>Really see results if used continually and on an on-going basis as the instructions say.  </li>
      <li>I have used it almost every day for the past two weeks and it is makes my skin super smooth!</li>
      <li>Im always willing to try new products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It moisturizes well but I didn&#x27;t notice a decrease in cellulite. Prob wouldn&#x27;t try again because I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my legs</li>
    <li> This stuff actually did what it said it would do. And this was before I lost a bunch of weight. And I was FAT. In a couple of weeks, my thighs and behind looked tighter and smoother, despite the otherwise chubby appearance of my form. The texture is rich and thick and it smells diviiiiiine. I was scraping out the inside of the bottle as best I could &#x27;cause now I can&#x27;t even FIND it anymore. My only guess is that it&#x27;s flying off the shelves before I can get some. Works great as a hand and foot cream, too, and everything stays nice and moisturized overnight. It seemed to perk up any part of my body on which I used it. Did I mention the scent? Yum. My husband was huffing me like airplane glue. (I think it&#x27;s a little thick for the face, but next time I get a bottle, I&#x27;ll try it.) I got mine I think at Wal-Dread, but for about the same price. I am not surprised that it seems like they jacked up the price in general, so get it here. Will your tush look like the chick on the bottle? Well, no, depending on the amount of cellulite you&#x27;ve got, but it will definitely look better than it did. Also, it lasts a good while. And it smells fantastic. I said it smells fantastic, right? It does. :)</li>
    <li> I was just telling my coworkers about this lotion and how I am REALLY impressed with it. I have been using it every morning after my shower for just about two weeks now and this morning had the thought in mind to check out my backside to see if I had noticed a difference. WOW! I couldn&#x27;t believe how much smoother my thighs and butt looked. I am very happy with this product! It smells like a nice clean citrus as well and so I actually enjoy putting it on for the smell too. I am not a chubby person but now that I turned 30 my body has been changing and that stubborn cellulite appeared. I am glad to have this product to battle the issue and would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a body moisturizer like it states but minus the cellulite shield part. I should know better that anything at this price point is not going to work miracles on my cellulite :-) However, I still continue to use this product(won&#x27;t be buying anymore of it when its gone) for the smell and it does leave my legs soft.... As for cellulite I am just going to continue working out-probably the best &amp; cheapest way to deal with that issue anyway.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and OMG big difference. I have really large thighs and alot of cellulite and my legs are so much firmer now. I am on my second bottle and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after this bottle. I do recommend and will be using again. This coupled with exercise is a win-win!! The only reason why i did not give this 5 stars is because i think it could be a little bit  more moisturizing other than that i love it</li>
    <li> Just purchased the same size bottle today at Walmart for $3.47. Have not tried the product yet but I will be back with any results or info in time. Don&#x27;t waste money for this online when you can find it cheaper elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I wish I could say that this lotion made my skin smoother and more firm.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough to see results.  I have fairly sensitive skin and this lotion caused me to break out in a rash everywhere that I applied it.  I&#x27;m so disappointed, because I was really optimistic about the results I&#x27;d see after reading all the great reviews.  I do have to say that the lotion does smell fantastic.  That may be the reason for my allergic reaction though.      Don&#x27;t let this review deter you from buying this product though.  It really does sound like it works.  Just beware if you have sensitive skin - maybe try it out on a small section of skin first instead of applying it all over your body like I did!</li>
    <li> I got this on a whim because I&#x27;ve been exercising and eating better and unfortunately was still unable to get rid of some of the more noticeable cellulite on my upper thighs.  I&#x27;m not saying this stuff performs miracles, however, I have been using it every day twice a day for about 6 weeks and I have seen noticeable results.  My skin is smoother and the bumpy cellulite is a lot less noticeable.  On that note, I do continue to exercise and eat healthily so I assume that helps too!  Oh, and drink a TON of water, because that does help also.  This stuff is not going to give you lipo but it is a small step in the fight against cellulite, and frankly, every little bit helps!  PS it also smells really nice, especially for summertime!</li>
    <li> Considering all the rave reviews, I was really looking forward to this being an answer to my cellulite problem. I&#x27;m only 24 but suffer from PMDD, and that in combination with having to take the Pill for the last 7 years or so means that my hormones are all over the place, and I was told that hormones can contribute to cellulite. I am not overweight but I do have lots of cellulite. I used this faithfully, at least once a day but usually twice a day, for about 5 months. I went through the whole container. I thought I noticed improvement when I first started using it, but if I did then it&#x27;s gone now. It will sometimes work if I pile on 2-3 layers of it, but those results do not last. Overall, I&#x27;m really disappointed. The smell of the product is amazing - citrus. That&#x27;s about the only good thing I got from it.</li>
    <li> Purchased in January and it was delivered a couple days later.  I thought the integrity of the lotion might&#x27;ve been compromised because it was delivered through freezing temps.  I had to let it &#x27;unthaw&#x27; if you will for a day because it was literally frozen when I opened the bottle.  So I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and I think my thighs look the same.  No change whatsoever.  Shame because I ordered two so I may try again because of the delivery snap foo.  I have had better luck with the [[ASIN:B002UUT43W Nivea Good Bye Cellulite Serum, 2.5-Ounce Tube]] but I figured I&#x27;d try something different.  Looks like I&#x27;ll be going back to Nivea.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. It doesn&#x27;t really reduce cellulite or the appearance of it, really. At least for me it didn&#x27;t. It smells really nice though, which is why I gave it three stars. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but for cellulite.. find something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been only using this stuff for 4 days and I can already see a significant change. I&#x27;ll usually put it on just after a shower before bed, but I hit my worst areas in the morning as well. My skin is getting firmer and less bumpy, plus I smell like I just got of a shower, plus my boyfriend loves how soft my skin feels!</li>
    <li> Im always willing to try new products. I was looking for my nivea cellite gel but the store was out. I saw this and tried it. The lotion makes your skin so soft and fabuulous. I put it all over my body and I swear It has helped with my weight loss. I love it and make sure I keep purchasing it. This will be my 3rd bottle. Everyone at work says what are you doing? Of course i work out but this has really helped and my boyfriend was admiring my legs and saying smooooooth. I do have to say this. The lotion is $3.69 at Walmart...sorry</li>
    <li> This product has an amazing smell and it does tighten your skin. The problem is that I am looking for a cellulite reduction cream and this cream did not do the trick. It made my thighs smooth however, I can just use lotion for that. If you are a slim person or carry little weight and would like to tighten your skin just a little bit, this is your product! If you are like myself and want something that will help your cellulite, don&#x27;t expect much from this cream.  p.s. If you really want to try this cream then go to wal mart it&#x27;s less than five dollars there.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 or 4 weeks now, and I have to admit it does seem to be helping my tummy. While it&#x27;s not perfect yet, I am working on it with exercise as well, and a skin brush along with this product. I do see positive results!</li>
    <li> I had used this lotion in the past to banish cellulite and dimples.  It really works, within reason!  You can&#x27;t sit on the couch eating potato chips and chugging soda.  You have to understand what cellulite is and WHY you have it in the first place.  Eating properly and getting moderate exercise will give you A+ results combined with this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product! Although I didn&#x27;t take a before and after picture to compare, I believe that it reduces the appearance of cellulite as promised. But of course, it works no miracle, it&#x27;s not like they will disappear, but it improves the looks.    Besides, it seems to really moisturize the skin. I try to also massage while spreading.    And thanks to another review, I found out that in Walmart it is indeed cheaper, and when I bought it had free shipping.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore-- and this stuff WORKS!!  Smells great too.  While it wont get rid of your cellulite (only diet and exercise will do that), it helps firm skin.</li>
    <li> I should have known better than to buy this item.  It is just a gimmick and it does not work.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;m a thin girl in my early 20&#x27;s, but noticed I had some cellulite. I honestly noticed a difference after 1 day of use! The price is very very affordable as well compared to other cellulite-reducing products. I definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 7 days so I really can&#x27;t tell you if it is a spectacular success.  However, it does smell really nice and it is no big deal to rub it on before you go to bed while watching t.v.   If there is some positive result, then that is just an extra bonus. But I&#x27;m sure it will take some to tell.</li>
    <li> This product does deliver.  I could see a noticable difference in the appearance of cellulite over a couple of weeks.  The reason why I gave it 4 stars is I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s organic.  If the product was organic, I would give it 5 stars.  But overall VERY SATISFIED!!</li>
    <li> I was researching cellulite creams as I&#x27;m in menopause and put on about 17 lbs which also means added cellulite on my butt and thighs. Not even exercise was taking it off, so I decided to give cellulite cream a shot and base my decision solely on the customer reviews. This St Ives cellulite cream was the only one that had three 5 star and one 4 star rating. None of the others came close so I ordered a bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m thrilled to say my cellulite has diminished by half!! I&#x27;m amazed and happy that this cream has done what exercise can&#x27;t!! I&#x27;m going to continue using it in hopes that by doing so will diminish more, if not the rest of my cellulite. My thinking is so long as there&#x27;s cellulite to remove it&#x27;ll keep working. And you can&#x27;t beat the fantastic price, $5.03 for an 18oz. bottle! All the other creams I researched cost 3-4 times as much and are only 6-10 oz bottles. I am oh so proud that my review now gives this fabulous phenomenal cream FOUR 5 star ratings, and I hope the 5 stars keep coming!!</li>
    <li> I recieved this stuff pretty fast, which is always a plus.. I began using it as soon as I got it. You do have to vigorously put it on..since you&#x27;re expecting something more out of this lotion you have to follow the directions. You have to basically massage. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and I&#x27;ve noticed tighter skin. I&#x27;m  only 130 pounds, but it&#x27;s all in my butt and thighs.. so you can imagine.. Lol. You can feel a tingling and cooling sensation soon after you put it on..   I&#x27;m just waiting to see my results in another week! It&#x27;s fabulous!.. and also smells amazinggggg.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using St. Ives Cellulite Sheild Moisturizer for well over a year now and I fell in love with it back on my first bottle. It does as it says it does-reduces (rather dramatically for an over the counter topical treatment) the appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  But be warned, this is NOT a weight loss item. It does NOT get rid of fat. What it does is smooths out the adipose tissue under your skin to make it lay smoother. By doing this it may lead to you appearing thinner, but you are not actually losing fat or weight. Again, it just redistributes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Having said that, it is wonderful at what it does. This is no miracle product though, and shouldn&#x27;t be substituted for a healthy lifestyle. In order to get the biggest bang for your buck and to see the best results the fastest, make sure you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1) Use this at least once a day to get full results after 2 weeks. (And massage the product in, dont&#x27; just rub a little bit)&lt;br /&gt;  2) Drink plenty of water throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;  3) Augment this with exercise. Even if it&#x27;s only 10 minutes a day of squats/lunges/etc. [This will draw more blood to the area you&#x27;re applying this to (assuming it&#x27;s legs and butt like me), helping reduce cellulite.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m not a heavy girl at 5 foot 1, 125lbs, but I do have cellulite. This helped smooth it out and had me ready to wear shorts all spring and summer. It&#x27;s a godsend, as long as you use it right. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and smells excellent.:D I very highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is to help diminish the cellulite. I have used it almost every day for the past two weeks and it is makes my skin super smooth! It&#x27;s super soft and feels amazing! The cellulite looks like it is less noticeable, but that might be in part to my skin is getting tanner which also helps. I would definitely recommend this lotion. It smells great, very much like citrus, and my skin feels better than when I use Jergens or Vaseline brands. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this twice a day for one week, so far so good my legs are looking smoother already by summer Ill be ready to throw on the bikini :) Also it has a fresh citrusy smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good, it moisturizes well, and with my diet and exercise I think it&#x27;s working for me! I bought the gel treatment as well but, I like the lotion better. Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> 5 star ratings are a bit suspicious. They all sound like they were written by the same person. Perfect wording, perfect results, perfect everything. Anyway, I bought it from Bad, Bath &amp; Beyond store, and used it religiously for about 2 months (ay least it&#x27;s big enough to last for a long time). It feels nice on the skin, has a nice smell but my cellulite is still \\&quot;looking me in the face\\&quot; as before; and I am a slim person who weight about 125 pounds, and 5&#x27;5&#x27; tall. So, as someone suggested, try something different for cellulite.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I was pretty skeptical because, well, if there were a way to get rid of cellulite, wouldn&#x27;t every woman be using it? But this did the trick. I am college age, and a little overweight, but I was having a huge problem with cellulite on my thighs, front and back. Four weeks later, my thighs are baby-skin smooth, no longer dimpled all over the place, and several people have commented on how nice and lean my legs look. Of course the lotion doesn&#x27;t get rid of the fat, but it definitely spreads it around and improves the overall look. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for dry skin, but it does moisturize nicely. And on top of all that, it smells great, citrus-y without being overwhelming, a light, pretty scent. Awesome stuff. Note that right now it&#x27;s selling for about 15 bucks. I bought it here are about 10, so I thought it was a great deal, but for what it does, I might&#x27;ve paid 15. (gotta love the differential pricing model!)</li>
    <li> When I read all the reviews on this product, I was instantly on a hunt for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent of this lotion, I enjoy using it.. However, its not all that great for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used to apply it to my skin everyday, but I noticed it left a residue on my skin and had&lt;br /&gt;a greasy texture if I used too much or put it on too frequently. I personally haven&#x27;t seen&lt;br /&gt;much of a difference. I like it and all--but the residue makes me use it a little less than&lt;br /&gt;recommended.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and thought that this would be a good product, NOPE!! You are better off buying Jergens smoothing lotion. This product does absolutely nothing and I used it on a daily basis. Don&#x27;t believe the hype this lotion is not worth your money.</li>
    <li> A great product.  Really see results if used continually and on an on-going basis as the instructions say.  I had used this product for about 2 years until I could no longer get in local drugstores; emailed St. Ives and was told  it was no longer available.  So I took to to the internet and was so glad to find it on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Not only does this lotion make my skin soft, it does exactly what it says it does - it makes the cellulite much less noticeable and my skin ends up feeling smooth and tight the morning after I put it on. I&#x27;m 21, and while my cellulite isn&#x27;t that horrible, it still makes me self conscious. For anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay outrageous prices to get rid of their cellulite, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the cream for  US $15 and now shows US $129, maybe there is a mistake</li>
    <li> I saw this for the 1st time on the today show for valentine&#x27;s day a few years ago.  They was talking about how great it worked and would made your legs smooth for your Valentine&#x27;s date. I saw it at our Walmart and was going to give it a try.  It works. I want say it will make cellulite go away forever but it does smooth it out for about 5-7 hours or so. For these I will never go a summer in short or swim suit without it.  The down side it has gotten hard to find. I went today to my Walgreens to see if they can order it. If not I will get it off Amazon because I will not go a summer without it. It is a must try and you will fall in love.</li>
