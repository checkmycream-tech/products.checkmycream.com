      <li>I will always use this conditioner as it is the best quality that I have ever found.  </li>
      <li>The product I ordered was sold by Beauty Perfect and fulfilled by Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Great &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; and smell.  </li>
      <li>It works great on my curly hair.</li>
      <li>As always this is a great product and a value you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
      <li>Not too oily, smells great.</li>
      <li>Great I swim slot and my hair is</li>
      <li>Thought it would work great...</li>
      <li>It still works great for curly hair, but if it had that wonderful Patchoulli-like scent that I fell in love with, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell too but nothing overpowering.</li>
      <li>All good things to say about this product.</li>
      <li>and I was delighted to find it online</li>
      <li>I immediately washed my hair again, applied the authentic product and got the great results I am used to.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
      <li>LOVE this Momo Conditioner!</li>
      <li>Great for fine baby hair in children.  </li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>It is rich and feels great.</li>
      <li>but it has a VERY strong fragrance, which as a guy</li>
      <li>Great stuff and worth the money.</li>
      <li>and this is the best conditioner I have found so far.  </li>
      <li>I tried this as a sample given at the Gramercy Park Hotel and it&#x27;s by far The BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used (in that it leaves hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many great, authentic beauty products at great prices from Amazon, but this was definitely not one of them.</li>
      <li>not what I used to with the Love Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I have purchased Momo shampoo and conditioner many times through Amazon and licensed salons</li>
      <li>I love the way this conditioner smells and how well it moisturizes my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>My purchases through Amazon have been hit and miss with regards to authentic unaltered conditioner.</li>
      <li>Many years ago, a hairdresser suggested I use this product, and I have been ever since.  </li>
      <li>Now, I think I like it better than the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Should have stuck with Love.</li>
      <li>Another plus - I dont use hair spray any more - my curls sit for 2 days without any styling products.</li>
      <li>I use a combination of Momo with Vegetable Miracle and I love them both.</li>
      <li>You must know I love this product as I keep ordering it in the jumbo container,</li>
      <li>Customer for life :)</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>My hair is healthy, strong, and shiny because of the Momo conditioner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fortunately I was able to return this for a full refund.</li>
      <li>And don&#x27;t be surprised if it is altered and doesn&#x27;t par up to real authentic stuff.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it</li>
      <li>I alternate the two and my hair always smells and feels great.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair shining and smooth and&lt;br /&gt;moisturized</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good and natural, but I was not blown away by it.</li>
      <li>It is all natural, and it makes my hair full and it holds curl!!!</li>
      <li>The products are very natural and have nice clean smells rather than floral or fruity,</li>
      <li>It works wonderfully for my thick, curly, sometimes prone to being frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m very familiar with what the real deal is.</li>
      <li>I should have known better but decided to try this larger size at such a great price.</li>
      <li>I do like all natural products, and this is not, but I still haven&#x27;t found a better conditioner.</li>
      <li>so soft love e</li>
      <li>It has helped my hair tremendously after going brought my first bottle.</li>
      <li>, it moisturizes very well and the scent is clean and earthy.</li>
      <li>This large quantity somehow doesn&#x27;t have the beautiful smell that the small bottles</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t speak for other sellers, but what I received was either NOT an authentic, unadulterated Davines product or was an expired product.</li>
      <li>I am going to try Love shampoo and conditioner next!!</li>
      <li>Glad my hair didn&#x27;t suffer damage - who knows what&#x27;s actually in this bottle!!!</li>
      <li>Much smarter to buy in bulk!</li>
      <li>I love the way this conditioner keeps up my hair, especially when used in combination with one of the Davines styling products after washing.</li>
      <li>I always have two of the large bottles on hand, and just pour (well, it doesn&#x27;t really pour)</li>
      <li>I lean towards thinking the real stuff was mixed with a cheap conditioner because the color of this product was somewhat marbled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In this case you really get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Approved by the whole family.  </li>
      <li>A little pricey but worth it!!!</li>
      <li>Have used both the shampoo and conditioner, I love these products, won&#x27; t use any other products on my hair.</li>
      <li>Already a fan of the Davines NouNou pak, I wanted a lighter product better suited for daily conditioning, and this definitely does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do add some water to it (25%) which cuts down on the oil even less and allows me to go longer w/o washing my hair and keeps it looking great.</li>
      <li>More Tears\\&quot;, \\&quot;Mustela\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Aveeno\\&quot;.......just to name a few.</li>
      <li>I have trouble keeping the shine and moisture in my hair after coloring, this product was introduced to me in a top Chicago salon</li>
      <li>Live it with the momo shampoo</li>
      <li>and I live in AZ</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic conditioner, especially when used as a deep conditioner once a week.  </li>
      <li>hair is naturally curly yet fine, and color-treated so prone to getting dried out.</li>
      <li>Pros- makes your hair soft, don&#x27;t need to use a lot per application.</li>
      <li>What I ordered came direct from Amazon</li>
      <li>Their products are not cheap, but when you find the right ones for your hair, they are worth every extra penny!</li>
      <li>I have really dry, coarse hair, and I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s somewhat expensive, it is so thick, that I add filtered water to it, shake it up and its a perfect consistency.  </li>
      <li>It requires VERY little to do the job as well, so this huge bottle will last close to forever.</li>
      <li>but she is learning to keep eyes closed until I can rinse her face off really well.</li>
      <li>I use this conditioner religiously, it makes my hair extremely soft and workable.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling dry and not moisturized although it feels very soft in the shower.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Fortunately I had half a tub of real product to compare it with.</li>
      <li>This is not an inexpensive line of hair product and a perfect way for companies to make $$$ by removing a portion on to refill with crap in order to sell for less than retail.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this conditioner and have usually purchased it from my hairdresser at $28 for a small tub. I should have known better but decided to try this larger size at such a great price. What I ordered came direct from Amazon so I can&#x27;t speak for other sellers, but what I received was either NOT an authentic, unadulterated Davines product or was an expired product. I lean towards thinking the real stuff was mixed with a cheap conditioner because the color of this product was somewhat marbled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I had half a tub of real product to compare it with. What I received from Amazon was a different color, texture, and scent than what I purchased from my hairdresser. Most importantly, it left my hair feeling terrible when I tested it out. I immediately washed my hair again, applied the authentic product and got the great results I am used to. I&#x27;ve purchased many great, authentic beauty products at great prices from Amazon, but this was definitely not one of them. In this case you really get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I was able to return this for a full refund. Glad my hair didn&#x27;t suffer damage - who knows what&#x27;s actually in this bottle!!!</li>
    <li> I will always use this conditioner as it is the best quality that I have ever found.  I have fine hair but a lot of it and I live in AZ therefore my hair tends to get very dry. Great stuff and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a sample given at the Gramercy Park Hotel and it&#x27;s by far The BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used (in that it leaves hair the softest and smoothest) but it has a VERY strong fragrance, which as a guy I do not want or need.  Therefore, I removed one star from my review.  It requires VERY little to do the job as well, so this huge bottle will last close to forever.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic conditioner, especially when used as a deep conditioner once a week.  I have really dry, coarse hair, and I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> A salon I used to go to in Emeryville uses this brand. I usually cant run my fingers through my hair when its dry, and after washing I have to carefully and painstakingly comb my hair with a wide tooth comb. The first time the stylist washed my hair with this, she combed through my wet hair with her fingers, in just a few seconds. i have been hooked ever since then! I use this conditioner religiously, it makes my hair extremely soft and workable. I have no breakage, compared to handfuls of hair before I used Momo. Another plus - I dont use hair spray any more - my curls sit for 2 days without any styling products. LOVE this Momo Conditioner! Customer for life :)</li>
    <li> Great price! Much smarter to buy in bulk! My mom swears this is the best conditioner out there! She wanted it but found this size for almost the same price as it&#x27;s smaller counterpart!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have very dry colores hair that is a bit frizzy. This calms it down and also feels like it is repairing past damage. And it&#x27;s shiny!</li>
    <li> I hate it.  It leaves my hair feeling dry and not moisturized although it feels very soft in the shower.  It&#x27;s also pretty thin and runny not what I used to with the Love Conditioner.  Should have stuck with Love.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this by a hairdresser friend.  It&#x27;s good and natural, but I was not blown away by it.</li>
    <li> I use a combination of Momo with Vegetable Miracle and I love them both. I alternate the two and my hair always smells and feels great. The products are very natural and have nice clean smells rather than floral or fruity, neither of which I like.</li>
    <li> non greasy.  Great &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; and smell.  Approved by the whole family.  Great for fine baby hair in children.  No tangles here!</li>
    <li> At last, I seem to have found a conditioner I can use regularly that helps keep my hair moisturized and thick without being weighed down and oily. Already a fan of the Davines NouNou pak, I wanted a lighter product better suited for daily conditioning, and this definitely does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally curly yet fine, and color-treated so prone to getting dried out. I love the way this conditioner keeps up my hair, especially when used in combination with one of the Davines styling products after washing. Their products are not cheap, but when you find the right ones for your hair, they are worth every extra penny!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.  It works great on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great I swim slot and my hair is so soft love e this especially if you have dry hair due to sun or dying.</li>
    <li> Not very conditioning. Thought it would work great...</li>
    <li> This large quantity somehow doesn&#x27;t have the beautiful smell that the small bottles Loews Hotel puts in their rooms has.  It still works great for curly hair, but if it had that wonderful Patchoulli-like scent that I fell in love with, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> You must know I love this product as I keep ordering it in the jumbo container, best buy. Keeps my hair shining and smooth and&lt;br /&gt;moisturized even in the Arizona summer heat!</li>
    <li> Have used both the shampoo and conditioner, I love these products, won&#x27; t use any other products on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! Not too oily, smells great. I do add some water to it (25%) which cuts down on the oil even less and allows me to go longer w/o washing my hair and keeps it looking great. Amazon has been the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Quality item.  Thank you.  Klara</li>
    <li> I wish it would have said that I needed to get a pump for it, since I was only buying it for myself and not a salon.</li>
    <li> I have trouble keeping the shine and moisture in my hair after coloring, this product was introduced to me in a top Chicago salon and I was delighted to find it online, it moisturizes very well and the scent is clean and earthy.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 4 and a half and has had VERY thin hair and has never been longer than 2 inches and you could always see her scalp because of how stringy it was.  After 2 weeks of use (every day washings) I am noticing her scalp is covered in thickening hair.  It is still only 2 inches but it&#x27;s not as stringy. She complains about burning eyes but she is learning to keep eyes closed until I can rinse her face off really well. I will update after a few monthes.  We also use the conditioner from this same line. We have tried EVERYTHING on the market here in the states and nothing has worked even the Paul Mitchel \\&quot;No More Tears\\&quot;, \\&quot;Mustela\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Aveeno\\&quot;.......just to name a few.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair and this is the best conditioner I have found so far.  It moisturizes without weight or making hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.. It leaves my hair hair silky and manageable. It is highly concentrated and requires very little to do the trick. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Just fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have purchased Momo shampoo and conditioner many times through Amazon and licensed salons so I&#x27;m very familiar with what the real deal is. My purchases through Amazon have been hit and miss with regards to authentic unaltered conditioner. When purchasing 8oz, it is always received sealed by Davines. However, when purchasing the 33oz, be very careful. And don&#x27;t be surprised if it is altered and doesn&#x27;t par up to real authentic stuff. This is not an inexpensive line of hair product and a perfect way for companies to make $$$ by removing a portion on to refill with crap in order to sell for less than retail. Extremely disappointing. You will notice the difference by the altered color, smell, and of course the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect when it is used.&lt;br /&gt;Since it is not allowed to review based on seller or purchase but rather by the product itself, I must rate 1 star overall.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo conditioner I have ever used. It is all natural, and it makes my hair full and it holds curl!!! I am going to try Love shampoo and conditioner next!!</li>
    <li> Many years ago, a hairdresser suggested I use this product, and I have been ever since.  Every once in a while I try another product, and always end up back to using Momo. for dry hair.  It works wonderfully for my thick, curly, sometimes prone to being frizzy hair.  I think it might be too heavy with other hair types.  Even though it&#x27;s somewhat expensive, it is so thick, that I add filtered water to it, shake it up and its a perfect consistency.  I always have two of the large bottles on hand, and just pour (well, it doesn&#x27;t really pour) some product into the empty bottle, and add water to that.  This way, I get at least twice as much product out of it.  I do like all natural products, and this is not, but I still haven&#x27;t found a better conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love the way this conditioner smells and how well it moisturizes my hair and scalp. Live it with the momo shampoo</li>
    <li> The product I ordered was sold by Beauty Perfect and fulfilled by Amazon.  The lid was unsealed and was not even screwed on tightly thus the product spilled inside the box.  What a mess!</li>
    <li> I started using Davines Energizing Shampoo a couple years ago, and I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try their conditioner. The Momo conditioner is green, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. It is amazing. Now, I think I like it better than the shampoo. My hair is healthy, strong, and shiny because of the Momo conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Pros- makes your hair soft, don&#x27;t need to use a lot per application. Cons- A little pricey but worth it!!!</li>
    <li> All good things to say about this product. It is rich and feels great. Pleasant smell too but nothing overpowering. It has helped my hair tremendously after going brought my first bottle. On my second now. And just in time for spring.</li>
    <li> As always this is a great product and a value you can&#x27;t beat. You can save over 40% from a salon purchase, why wouldn&#x27;t you buy this way?</li>
