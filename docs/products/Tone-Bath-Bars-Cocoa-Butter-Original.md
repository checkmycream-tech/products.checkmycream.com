    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tone soap for years and have been very disappointed in being unable  to find it in the grocery store lately.  It is very nice for people who have dry skin, because of the cocoa butter it contains.  My husband was allergic to many soaps - this is one of the few he could use.  He especially liked it because it did not have perfume as so many other soaps.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great soap cleans and softens the skin.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and Product was as described. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Act to remove Money from Politics and Move to Amend.</li>
    <li> For my wife, she loves it, cannot find local.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and now it seems more difficult to find in the regular stores.  I loved finding that I could order 8 bars at a great price through Amazon.  I am highly allergic to many bath products but not to this one.</li>
    <li> ...love the feel...love the smell...love the suds.</li>
    <li> Tone provides moisturizing but is not greasy.  I have used it for years and love the multi-pack that you can&#x27;t find in stores.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this soap is one of the only soaps that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It is a bar of soap. It is great smelling. It cleans well. Not much else to say except we love the stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tone soap for decades, on the long-ago recommendation of a dermatologist.  It used to be readily available in supermarkets, but no longer, it seems.  Fortunately I was able to order it through Amazon, which I will continue to do.</li>
    <li> The only source of the bath-soap I have used for decades, since all my local stores have stopped carrying on their shelves.</li>
    <li> Wonderful,  this product  is awesome. It really does beautifully.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap by far.  The soap eluded the store shelves for years.  It has popped up in only one local store I know of, and now Amazon brings it to my door.  The soap is a bit pricey so I will shop for the most competitive price.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted.  This soap is not readily available in my residence area.  It&#x27;s far more convenient to order through Amazon than it is to go from place to place physically and telephonically in hopes of finding the product. I&#x27;ve used Tone soap for a long time and would certainly recommend it if asked.</li>
    <li> I was very happy that I was able to purchase this soap on amazon, since they&#x27;re are sold in limited stores now.  I love this soap and so does my husband. Glad that I was also able to get them in a big pack and a good price.</li>
    <li> This soap works great and isn&#x27;t overly smelly like most other soaps. It is hard to find locally, so I&#x27;m glad to be able to order it here.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, Fast shipping.  Will order again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This soap is hard to find in my area. Great sudsing, great perfume, great cleaning, mild moisturizing. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap my family will use and it is sometimes HARD to find.  Got it here, in quantity, and we are happy campers. I mean bathers; sorry!</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding this soap after the stores stop carrying it but a chance and found it online.  It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and soen&#x27;t dry out my skin as much as other soaps.</li>
    <li> The only soap I can use.</li>
    <li> I love cocoa butter tone I&#x27;m so pleased I found it on Amazon it is no longer on store shelves thank you</li>
    <li> Not only is the price reasonable, but it&#x27;s nice to see that this product is available on Amazon, because it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find it in local stores.  We like the moisturizing qualities of this bath soap and its pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> We noticed that you can no longer find this anywhere in the stores!  Has always been our favorite soap, mild, smells nice, moisturizing.  So, I decided to see if it was on Amazon and sure enough, there it was!  Thank you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I have to use tone because other soaps break me out. The cocoa butter one is best for sensitive skin. Also it does not seem to dry out my skin like other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally once ordered the Tone clay bars and I broke out in hives so be careful that you get the cocoa butter ones.</li>
    <li> i used tone soap when the kids were young . for some reason i couldn&#x27;t fine tone bar soap on the selfs, so we started using olay soap. i had a fight with cancer. i won but my treaments scared my skin and darken it i knew what i needed so amazon here i come, found what i needed and yes it still works !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not an over whelming smell, and the soft, smooth lather is very nice.  This is a good buy.  Try it!</li>
