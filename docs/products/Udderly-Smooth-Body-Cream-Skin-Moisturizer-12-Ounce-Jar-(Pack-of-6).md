<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> MUST BUY!!!!  It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being overly emollient.  It absorbs into your skin, and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel depleted of moisture after washing your hands again.  This was recommended by an oncologist, and it was the best recommendation to-date!  I bought some cotton gloves and cotton booties to moisturize my hands and feet at night.  This is sold at CVS, but recommend buying in bulk on amazon since it goes pretty fast in the stores.</li>
    <li> Ok i read the reviews here after having bought a small tube of Udderly Smooth Udder Cream at the dollar store and was so impressed I wanted more.  I read the reviews here which the majority of which refer to UDDER cream.  This is BODY cream not the udder cream i purchased at the store!!  (I even skipped over the name of the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While its a great cream it is NOT the udder cream i wanted.  I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll find a use for this granted but when reading all the reviews which refer to Udder cream it is confusing. The list of ingredients is different and this cream is far too heavy for the face : /&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read carefully. Don&#x27;t get confused like i did : /</li>
    <li> Great for softening hands and feet, and seems to have some healing properties as well. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This is a great body moisturizer and wel worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to anyone that is looking for a great skin care product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Been using this cream for years.  Haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great for both hands and feet!</li>
    <li> This is the most effective moisturizer and the only one that works during the winter.</li>
    <li> I have bought this 12oz body lotion at Walmart for $3.5... Don&#x27;t be fooled!&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent labour lotion too...</li>
    <li> Works on dry, cracked skin better than any thing I have tried. It does not smell and is a white cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for years and ordered it online as it&#x27;s hard to find - usually it&#x27;s in the first aid section of stores.  It has no alcohol in it at all which is rare for a moisturizer and it hydrates better than anything else.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of knee surgery and once the incisions are healed, Udderly Smooth really helps the scar lines as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also keep some of the Udder Balm in my first aid basket as it&#x27;s perfect for helping heal burns and cuts.</li>
    <li> I always liked this product but have now become more concerned about parabens, so be aware that this is not paraben free.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m not aging because of this lotion. Is that crazy? ABSOLUTELY but none the less this stuff works.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It is great for dry skin!</li>
    <li> This is the only product in years of trying different products that works to keep cracks from forming during the winter.   The cold and dry conditions that used to produce bloody cracks no longer occur due to this product.   And it is very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Greetings all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking into Udderly Smooth Udder Cream to use on our family cow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was astonished to discover the variety of chemicals listed as ingredients in Udderly Smooth Udder Cream products.  The following list comes for the Udderly Smooth Udder Cream web site itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deionized water,&lt;br /&gt;stearic acid,&lt;br /&gt;Peg-2 Stearate,&lt;br /&gt;propylene glycol,&lt;br /&gt;isopropyl myristate,&lt;br /&gt;dimethicone,&lt;br /&gt;lanolin oil,&lt;br /&gt;mineral oil,&lt;br /&gt;triethanolamine,&lt;br /&gt;allantoin,&lt;br /&gt;methylparaben,&lt;br /&gt;propylparaben,&lt;br /&gt;fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Human skin readily absorbs substances placed on the skin.  Note that there are two \\&quot;parabens\\&quot; listed in the ingredients.  These are preservatives with a link to cancer (Google \\&quot;paraben cancer\\&quot; and evaluate for yourself).  In fact, there are only two ingredients listed that I would allow to touch my cow&#x27;s skin--much less mine: water and lanolin.  I am not trying to scare anyone, but an awareness of what you put on (and in) your body is important.  Please do your own research, and then make an informed choice on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is soft skin from products like this worth the potential of long-term, serious health problems?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Udderly Smooth&#x27;s web site (see FAQs), Trader Joe&#x27;s has removed this product from their shelves.</li>
    <li> I bouhgt this product. thought it would be great. Was using it for about a week on my face and arms. Now my face feels dry, itchy and has bumps like an alergic reation.       Not going to finish using this, maybe good for feet only.</li>
    <li> I already knew that I loved uderly smooth as I have purchased from a pharmacy in the past.  I work construction and my hands get very dry almost daily.  This is, to date, my favorite product to fix my dry hands and I enjoy the smell.  Buying the six pack is almost half off from what I was paying when buying individual cans.</li>
    <li> I was already familiar with this product and really like it. Unfortunately, one of the jars arrived broken so some product was lost.</li>
    <li> UDDER CREAM is a great product for your hands or any part of your body. Non-greasy and makes your skin feel moist. Not just for womem but also for men who work outside or on cars.  Takes care of those dry and rough hands.  Use it at night and before going to bed to help heal your skin. Great product and I get to make jokes about rubbing cream on my udder!</li>
    <li> My local Trader Joe&#x27;s no longer sold this and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I was so happy to find this online. I love this cream. No smell, not greasy and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this cream by a volunteer at my school. She had purchased it locally but then the store stopped carrying it. I then was delighted to find it via Amazon at reasonable prices. My husband and son both like it due to the pleasant non overpowering smell and the fact it really does make skin smoother. I won&#x27;t buy anything else now, because this is the best for dry skin and feet. Been using this product for over three years now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  this product for years and truly love it! It is not greasy and totally helps with dry skin!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! I was worried about using a tub but I quickly realized it was better as I can control the amount taken out and I can use less! It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t have an annoying fragrance and really keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizing lotion</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001ET78L0 Udderly Smooth Udder Cream Skin Moisturizer, 12-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)]] While looking for some books, I stumbled upon this cream.  We used to buy it, of all places, at a horse company.  Some told my daughter about it and we jumped on it for our feet.  It works.  The store closed and we never found it before Amazon.  I ordeded the 6 pack and that was a couple of weeks ago.  I have two jars left.  My family helps themselves to it and are overjoyed that I found it.  It is much cheaper than what we had to pay.  Buy some and see for yourself, but don&#x27;t buy it all.  I will need to order again very soon.  Very good place to shop.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this cream is the best stuff on the market. The price and shipping is great. My whole family uses it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched to this product after years of using other body lotions.  It keeps my skin smooth and protects from bad weather and winter-dry itching.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly great. (Of course, back when Trader Joe&#x27;s had it for only $2.99 a jar, it was Spectacular.) If you shave with a blade, this is hands down, the best-ever stuff to use, especially if you can&#x27;t pre-soak your face with hot water. The blade just glides over all those sensitive spots that usually get cut. It&#x27;s also excellent for other parts of the body, and can be used to relieve various forms of personal discomfort.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin on my arms. This is the best at smoothing it out. Little odor so it doesn&#x27;t mess with perfume or cologne. Sinks in quickly, but not too quick. Lasts through a hot tub session to protect dry skin. Moove out your old creams! This one rises straight to the top!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell. no scent. But best of all it leaves no trace. No grease. No residue....And this price is 40% less than CVS, but that shouldn&#x27;t surprise you--everything is...note my name is from a former review...not apply here.</li>
    <li> My skin is near-reptilian in dryness, so I&#x27;ve made a study of many different moisturizers on the market.  \\&quot;Udder Cream\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t bad, but neither was it the answer to my problems.    If you are sensitive to scented lotions this is probably not for you. The product description claims a \\&quot;light fresh fragrance\\&quot; and indeed the fragrance is light compared to many of the in-your-face scented products on the market. Just don&#x27;t get lulled into thinking there is no scent.  It&#x27;s there and is the primary reason I will not purchase this product again.    It is a decent moisturizer.  I used it primarily as a hand creme and it performed well enough though it didn&#x27;t have the staying power as some other dedicated hand cremes I&#x27;ve used.    Overall, though, there are better choices.  I can think of numerous hand cremes that are truly unscented and hold up better over time -- Handshield, Aveeno hand cream, Eucerin and Cetaphil to name a few.  For general body use, I&#x27;d recommend the above-mentioned brands along with the other dry skin standbys like Aquaphor.    Finally, I couldn&#x27;t help but be suspicious of the labeling. The product is labeled for veterinary use.  I understand that is ostensibly the original use, and it&#x27;s cute and all, but one wonders why it&#x27;s so important to market a misbranded cosmetic.    Not a bad choice if you don&#x27;t mind the scent and are amused by the gimmick.  Otherwise, there are lot of other options out there that may work better for you.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream.  It is the only thing I have ever found that actually helps keep my hands from cracking and bleeding in the winter-time.  My hands work hard and long every day.  This cream doesn&#x27;t make them feel greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t give off any noxious perfume/odor. It simply works.  Best of all, it is a bargain! Each jar costs less than $4.00 at Wal-Mart!  I keep a jar next to the sink in the kitchen and bathrooms, also on my dresser and even in the glovebox of the car.  Last year, I gave a jar as a Christmas gift to all my friends and family, and now, they are all &#x27;hooked&#x27; on this cream. Every once in a while, you catch a break.  This cream is mine!</li>
    <li> We LOOVVVE this stuff. My husband can&#x27;t live without it, especially during winter, we both dry up and I get dish-pan hands so bad they hurt but neither of us want anything greasy. A real skin healer and soother without the fuss.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes,I bought 6 jars, my son works as a stagehand and taking them apart was tearing his hands up. This product worked so well, he started using it on his feet. He loves it and told his partners about it.&lt;br /&gt;I have scleroderma and use it on my hands and feet also. It is healing and soothing.  My fingers look better than they did before I got Udderly Smooth Udder Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Lynell</li>
    <li> This hand cream has been a favorite of seamstress and people who get small cuts and scrapes.  It seams to have a healing property and it does get rid of dry skin.  It is not oiley or sticky.</li>
    <li> It really moisturizes my skin and stays on my skin for a while that you don&#x27;t have to apply often.</li>
    <li> There are those that think the preservatives used in the formulation of this product are carcenogenic. I&#x27;ve read the information available and will continue to use this product. Trying to avoid all chemicals in our life and our environment would be a time consuming and for practical purposes....impossible.  We should get information and make informed decisions. I choose to use this product and benefit from it&#x27;s properties. I&#x27;m and sick and tired of those that wish to be the guardians of us all campaigning against whatever the \\&quot;flavor of the month\\&quot; is. I will make those choices. I do not need someone trying to remove products that I love from the shelves because they are afraid of every buggaboo chemical that somebody tells them is going to kill them.   I remember when they took black jelly beans off the market because of a cancer scare. They found out that you&#x27;d need to eat a couple of pounds a day for 30 years to get that cancer. Not highly likely. It&#x27;s always something. Last year it was BPA. This year it&#x27;s parabens. Next year it will be something else.   Gimme a break. I worked over 20 years in the chemical industry with some of the baddest stuff known to man. I don&#x27;t have two heads and I don&#x27;t spend my time worrying about all this craziness people post all over the internet. Use common sense, folks. That&#x27;s all you can do. If the benefits out weigh any (however remote) negative aspects...go for it.       Here are some truths about the preservatives (parabens) used in this product..gleaned from an online sources....  The first is from Wikipedia....  \\&quot;Methylparaben is produced naturally and found in several fruits, primarily blueberries, along with other parabens. There is no evidence that methylparaben or propylparabens are harmful at concentrations typically used in body care or cosmetics.Methylparaben and propylparaben are considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for food and cosmetic antibacterial preservation.Methylparaben is readily metabolized by commonsoil bacteria, making it completely biodegradable.  Methylparaben is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or through the skin. It is hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and rapidly excreted in urine without accumulating in the body.[6] Acute toxicity studies have shown that methylparaben is practically non-toxic by both oral and parenteral administration in animals.In a population with normal skin, methylparaben is practically non-irritating and non-sensitizing; however, allergic reactions to ingested parabens have been reported.[6] Methylparaben is not carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic or embryotoxic; in addition, it is negative in the uterotrophic assay.\\&quot;  This \\&quot;report\\&quot; includes some pros and cons....  \\&quot;Much of the controversy surrounding parabens stems from a small study conducted at the University of Reading, United Kingdom, back in 2003. The study found parabens in breast cancer tissue in 18 out of 20 tumors.   But first, let&#x27;s back up a bit... exactly what is a paraben? The chemical name is Alkyl Hydroxy Benzoate Preservatives.  Phew! That&#x27;s a mouthful.   Parabens are the most commonly used preservative in personal care products. They are widely used in everything from shampoo to personal lubricants.  Actually, parabens are hiding in over 13,000 products!  A surprising piece of information is that parabens are added to food products and prescription drugs. The sobering fact is that most of us are exposed to numerous parabens on a daily basis.  Parabens and Cancer - the Estrogen Connection   Suspicions concerning parabens and cancer first appeared back in 1998. At that time, studies began to expose the estrogen-like property of parabens. Twelve studies have confirmed estrogen-like activity in laboratory rats injected with parabens. The results indicate a weak form of estrogen, but it&#x27;s there.  On a positive note, the researchers found that parabens ingested orally show no estrogen activity. It appears that parabens in food and medications are insignificant. (Well that&#x27;s good news!)  So what are the concerns?  The \\&quot;Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association\\&quot; maintains that parabens are safe. Scientists from the international community, however, are not so sure. Many experts believe the issue requires further study before such a declaration can be made.  Why worry?   To begin with, the estrogen-like activity relates to the research findings of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT studies established a connection between estrogen and breast cancer.   Note: the estrogen activity in parabens is weak compared to HRT.  Next, consider the fact that parabens are used in the majority of personal care products. Just look in your own bathroom cupboard. Even many so called natural skin care products use these preservatives.   This translates to widespread, daily use over the course of many years. The significance of this raises a cautionary flag.  Consider this...  Personal care products expose the typical adult to an average of 126 unique chemicals daily! This raises other questions, such as:  - What is the risk of combining parabens with other chemicals?   - What is the cumulative effect of exposure day after day?   Good questions, but no answers.   At this time, the research has not been conducted to state conclusively that such combined, prolonged chemical use is safe.   University of Reading Study  It&#x27;s important to know that this study does have its critics. And frankly, it was not flawless.   Here are the facts...  *The study was small - samples were taken from only 20 women.  *There were no controls - normal breast tissue was not investigated for comparison.  *No other parts of the body were studied - theoretically, parabens may lurk elsewhere in the body.  *The source of the parabens was not identified - no one knows if they came from antiperspirants, other personal care products, or possibly a household source.  The bottom line...    A Proven Link to Justify Paraben Free Skin Care?  This one study does not prove a cause and effect relationship between parabens and cancer. It sheds just enough suspicion to indicate that more research is needed.   Ar you confused?  You&#x27;re probably wondering what to do with all this information. Should you change your personal care product habits?   Unfortunately there are no easy, clear-cut answers. But to help you make sense of it all, here&#x27;s a list of what we know and what we don&#x27;t know at this time.  We can say parabens...   *are contained in some breast cancer tissue  *are absorbed by the body  *appear to enter tissue via the skin, rather than ingestion  *promote estrogen-like activity in lab animals  We can not say...   *parabens cause cancer  *deodorants or antiperspirants cause cancer  *parabens inhabit the body only in breast tissue  Parabens, Cancer, and All Natural Skin Care Products  What products should concern you the most? The greatest potential risk comes from so called \\&quot;leave on\\&quot; products... ones that remain on your skin. These have more time to penetrate and enter the bloodstream. Some examples are...  *Moisutrizers, body lotions, and skin creams  *Make-up  *Deodorant  *Sunscreen  Products that are on your body for only a short time before being rinsed off are less likely to be absorbed...  *Soaps  *Shower gels and cleansers  *Shampoos and conditioners  Of course, you may want to just eliminate all skin care products that contain parabens and follow...  The \\&quot;Precautionary Principle\\&quot;  The Precautionary Principle states: if there is the potential for harm, it&#x27;s best to err on the side of caution. This public health principle promotes preventative action, rather than waiting for scientific \\&quot;proof.\\&quot;   The good news is that many manufacturers are listening to the public and eliminating parabens from their products.   If you&#x27;re still concerned about parabens and cancer, it&#x27;s easy enough to avoid this controversial chemical. Read labels... look for ingredients such as ethylparaben, butylparaben, methylparaben, propylparaben,isopropyl and isobutylparaben, or parahydroxybenzoate. They all indicate the product contains this preservative.   An alternative is to find companies that sell only 100% all natural skin care products. Natural brand skin care such as Aubrey Organics, Dr. Huaschka Skin Care, and Weleda Skin Care. These trusted lines offer high quality, efffective skin care that makes the paraben and cancer dilemma a non issue.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Best for cracked heels!</li>
    <li> This is the best product you will ever find for skin. I put it on every night and wake up with extremely smooth skin.  My job requires that I constantly wash my hands which leaves them dry, cracked and so painful and this stuff really helps them so much.      I recently got sunburn and this stuff is a godsend, It&#x27;s cool, soothing and it isn&#x27;t greasy so I can really slather it on the part of my skin that is burnt.    I can guarantee if you try this stuff,whether it be for dry skin, sunburn or just a a relaxing treatment for moisturizing, you will absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have too much to say about this wonderful product, because this product speaks for itself, it doesn&#x27;t need a long review. I want to tell every body how effective this cream is. Zero grease, zero oil, my skin is so moisturized after I use this cream. I compared my skin with a dry sponge, and right after I apply Udderly Smooth, my skin feels completely different, is like the dry sponge was place in water and has absorbed it so deep inside. My skin is transform into a complete different texture! it feels full of life! I really do understand why this product is also for cows, even when a cow is a very tough animal, their udder is as delicate as human skin, and because their nature of milk production that part of their body got to suffer terribly, they thought well when they had that on mind!!!. Huge container, price so affordable, and an excellent product. What else I could say? try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product locally a few times, so I was excited to see it on Amazon! I buy this product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Instant penetration to the dermis of my skin, so I can put on clothing/gloves, etc., immediately after applying.&lt;br /&gt;2) Non-Greasy formula, NO lingering reside to leave marks on clothing or anything I touch or make contact with.&lt;br /&gt;3) Wide mouth jar makes application easy, and you get to use every last drop!&lt;br /&gt;4) Re-usable jar-a bonus for those of us who like to re-purpose packaging.[[ASIN:B001ET78L0 Udderly Smooth Body Cream Skin Moisturizer, 12-Ounce Jar (Pack of 6)]]</li>
    <li> My daughter found this cream back around Christmas. She shared some w/ me. I loved it so much, I bought a container of it for stocking stuffers for each of my 3 sisters and my mother.&lt;br /&gt;They are all hooked it as much as my daughter and I are now.&lt;br /&gt;It has softened my feet so much it is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who is about 25 years younger than me, loves it every bit as much as I do. Her elbows had been dry all her life, no matter what she did for them, till she stumbled upon this cream. Now, they are soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My mother, who is nearly 80 adores it.&lt;br /&gt;My whole family is summer foot wear-ready now because of this cream.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  A friend gave me a tube when I first got pregnant and I fell in love with it.  I&#x27;m now on probably my 4th Tub.  It absorbs quickly, smells nice  and isn&#x27;t greasy.  It&#x27;s not super long lasting (which is why I only gave it 4 stars) but I still love it.  I slather it on twice a day and haven&#x27;t gotten one stretch mark.  I will continue to use it even after the baby&#x27;s here.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I tried this product! My whole family has been using this  udderly smooth cream to treat our extremely dry skin (eczema) for over a year now. It actually works! The price is also wonderful -- what a deal!&lt;br /&gt;The cream smells fresh and clean, not overpowering, so everyone can use it. It also goes on smoothly and dries without leaving a greasy feeling. We use this about 2 times a day and our skin showed less breakout of dry and itchy skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for several years in my practice as a bodywork practitioner of deep tissue myofascial release (Rolf Method of Structural Integration). It allows deep work without the slipperiness that most massage creams and oils cause. And no concerns about staining sheets or clients&#x27; clothing. Everyone loves it, it has a pleasant odor and appears to be completely non-allergenic. I bought some for my mother for her aging dry skin. She loved it, said it was the best moisture cream she had ever used. It is not often that an inexpensive product turns out to be the best.</li>
    <li> This cream is a miracle worker! I&#x27;ve suffered with cracked fingers for many years then I started using this cream and have not had 1 reoccurance...I use it every time I wash my hands and right before I go to bed...not greasy at all and very pleased with my purchase! YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS!!!!  THUMBS UP!!!!</li>
    <li> this stuff is great but the packing needs padding ... one of the six jars was cracked</li>
    <li> love this stuff! not greasy and keeps my hands soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will, however, will still be on the hunt for more natural ingredients...</li>
    <li> Udder Cream is the only moisturizer that I know of (other than Cornhusker&#x27;s) that contains NO MINERAL OIL. Mineral oil, in my opinion, is about the worst thing that you can put on your skin. I also use it as an after shave and put a dab on some TP to get my butt extra clean after taking a dump. After you finish a jar, wash and dry it and put in some dried beans or unpopped popcorn--it makes a great shaker for those percussion jam sessions!</li>
    <li> This cream has extraordinary healing properties. Use it on dry, cracked, rough skin. It also works on cuts, and burns. It&#x27;s great for massaging the body. The odder is pleasant and soothing. It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t stain.   I use it at knight before I go to bed. I apply it onto my cracked feet with a nice foot massage, my super dry hands, and my elbows. Sometimes I even do my arms and legs, back, chest and stomach.   You may experience a slight burning sensation when you apply it to dry or cracked skin, cuts, and burns.  Allergy Alert! This product contains: Allantoin, Dimethicone, Lanolin Oil and Propylene Glycol in an Emollient Base.   I highly recommend this cream to anyone.</li>
    <li> Product was just as promised.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it.  It&#x27;s great for cracks in the fingers, and for dry hands in general.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and easy to use.  Rubs in great!</li>
    <li> Buy this product if you have any kind of dry skin problem---and it&#x27;s not greasy.  This is my second time purchasing it and believe me it works</li>
    <li> The best of lotions, it soaks right in and a little goes a long ways</li>
    <li> This product is the best hand cream and skin moisturizer that my wife and I have ever used. It certainly does an excellent job of preventing dry and cracked hands. It also is a very good moisturizer for other parts of the body.</li>
    <li> I and my wife have been using this product for about three years now and an glad Amazon carries this product because Trader Joes has discontinued selling this cream product. I use the tube and jar version of this product. If you want to make the jar version a little smoother just mix in some baby oil . The baby oil makes is smell better too.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I have extremely dry skin.  I used to use petroleum jelly to soften it but since I discovered Moo cream that&#x27;s all I use because it softens the skin as well without being greasy and is water soluble which the petroleum jelly isn&#x27;t.  Buying it by the case is the only way to go since it becomes cost effective when you use as much as I do.  I also have lots of relatives and friends that seem to latch onto my jars because they love it too.  I would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer out there. No greasy after touch.</li>
    <li> I use every day.  6 in one order - wow.  great price too.  subscribe and save is the best plan</li>
    <li> I use this twice daily to minimize some of the side effects of chemotherapy.  It works really well and I will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> I just love this and it is so useful. My skin is so dry so I need it sooooooo much!!!!&lt;br /&gt;and the price is so perfect</li>
    <li> Whenever winter time rolls around, I get really dry, chapped hands that often crack and bleed.  I have tried numerous lotions and ointments and happened upon this one in my grocery store and decided to give it a try.  I now purchase this stuff in bulk off of here (you cannot beat the price!) and use it as my everyday body and hand lotion.  It makes your skin smooth without a greasy residue and is a godsend to dry skin.  I hope they make this stuff forever!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes nicely; definitely  my favorite cream.  I wish the version in a large tube was more widely available; I used to buy it in stores like Walgreens, not it&#x27;s not available anywhere I can find.</li>
    <li> This stuff might work well, but it contains propylene glycol. Not something I want to put on my skin or my animals&#x27; skin. Go to your local farm store and get real Udder Balm.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> My family uses this stuff all the time. It works great. Great for at work because it is not greasy and has no perfume smells.</li>
    <li> this is NOT for a pack of 6 12-oz jars, you only get 1!!  Amazon wouldn&#x27;t send the other 5 jars, only option was for me to return it and get a refund-- NOT HAPPY!!</li>
    <li> Works great for dry skin, especially on the feet.</li>
    <li> My Grandson is a welder .  It helps keep his skin soft from heat irritation at work.  My daughter has dry skin (like most women) on her feet.  Well no more.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> I like how this stuff rubs in, stays, and helps heal my dry neglected hands ... and other body parts.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, on my feet. Being in work boots 12-14 hours a day definatly tears up my feet, but with udderly smooth my feet dont split crack or burn... Love the product wouldnt go without it!</li>
    <li> Great cream for overall skin dryness and irritation. I have also used it after getting burned. It helps. It is a natural product.</li>
    <li> I use this every night after a shower to keep my legs soft and non-itchy.  It is not greasy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I take oral chemo and it kills my hands and feet; udderly smooth keeps them feeling lots better.</li>
    <li> The best ever, doesn&amp;#34;t leave you greasy or overpowering scent. Just Right Give it a try ,you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I gave them to a friend who just finished radiation treatment for breast cancer and she said it was very helpful.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Product as described. Fast delivery. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!! Great product at a great price. Will never go back to buying this product at the local drug store. Excellent product for all my family. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the only place I was able to find it in the tub was here on Amazon, not sure why. You will love the product and the pricing is great as well!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and the price thru Amazon is awesome, I am very happy and recommend this to all who are looking, great product.</li>
    <li> While she was initially put off by the fact that it isn&#x27;t organic, free-trade, no-animal-testing, etc. (when it comes to cosmetics - only cosmetics, apparently - my wife is a hippie), this is by far her favorite moisturizer.  Nothing else comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant, not overbearing scent; not greasy, and works very well to clear up dry skin that is a fact of life in the city in winter.</li>
    <li> Udderly Smooth Body Cream is excellent. Great for the whole body, but I love to use it on my hands. Udderly Smooth soothes my dry chapped hands and leaves them soft without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Started using this product over a year ago when I found one marked down in my local store. By the time I was half way through the container I was looking for more to buy. I looked everywhere and finally decided to look online. I love the way my skin feels after using Udderly Smooth and I will never go another winter without it. Thanks Amazon for carrying this. BTW, it also makes great gifts and everyone I gave one to last year loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Bought  Udder Cream from other sources and love it</li>
    <li> Got a very inexpensive multi-pack. This stuff is wonderful for getting us through the dry winters.</li>
    <li> Excellent for a body cream.  Both my husband and I use it daily!</li>
    <li> One jar had a busted lid</li>
    <li> Yes, the name is a bit odd, but it really works.  I work in construction and my hands used to get so cracked that they hurt badly.  If I use this cream at least two to three times a day, no more finger razor cracks.  Great product and very happy I can get it on Amazon and at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.  The comparison on what I pay for just one jar at the store is half what I paid for 6.</li>
    <li> What a great skin moisturizer and at such a small cost.  This was recommended to me by a friend and I am now a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is very inexpensive but works really great.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  If my review helped you, could you please click \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; button below. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Goes on light, fast and leaves no oily residue. I have yet to meet anyone male or female that tried the cream and didn&#x27;t like it - including a very discerning group of technicians that cannot afford to let their hands slip while repairing computers.</li>
    <li> Let me say first that I always put off moisturizing because I hate that greasy feeling. This cream absorbs pretty quickly and feels light on the skin. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have some sickly, flowery odor. I bought the optional pump dispensers that replace the lid to make it easier to use and I keep them throughout the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great on calluses!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product has been on my &#x27;favorite list&#x27; for several years.  I do not like a heavy oil on my skin - this product makes my skin smooth without that oily feeling.</li>
    <li> The whole family uses this stuff for dry skin so we use a lot of jars over time.  This 6 pack is a good way to keep enough on hand.  Saves big on shipping.  The product itself is high quality and goes into the dry skin quite well and leaves skin feeling moist.  Quite a good product with high lanolin content.  Been using this product for many years.  Highly recommend if you have problems with dry skin, especially hands.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff all the time. It&#x27;s not slimy.&lt;br /&gt;It has a decent smell. Doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> Udder Butter, in its human rendition, is a fantastic moisture creme.  The really nice thing is that this blend washes off cleanly with water.</li>
    <li> we love it we won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> This is the best hand/body cream on the market. It is not oily and very smooth. Use it everywhere to keep your skin smooth.</li>
    <li> What kind of review works here?  The stuff doesn&#x27;t have any powerful scent, it&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and it really keeps your skin feeling better right away.  That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Simply the BEST! A cancer patient recommended this. It&#x27;s greaseless, odor free, inexpensive and keeps my skin soft. Absolutely LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I like the moisturizer but I did not like the company used to deliver the product. It took over a month to receive the cream . I ordered a pack of 6 but only received 1 in the box . When I called to ask for the other 5 , I was told that I had to return the 1 before I could receive the entire package.  That  didn&#x27;t make any sense. In the mean time, the price of the lotion 6 pack went up $4.  I was offered the balance of 5 lotions back onto my prime credit. The solution didn&#x27;t make me happy because I was still out the lotion. I spent a long to on the phone with customer service. She seemed helpful enough but I still came up short 5 lotions.</li>
    <li> Mom was introduced to this during her cancer treatment several years ago and it lives up to its reputation.  It soaks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy afterwards.  A little goes a long way.  It helps her  prevent and heal cracked fingers from the weather and I use it on my heels.  The fact we buy in bulk is praise enough!</li>
    <li> have used it for years love it</li>
    <li> I have been using THIS as Lotion &#x3D; Cream for over 10-years. It is THE BEST if you do not care for any specific fragerance.  Just the LOTION!</li>
    <li> Item arrived a day early. However, two of the six jars were cracked open and leaking.  Will find other containers to put the cream in, but disappointing.</li>
    <li> I used to recommend this cream for my patients and now I decided to try it. Only one regret: not doing this earlier!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cream! It is rapidly absorbed, has a delicate scent and doesn&#x27;t interfere with our perfum.&lt;br /&gt;So hydrating and leaves skin extremely soft. Loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Great Stuff used for many years and hope to use it again and again and again and again and again</li>
    <li> just love it but prefer the 32 ounce bottle ,but same good stuffthank you for sharing such a good product</li>
    <li> Works Wonderful. Has all but stopped my terrible itching. :-}</li>
    <li> sent comments, have received no reply -&lt;br /&gt;contents like lotion liquid - should be consistency of &amp;#34;crisco&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is great after shower lotion, recommended by my doctor.  Helps with skin tags.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for years. I use it on my rough hands and feet, my husband swears this is the best cream for his very calloused working hands. It goes on smooth, and leaves your skin soft but NOT oily. I buy this by the case. It&#x27;s much less expensive here than in stores. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This brand of lotion is the best I have used.  It is not greasy and is easily absorbed.  It also doesn&#x27;t have any scent added.  I would suggest that you get the hand pump that fits the jar.  It makes it much easier to use.</li>
    <li> Has to be my favorite cream.  Sad TJ&#x27;s quit carrying it. Thank god for Amazon. I stock up all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a seamstress and I love Udder Cream and have been using it for years.  Udder Cream isn&#x27;t greasy and I can hand sew almost immediately after applying it without loosing grip on the needle.  It works very well as an everyday all over cream.  sometimes I need another cream when my hands get extremely dry and crack (gardening and winter times).</li>
    <li> six pack at this price, I love it! Ilove Udderly Smooth because it keeps my hands nice, and there is no slimy film, nor fru fru smell.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for dry, cracked skin and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot of, if any, perfumes in it. It&#x27;s thick and not watered down. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be greasy, at all, after you rub it in. I highly recommend this moisturizer for anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this when living through harsh Midwestern winters which dried out my skin a ton.  It did a wonderful job keeping my skin from drying and cracking.  Now I live in a much milder climate, but I still love this stuff.  I bought the 6 pack and 6 jars arrived.  The light scent also doesn&#x27;t linger, which is great as I don&#x27;t like smelling perfumey. It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or waxy when it dries... hmmm, I kind of want to go lotion up now!</li>
    <li> I work in a warehouse environment and handle a lot of cardboard which sucks the moisture right out of my skin.  If I don&#x27;t take care of my hands with lotion then they become cracked and very dry.  I&#x27;ve been using a neutragena lotion for my hands and it works reasonably well.  I bought this Udder cream because of all the rave reviews it&#x27;s getting about people saying it&#x27;s the best stuff they ever used.  Well I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and my hands have gotten worse not better.  My hands are dry and are cracking in between my nuckles.  I have seen no benefit from using this cream, it might have even done me bad.  Worse $20 I ever spent.  I will keep trying it a little while longer and update my review if these circumstances change.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful non-greasy, effective moisturizing cream!  They should do a better job of packaging and marketing it, because it really is terrific!  I started using it when I was swimming in a chlorinated pool every day (on the advice of another swimmer) and was so impressed with how well it works, not to mention how reasonably it&#x27;s priced.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Some of the best cream for Dry skin.... My wife loves it, but we were haveing a hard time finding it on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years and it is still my favorite.  It is not only smooth, it is not greasy; so there is no problem applying it before wearing silk.</li>
    <li> The merchandise came on time and the product was wonderfull. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> The only thing that will help my hands where many others have failed.</li>
    <li> For my skin this product works well. One of the very few lotions that actually heals the cracks and problems acquired in life. Plus the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of skin products over the years and nothing compare to this product.  The cream does not have heavy perfume smell like a lot of other cream do.  The cream soak in your skin right away and keep your skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for years and cannot live without it.  I use it after every shower and the softening of your skin is awesome.  Truly amazing product.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has used this cream for years.. She has a skin problem and this cream appears to help. we will continue to buy this cream.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled that I finally found this product!  I have been a faithful user of Pacquins Hand Cream for 40 years.  When it was discontinued, I was extremely disappointed -- I used to keep a jar in the kitchen and all bathrooms for my dry skin.  I have spent lots of money trying to find a product that closely duplicated the properties that I loved in Pacquins and Udderly Smooth Udder/Hand Cream does the trick!  It has the consistency of Pacquins.  IS NOT GREASY!!!!! And, it lasts a long time! I use it on my hands, elbows, knees, and feet.  I have just recently bought more so I can put them in the kitchen and all bathrooms.  This is a real price performer!  I originally bought the Fragrance Free because I was a little worried about the smell (after all, it was originally made for cows udders) but I went ahead and bought more with fragrance.  Can&#x27;t rate the product with fragrance because I haven&#x27;t received it yet but I think it will be just fine!</li>
    <li> I love this cream for rough feet and dry skin, I&#x27;m so happy to be able to&lt;br /&gt;get it now.</li>
    <li> Product has always provided satisfactory results.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Getting along in years and Udderly Smooth works to keep me unwrinkled and soft.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why others highly recommend this product. I  have dry skin and found that it did not work any better that Vaseline lotion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this per the description.....well I will give them an opportunity to make good on the advertisement before I give them a negative review.....stay tuned for better or worse however....I will definitely let you all know how this turns out......if they stand behind their product...and any mistake they might make in selling it.....I will gladly buy, and buy again from this distributor......we shall see if Dave is a true business man and makes good on his word....he&#x27;s the sales associate I dealt with regarding this order when I received it and had to call  personally for an explanation on what I received....principles are important...does Pharmpack agree?</li>
    <li> Great product. Not greasy, easily absorbed and keeps the skin moisturized and supple for a long time. Much better than most body cream found in shops. The only draw back is the pumped version is far more expensive comparing to jars.  But the quality of this product and good price make it worth while to buy in jars.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion ever</li>
    <li> Use daily on my legs and thighs. It is not oily and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing.  It also doesn.t leave any unpleasant odors.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> This body cream absorbs faster than other creams and definitely softens your skin. There have even been cases where it has stopped itching in sunburned areas.</li>
    <li> This is my third order ot this moisturizer cream and will continue to order more as time goes by.  It is has a nice consistency with a more creamy texture than some of the others that i&#x27;ve used over the years.  It works great on any kind of rash and reduces the rash over a couple days of usage.</li>
    <li> Best thing for dry, cracking skin.</li>
    <li> great Product!!!  have ordered a doz. for family.  Especially works well for people with unusually dry skin.  highly recommend.  Not greasy</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Its the only lotion that works for me! soaks in fast and leaves your skin feeling great!</li>
    <li> If you work in a central cash vault or anywhere that requires u handle currency this product is a lifesaver for your your dry hands. I have tried countless products and nothing compares to this one.  I now buy this for everyone who works for me in a central cash room at a gambling establishment and have heard nothing but positive feedback.</li>
    <li> I have used udder cream for over 10 years, and found it to be the best for dry skin and chapped hands. The consistency is thick, and is not greasy. Has a wonderful \\&quot;healing\\&quot; quality.</li>
    <li> Great body moisturizer, especially for hands and feet.  Was tired of only finding it in a small tube so was very excited to get it in mass quantity.  Will share with my daughters.</li>
    <li> The product is good. It does just what it says. I love this stuff so much that even with mine being shipped to be with the merchandise busted and a mushy mess, I&#x27;m still satisfied. It makes your skin so soft and smooth. It might say use for udders but it helps humans too.(lol)</li>
    <li> My skin gets really dry, especially during winter so finding this has been a fantastic boon.&lt;br /&gt;I was first introduced to it by family, looked it up and found it on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at the price, but having already tried it had no reservations about buying it and distributing the extras to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I&#x27;ve let try it has been shocked at how well it works and moisturizes and have exclaimed that they want to get some of their own!&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy, absorbs into skin in less then a minute and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely re-order when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love it--great for all ages from babies to seniors!!! Cream blends in well, no unpleasant scent, feels luxurious. Use on hands, feet, body.</li>
    <li> I have used many moisturizing creams over the years and Udderly works very well for me. I also have itchy skin and Udderly appears to lessen this occurring. It isn&#x27;t really greasy like many other moisturizes but still works well. Its very easy to apply</li>
    <li> This lady at my job told me about this cream she told me her sister had alligator skin and now she don&#x27;t  anymore so I got the cream and used it on my grandson and his skin is coming along real good also I have rough fee and I used it and my feet is smooth</li>
    <li> love this cream. Use it everywhere and all the time.</li>
    <li> My friend uses the Moisturizer because of the low humidity where she lives.  I tried it and love the way there is now greasy residue when you apply it to your hands. It leaves your hands moisturized, has a nice fresh scent and does not evaporate. I like enough that I have given two jars to friends.  I would recommend it to anyone with dry hands.  It is available with a pump but works better just dipping your fingers in the jar.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this as much as I do.  This is a cream but  liquiifies when you rub it on and is not sticky.</li>
    <li> Best thing for cracked skin in the cold winters.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve been able to find. Lots of other stuff makes my hands break out in blisters so I sometimes have to be careful, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Udderly Smooth cream.</li>
    <li> It was 1 jar not 6. They credited my account but I still paid more for 1 jar than I should have.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I live in the dry Southwest and my skin is always crying for moisture. To top is off, I have a cleaning service so my hands are especially prone to being dry and cracked. I use Udderly Smooth Skin Moisturizer as a body moisturizer after my morning shower and on my hands after having them in soapy water. It&#x27;s wonderful! No more flaky skin and no more sore hands! It&#x27;s even great on dry cracked heels. Just rub into your feet and heels before putting on your socks and in a few days your heels are soft again! Couldn&#x27;t live without this cream!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item in the past, and find the cream wonderful.  The last time the jars were mounted with shrink wrap on a cardboard.  However, this time the jars of cream were placed loose in a box that was too big with no packing material.  As a result, of 6 jars, four came through fairly well, but one was cracked, one was almost completely disintegrated, so there was cream EVERYWHERE in the box.  What a mess!!  The seller replaced one jar, but there was a big mess in the box and now I&#x27;ve tried to tape the cracked jar together (though the tape doesn&#x27;t stick well on a jar which was covered in cream) so it won&#x27;t fall apart when I open it (the cracks are causing it to dry out too). Would buy the product again, but maybe from another vender unless they change the way they pack product.</li>
    <li> I started using this on work via a coworker and couldn&#x27;t find it at Target so I decided to buy some from here. It is literally the best stuff, and I am a guy, and I don&#x27;t mind saying that. My hands get real dry during the winter and this stuff feels awesome and is not greasy like a lot of other lotions. It rubs in real nice. I did not notice it was a 6 pack so a lot of family received some lotion for Christmas :)</li>
    <li> Udderly Smooth leaves your skin feeling so silky! I will continue to purchase this product. My husband says it is the best lotion for his dry feet.</li>
    <li> Good Price for this product, This time it seems to be taking a very long time, I received all my other items I ordered on the same day</li>
    <li> Give my hubbie backrubs with this cream. I prefer only the 12oz jar (the cream is thicker)  He likes it because it does not have a perfumy odor, does not leave his skin feeling greasy and it really works.  I&#x27;ve always loved it because it is one of the most economical lotions containing lanolin, which is an ingredient that I find really moisturizes my dry hands.  Its a win-win-win.  He loves it, I love it, and it enhances our fun/quiet moments.</li>
    <li> I was first recommended this cream by my doctor as a treatment for my dry feet after a summer&#x27;s worth of flip-flop wearing, and while I was a bit turned off by the description, I figured, well if my doc recommended it...  This cream is amazing!  I&#x27;ve used it for 6 years now, and I&#x27;ve tried many brand-name and high-end moisturizers, and none compare to Udder Cream.  It&#x27;s versatile (I can use it for my dry feet, my hands, and my face), it smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a greasy mess after I&#x27;ve applied it-- to the contrary, I feel incredible hydrated.  It&#x27;s been incorporated into my makeup routine in the morning, and I slather some on my face and body before bed, and I wake up with skin that is as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom (or cow&#x27;s udder after Udder Cream, I suppose).  I would strongly recommend this product to both men and women, young and old.  I found this at my local drug store-- I&#x27;ve never seen it at other places, but others seem to have found it at grocery stores and craft stores (so lucky!).</li>
    <li> I hate plastering my body with a lot of synthetic chemicals and this product has considerably less.  I think the &amp;#34;udder cream&amp;#34; has even less and when I purchased this variety I found the ingredients to have more of what I didn&#x27;t want to put on my body, still much better than any like product sold in most stores.  Would buy again but would look for &amp;#34;udder cream&amp;#34; instead.</li>
    <li> The box was greasy underneath. Inside was one container completely smashed, with shards of plastic in the goo. Another container was cracked, though mostly salvageable. The remaining containers were OK. A too large box with too little protection--the plastic bubble balloons were on one side of the box, the containers on the other. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d re-order, but instead purchase locally. A 4 or 5 star product, a 1 star package.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the original product like Udder Balm, but this is nothing like the original. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, but I was extremely disappointed in the packaging.  The 6 jars were shrink-wrapped with very thin plastic that broke.  One strip of AIRplus STOROpack bubble wrap was included (7x22 inches).  When the 11x13x5 box arrived, the jars were all loose in the box, and 3 of the 6 bubbles of the bubble wrap were flat.  Surprisingly, only ONE of the 6 jars of lotion had been cracked beyond salvaging.  The label seems to be holding the jar together, and I was able to scrape most of the lotion out and re-deposit it in another jar.  Very very bad packaging.  The lotion is absolutely worth salvaging, but there needs to be a discussion about packaging.</li>
    <li> hands are so soft and never greasy! I have one at the office, in my bath, and in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> My mom was glad to get this bulk and cheap. Was hard to find in store without paying a ton and only having a few. Great!</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion, this company sure knows how to make a moisturizing lotion. I have really dry skin and I love how this lotion moisturizes me but does not feel greasy. I prefer the &amp;#34;lightly scented&amp;#34; kind because it gives off a really soft light fragrence that I like the smell of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were very quick with their shipping, I received the product on time as promised. Thanks for the great service.</li>
    <li> This hard to find lotion can sometimes be found in the pharmacy area but often is sold out. It&#x27;s moisturizing and lightly scented.  It&#x27;s not too oily so it&#x27;s perfect for the face too.  I also use it for my kids eczema. Was happy to find it in bulk on Amazon. I&#x27;ll continue to order from here.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this cream for years. It&#x27;s the best winter time moisturizer we have found.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and will order it again. Ordered a 6 pack and haven&#x27;t ordered any in about a year, down to the last two.</li>
    <li> Love it for sore, dry heels.  We buy lots of it.  The 6-pack is a good value versus individuals sold at drug stores.</li>
    <li> As a chef, I wash and dry my hands nonstop throughout the day, and really need a quality moisturizer to quickly nourish my skin.  Udderly Smooth Body Cream is a thick no nonsense formula that absorbs immediately with no greasy residue. I have tried many &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; skin formulas, but Udderly Smooth works better.  The almost nonexistant scent earns the 5-star rating in my kitchen.  I order this cream by the case. I have tried other &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; lotions, but the other creams go right in the trash as soon as their awful perfumes overwhelm my sensitive nose.  Give Udderly Smooth creams &amp; lotions a try. Quality products made in America!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading the ingredient list on the back. However, I did not recieve the same product because if you view picture #2 there are no parabens listed. The product I recieved has them.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter uses it for her dry skin &amp; she loves it. It keeps her skin moist and soft. In fact I just started auto shipping for the Udderly Smooth Udder Cream Skin Moisturizer, 12-Ounce Jar (Pack of 6) so I don&#x27;t have to reorder very time she get low.</li>
    <li> Great product, Good price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It moisturizes very well and effect are long lasting.  The scent is fresh and suitable for a woman or a man.</li>
    <li> Great to give as a gift so smooth and feels amazing on your skin</li>
    <li> Udderly Smooth Body Cream skin moisturizer is the absolute best thing I have found for dry heels, feet overall, and legs.  I have diabetes and my skin has always been extremely dry.  This cream makes it feel baby soft.  If you have issues with dry skin and want to find something that will help, give this product a try.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants smoother skin.</li>
    <li> the best moisturizer on the market!!!</li>
    <li> There is not a body cream made to compete with Udderly Smooth.  I use it on my hands at bedtime, put on cotton gloves, and in the morning they are baby smooth.  Do the same on your feet wearing cotton socks.  And it&#x27;s made in America!</li>
    <li> This can be hard to find in retail stores, but it&#x27;s worth the trouble.  I use this all over after a shower, when I&#x27;m in ski country.  The air is so dry, without it, my skin would be like sand paper, and itchy.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and absorbs well.  When ski season is over, I use it on my elbows, hands, and feet.  It keeps the calluses from building up.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this cream, it has been very reliable in its performance.&lt;br /&gt;I have been a customer for some time and have not been able to replace this product with any other cream.&lt;br /&gt;It has done wonders for my skin, considering it was originally developed for cattle, being an animal lover and advocate I knew it had to work.&lt;br /&gt;If your searching for a great body cream, give this a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years on my face.  It&#x27;s one of the only lotions that I can use that does not cause me to breakout, and provides the perfect amount of moisture to keep my skin looking healthy.  The tub itself lasts awhile, I go through maybe 2 a year. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works great on my feet:)</li>
    <li> Usually below zero weather brings cracks on my fingers near my nails.  Very painful cracks.  This year I used the Udder cream and no problems.  It&#x27;s very pleasant, with no strong smell, no greasiness.  It absorbs yet seems to form a protective layer.  Just watch that you get the real Udder cream.  (You can tell it&#x27;s the udder cream because the instructions talk about cleaning the udder, spplying to the udder, etc.  Real farmer stuff.)  The company makes a lotion and foot cream that seem to have more water.  This udder cream has allantoin as the first ingredient.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hands and face all winter. I also use it on minor scrapes on my horse.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! Hard to find in stores! Love this stuff especially in the winter when my skin is so dry.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that actually makes my hands soft without being greasy.  This is the 2nd order of the 6 pack in less than 6 months.  I LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a great cream.  It was recommended by our dermatologist.  We always have it on hand (no pun).</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this product in any store so I could not be more ecstatic  to find it and in a package of 6 none the less! Always amazing and I love that it is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy film. I wish the smell could be better, but otherwise it is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff....smooth</li>
    <li> I got this to help with stretch marks during my pregnancy. So far it seems to be helping a lot. My husband tried it on his hands, which get a lot of abuse, and he loves it.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars... if it weren&#x27;t for the unnatural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad for using this knowing it has chemicals that are bad for me...&lt;br /&gt;but I have yet to find something that quenches my skin&#x27;s thirst so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tub in the car (in winter)&lt;br /&gt;I have another tub near my bed (apply every night on hands, forearms, feet)&lt;br /&gt;And yet another tub in the kitchen...&lt;br /&gt;One more tub in the laundry room (my hands &amp;#34;can&#x27;t breath&amp;#34; ... they get so dry from folding clean laundry)</li>
    <li> This is, flat out the BEST moisturizer I have used.  Non-greasy, absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t stain, mild fragrance.  What gets me is the price-- an incredible bargain!  I discovered it at Walmart, been haven&#x27;t seen it there lately.  So, I just got a case of 6 from Amazon and have them located around the house where I occasionally need lotion.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Yes!  This product was recieved immediately, at a good price and is awesome!  I will be buying from these guys regularly!  I recommend hem greatly!</li>
    <li> One of the side effects of a chemotherapy drug I was taking was cracked and bleeding fingers.  After trying several other more expensive lotions that didn&#x27;t do anything but cause more irritation my oncologist recommended Udderly Smooth.  It worked wonders! I am still using it two years later.</li>
    <li> Udderly Smooth is the only hand/body cream I use.  It soaks into my skin perfectly with no greasy or sticky feeling afterwards.  I love it!</li>
    <li> When I ordered the product, I thought it was perfume free, but it contains a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;., which is just another word for perfume.  Because I am highly allergic to perfume, I have had to discontinue using this Udderly Smooth.  I found, however, that there is a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; form of Uddely Smooth (Extra Care Cream)that is &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34;  I ordered it from another source and am currently using it.  I think it will, in time, improve the condition of my eczema-plagued skin.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is mild and pleasant. Works great on repairing dry skin. It appears thick but smooths onto skin easily and evenly.</li>
    <li> This was one of my best purchases from Amazon.  I first heard of Moo Cream on Oprah--I think almost 8 (?) years ago?  Tried the product then, and have used it ever since.  I&#x27;m a guy who likes taking care of his skin, but in a non-fussy way.  This totally fits the bill.  The cream is not fragranced in any heavy way, glides on smooth as can be, and within minutes, you&#x27;ve done something good for you skin without fuss. The women in my family--sister, niece etc., love this product too (I actually turned them on to it), but I think it is perfect for guy maintenance!  And this particular offer of a six-pack, came at an AMAZING price!</li>
    <li> i use this product to make it through the long chicago winter....regular application prevents cracks in the feet and hands....this 6 pack is a bargain</li>
    <li> I really like this cream in harsh winters it heals the skin fast and its not greasy yet still very moisturizing and absorbs well. It is even great for all year around.</li>
    <li> I just received it today,packaging was ok, packed tight in plastic although one of the lids was a little loose so check them before storing. I think it has a nice,light fragrance but i do think its a little  greasy. Dont know about using on my face, used on legs after shaving and it felt nice. Maybe try on forehead,i have rosacea so have to be careful and very sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I had dry patches of skin that I thought was from old age. Well that may have been the case, but the patches are gone now. Even if I skip a day using the cream the dry patches stay gone. I will use this stuff for the rest of my life!!</li>
    <li> After reading all the Amazon reviews I purchased this cream. I didn&#x27;t want the six containers, but wanted to try the body cream. My wife and I really like this product. Will solve your dry winter skin problems, goes on easy and is not greasy. Has some kind of fragrant but it is so slight you really can&#x27;t notice it. I would say the fragrant seems like fresh air or is fresh air like. Once applied the cream will still be there at the end of the day. Very good cream.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, especially in the winter when your skin gets dried. I&#x27;ve never found anything else as effective and the price is right too.</li>
    <li> Used it for years and it is very good on very dry skin, I highly recommend this product for people with dry itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Bought several containers so I have it close by to apply often.  Would have given 5 stars, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the cream is not consistent from one container to another.  One container seemed very moist (too much water).</li>
    <li> Contains parabins.  Threw them all out.  Wish I had checked this out before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Great for dry hands, its a little over fragranced though for my tastes.</li>
    <li> My skin is dry, so I slather Udderly Smooth Body cream all over my body after my shower.  My skin feels so soft and smooth.  I use it liberally all day on my hands.  I love how it softens  and keeps the skin on my hands and feet from cracking and peeling.  I highly recommend it.  I have tried all kinds of expensive creams and lotions recommended by my dermatologist, but this one is the winner, HANDS DOWN!</li>
    <li> I use this as my high end daily body cream and it works amazingly. Would absolutely buy again and product is light enough but strong enough to be used year round.</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of the only lotions I have found that smells pleasant, feels light on the skin,  deeply moisturizes,  and feels clean.  My skin was flaky,  ashy,  cracked, and scaly due to swimming in chlorinated pools and autoimmune conditions.  This lotion was wonderful-not the least bit sticky or tacky- and didn&#x27;t make me feel like I was wearing a glove... super smooth and light while being a heavy duty moisturizer!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. The way Amazon dealt with this order of mine was excellente, too. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands.  Tried many others but this product works the best for me.  I use it on my whole body.  I saw this product over the years but I wasn&#x27;t  interested in it because of the label.  But out of desperation I decided to try and I love it.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer.  The 6-pack DOES contain 6.</li>
    <li> Sweet stuff for dry skin</li>
    <li> HOWEVER the plastic container is terrible.  The tops crack easily and shatter.  I would return it but the same thing happens over and over.  I order 6 at a time for gifts because everyone loves the cream.  Big packaging dilemma.  The last time one had completely shattered in the box and cream was everywhere.  What to do?  After the holidays I will try to write the company.</li>
    <li> I have used MANY different lotions, butters, and creams over the years. Based on the reviews of this cream I was sure that I would love it, unfortunately, I was wrong, I dont like it. In my opinion, it is very watery, much more like a lotion than a cream. I was looking for something very moisturizing and thick like a typical cream, but this was very disappointing. I have to massage it into my skin for much longer than usual just to get it to absorb a bit because its so watery and thin. Then it still doesnt feel like its doing anything for my skin, theres no real benefit to using it, no long term moisturizing effects. I understand what another review meant saying it kind of sits on top of the skin, as soon as I shower or wash my hands, that&#x27;s it, it doesn&#x27;t absorb in and moisturized my skin like other lotions &amp; creams do. I wish I had tried a smaller container from walmart before I just jumped into buying 6 containers. Also, I recieved the package with one of the containers broken and leaking cream all over the other ones. I wish I could return them but I think its been too long. I tried to use it for a while to give a fair review, the price is very attractive but I would much rather spend a little more money on a CREAM that I actually really like and will benefit my skin long term. Obviously, many other people feel differently about this cream, so I would just suggest that you try it before you buy 6 of them or only buy one so you know if you really like this stuff, its not for everybody. I prefer a cream like Cetaphil by a landslide, I love that stuff &amp; now I see a justification for the higher price tag but I don&#x27;t mind paying it all all  Cetaphil is great. I don&#x27;t like giving bad reviews &amp; I&#x27;m not trying to bad mouth this company just want others to be sure before you go and buy 6, like I said, its just not for everybody.</li>
    <li> Udderly Smooth relieves dry skin without that sticky greasy feeling. It doesn&#x27;t have a cosmetic odor and doesn&#x27;t sting when applied.</li>
    <li> Since the local walmart stopped carrying Moo and a year of trying many other products, I finally got a clue and Amazoned it.&lt;br /&gt;It is absorbed into the skin quickly and works for hours or until it is washed off. Great on feet, too. If you have dry, chapped body parts,  this is the right stuff to use.</li>
    <li> Ya don&#x27;t have to be a cow to love it. Great for harsh winter weather.  It&#x27;s the best cream I know.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the Udderly Smooth lotions for years now.  The last bottle I bought was good, but this jar version is even better - it&#x27;s a little thicker, creamier.  I would prefer no fragrance at all, but at least the scent is so mild I couldn&#x27;t tell it wasn&#x27;t fragrance-free until I put my nose right up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This order of six 12 oz jars is the best deal I could find anywhere.</li>
    <li> In the winter my hands get so dry that they crack and bleed. This cures that problem with out being to greasy or over powering</li>
    <li> I am not making medical clams but this is what I have been usingn massive dematitis outbreak on my leg, and it has kept it from getting worse. Also a great hand cream and feels wonderful after your daily shower. Light scent does not interfere with your perfume.Grab some!</li>
    <li> This cream works really well for dry hands, as advertised.  Good value for the $$.  Originally bought a tube of cream to try it.  Leaves no sticky residue.  Minimal scent, too----a positive attribute!  Tried to buy this cream at a retail outlet but was unable to find any.</li>
    <li> My family provides full time, in-home care for my 92-year-old grandmother, and I&#x27;m the point person for her hygiene and beauty products. Since she became incapacitated about 9 years ago, one of the constant challenges we&#x27;ve been working through is her uncomfortably dry skin. Especially during winter, she is plagued by itchy, dry skin, and I have tried myriad lotions, oils &amp; scrubs trying to find a solution. I did a search on Amazon looking for well-reviewed dry skin lotions, and was surprised to see how well this cream was regarded. I&#x27;d used it before on myself, but never thought of it for grandma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon reviewers, for giving me the idea to buy this! I&#x27;ve been using it on her for a few weeks now, and it is by far the best thing we&#x27;ve tried! It&#x27;s doing a wonderful job of moisturizing, it has a mild fragrance that fades quickly, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any adverse reactions at all. I&#x27;m sure this would be great for anyone, but I especially recommend it to caregivers struggling with the same issue!</li>
    <li> I just installed a wood heater and between chopping and handling the wood and tending a hot fire, plus sitting in relatively dry environment, my hands began to get very rough and cracked. I remembered an old flame of mine used to have the softest skin and this was her secret.&lt;br /&gt; I like that it&#x27;s not greasy and works into my skin quickly. This cream works fast and I highly recommend it&#x27;s use and purchase..</li>
    <li> best lotion for dry skin.  love it</li>
    <li> It is absolutely non-greasy. Helps to correct dry and/or itchy skin. Nothing else on the market can compare. It was originally developed to help farmers keep the skin of their hands from cracking and drying out because of their work in milking udders of cows - &amp;#34;Udderly&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I use it to moisturize my face.  It does not take a lot to do the job and it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Udderly Smooth Body Cream Skin Moisturizer is great, I purchased several jars &amp; have shared with family &amp; friends.....we all loved it!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best moisture creams for your body.  It really makes a difference.  I highly recommend it, especially in the winter!</li>
    <li> I had used Udderly Smooth Udder Cream in the past and liked the results, so I ordered the Udder Cream.  When I received my order it turned out to be labeled Body Cream.  It had the same bar code as the Udder Cream, and It listed the same ingredients as Udder Cream plus several other ingredients.  I contacted the seller about not receiving the product I wanted.  The seller suggested that probably the products are identical, but because Udder Cream is labeled for use on cows, and Body Cream is labeled for use on humans, the Udder Cream probably does not have to list all of its ingredients in order to meet legal requirements.  I emailed the manufacturer to ask if the two products are identical and it has been over 2 weeks and they have not replied.  That leads me to suspect that the two products probably are the same and the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t want to admit it because they do market the Udder Cream for use on humans.</li>
    <li> The description when I bought this said pack of 6 but I only received one jar, and the lid on it is cracked.</li>
    <li> Great product. Used it for tears. Glad to be able to buy them 6 at a time.</li>
    <li> I just like this cream.  Not greasy, no heavy smell.</li>
    <li> I would give this product 5 stars. I&#x27;ve used this product for years. As a teacher and a mama, as well as someone who suffers from eczema, I highly recommend this product to anyone who washes their hands as much as I do. Just a warning though this seller is deceptive in their advertising. I ordered this and only received one jar not 6 as advertised. Beware!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  LOTS OF DRY SKIN IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA IN THE WINTER.</li>
    <li> I am in my thirties and, within the last two years, have developed nasty eczema on my hands, quite out of the blue.  It was SO ugly and itchy.  I used to call it \\&quot;reptile skin\\&quot; only itchier.  Nothing the doctors gave me worked.  I tried this: [[ASIN:B001V9OGJ0 SWEEN CREAM 12 OZ SC7069 12 OZ]] and it worked for awhile but, once I stopped using it, the eczema came back with a vengeance coincidentally on the night I got engaged! Not even my beautiful ring could make my hands look better, they were gross and itchy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Sween Cream again but it no longer worked.  I picked up this Udderly Smooth in a last-ditch effort to find SOMETHING to alleviate the nasty itching and scaliness and this worked SO WELL.  My hands are baby&#x27;s bottom smooth and look BETTER than they did before I even got the eczema! What I love most is that this stuff is not greasy.  I cannot stand having greasy hands (a drawback to the Sween Cream) and this stuff is just perfect.  Plus, the fragrance is very light and pleasant.  Love it!</li>
    <li> its good, smells well and worthy price... use it anytime when you at home. The shipping is very fast, will consider to second buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> best cream, use it on my face, sore feet and also as chamois cream for my cycling</li>
    <li> Fantastic cream! It soothes my cracked feet and fingers. I was so impressed the cream that I gave them as stocking stuffers this Christmas.</li>
    <li> Mine had one jar damaged, but it was described as such in product description.  Great product, good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this before but received a sample.  It sat on my desk for a month &amp; I finally tried it.  After the 2nd time I used it, I went on the &#x27;net to find out where to buy it.  I&#x27;ve used a variety of hand creams over the years (b/c I use a lot of it!)  The only one comparable to Udderly Smooth is Avon&#x27;s Silicone Glove.  They both moisturize &amp; help heal/protect but are not overly greasy and are not outrageously priced.  Udderly Smooth has a nice light scent, too.  I&#x27;ve bought 2 tubs at CVS but found the Amazon price to be quite a deal on the six pack &amp; just ordered the six pack.      Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have diabetes and as a result scrapes, sores, and cuts sometimes take over a year to heal.  I work with my hands and get exposed to cleaning products on a regular basis.  I originally bought this product for my hands.  It healed them so fast I tried it on a sore I had on my forearm for over three months. The sore was completely gone in two days.  I couldn&#x27;t  believe it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I use this product, it only takes a few days to smooth the skin on my heels and sometimes the bottom of my feet.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I like the fact that it is so effective and has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it better in the plain jar, however.  I think this packaging is tacky.</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;Udderly Smooth Body Cream Skin Moisturizer, 12-Ounce Jar (Pack of 6)&amp;#34; -  I only got 1 jar, not 6. I am absolutely sure I should have received 6 as the per ounce price basis was calculated using 72 ounces. I clicked the link and, while the description is still the same, the price has tripled and the supplier&#x27;s name has changed from Supermart to OnlineRx. I guess they realized their mistake and decided to simply ship one jar instead of doing the right thing and filling the order as advertised. Normally, $10 isn&#x27;t worth hassling with, but I hate being cheated.</li>
    <li> My family has found this cream to be very helpful during the winter months, as our hands tend to get very dry and crack at times.  Not since we began using this product.  Very good value for the money.</li>
    <li> My favorite. Never have problems with dry or cracking skin, which was especially helpful this long, cold winter.  Not greasy, and no smell.</li>
    <li> this stuff doesnt really works for me very sorry to say that..however, dont take my words 100%. please try first on yourself as it is quite affordable compared to other brands</li>
    <li> No petrolatum and it absorbs beautifully with no greasy residue. You can literally pick up fabric, etc. soon after applying and it leaves no mark. Nothing else compares. I love this moisturizer!! (and I&#x27;m allergic to most scents so I love how simple and straightforward it is.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve found yet for dry, cracked and chapped skin. It soaks right in and does not leave that greasy feeling one gets with many other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase mine through Amazon (can get it locally) but it&#x27;s a GREAT chamois cream for cyclists - and 1/4 the price of chamois cream sold in bike shops.  I used one container for over a year and never had road rash in that time.</li>
    <li> Great stuff....cows have been hiding this secret.  non greasy yet lasts long.  I use it all over my body.....I have used many skin softners and products that claim to moisturize, but this is the best.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> We bought this because our son had problems with eczema. We had tried nearly every other skin cream and lotion on the market and then I stumbled across this somewhere. This works wonders! I absolutely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This cream is great. It is not greasy and does a great job as a moisturizer. It will make your dry patchy skin smooth and soft and works great on my calused hands.</li>
    <li> it is ok. I have being used this for a long time, for medics prescriptions, and the&lt;br /&gt;result was very good.</li>
    <li> My husband is on chemo therapy and has dry skin as a side effect. This cream works wonders.  Goes on easily and helps this places actually heal!</li>
    <li> bought this product as a gift for my wife.cured her cracked hands in no time at all.would highly recomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Dry cracked skin be gone. I have used this on my hands and feet for a long time now. I work outside in the winter this is the only thing that keeps my hands and feet from cracking. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before and had good luck, but this time, one of the lids was cracked open and cream smeared over everything.  Luckily there was a plastic bag so the rest of my order at least didn&#x27;t get damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer itself is great--works well to turn rough skin into soft and eases minor irritation and chafing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE DEC 8 2013&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered again, same problem.  Wrote comments to Amazon about packaging and uploaded photos to show damage. Probably will never hear from them.  At least this time I kept some of the old jars/lids so I could transfer the lotion.</li>
    <li> This product is great for keeping heels, elbows and hands soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I am a health care professional and wash my hands 50-70 times/day. I tries numerous products which did not come close to this one. It keeps my hands moist and prevent cracking, particularly in winter weather.</li>
    <li> Why does it say pack of 6 and I only received one jar?  This is miss leading on how many jars I would get.  I like the cream but expected more jars for the price.</li>
    <li> The seller of this product sent only 1 jar instead of the advertised pack of 6.  They offered only a 50% refund, making the price still greater than what I purchased it for at Walmart.  Now this is just a big pain in my you know what to get it fixed, wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought something so simple online.</li>
    <li> It took forever for me to receive this and when I did, just yesterday, I only received 1 jar instead of the pack of 6 advertised.  This is unacceptable because I would have never bought this item if I had know that I was only greeting 1 jar.  Not 6. I want a refund!!!</li>
    <li> I know that the product is very good; however, the order was for 12 ounce jar, pack of 6. I only received one jar! Not sure what happened to the other five. I was hoping to use them as gifts.</li>
    <li> Cheap and adequate replacement for risabal .results the same and forty dollars cheaper per twelve ounce jar.very good purchase thanks</li>
    <li> I really wanted the TUBE of this cream, since I had ordered the six pack of this jar the week before.&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t want to make waves, I just kept the jar.</li>
    <li> I work in a hospital and wash my hands so many times a day that the skin on the ends of my fingers literally splits from the dryness -- very painful. In the winter, it is especially bad. Someone I work with gave me a tube of this moisturizer and when I tried it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how good my skin felt. It&#x27;s really cut down on the skin splitting and the skin on the top on my hands no longer feels like sandpaper. I love the way it works so much that I&#x27;m tempted to use it as a facial moisturizer, too. I particularly love that there are no nut oils in this product. More and more lately, these are being used in almost every moisturizer I see and I am allergic. It does have a scent, but it&#x27;s a light, clean scent, not a heavy perfume-y scent. When I went on line to order more, I saw that Amazon sold it. I could not believe the deal. 6 big jars of this for a little over $20. I&#x27;m used to spending 3-4 times more than this for one jar of moisturizer that is only an ounce in size and this is a full 12 ounces times 6 jars! Amazing. My skin is very sensitive and I wash my hands more times than I can count a day, and now my hands feel soft again, they don&#x27;t hurt, and the skin is no longer so dry that it feels like it&#x27;s pulled taut. If it works this well for me, it should work for anyone, and what a deal on top of that. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My niece have severe eczema but every time I touched her hands it seemed hard and abrasive, someone told me about this so I decided to mix it in her steroid cream, it improved her skin a lot.</li>
    <li> I will keep this short and to the point.&lt;br /&gt;Best body moisturizer ever&lt;br /&gt;Great for shaving legs&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin vanishes, not covered - up&lt;br /&gt;Best value - less expensive than in brick a mortar&lt;br /&gt;  stores&lt;br /&gt;As a body moisturizer and shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;  substitute, should last, at least, a year&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer is quick to answer any&lt;br /&gt;  and all questions with complete honesty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a &#x27;win, win&#x27; in my book. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.</li>
    <li> Best cream there is out there!</li>
    <li> This is about the fourth time I have ordered this product. I am allergic to perfume in creams.  This has none.  It softens the roughest skin and is absorbed right away.  This comes in six jars and I definitely keep one jar in the car, one in the house and haven given away a few jars to friends and relatives who also love this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t go wrong ordering this which will soon become your favorite too.  Especially nice is the fact that it is inexpensive and may be used liberally on your entire body, or at least legs, arms, hands, feet and face.</li>
    <li> this is a great product that is not too greasy with a light scent. it&#x27;s very affordable esp if you buy the pack of 6. my dad uses on his feet that are very dry and fragile from diabetes. me and my kids use as hand and body lotion. the only problem is every time i get a shipment, at least one of the containers are cracked with some lotion leaking.</li>
    <li> Bar none, the best lotion I have ever used. I use it for everything from hair conditioner after a shower to using it as a total body lotion , and best of all, as a shaving lotion/cream.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much. Arrived fast, but leaked some cream. Made a little mess, and I had a lot of work cleanning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very useful to keep skin from breaking down, especially for people using wheelchairs.  I would recommend this product to people who need to maintain skin integrity over long periods of time.  It&#x27;s quite beneficial.</li>
    <li> We have a jar of this in each bathroom, the kitchen and our bedrooms. Since I began using Udderly Smooth, I no longer have to use expensive cuticle cream (which was necessary with other hand lotions and creams.) I would be lost without this product. I have very dry skin and this is the only cream I know of that works on all body parts successfully. It goes on creamy and is instantly absorbed into the skin. It has a light scent (which is important to me as I am sensitive to many synthetic fragrances) and leaves no tacky or sticky residue behind.</li>
    <li> How Now Brown Cow?  This has been a family favorite ever since we couldn&#x27;t find bag balm, and gave this a chance.  Whereas bag balm is like vasoline, this is more like noxema without the eucalyptus &amp; menthol.  Great for rough hands &amp; feet.  It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;lump up&#x27; as some do either.</li>
    <li> All six showed up, but had damage and had broken plastic jars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product at a great price. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy. It has cow prints on it. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Received all 6 jars as promised. Shipped in great condition and received in a timely manner. I love this cream as it is the only product that soothes my dry skin and my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> This cream heals cracked dry skin like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used, use to get it at Wal-mart but they quit carrying it.</li>
    <li> Like my mother I have very sensitive skin.  She turned me onto this product.  Many soaps and lotions have additives that give me rashes and cause my eczema to break out.  Not only does this product not cause that but in helps clear out issues caused by other things.  It is lightweight, rubs in quickly and moisturizes like nothing else I have ever tried.  I use it on everything from my hands, feet and even my severely chapped nose from bad colds.  I would reccomend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> feels good and leaves no oily feeling on the skin.  It goes on, vanishes, and the skin feels good.</li>
    <li> Usually my skin is dry and itchy in the winter.  I&#x27;ve been using this pretty consistently this winter and I noticed that my skin stays hydrated the whole day.</li>
    <li> Soft moisturizing cream. Wife loves it since it she gets no allergic reaction to the smell. She has used all the non allergic face creams and she returns them. This works for her.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have re-discovered this product. I have tried many body and hand lotions over the years, and now in my 60&#x27;s, my skin is even drier than ever. I decided to give this cream another try and I use it all over my body. It feels wonderful going on and absorbs. It keeps my skin more moisturized and smooth than any other product. And it is not expensive! Will keep using it! Yay!</li>
    <li> Fabulous and inexpensive lotion. It&#x27;s not the kind that you need to wipe off cuz it&#x27;s so greasy, it soaks right in. My friends in England request it everytime I go to visit them.</li>
    <li> Excellent service; will buy again!</li>
    <li> Was not the body cream, that I am used to getting, but a lotion. Not as effective for dry skin. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> In all ways but one. Three or four of the containers had cracked lids. Fortunately I had some unfinished jars to exchange lids with.</li>
    <li> This creme is amazing and is so gentle it can be used on a baby&#x27;s tender skin.  It is fragrance free and a little goes a long way....really good buy, especially since it is difficult to find ion local stores.</li>
    <li> The work I do requires my hands to be in contact with isopropyl alcohol for several hours during each day.  Nothing dries your skin out more than alcohol.  Udderly Smooth is the only moisturizer that has ever worked for me.  You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer for your body, face and feet.  Everyone I have recommended it to is amazed at how well it works and how great the price is!</li>
    <li> I have three sons with eczema.  This is the best non-steroidal cream I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s nice to have a default outside of hydrocortizone cream.  My eldest says it works better on him than triamcinolone.  Yay for Mommie!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion ever.  It isn&#x27;t greasy.  It does a great job.  I put it on after I shower and I don&#x27;t have to put it on again until I soap up again.  It also has a neutral smell so you don&#x27;t go around giving people headaches.</li>
    <li> This product is great and i would have given it 5 stars except that the lotion was not creamy and that makes it difficult to apply to skin. I figured it froze at one time and tried mixing it and putting it next to the heater but it stayed clumpy.  The lotion still works great! The product arrived fast and was packaged good.</li>
    <li> I asked the package of 6 jars. The cream is really smoothy and my skin &amp;#34;knows&amp;#34; it. I really recommend it if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Goes on light, does not feel greasy.  My husband uses it as well.  No sweet perfume smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream, however I just picked up a 12 oz jar for under $5.00. Please don&#x27;t get ripped off.</li>
    <li> Growing up working on a dairy we used Udder Cream cream on sensitive cow teets that were cracked &amp; chaffed, the dairy cows loved this lotion.  Working in a freezing dairy barn can be brutal and using udder cream on your hands kept your hands from drying out and cracking due to constantly washing the dairy barn and cow udders down with water.  This lotion is great for men since it has no distinct odor and does not stain your clothing.  I apply it my face when my skin gets sensitive in the winter from dryness &amp; shaving.  The secret is Lanolin which comes from sheep wool fat.  I am a professional now &amp; keep a jar at my desk.  Everyone who has used Udder Cream, absolutely loves it; you will not be disappointed!  This product is better than good, it is exceptional!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived.  Efficient service.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this product through a midwest friend and I seem to only be able to get it through Amazon and this seller.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy, very good for my skin, which is dry from my face to my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I believe the design, does something to do with its origins of taking care of cow udders.  Never mind, my friends and I swear by this product.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin from getting dried out in winter months. Does not make you feel oily after it is applied.</li>
    <li> i bought this product for a friend becoz none of the stores that was listed on the website carries them anymore and the price is a little cheaper minus the s/h cost.</li>
    <li> Not able to buy this locally anymore so I was thrilled that amazon has it.  It&#x27;s a good product, use it several times a day, also very good if you have minor irritation of skin, not just for moisturizing.  I think it&#x27;s a good value too, price-wise.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for the bottom of my feet.  The scent is fresh and delightful.  The soles of my feet have become softer than they ever were</li>
    <li> My husband and I really like this cream.  It isn&#x27;t greasy like many other creams and adds a layer to the skin that keeps it feeling soft even after a few hand washings.  This is the only cream we use on our hands.  we dont have any concerns about the ingredient list.  It works keeping our hands from cracking and allows us to use our hands without any greasy coating.</li>
    <li> MY FINGERTIPS WERE CRACKING BAD WHEN I WAS WORKING IN A DAIRY. I WAS CONSTANTLY GOING IN THE COOLER AND MY HANDS WERE HURTING BAD. WHILE AT MY FATHER&#x27;S HOUSE, HIS GIRLFRIEND GAVE ME THIS UDDER CREAM STUFF TO TRY. WOW, THIS STUFF WORKED GREAT. I FOUND IT AT WALMART AND HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS NOW. IT GOES ON CREAMY, DRIES QUICKLY, AND LEAVES YOUR HANDS FEELING SILKY SMOOTH WITH &amp;#34;NO GREASY FEELING AT ALL&amp;#34;!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR CRACKED FINGERTIPS. ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT WORKS VERY WELL IS CALLED &amp;#34;HEALTASTIC&amp;#34; USE THIS FOR EXTREME CRACKS THAT ARE VERY BAD. APPLY TO FINGERTIPS AND COVER WITH A BANDAID OR GLOVE. YOU WILL BE COMPLETELY HEALED IN A DAY OR TWO. THIS STUFF DOES HAVE A LEMONGRASS SMELL, BUT IT SMELLS PLEASANT. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything it promises. It works great on my skin. Shared the 6 bottles between me and my friends. We all love it</li>
    <li> I love this cream and give it away as gifts but not sure how I managed to get on an auto ship status. This last batch just showed up at my house.</li>
    <li> Good body cream - doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy and helps heal dry skin quickly</li>
</ol>
