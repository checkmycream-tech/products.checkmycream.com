      <li>Great item -fast shipment</li>
      <li>We love Bullfrog.  </li>
      <li>I remember them being more water resistant, to the point it required soap and water to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I bought this for a trip to Florida when I found out that most sunscreens damage the coral in the ocean.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes more than you want.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best protection against long exposure to the sun that I ever experienced.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the best.  </li>
      <li>like that this goes on easily and dries quickly, unlike most sunblock lotion.</li>
      <li>Thank you for your quick service!  </li>
      <li>now the pump spray have always kept me sunburn free.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff, and the only sunscreen I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
      <li>I used the sunBLOCK lotion from Bullfrog on my face &amp; it worked great although it was several years passed the expiration date.</li>
      <li>Arrived perfectly on time a day before our trip as expected at a decent price.</li>
      <li>Bull Frog really did stay on in the water keeping me and my family safe from the sun.  </li>
      <li>There is definitely a distinct citrus like smell when applied but that dissipates quickly.  </li>
      <li>The product recommended re-spraying every 80 minutes, but it lasted all day on a warm all day hike with 50# pack at high elevation in the high sierras.</li>
      <li>Love it, doesn&#x27;t stain, stays on and not dangerous like the aerosol ones near a flame/BBQ.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I hit the pool and beach and spent a lot of time in the sun, and I am a ginger haired Irish gal, who is very fair skinned.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d look for a different brand before buying this again, but might well if I can&#x27;t find another that is better</li>
      <li>- she was the first to try it.  </li>
      <li>This product came highly recommended by an objective review website, so I decided to try it, and if didn&#x27;t suffer even the lightest burn, so I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>but this was fine for a recent beach trip.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to use for a Tough Mudder in May and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>Sprays on, so you don&#x27;t have to get your hands sticky, although I always seem to anyway, and it really, really works.  </li>
      <li>This stuff stays put and really blocks the sun.  </li>
      <li>Works better than any other sunblock I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Just got back from 11 days in Hawaii where it was very hot and sunny.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I ride a road bike about 4-5 times per week, and live out in California.</li>
      <li>Since I have such a light complextion I use it daily.</li>
      <li>After spending over an hour in the direct sun, no hat, she did not burn.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time with cream sunblocks, go with bullfrog and enjoy the rays.</li>
      <li>Since my forehead is expanding rapidly, the Bullfrog spray is really the only product I ever use to protect my skin from harmful UV rays.  </li>
      <li>This spray however was brand new and left me with 3rd degree burns.</li>

<li> plus I never burn and I am in the sun all day long - use it on the entire family.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate our allergies either, though we only use it if we have to be in the sun for a long time.</li>
<li> If it was a little cheaper, I would use it exclusively, but I&#x27;m not usually in the tropics</li>
<li> Went out to the lake last week and spent the entire day at the lake</li>
<li> Those of us who were using up the last of the other sunblocks were sunburned.  </li>
<li> Like:  pump action (not aerosol), water resistant, small size bottle</li>
<li> Wish I could say the same for other brands!  </li>
<li> IS WHAT ONE SHOULD USE FOR CAREFUL PROTECTION.</li>
<li> In fact he told me not to use any other brand.  </li>
<li> but when I used this down in the Caribbean</li>
<li> Found it less wasteful than the aersol sprays.</li>
<li> was a little stingy.</li>
<li> Just a little note about the product.  </li>
<li> I am an ocean lifeguard and rely heavily on &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; sunscreen to keep me from getting sunburnt.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed in this and do not have enough left to even test the product</li>
<li> /&gt;Dislike: leaves slick, slippery feeling on skin</li>
<li> My only complaint with this product is the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; pump can be difficult to use--</li>
<li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find in the stores</li>
<li> Floated for at least 8 hours on the Elk River in Missouri without getting toasted.  </li>
<li> Expensive.</li>
<li> (sad face)</li>
<li> Needless to say, sun damage starts to build up.</li>
<li> it is hard to push and awkward (when your hands have sunscreen on them!).</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve used it for years and never been disappointed.</li>
<li> They also have a spray one with mosquito repellent I have.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This, along with its &amp;#34;Quick Gel&amp;#34; version, have been the only sunscreens I have used for about the last 10 years.  I am a bicyclist whose rides frequently last 6-8 hours.  No burns, even with no additional application.</li>
    <li> Irritates skin  not for people with sensative skin</li>
    <li> BULL FROG GOOD PRODUC AND THE CHILDREN LIKE THE SPRAY AND SP 50 IS WHAT ONE SHOULD USE FOR CAREFUL PROTECTION.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works great, I always burn but when I used this down in the Caribbean I didn&#x27;t get red at all. This bottle works the best for application, and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling so sticky.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Florida when I found out that most sunscreens damage the coral in the ocean.  This worked well at keeping me from getting burned and it lasted in the water.  I will always use this when I have to go in the ocean from now on.  If it was a little cheaper, I would use it exclusively, but I&#x27;m not usually in the tropics (sad face) so I don&#x27;t always need to protect the ocean.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever! I would buy this by the case, but three at a time is good! Spray is key!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best.  I bought this to use for a Tough Mudder in May and it worked great.  5 hrs in the sun, mud, water and sweat and the only place I got burned was were I forgot to spray it.  FYI do not forget the backs of your knees when you are wearing 3&amp;#34; running shorts!</li>
    <li> This stuff stays put and really blocks the sun.  We&#x27;ve used it for years and never been disappointed. Wish I could say the same for other brands!  It doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate our allergies either, though we only use it if we have to be in the sun for a long time.</li>

    <li> We love Bullfrog.  It&#x27;s one of the only two brands of sunscreen that I buy.</li>
    <li> The product recommended re-spraying every 80 minutes, but it lasted all day on a warm all day hike with 50# pack at high elevation in the high sierras. This product was awesome!</li>
    <li> The best sunblock ever -not greasy plus I never burn and I am in the sun all day long - use it on the entire family.</li>
    <li> It seems as though Bullfrog changed the formulation of their product(s). I remember them being more water resistant, to the point it required soap and water to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this goes on easily and dries quickly, unlike most sunblock lotion.</li>
    <li> Bullfrog is the best sunsreeen I have used. It stays on even when i perspire. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> One application followed by Five+ hours in the Denver sun on my bike and zero sunburn.  I have been using bull frog for several years and  haven&#x27;t had a problem with it in any form.  Gel, continuous spray, and now the pump spray have always kept me sunburn free.  There is definitely a distinct citrus like smell when applied but that dissipates quickly.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with cream sunblocks, go with bullfrog and enjoy the rays.</li>
    <li> Bullfrog is our favorite sunblock.  I prefer the lotion or gel to the spray but this was fine for a recent beach trip.  Arrived perfectly on time a day before our trip as expected at a decent price.</li>
    <li> This spray doesn&#x27;t work. I got severely burned. I used the sunBLOCK lotion from Bullfrog on my face &amp; it worked great although it was several years passed the expiration date. This spray however was brand new and left me with 3rd degree burns.</li>
    <li> Great item -fast shipment</li>
    <li> I am an ocean lifeguard and rely heavily on &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; sunscreen to keep me from getting sunburnt.  Bull Frog is DEFINITELY the best sunscreen for the job.

    <li> Works. Found it less wasteful than the aersol sprays. Expensive. I save it for all day exposure days.</li>
    <li> Just got back from 11 days in Hawaii where it was very hot and sunny.  I hit the pool and beach and spent a lot of time in the sun, and I am a ginger haired Irish gal, who is very fair skinned.

    <li> Works better than any other sunblock I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Sometimes more than you want.  Went out to the lake last week and spent the entire day at the lake and my face didn&#x27;t even have any color that is desireable.</li>
    <li> I ride a road bike about 4-5 times per week, and live out in California. Needless to say, sun damage starts to build up. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually stays put, even when I sweat. Great stuff, and the only sunscreen I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best protection against long exposure to the sun that I ever experienced.  I do a lot of fishing and would never consider going without it.  Since I have such a light complextion I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I buy Bull Frog sunblock because my Dermatologist said it was the best.  In fact he told me not to use any other brand.  I like the convenience of the spray, but my Dermatologist would prefer I use the Gel.</li>
    <li> Sprays on, so you don&#x27;t have to get your hands sticky, although I always seem to anyway, and it really, really works.  Excellent sunblock.  I wish it smelled a bit better though.  But, you can&#x27;t have everything!</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to use. Not greasy.  Great for my husband and his bald head.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your quick service!  Bull Frog is great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Brought this to Costa Rica with us our last visit.  It WORKS!  One of our family is very, very fair - she was the first to try it.  After spending over an hour in the direct sun, no hat, she did not burn.  Those of us who were using up the last of the other sunblocks were sunburned.  Will always use it from here.</li>
    <li> This sun screen works great, dries fast and does not leave a sticky feeling on your skin. It&#x27;s getting hard to find in the stores so I have to get it from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I ride a motorcycle and when out all day I&#x27;ve only applyed this stuff once in the morning and it&#x27;s held up all day.</li>
    <li> I am very easily burned by the sun. Floated for at least 8 hours on the Elk River in Missouri without getting toasted.  Bull Frog really did stay on in the water keeping me and my family safe from the sun.  Just a little note about the product.  I found application to my face was a little stingy.</li>
    <li> not as water resistant as advertised.</li>
