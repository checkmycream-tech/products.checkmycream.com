    <li> first of all this is about me so i can&#x27;t speak for anyone else but i love this stuff... i use it on my cold sores,fever blisters, chapped hands, and on my dogs sore spots... and i find it works GREAT.... i have had cold sores most of my life years ago a druggist told me to try this carmex so i did, and it&#x27;s been in my health cabinet from that time forward. now i&#x27;m so glad they have these larger jars and i don&#x27;t have to stock up on the smaller ones... if you have never used it go to the drug store buy the small one. if you have used it and like it... well then there you go... get the bigger better one... good luck... sometimes it the things you don&#x27;t pay a lot for that work the best...</li>
