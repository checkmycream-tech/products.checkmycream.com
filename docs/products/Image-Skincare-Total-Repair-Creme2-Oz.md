      <li>I love this creme.  </li>
      <li>Just to be sure that it wasn&#x27;t because Image Skincare changed the container they used and the formula of the cream</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The price on amazon is outstanding.  </li>
      <li>Love this line of skincare...</li>
      <li>love this.  </li>
      <li>See great results on my old skin.  </li>
      <li>but this item was too strong for my skin  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin smooth, your skin looks good in the morning, and tingles a little but feels good on.</li>
      <li>Best night cream on the market hands down!  </li>
      <li>it moisturizes, repairs, and will give you a smooth look in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I use this only 3 times a week and it does a good  job brightening my complexion.  </li>
      <li>The cream goes on smooth, but really tingles on the skin.  </li>
      <li>One warning, it does make your skin more sensitive to the sun</li>
      <li>This one is worth it.</li>
      <li>so my skin will get use to it, so far my skin is ok</li>
      <li>I have found that this particular mix of retinol and glycolic acid is perfect for me in that it&#x27;s not too strong, not too weak, but just right to keep my skin clear through the mildest kind of peeling so that my face never looks red or irritated.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and notice a remarkable difference.</li>
      <li>I use, not only this cream, but also the Anti-Aging Serum, the Eye Lift Cream and the Total Cleanser, in additon to the resurfacing mask,  which is my favorite thing ever!!.  </li>
      <li>Well, anti-aging indeed, because in two uses, as directed, I looked very much like a pimply-faced adolescent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
      <li>It can be a bit itchy at first until your skin gets used to it, but I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else on my skin at night.  </li>
      <li>When used properly, this helps with safe exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Image never fails to impress.  </li>
      <li>The copy from this company does not say any of this and has a funny horseshoe like thing on it.</li>
      <li>Sadly, (no pun inteneded)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, but I feel as though it gives good coverage.  </li>
      <li>My doctor recomended this line to me and I have slowly started to use more and more.  </li>
      <li>Apparently our facial expressions are connected to the brain activity that allows for a full and healthy range of emotion.  </li>
      <li>Really like this product.  </li>
      <li>A real winner that will always be a staple in my cosmetic case.</li>
      <li>The real product says Taral Plastics on the bottom</li>
      <li>It feels intense on my skin and in the morning my skin looks refreshed.</li>
      <li>I looked very closely at the container</li>
      <li>I love this product,and i really will  recommend to my friends and other who is looking for skin repair.</li>
      <li>I bought the Image night time moisture cream to use on the other nights and that too is lovely.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Put it on at night a few times a week and your skin will noticeably look better.</li>
      <li>I went to my dermatologist today and bought a new container of it.</li>
      <li>keep yor skin very soft and silky.</li>
      <li>Since then My adult onset acne has cleared up along with the fine lines and dark spots I had.  </li>
      <li>--I wasn&#x27;t willing to go as far as the Max Cream b/c it states it messes with neurotransmitters to limit facial expression, thereby limiting or delaying the formation and reinforcement of natural expression lines/wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>Rather than use drying out creams on adult acne at night, I apply this cream and it clears up my skin.  </li>
      <li>the suppression of facial expression is shown (yes, real data) to be correlated with increased depression and flattened affect.  </li>
      <li>I called Image skin care directly to see if they sell to this company</li>
      <li>SO, I decided to try the Total Repair Creme, which features Retinol, the only ingredient clinically proven (no, really) to reduce skin aging signs like fine lines etc.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong and will love your image!</li>
      <li>I am not sure I saw a significant difference in my skin because of the cream or if I saw a difference from another product on this line.  </li>
      <li>Now I can look forward to waking up to clear skin instead of waking up and finding that I&#x27;ve got to find a way to cover the zits or use a teenage acne preparation to get rid of them.  </li>

<li> The jar should last quite a few months.  </li>
<li> Not pretty.  </li>
<li> im only using little by little</li>
<li> It deals with a wide array of skin issues - acne, redness from previous acne, damaged skin, scars, etc.  </li>
<li> Controls breakouts and my skin is less blotchy.</li>
<li> I can say that my skin feels tighter, the lines are less noticable, and the spots have faded.  </li>
<li> less</li>
<li> I use this once a day, it seems to take care of the fine lines that I am desperately trying to slow down!</li>
<li> It still burns at night but just for a few minutes.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements after a few weeks of use.</li>
<li> No matter what cream I used in the past I would always see little pimples and zits from time to time.  </li>
<li> I use the serum in the AM and just the Total Skin Repair at night, if I try to combine the two my face itches and is a bit uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> This is a heavy night cream that makes your skin feel smoother and softer by morning!!  </li>
<li> You are getting fake Junk!!!</li>
<li> Makes me so angry that they are getting away with this!!!!!  </li>

    <li> I love this creme.  My dermatologist had me start using it two years ago.  Since then My adult onset acne has cleared up along with the fine lines and dark spots I had.  One warning, it does make your skin more sensitive to the sun so I recommend using a really good sunscreen too.</li>
    <li> Love this line of skincare... It&#x27;s the real thing! See great results on my old skin.  Lol</li>
    <li> love this.  Use it every nite!</li>

    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using Total Repair Creme for years.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the Image Vital C, and so I thought I&#x27;d up the anti on anti-aging.  SO--I wasn&#x27;t willing to go as far as the Max Cream b/c it states it messes with neurotransmitters to limit facial expression, thereby limiting or delaying the formation and reinforcement of natural expression lines/wrinkles.  Sadly, (no pun inteneded) the suppression of facial expression is shown (yes, real data) to be correlated with increased depression and flattened affect.  Apparently our facial expressions are connected to the brain activity that allows for a full and healthy range of emotion.  SO, I decided to try the Total Repair Creme, which features Retinol, the only ingredient clinically proven (no, really) to reduce skin aging signs like fine lines etc.  Well, anti-aging indeed, because in two uses, as directed, I looked very much like a pimply-faced adolescent.  I assume that&#x27;s not what they meant when they stated anti-aging effects, but yes, all I got from this product was a skin break-out on my face and neck.  Not pretty.  I&#x27;ve discontinued use entirely, and will look for another alternative with Retinol...hopefully it&#x27;s the formula specific to this product and not the Retinol itself that is the problem.</li>
    <li> This product is great!</li>
    <li> Give this product a try!  I promise your face will look more radiant than ever!  I have been using Total Repair now for several years.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great price and product</li>
    <li> My doctor recomended this line to me and I have slowly started to use more and more.  I am not sure I saw a significant difference in my skin because of the cream or if I saw a difference from another product on this line.  I can say that my skin feels tighter, the lines are less noticable, and the spots have faded.  I use, not only this cream, but also the Anti-Aging Serum, the Eye Lift Cream and the Total Cleanser, in additon to the resurfacing mask,  which is my favorite thing ever!!.  I can not, however, use all of them at the same time everyday or my skin will go dry (I am guessing due to the Retinal).  I use the serum in the AM and just the Total Skin Repair at night, if I try to combine the two my face itches and is a bit uncomfortable.  I would absolutly recomend this line to anyone my age (40) and up, just use caution and introduce new products slowly.</li>
    <li> Even my Dr. asked my what I was doing.  She walked into the exam room last week and said, \\&quot;you look amazing\\&quot;.  I told her that my aesthetician told me about Image Skincare 3 months ago and I have been using it religiously.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it anywhere else either.  These guys are GREAT!  I now have 3 others hooked on the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> On time!! but this item was too strong for my skin  im only using little by little so my skin will get use to it, so far my skin is ok n seems like its working.</li>
    <li> I love this product,and i really will  recommend to my friends and other who is looking for skin repair. keep yor skin very soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Image never fails to impress.  I have used a number of their products and they are excellent.  This night cream is excellent.  I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t clog or leave an oily film. There is great coverage.  The jar should last quite a few months.  It is not as thick as the retional A cream and doesn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;Divine Skin Care are an excellent company to deal with and their customer care is excellent.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I can&#x27;t use it daily as it dries my skin out- I believe that&#x27;s because of the retinol.  I can use it about 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Controls breakouts and my skin is less blotchy. More confident without makeup.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Arrived on time. Great product for me.</li>
    <li> Rather than use drying out creams on adult acne at night, I apply this cream and it clears up my skin.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> I use this once a day, it seems to take care of the fine lines that I am desperately trying to slow down!</li>
    <li> The cream goes on smooth, but really tingles on the skin.  I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This is a heavy night cream that makes your skin feel smoother and softer by morning!!  It&#x27;s not too heavy, but I feel as though it gives good coverage.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple months. It still burns at night but just for a few minutes. If you follow the directions it says to use it daily or l2-3 times a week if it irritates you r skin. I don&#x27;t always follow directions. My skin is smoother which is why i keep using it.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by the aesthetician who does my facial peels. I love it. It is the only night cream I have repeatedly reordered. It leaves your skin smooth, your skin looks good in the morning, and tingles a little but feels good on. It is not overly moisturizing, but it&#x27;s enough.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this from my dermatologist for some time so when I saw this being sold on Amazo by ShopXperts for&lt;br /&gt;$20 less I thought I was getting a good buy. When I received it I noticed it smelled and looked different and felt different on my skin as well. The color was off and there was no tingling when I put it on my face. I looked very closely at the container it came in and it looked the same until I looked at the bottom. The real product says Taral Plastics on the bottom and it also says 2oz 58mm. The copy from this company does not say any of this and has a funny horseshoe like thing on it. Just to be sure that it wasn&#x27;t because Image Skincare changed the container they used and the formula of the cream I went to my dermatologist today and bought a new container of it. It still says Taral Plastics and 2oz 58mm and the cream is still the same as it always was. DO NOT BUY from this company. You are getting fake Junk!!! Makes me so angry that they are getting away with this!!!!!  I called Image skin care directly to see if they sell to this company and they do not! They said they don&#x27;t sell to any online retailers and Shopxperts is not an authorized retailer. Learned my lesson- you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My Esthetician uses this product line so I bought this cream.  Because it is a retinol night time repair cream you should not use it every night.  I bought the Image night time moisture cream to use on the other nights and that too is lovely.</li>
    <li> This creme is the perfect, powerful night creme- it moisturizes, repairs, and will give you a smooth look in the morning.  It can be a bit itchy at first until your skin gets used to it, but I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else on my skin at night.  This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  Although it is a repair creme for aging, I use it on acne.  It regenerates your skin over night.  It deals with a wide array of skin issues - acne, redness from previous acne, damaged skin, scars, etc.  I highly recommend it.  The price on amazon is outstanding.  This often runs for 70 dollars in a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Best night cream on the market hands down!  I have tried everything and this stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer!  I was paying almost double for this product!  Protects your face from the sun!  I will continue to purchase.</li>
