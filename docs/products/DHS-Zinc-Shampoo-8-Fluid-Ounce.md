      <li>Good stuff</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I wish it worked for me because it smells nice and is good for my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!</li>
      <li>my dermatologist recommended it, love it!   </li>
      <li>Although some people swear by this, I found that it is ok and does a good job but still prefer the t-sal or t-gel.</li>
      <li>They are all nice.</li>
      <li>Admit it isn&#x27;t 100% as effective for me as Nizeral was</li>
      <li>but so far nothing, just great results!</li>
      <li>Found TGel to work better for me.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have miraculous results, but it is getting better.</li>
      <li>Worked ok for me for some time, but then it still got worse.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>T-sal from neutrogena does a better job.  </li>
      <li>I used many shampoos and also tried home treatment</li>
      <li>I love that.    </li>
      <li>Make sure to generously condition afterwards.</li>
      <li>I use this product for many years and it works for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still sticking to my Head and Shoulders Hair Endurance for Men which smells better than the DHS shampoo and helps relieve my symptoms.</li>
      <li>I used this product every day for the first week and saw amazing results!</li>
      <li>Give you a hint, you need to eat more greens and juice</li>
      <li>My head itches a ton, and there is still more flaking</li>
      <li>This zinc shampoo is pretty good</li>
      <li>I will say that the shampoo is incredibly drying, especially since you have to leave it on for about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>GREAT SMELL  LEAVES HAIR SOFT AND</li>
      <li>but I think my dandruff problem was way too strong for this shampoo.</li>
      <li>and its been a fine balance for me.</li>
      <li>It works fine</li>
      <li>It clears my scull and keeps it flake free.</li>
      <li>I finally went to see dermatologist and took some doxycycline hyclate and all my acne are gone in 2 weeks lol.</li>
      <li>My daughter is trying this product out based on the fabulous reviews on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I get best results when I use it everyday.</li>
      <li>This is a nice shampoo if you have sensitive skin and easily irritated scalp issues.</li>
      <li>This was the second item I tried (giving each trial 1 week minimum) and I was thrilled to discover it worked!</li>
      <li>I developed scalp psoriasis from what seems like nowhere, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many shampoos and products in attempt to &#x27;cure&#x27; it.</li>
      <li>I read all about the benefits of zinc and how therapeutic this product is well,it doesn&#x27;t  possess any extraordinary features over head and shoulders and even the printing on the tube came off in the shower after 1 week,</li>
      <li>I found it here on Amazon through the help of other kind reviewers and am so glad.</li>
      <li>No unpleasant smell (like all the others I tried).  </li>
      <li>&quot; If my scalp is already irritated I can use the zinc and it seems to calm it.</li>
      <li>Oh some more good news is as you age (over 50) this becomes more difficult.</li>
      <li>After YEARS having dermatitis and buying and using Nizeral with success</li>
      <li>The DHS products that I have used all seem to be very conscious of sensitivities and easily irritated skin.  </li>
      <li>I will say the product is working OK, her scalp is barely better if any at all, if it is it is not a HUGE change.</li>
      <li>but it still works very very well.  </li>
      <li>The great thing is that it is not harsh like the tar shampoos which do a number on your scalp especially if you live in a sunny climate like Florida.  </li>
      <li>Note: when I used for first time , dandruff cleared off my scalp and came on my hair.</li>
      <li>I had it all, the whole gammet!</li>
      <li>It is pretty pricey.</li>
      <li>this will have a positive effect.</li>
      <li>My head gets really itchy and also I get pretty horrid flakes off of my head</li>
      <li>It is really helping.</li>
      <li>However when using this shampoo it does help with my itchy scalp however really causes my hair to become very brittle</li>
      <li>would much prefer a non scented brand.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s very misleading that they list the ingredients on here and leave those two out.</li>
      <li>I used this product for about a month without producing any real results.</li>
      <li>/&gt; dries out the hair and is designed for very oily hair.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>This has really helped my scalp dermatitis.  </li>
      <li>For the price of the shampoo, I was really hoping it would work</li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle but didn&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
      <li>I never, never thought I would find something that really works as much as this does</li>
      <li>I suffer a mild to moderate case of seborrheic dermatitis and this product hasn&#x27;t helped me very much.</li>
      <li>To clean up the blood system/liver/digestive system is a whole different matter.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is really thin and as for the smell, I did not hate it or love it.</li>
      <li>I have a scalp condition called dermatitis, with itchiness and flakes , it does not help more than a regular Selsun Blue or Head and shoulders.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend giving this one a try.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this, and it just doesn&#x27;t work at all for me</li>
      <li>She really dislikes the smell (it is not a very fresh clean smell),she</li>
      <li>The Zinc shampoo is especially nice when I have \\&quot;bad scalp days\\</li>
      <li>This product was recommended to me by my Dad who has sensitive skin and a very itchy, flaky scalp.  </li>
      <li>My daughter did not have the same success with this as I did so</li>
      <li>This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve used that actually relieves the itchiness I feel from my dermatitis.</li>
      <li>I bought this about a week and a half ago and have used it three times since, and my scalp psoriasis has lessened by a HUGE amount.</li>
      <li>I may actually be able to wear my hair down the next time I wash it.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended this Zinc and the Clear shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have Psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>After trying many other shampoos for my 15 year old son with flaky dry scalp (so embarrassing!)</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of the dry patches on my scalp but has certainly restored some of the moisture on my skin.</li>
      <li>This is why when you take a antibiotic (do not recommend) will clear it up this problem for a short time.</li>
      <li>This left my hair soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>I Will go back to my old shampoo</li>
      <li>For those who haven&#x27;t found anything that worked for their dermatitis or dry scalp conditions yet, I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but if you have scalp problems this will most likely clear it up.  </li>
      <li>Their are other products with zinc on the net try search for ZincPlex that offer a combination that will treats your hair in a gentle way with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We as men lose our hair and get dirty from day to day operations and life. This will stop you from that oily and scratchy scalp. A must buy</li>
    <li> Worked ok for me for some time, but then it still got worse.&lt;br /&gt;Then I switched for a variety of products and finally &amp;#34;Head And Shoulders Clinical Strength&amp;#34; works the best.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have no dandruff. I guess it can be different result for others but I still want to post it here to give others another option.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair so I use conditioner maybe once a week.  However when using this shampoo it does help with my itchy scalp however really causes my hair to become very brittle I have to use conditioner every time I use this shampoo as a follow-up</li>
    <li> I am using this for my seborrhea dermatitis of the scalp. It is really helping. I use this 3x a week &amp; leave it on 2-4 minutes. I occasionally alternate this also with SEBULEX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, I had to use the steroid hair foam for control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HTH</li>
    <li> After I came to US dandruff has become severe. I used many shampoos and also tried home treatment but none worked. This one came like a miracle for me!  Note: when I used for first time , dandruff cleared off my scalp and came on my hair. I combed it off and that&#x27;s it from second wash I did not see any dandruff  I would recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended it, love it!   GREAT SMELL  LEAVES HAIR SOFT AND MANAGABLE  ADDS LOTS OF VOLUME AND TEXTURE!     will buy again.</li>
    <li> I cannot vouch for how much this shampoo helped my scalp because the first time I tried it, the smell and texture were so awful, I never used it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended by my skin doctor to help with my thinning hair.  I am not sure if it is working except to make me feel like I am not causing additional damage.  It is pretty pricey.</li>
    <li> This product targets Seborrheic Dermatitis or Scalp Pimples with Zinc. Zinc (drys the hair) targets the serious bacterial imbedded at the root base. It does not work overnight (30 day treatment once or twice per day)but in a day or two you will feel the difference. This product works but it real&lt;br /&gt; dries out the hair and is designed for very oily hair. It you have dry hair I recommend a different shampoo. Their are other products with zinc on the net try search for ZincPlex that offer a combination that will treats your hair in a gentle way with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST ALSO KEEP IN MIND that the hair root is feed by the blood system and you may have to address your diet to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; this bacterial infection. This is why when you take a antibiotic (do not recommend) will clear it up this problem for a short time. However it comes back doesn&#x27;t it! It does because you have not used the shampoo to remove the bacteria/fungus at the root hair.  To clean up the blood system/liver/digestive system is a whole different matter. Give you a hint, you need to eat more greens and juice this will have a positive effect. I know you wanted to buy some shampoo or take a pill and did not want to hear this.  Good luck with that! Oh some more good news is as you age (over 50) this becomes more difficult. Now you know why physicians can not solve this problem because they do not address your eating habits. Dermatologist usual go with a topical or antibiotic and now you know the rest of the story. Therefore you stay in a YoYo type of problem. I know it happened to me.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years based on my Doctor&#x27;s recommendation. It does the job for me and I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help my dandruff, which may be dermatitis. then again, nothing else has helped.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this shampoo a few days ago. I read the ingredient list here on amazon, oh hey, no mention of fragrance or dyes.... The shampoo comes in today, and I read the ingredient list on the bottle itself and I notice that it has both fragrance and yellow dye.....of course they fail to mention that on here. I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance, so now I have a shampoo that I can&#x27;t use.  That&#x27;s very misleading that they list the ingredients on here and leave those two out.</li>
    <li> I developed scalp psoriasis from what seems like nowhere, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many shampoos and products in attempt to &#x27;cure&#x27; it. Coal tar, salicylic acid, and even extremely expensive prescribed shampoos didn&#x27;t work. I bought this about a week and a half ago and have used it three times since, and my scalp psoriasis has lessened by a HUGE amount. I may actually be able to wear my hair down the next time I wash it. I&#x27;m so relieved that I finally found something that works. I will say that the shampoo is incredibly drying, especially since you have to leave it on for about 20 minutes. Make sure to generously condition afterwards.</li>
    <li> I use this product for many years and it works for me. It clears my scull and keeps it flake free. There are no unwanted additives and after 15 years of usage I am still happy.</li>
    <li> Works great. Great buy. Great value.</li>
    <li> I have Psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin.  My dermatologist recommended this Zinc and the Clear shampoo. (I also tried the conditioning rinse.) They are all nice. The DHS products that I have used all seem to be very conscious of sensitivities and easily irritated skin.  I have been using them for a while now and I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  The Zinc shampoo is especially nice when I have \\&quot;bad scalp days\\&quot; If my scalp is already irritated I can use the zinc and it seems to calm it. I love that.    · Bottom line:  This is a nice shampoo if you have sensitive skin and easily irritated scalp issues. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve used that actually relieves the itchiness I feel from my dermatitis. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past three weeks. It hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of the dry patches on my scalp but has certainly restored some of the moisture on my skin. For those who haven&#x27;t found anything that worked for their dermatitis or dry scalp conditions yet, I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> Great smell works well.</li>
    <li> I used the whole bottle but didn&#x27;t see the difference. I had pretty heavy acne problem for 8 years and it was getting worse when I bought the product. At that time I was really suffered by acne on my head skin, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t help with that...I finally went to see dermatologist and took some doxycycline hyclate and all my acne are gone in 2 weeks lol.</li>
    <li> Nothing unseen before. I have a scalp condition called dermatitis, with itchiness and flakes , it does not help more than a regular Selsun Blue or Head and shoulders.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a couple of weeks and it appears from the 1st day my scalp has improved.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has struggled with sebhorrheic dermatitis for years.  I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  She is so very happy as well as am I with the results!  Her scalp is clearing up and only after a few weeks at twice a week.  I will definitely keep this product on hand.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended by my Dermatologist for my itchy scalp.  I am happy with the results it has give me..&lt;br /&gt;I would order again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff….if you have scalp itching issues this will help.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have miraculous results, but it is getting better. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month. I get best results when I use it everyday. and yes using it everyday doesn&#x27;t cause any problems.</li>
    <li> My daughter is trying this product out based on the fabulous reviews on Amazon. I will say the product is working OK, her scalp is barely better if any at all, if it is it is not a HUGE change. She really dislikes the smell (it is not a very fresh clean smell),she would much prefer a non scented brand. She will finish the bottle but I think we will be moving on to try something else. Also, after in the shower one time all of the black lettering on the bottle has been chipping off, leaving black debris on your hand and the shower floor which is kind of annoying, as the bottle and its lettering should be water proof.</li>
    <li> No unpleasant smell (like all the others I tried).  Leaves hair somewhat dry. I do leave on for 4 minutes, rinse and then use a little Clear Anti Dandruff shampoo for a few seconds and rinse.  It seems to make hair softer without itch returning.  You do have to shampoo twice a week.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed with this product.  It works fine but it does not get rid of the scales.  T-sal from neutrogena does a better job.  Although some people swear by this, I found that it is ok and does a good job but still prefer the t-sal or t-gel.</li>
    <li> I suffer a mild to moderate case of seborrheic dermatitis and this product hasn&#x27;t helped me very much. My head gets really itchy and also I get pretty horrid flakes off of my head so I was hoping this shampoo would help deter these symptoms. Unfortunately, it did not help me that much. For the price of the shampoo, I was really hoping it would work but it didn&#x27;t. I used this product for about a month without producing any real results. The shampoo is really thin and as for the smell, I did not hate it or love it. I&#x27;m still sticking to my Head and Shoulders Hair Endurance for Men which smells better than the DHS shampoo and helps relieve my symptoms. I&#x27;d still recommend you to try this shampoo just in case it works for you.</li>
    <li> After trying many other shampoos for my 15 year old son with flaky dry scalp (so embarrassing!) I found this one. It works great! Flakiness has cleared up and even though he showers every day because of his sports, there is no irritation from the shampoo. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo after i got a sample at the dermatologist&#x27;s office. My scalp&#x27;s itching/burning was getting pretty bad and i have been trying different shampoos that have not help. As of today, my scalp is doing good--no more itching and burning and the redness has decreased to slight pink spots. The only thing that i have been using in addition to DHS shampoo and conditioner is John Masters Scalp purifying shampoo which I am alternating every other time I wash my hair. I am glad this is working for me; I did not know that the scalp could get that painful.</li>
    <li> This did not work well for me unfortunately. I still have flaking and scale build up from psoriasis with little difference.  It doesn&#x27;t smell badly like many other treatment shampoos but it just didn&#x27;t work and made my hair rather dry.  I guess it&#x27;s back to the expensive prescription shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> SO disappointed with this shampoo. I read a ton of the reviews and decided to buy the smaller bottle to see how that would work for me, and well it doesn&#x27;t work at all. My head itches a ton, and there is still more flaking then I want. Going back to the T-Sal shampoo I&#x27;ve been using. I had high hopes for this, and it just doesn&#x27;t work at all for me and I really believe it made my head worse then before I was using it. I know that different things work for different people, and this just isn&#x27;t the shampoo for me at all.</li>
    <li> I have battled oily scalp which in turn has created other skin irritations, infections, sores, flakiness, and extreme itchiness! I had it all, the whole gammet! I used this product every day for the first week and saw amazing results! Now I have limited it to once a week and its been a fine balance for me. My initial concern, as a women, was if it would leave my hair too dry or interfer with my colored hair but so far nothing, just great results! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> After YEARS having dermatitis and buying and using Nizeral with success I was horrified when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere outside of a $50 per bottle price tag so I begain trying other products fearing the worst!  I&#x27;d tried other things in the past before finding Nizeral and they had all been epic failures!  This was the second item I tried (giving each trial 1 week minimum) and I was thrilled to discover it worked! Admit it isn&#x27;t 100% as effective for me as Nizeral was but it is SO close I hesitate to even mention the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 improvement I would ask for is to get rid of the medicine smell.  Just because it&#x27;s medicated shampoo doesn&#x27;t mean it has to smell like one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will caution it may not work for everyone though.  My daughter did not have the same success with this as I did so we are still trying out things for her.  For me - it&#x27;s a relief!  I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> Been great for my scalp when Rx shampoos wouldn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
    <li> Probably will not order again.  Head is still itching after using for several months.  I Will go back to my old shampoo</li>
    <li> I read all about the benefits of zinc and how therapeutic this product is well,it doesn&#x27;t  possess any extraordinary features over head and shoulders and even the printing on the tube came off in the shower after 1 week,pretty sorry excuse for quality control</li>
    <li> This zinc shampoo is pretty good and I see an improvement, using it on a weekly basis.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and it always just eliminated my dandruff.  The last bottle I used does not seem to control my dandruff any longer.  I don&#x27;t know if the product has changed or if I have become desensitized to the chemicals. I just know that I now have a dandruff problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dewey Reinhard</li>
    <li> I have seborrhea.  Use pine tar soap and shampoos and added DHS Zinc shampoo in an effort to cut down on the itch.  Zinc shampoo does give me a few hours of relief.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help with my dandruff at all.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This did help my seborrhea dermatitis in my hair!!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me but I think my dandruff problem was way too strong for this shampoo. It still works well if your not that bad.</li>
    <li> DHS Zinc Shampoo did not help with my dandruff problem. I&#x27;ll keep trying different products until I find one that does work.</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This has really helped my scalp dermatitis.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been a life saver.  I have suffered with dandruff for 20+ years and I have tried everything, literally, prescription and OTC to get rid of it.  I actually tried this before and it didnt work too well but I realized I need to use it everyday.  I dont usually rinse and repeat but it still works very very well.  It does not clear up the problem entirely for me but it is 80% improved.  The itch and the flakes are greatly diminished.  The great thing is that it is not harsh like the tar shampoos which do a number on your scalp especially if you live in a sunny climate like Florida.  I never, never thought I would find something that really works as much as this does and I never have written an Amazon review before but this deserves it.  The only downside is that it is a little runny and leaving it in place usually means getting it in my eyes a bit.</li>
    <li> Removed the itchiness but I neded up buying TGel next since it didn&#x27;t remove my build-up. Found TGel to work better for me.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t cure my dandruff but that might just be me.  I must need something else.  This left my hair soft and silky.  Some dandruff shampoos are harsh and damaging, not this.  I wish it worked for me because it smells nice and is good for my hair.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my Dad who has sensitive skin and a very itchy, flaky scalp.  I got the gene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but if you have scalp problems this will most likely clear it up.  It&#x27;s hard to find at pharmacies so I just gave up and ordered it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This shampoo solved the problem I&#x27;ve had with itchy scalp since I was a teenager. Nothing else worked. I found it here on Amazon through the help of other kind reviewers and am so glad. I don&#x27;t use any conditioner with it and my hair is in great condition. (I even color my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Stuff works!  If you need a shampoo like this, then this is the best one on the market. I bought 5 at one time.</li>
    <li> My is scalp no longer itchy. I had tried other shampoos for sensitive and itchy scalp and none of them worked like this one does. At least for me. I highly recommend giving this one a try.</li>
