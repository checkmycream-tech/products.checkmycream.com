      <li>Exact same product used in the Physical Therapy department I visit.</li>
      <li>Since I developed hives and extensive dermatitis after having this product used on my skin prior to a stress test, I cannot recommend it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a very good product as a protective barrier and helps adheres the Ostomy bag to the skin and you are able to keep on for up to seven days. Convatec makes, I think, the best the best products and I have used many different ones. Allkare protective wipes are easy to use and are priced reasonable.</li>
    <li> A Hospice nurse brought some of these out to use on the heels of  an elderly bedridden lady.  She was getting reddened areas on her heels from lying in bed, even though we turned her often and tried to keep her heels elevated.  They worked well.  We now use them as needed when her heels start to get red.  They will not work on an area that does not stay dry.  We were directed to wipe the moist towlette across her heel, let it dry and wipe again to create layers of barrier.</li>
    <li> AlKare, is used to make a layer between your skin and sticky dressing going on it. Like medical tape, bandaids, Tagaderms, VAC drape. AlKare becomes sticky like contact glue that holds your dressing down even better than the sticky on the dressing. This is so when you pull it off, you pull against the AlKare sticky, not your skin. Helps protect the skin.</li>
    <li> I reviewed a similar product called Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film Wipes, which I purchased through Amazon.  (see review entitled \\&quot;Lots of dressing changes? Fragile skin? -- Try This Product\\&quot;).    I have also used this product (the AllKare Protective Barrier Wipes).  They are just as good as the Cavilon product.    Cavilon has in each packet a small square of fine sponge (like foam-rubber) soaked with the barrier solution.  AllKare has a small square of thick paper or cotton fabric (like thick paper-towel).    This stuff is great.  I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s readily available online.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous different proctective wipes, but this brand surpasses those brands. I longer have to worry about wafer leaks and skin irritants.  Keeps my urostomy appliance safely intact.</li>
    <li> This product is a protection for skin to use before putting on ostomy appliance.  It is gentle on skin and helps with adhesion.</li>
    <li> I agree about the size being  a bit small.  It does help some to unfold it before use.  But the product is a truly great skin protectant.   Your pads are too small to get good coverage</li>
    <li> Very good wipes that allow steri strips or band aids adhere better to the skin.</li>
    <li> Allkare Protective Barrier Wipes - Box of 100 - by Convatec needed for care of ostomy and were reasonably priced</li>
    <li> If you have a urostomy these are the best. The barriers adheres better then anything else we&#x27;ve used. One of the best features is that it cleans off of the skin at changing time. Little to no extra remover needed.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin around the stoma these wipes will help you control irritation and rash.  They aren&#x27;t necessary for all.  Many stoma supplies do not require the extra adhesive quality that these wipes provide but some do.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my sister-in-law, who always uses this brand.  She&#x27;s convinced there isn&#x27;t any better.  Will always order from this company.</li>
    <li> BEST PRODUCT FOR MY NEEDS.  PRICEY.</li>
    <li> Makes the removal of large adhesive film bandages extremely easy and comfortable.  The fluid creates a second skin, reducing the pain or irritation to the skin.</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic with an insulin pump.  These barrier wipes are the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  They keep my pump site in place through numerous showers, swimming in the pool, and even going to the beach.  I would recommend these for anyone that needs to protect their skin, plus keep a mild adhesive device in place for days!!</li>
    <li> Protects surrounding skin while caring for a wound</li>
    <li> This  product is getting harder to find, and that&#x27;s a shame because it is so good.  Allows bandages to stick well and lets the adhesive come off when you&#x27;re done!</li>
    <li> Since I developed hives and extensive dermatitis after having this product used on my skin prior to a stress test, I cannot recommend it. The ingredients are listed on this document, page 4, if allergies are a concern for you.  [...]</li>
    <li> Outstanding Item for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re looking to purchase  this Item this is the place.&lt;br /&gt;100% satisfied with purchase. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am a type one diabetic and on the Omni Pod insulin pump. I use there barrier wipes every time I change my site and put a new insulin pod on. The work great to help keep my pod on and they help protect my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and as advertised</li>
    <li> Exceptional product.  Very mildtothe skin.</li>
    <li> i use this every other day &amp; find it is a great product for clensing the arera you are prepairing to cover, i recomend this very good</li>
    <li> Great product.  Provides a thicker protective film than some other protective barrier wipes.  Dries somewhat tacky which helps in adhesion tape applied over the AlKare.  Like product for use under kinesiology type tapes.</li>
    <li> I use an insulin pump and it glues to my skin. I have ultra sensitive skin and the glue causes  blisters and welts. Using this stops it cold. It&#x27;s not greasy or impossible to wash off. If forms a comfortable barrier. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming,  slightly like nail polish remover, but nowhere near as potent. And the biggest plus, no skin breakdown since using these. I totally recommend them.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in perfect condition, as though I purchased it directly from a brick and mortar store.  I would not think twice about purchasing any future products from this vendor.  Of course, since I have been licensed as a Professional Nurse; having a MSN and MBA, I would keep this vendor at the top of the list for this type of product.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised and saves your skin. I should have tried them along time ago. Give it a try especially for diabetes pump users lie the Omnipod</li>
    <li> Works well as part of a two-step plan, with the adhesive remover being used first.</li>
    <li> Does the job.Realy helps keep the stoma barrier on.price cheaper than medicare price. Glad we got them as back up.</li>
    <li> Wipes are too small to handle.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to protect my skin under adhesive derma patches since my skin is very sensitive.  It kind of worked but the area I needed to cover was very small and found it difficult to wipe it on with the towelette. It is very sticky,glue like. I think it would work better with an applicator instead of the &amp;#34;towel&amp;#34; I ended up buying some paper tape to apply under my patch.</li>
    <li> Exact same product used in the Physical Therapy department I visit.</li>
    <li> very good product and really creates a fine barrier.</li>
    <li> These are still the best!  I&#x27;ve used four or five other brands and they don&#x27;t provide a strong and sticky surface.  The &amp;#34;Allcare&amp;#34; leaves a very sticky surface if you don&#x27;t try to rub it in, just wipe on.  For ostomy work, count on using at least two and maybe three pads but the resultant surface gave a very high safety record.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve used these now for since 2012 and they give excellent results!  Just be careful and take your time.</li>
    <li> Although this product does not quite match the quality of the product I get from the doctor&#x27;s office, it is usable.  Arrived on time, and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I use this wipes because I wear a insulin pump and they help my infusion set stick better. Good product.</li>
    <li> These AllKare Protective Barrier Wipes are very effective at protecting sensitive skin from repetitive tape bandaging. I have very sensitive skin and, due to a chronic condition, have needed bandaging on several areas of my body for over a year now. Before using this regularly, I would periodically get a reaction from the adhesive or ripping when removing the tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this to freshly cleaned skin and allowing it to thoroughly dry before bandaging works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended! I have also used [[ASIN:B002NS5GGA Smith &amp; Nephew 54420400 Skin-prep Protective Dressing Wipes - Box of 50]], which also works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> These are a great product.  I am a diabetic who wears OmniPod insulin pumps, which have to be adhered to my skin for 3-day wear, and this adhesive layer works well in concert with the adhesive on the pump, giving them greater dependability.</li>
    <li> Not much to get excited about- they work, &amp; they&#x27;re what the hospital uses.  Very sticky, but that&#x27;s the point.</li>
    <li> These have been great.  They really help when it is time to change a bandage by providing a &amp;#34;barrier&amp;#34; between the skin and bandage.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, does what it is supposed to, but maybe 100 is too many. They are sealed and stay fresh but I only use 1 wipe every 20-30 days so a box of 100 may last me over 6 years. You might want to save some money and get the box of 50.</li>
    <li> Wonderful I take them to dialysis.</li>
    <li> works well.  Fast and accurate delivery of product</li>
