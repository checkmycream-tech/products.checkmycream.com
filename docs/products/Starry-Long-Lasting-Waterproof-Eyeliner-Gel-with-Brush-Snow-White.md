      <li>Unforgettable Eyes!  </li>
      <li>The brushes are great!</li>
      <li>It is awesome</li>
      <li>Also awesome that it comes with the brush!</li>
      <li>♥</li>
      <li>GREAT PRICE FOR A GREAT PRODUCT!  </li>
      <li>This is great for under eye makeup or even designs.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>This worked great.</li>
      <li>Great eyeliner.</li>
      <li>and it came out great.</li>
      <li>This was a great product esp given the price.  </li>
      <li>Made my eyes water a bit but with the help of some quetips all was good.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this eyeliner!</li>
      <li>It slides on so smooth and looks great.</li>
      <li>Not to mention It glides on nicely</li>
      <li>Nice price, and exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>I liked the applicator it came with too.</li>
      <li>However, I have to keep checking my mirror and use lots of Qtips to keep it tidy all day.</li>
      <li>Alright, I&#x27;m going to be honest here.</li>
      <li>This is NOT that kind of eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Very easy to blend in.</li>
      <li>This is so easy to put on and it stays!</li>
      <li>Generally speaking, gel eyeliners tend to be waterproof, therefor an excellent choice for the waterline below your eye.  </li>
      <li>Goes on more easily than I would have thought!</li>
      <li>Goes on very smoothly, with a lot of control.</li>
      <li>good ideal to make it water resistant, yet strangely makeup remover proofed?!?}</li>
      <li>Works so much better than pencil.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE EASE OF APPLYING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I have 3 colors and I will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>Tried more brands than I would admit to my husband and was quite discouraged.    </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find white gel in the stores and I was very happy with the service and product.</li>
      <li>power is better</li>
      <li>I would order more if needed though..</li>
      <li>and I still love it more than any eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smooth and comes with it&#x27;s own brush.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Very happy with the application and how it wears all day long when I use it.</li>
      <li>Product works best if a layer of loose powder is applied before adding the liner.</li>
      <li>It is as white as a piece of paper and very, very bright.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice, but not as bright white as I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>It smudges really easily and it isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
      <li>I may still look for something more \\&quot;professional\\&quot; from Ben Nye, RCMA, or something in special FX makeup.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s chalky, won&#x27;t apply smoothly.</li>
      <li>I just received my order today and tried it and overall it was great.</li>
      <li>so it kind of stands out too much.</li>
      <li>The box even says \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot;, but the title says \\&quot;waterproof.\\&quot; With all that said; I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars because it goes on really smooth, and you get a lot for the money.</li>
      <li>That can&#x27;t be too healthy, right?</li>
      <li>First of all, I love this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Not exactly what I was looking for, but it works great.</li>
      <li>Its very smooth, not thick or oily.</li>
      <li>Fades too quickly.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, lasts all day, no irritation, and it&#x27;s really a pretty color.</li>
      <li>For a couple of bucks though, I am overall pleased because smooth application is important to me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, but a little bummed about it not being water proof.</li>
      <li>Anyway, the color is nice and bright, but it goes on kinda thin.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s really good for giving a subtle white tint that I really liked. :)</li>
      <li>It does go on smoothly and easily, however, so for ordinary use, it&#x27;s not bad - just could be better.</li>
      <li>This item was purchased specifically for it&#x27;s waterproof abilities as non waterproof makeup tends to melt right off your face 8 months out of the year here in Arizona.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s really nothing special about it.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s perfect to add under or over your color...adds a little extra sparkle.</li>
      <li>&amp; you get a real great opaque line, not easy to find white eyeliner that does that.</li>
      <li>This is more of a sparkle than actual color.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand or product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s matte and has no shimmer, which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I love this item and will definitely purchase additional colors!</li>
      <li>but I wanted to be able to make the inner corners pop.</li>
      <li>However, once smudged, it does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
      <li>The white is really more of a metallic silver, which really brightens up your eyes.</li>
      <li>I really need a much more \\&quot;solid\\&quot; looking white line than what I can achieve with this.  </li>
      <li>Smooth, a nice icy white color, but by no means water proof or even really water resistant.</li>
      <li>The color is solid white which I love!</li>
      <li>The main purpose I bought this eyeliner was so I could do Halloween make up with it!</li>
      <li>I really wanted a waterproof gel eyeliner.</li>
      <li>and I really like.</li>
      <li>Very disheartening</li>
      <li>It can be very flaky.</li>
      <li>It doesnt apply and adhere as it should and it doesnt even really want to come out of the pan.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I own quite a few gel liners</li>
      <li>Added bonus: The brush it comes with is nice and small and does a decent job!</li>
      <li>After using this liner I can now say it&#x27;s true; it does make your eyes look bigger, however, the liner is NOT waterproof as it claims.</li>
      <li>You only need to apply it once on and it will last the whole day; however, if you are going to line your waterline, I suggest touching it up every so often to maintain the brightness</li>
      <li>But then again, when you live in an arid climate, the cost is worth it to keep from looking like a sad, sad, melted little clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good packaging, smooth consistency, true bright white color, cute &amp; extremely soft eye gel brush {straight not angled} is included, but not waterproof as advertised, so much as made in china water resistant, and makeup remover proof.</li>
      <li>I thought the pigmentation would be kinda grayish and it wouldn&#x27;t be high quality but</li>
      <li>3 stars because if the crushed, damaged box it came in but the shipping envelope was just fine.</li>
      <li>I bought as an inexpensive trial run to see if I really want an expensive white gel eyeliner from MAC or Inglot, but it wasn&#x27;t a very good test because it doesn&#x27;t look opaque for more than a few seconds.</li>
      <li>I actually ended up sleeping with it on my eyes, and in the morning, it was gone like my body absorbed it or something.</li>
      <li>I was in search of a highly pigmented white gel liner and did not want to spend the cash on MAC Chromaline or Inglot AMC Gel Liner right away.</li>
      <li>This product can right on time and goes on the skin perfectly white.</li>
      <li>Temp wise, it&#x27;s hard to know, as currently it&#x27;s only ninety degrees here.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m left to wonder if it&#x27;ll stand up to temperatures thirty degrees higher like I need.</li>
      <li>I am thinking about seeing if I can also use it as a long lasting eyeshadow as well, that&#x27;s how smoothly it goes on.</li>
      <li>On my upper lid it lasted all day, but on my lower lid (which is obviously subject to more moisture) I had to reapply it.</li>

    <li> I really wanted a waterproof gel eyeliner. Generally speaking, gel eyeliners tend to be waterproof, therefor an excellent choice for the waterline below your eye.  Anyway, the color is nice and bright, but it goes on kinda thin.  I went back later and added another coat...not sure if it made a difference or just pushed around the first layer already there.  I may still look for something more \\&quot;professional\\&quot; from Ben Nye, RCMA, or something in special FX makeup.  I really need a much more \\&quot;solid\\&quot; looking white line than what I can achieve with this.  It does go on smoothly and easily, however, so for ordinary use, it&#x27;s not bad - just could be better.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is much brighter than expected, so if you don&#x27;t want it obvious to everyone around you that you&#x27;re wearing white eyeliner, you have to smudge it a bit. I use it on my bottom lash line to make my eyes look brighter. However, once smudged, it does exactly what I need it to do. My eyes look bigger and bluer.</li>
    <li> Product works best if a layer of loose powder is applied before adding the liner. Couldn&#x27;t find white gel in the stores and I was very happy with the service and product.</li>
    <li> I wear glasses and wanted a white eyeliner pencil for my waterline.  Tried more brands than I would admit to my husband and was quite discouraged.    Finally thought I needed to shake it up a bit, so I decided to try a pot eyelined.    Thais one works! Goes on more easily than I would have thought!</li>
    <li> this product is sooooo not waterproof. i got it to line my waterline but it was not waterproof so it did not stay leaving me abgry with with eyeliner everywhere</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand or product and I really like. It goes on smooth, lasts all day, no irritation, and it&#x27;s really a pretty color.</li>
    <li> For the price you get a lot of eyeliner! Not to mention It glides on nicely &amp; you get a real great opaque line, not easy to find white eyeliner that does that. Also awesome that it comes with the brush!</li>
    <li> This item was purchased specifically for it&#x27;s waterproof abilities as non waterproof makeup tends to melt right off your face 8 months out of the year here in Arizona. Immediately upon opening the package I read over the product info, and soon notice the words \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot; are all up on the box. I was like, \\&quot;Didn&#x27;t I order the waterproof stuff?\\&quot; So I go back to the computer, and low and behold, \\&quot;Waterproof\\&quot; miraculously becomes \\&quot;Water Resistant\\&quot; somewhere in the shipping process. Anyway, I test ride it, &amp; put it on, and no kidding, this stuff is hard to get off w/ regular makeup remover. I used it on my waterline, and of course you don&#x27;t want to rub any of the delicate eye tissue too much, so I gave up after a few passes of remover dipped on a Q tip. I actually ended up sleeping with it on my eyes, and in the morning, it was gone like my body absorbed it or something. That can&#x27;t be too healthy, right? {Is that a made in China good ideal to make it water resistant, yet strangely makeup remover proofed?!?} Temp wise, it&#x27;s hard to know, as currently it&#x27;s only ninety degrees here. So, I&#x27;m left to wonder if it&#x27;ll stand up to temperatures thirty degrees higher like I need. Maybe I should have just forked out the 4X higher cost for my usual waterproofed Bobby Brown Gel Eyeliner. But then, she doesn&#x27;t currently have white that I&#x27;ve seen at least, and sepia and other colors can actually run you upwards of $45. Whew! That&#x27;s a lot of money for eyeliner! But then again, when you live in an arid climate, the cost is worth it to keep from looking like a sad, sad, melted little clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good packaging, smooth consistency, true bright white color, cute &amp; extremely soft eye gel brush {straight not angled} is included, but not waterproof as advertised, so much as made in china water resistant, and makeup remover proof. Three stars for the old waterproof bate and switch trick.</li>
    <li> This is more of a sparkle than actual color. But it&#x27;s perfect to add under or over your color...adds a little extra sparkle.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love this eyeliner. I have 3 colors and I will be ordering more. It slides on so smooth and looks great. I&#x27;m used to eyeliner that I only put on once a day. This is NOT that kind of eyeliner. It smudges really easily and it isn&#x27;t waterproof. not at all. lol. That being said, I will still order it. It is awesome and I still love it more than any eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. The brushes are great!</li>
    <li> Alright, I&#x27;m going to be honest here. I&#x27;ve never bought makeup from Amazon and told myself I never would, but your girl here was in desperate need of white gel eyeliner and no stores sold it around me. So I did the unthinkable. I bought makeup off Amazon and it was...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best decision I&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this eyeliner. I thought the pigmentation would be kinda grayish and it wouldn&#x27;t be high quality but boy oh boy, was I wrong. The preview picture does not do this eyeliner a justice. It is as white as a piece of paper and very, very bright. It&#x27;s matte and has no shimmer, which is exactly what I was looking for. It goes on so smooth and comes with it&#x27;s own brush. You only need to apply it once on and it will last the whole day; however, if you are going to line your waterline, I suggest touching it up every so often to maintain the brightness but you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> 3 stars because if the crushed, damaged box it came in but the shipping envelope was just fine. My son got a hold of it and dug his little finger in ut before I even got the chance to use it... Anyway after that I tried it out and there&#x27;s really nothing special about it. It&#x27;s white eye liner and it does it&#x27;s job. I would order more if needed though..</li>
    <li> Having not heard much of this brand (very few blog reviews exist), I was worried that the product would not deliver the pigmentation I was looking for. I was in search of a highly pigmented white gel liner and did not want to spend the cash on MAC Chromaline or Inglot AMC Gel Liner right away. I love this item and will definitely purchase additional colors! Added bonus: The brush it comes with is nice and small and does a decent job!</li>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner because I heard that applying white liner to the inside of the bottom eyelid makes your eyes look bigger. After using this liner I can now say it&#x27;s true; it does make your eyes look bigger, however, the liner is NOT waterproof as it claims. On my upper lid it lasted all day, but on my lower lid (which is obviously subject to more moisture) I had to reapply it. The box even says \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot;, but the title says \\&quot;waterproof.\\&quot; With all that said; I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars because it goes on really smooth, and you get a lot for the money.</li>
    <li> It does smear a little bit but if your like me and put eyeshadow over your eyeliner this eyeliner is for you. The main purpose I bought this eyeliner was so I could do Halloween make up with it! And it was great for that! I submitted a picture of what I used it for. A great buy!</li>
    <li> Unforgettable Eyes!  A Little Eye Sparkle Goes a Long Way! BABY!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner! I use it as an eyeshadow but it works wonders. Its very smooth, not thick or oily. Very easy to blend in. I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I like using the white to accent other eyeliners already applied. However, I have to keep checking my mirror and use lots of Qtips to keep it tidy all day.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was looking for, but it works great. Nice price, and exceeded my expectations. Goes on very smoothly, with a lot of control. I use it to line my bottom water line. I am thinking about seeing if I can also use it as a long lasting eyeshadow as well, that&#x27;s how smoothly it goes on.</li>
    <li> Love this. I love the black and white 2 tone mix. And this helps.</li>
    <li> This was a great product esp given the price.  I use white eye liner and have always had trouble in the past getting the pencils to show up unless I heated them which was messy. This worked great. I liked the applicator it came with too.</li>
    <li> I just wish it was not so sparkly to me. I use almost nothing but matte makeup so it kind of stands out too much. Though it is very white if that is your only concern</li>
    <li> Works so much better than pencil.  Very happy with the application and how it wears all day long when I use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s chalky, won&#x27;t apply smoothly. Fades too quickly. Thought as a gel eyeliner would be waterproof but it&#x27;s not. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today and tried it and overall it was great. It is not water proof but it&#x27;s staying power is better&lt;br /&gt;If you apply a white eyeshadow over it. The color is solid white which I love! However, the brush it comes with does not compliment the eyeliner itself for application. I have plenty of brushed so I used my eyeliner angled brush and it came out great. Made my eyes water a bit but with the help of some quetips all was good. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, but a little bummed about it not being water proof.</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have the opacity or staying power to make that claim. It&#x27;s more of a cream shadow, but it creases badly, so it&#x27;s out for that too. I bought as an inexpensive trial run to see if I really want an expensive white gel eyeliner from MAC or Inglot, but it wasn&#x27;t a very good test because it doesn&#x27;t look opaque for more than a few seconds. Slightly shimmery. Will not work as an eyeshadow base because of the emollient quality. Not great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I decided to try out the gel route because white eye pencils do not work on me (eye pencils in general, really - not sure why) but I wanted to be able to make the inner corners pop. This is so easy to put on and it stays! It&#x27;s opaque and long-lasting. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product can right on time and goes on the skin perfectly white. This is great for under eye makeup or even designs. I am so happy I purchased this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to put this eyeliner on. The brush is awful. It works well to lighten the corner of your eyes but I wouldn&#x27;t use it an eyeliner by itself. It can be very flaky. Goes on like a Crayola crayon. The white is really more of a metallic silver, which really brightens up your eyes.</li>
    <li> Smooth, a nice icy white color, but by no means water proof or even really water resistant. For a couple of bucks though, I am overall pleased because smooth application is important to me (I don&#x27;t want to be pulling and tugging around the eye by any means!) and it does stay on through out the day.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this, she does a black and white cat eye and loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, but not as bright white as I was hoping for. But it&#x27;s really good for giving a subtle white tint that I really liked. :)</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE FOR A GREAT PRODUCT!  I WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN. I LOVE THE EASE OF APPLYING THIS PRODUCT. ♥</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner. Use it on my bottom lid to make my eyes pop!</li>
    <li> I am a licensed make up artist and i needed a gel liner for a project. I own quite a few gel liners but this one was the worst by far. Its cakey not creamy. It doesnt apply and adhere as it should and it doesnt even really want to come out of the pan. Very disheartening</li>
