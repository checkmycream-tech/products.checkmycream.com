      <li>wonderful, love it!</li>
      <li>Worked great</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>This hand is great for State Board Exams, I bought already shaped nails</li>
      <li>The price is great as well.</li>
      <li>Great for school.</li>
      <li>and they stuck on great.</li>
      <li>very  nice for practice</li>
      <li>and oh  don&#x27;t forget to plug your selfhow a remarkable artist you are</li>
      <li>Good buy</li>
      <li>I purchased this to attach and paint my artifcial nails before applying them to my own hands.</li>
      <li>Very good price and fast shipment.</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>This is for you to practice on the hand to invent your own nails and watch they look so pretty that you will design your own nails and watch the compliment come your way</li>
      <li>I am just getting into painting intricate designs on nails and this realistic hand has been a great help to me.</li>
      <li>Hand does come off of the stand easily while handeling, so make sure it is secure while painting.</li>
      <li>The hand just spins on the stand and comes off way to easy.</li>
      <li>This works just fine for practicing.  </li>
      <li>It is not the light skinned ivory color on the box.</li>
      <li>Love my hand just wish i had the whole set up.  </li>
      <li>Bright pink, and the fingers are not flexible at all.</li>
      <li>This item was both affordable and useful, it was bought as a gift for an aspiring Nail Tech; because she is still in grade school she cannot have false nails, and therefore could not experiment with acrylics, the mannequin hand proved affective and was a great deal to boot!!!</li>
      <li>I really am thinking of returning it!</li>
      <li>I ended up using hot glue, which is ok if you want them t be permanent and only</li>
      <li>My first issue with this product is the color of the hand.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I need to practice on.  </li>
      <li>pretty much had to use pinky sized nails on all 5 fingers and do some filing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a LONG standing Amazon customer and so pleased with everything I purchase we get.</li>
      <li>On the other hand the stand was fine and would have been useful otherwise.</li>
      <li>Shipping was decent, and I don&#x27;t regret my purchase.</li>
      <li>The main problem I had was with the fingers, they do not stay bent and the part that connect to the stand broke off.</li>
      <li>Also the normal nail glue did not work.</li>
      <li>The pink color will NOT be true to the nail polish that you are working on so the shade may change.</li>
      <li>I bought this item because it was clearly stated in the description \\&quot;practice hand with flexible fingers...</li>
      <li>They are completely unprofessional.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this product what so ever this is no way near a professional practice hand.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s working out</li>
      <li>It is more like a thick glove that has been inflated.</li>
      <li>Not sure if any nails will fit on this hand.</li>
      <li>This is basically a hand shaped soft and somewhat thick rubber balloon filled with air)&lt;br /&gt;You</li>

<li> Just not what I expected.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s came correctly but I got a pink hand!</li>
<li> and i feel it was a waste of my money</li>
<li> Not very happy it was not what I expected</li>

<li> I was looking forward to getting this; however it had arrived in a torn box and the stand was broken.  </li>
<li> The hand was not flexible so that part is false</li>
<li> , unfortunately I wanted to use it to practice putting on acrylic tips.</li>
<li> The color is reddish and unrealistic a waist of money.</li>
<li> horroble to handle, horrible to work on , totally not the type of flexible rubber fingers that I had hope for.</li>
<li> and well, the fingers do not bend, therefore it is useless!  </li>
<li> I needed for a photographic prop and it looks very fake.</li>
<li> I am disappointed and returning it.  </li>
<li> totally useless!!</li>
<li> However, I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product as well as the company that makes this product.</li>
<li> nail beds are horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looks nothing like the picture. The color is reddish and unrealistic a waist of money. I should&#x27;ve just purchased one from the local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t polish this hand and you can&#x27;t put press on nails on it..totally useless!!</li>
    <li> The main problem I had was with the fingers, they do not stay bent and the part that connect to the stand broke off.</li>
    <li> This item was both affordable and useful, it was bought as a gift for an aspiring Nail Tech; because she is still in grade school she cannot have false nails, and therefore could not experiment with acrylics, the mannequin hand proved affective and was a great deal to boot!!!</li>
    <li> GAVE TO MY NAIL SALON</li>
    <li> I purchased this to attach and paint my artifcial nails before applying them to my own hands. I use a sticky putty to keep them in place. So far it&#x27;s working out ok. The hand is a little stiff and the fingers don&#x27;t stay bent, but I can pick it up and turn as needed to and do a much nicer job on my nail art. Hand does come off of the stand easily while handeling, so make sure it is secure while painting. Shipping was decent, and I don&#x27;t regret my purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hand for state board.  There is a portion that I will need to place hand in a water bowl and well, the fingers do not bend, therefore it is useless!  I really am thinking of returning it!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to getting this; however it had arrived in a torn box and the stand was broken.  The fingers are not flexible like it had described in the description. I am disappointed and returning it.  They are completely unprofessional.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of items on Amazon. Usually, the products are what the description states them to be. Not the case with this &#x27;Pro Practice Mannequin Hand&#x27;. The fingers do flex but they do NOT hold their pose. To state otherwise is flat out lying. Amazon should remove this item from their page.</li>
    <li> My first issue with this product is the color of the hand. It is not the light skinned ivory color on the box. It is a strange reddish pink color looking like someone stayed out in the sun way too long and got a horrible burn. The second issue is the fingers bend but return to their prior position as soon as you let them go. There is nothing internally to help it hold a position. It is more like a thick glove that has been inflated. The hand just spins on the stand and comes off way to easy.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with this item. For one thing the nail bed was way to small to fit normal sized fake nails..pretty much had to use pinky sized nails on all 5 fingers and do some filing. Also the normal nail glue did not work. I ended up using hot glue, which is ok if you want them t be permanent and only practice nail design, unfortunately I wanted to use it to practice putting on acrylic tips. It wasn&#x27;t ideal. Just not what I expected. On the other hand the stand was fine and would have been useful otherwise.</li>
    <li> This works just fine for practicing.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet but intend to have it as a display and samples on it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it was clearly stated in the description \\&quot;practice hand with flexible fingers... Fingers can be bent and adjusted. They retain position until you move them.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Fingers certainly do NOT stay bent, not a second!! This is basically a hand shaped soft and somewhat thick rubber balloon filled with air)&lt;br /&gt;You will end up with this one and only shape.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend it if you are looking for bendable fingers that retain position!!!&lt;br /&gt;Plus, no nails.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product what so ever this is no way near a professional practice hand. I cant do acrylic nail on it and the finger beds are deep and its junk.</li>
    <li> Love my hand just wish i had the whole set up.  Great for school. It was everything hat i thought it would be</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter to practice painting nails. Good buy</li>
    <li> horroble to handle, horrible to work on , totally not the type of flexible rubber fingers that I had hope for. nail beds are horrible.</li>
    <li> Really not capable of practicing acrylic on here.</li>
    <li> Hand is pink and not flesh colored.  Fingers are not adjustable.  Nail beds cannot accommodate standard acrylic nails.  Not sure if any nails will fit on this hand.</li>
    <li> The fingers do not bend like it says.I brought it to practice doing acrylic nail but i am not getting anywhere with it.I will not buy this product again and i feel it was a waste of my money</li>
    <li> Used this for an artist&#x27;s model. Works great.  I wish the fingers were bendable but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s came correctly but I got a pink hand!</li>
    <li> This hand is great for State Board Exams, I bought already shaped nails and they stuck on great. Very good price and fast shipment.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to use for my state board. When it  arrived, the hand was purple.  I could not use it. Product description said nothing about it not being the color shown. When I asked to return it for a refund I was denied! So now I have a purple hand, that I paid for, I have no use for, as well as had to buy another hand.</li>
    <li> This was a falsely advertised, the fingers don&#x27;t bend and stay in place the mannequin hand is some hard. My advise don&#x27;t order this product.</li>
    <li> Used for my boards. Worked great</li>
    <li> It is perfect!  Exactly what I need to practice on.  The stand helps for state board purposes.  The price is great as well.</li>
    <li> This is for you to practice on the hand to invent your own nails and watch they look so pretty that you will design your own nails and watch the compliment come your way and oh  don&#x27;t forget to plug your selfhow a remarkable artist you are</li>
    <li> It was red n the fingers weren&#x27;t totally flexible they did bend but wouldn&#x27;t stay bent. Not very happy it was not what I expected</li>
    <li> The hand was not flexible so that part is false i order it for my state board</li>
    <li> wonderful, love it! Daughter practice painting nails on it and it works out perfectly...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a LONG standing Amazon customer and so pleased with everything I purchase we get. However, I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product as well as the company that makes this product. The hand is PINK not \\&quot;flesh\\&quot; color as shown. The fingers on the hand will not \\&quot;bend\\&quot; and hold their position.  The pink color will NOT be true to the nail polish that you are working on so the shade may change.</li>
    <li> I am just getting into painting intricate designs on nails and this realistic hand has been a great help to me.</li>
    <li> Bright pink, and the fingers are not flexible at all.</li>
    <li> It was used and box was open.</li>
    <li> It was. not what I expected. I needed for a photographic prop and it looks very fake. The fingers could not be moved into position.</li>
    <li> very  nice for practice</li>
