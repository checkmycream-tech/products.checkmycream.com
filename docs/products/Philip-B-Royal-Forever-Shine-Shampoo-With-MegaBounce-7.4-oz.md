      <li>Fabulous shampoo and amazing scent!</li>
      <li>not even to mention how good it smells:) I just love it.</li>
      <li>The scent I think is lovely, but it is very strong, so if you don&#x27;t like resin/incense/heavy warm scents this might not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped fast, good price.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m certainly glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay $75 to try it, but I&#x27;m undecided whether I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
      <li>My hair is colored and it is healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>It became my favorite when I tried it along with the condiccioner 2 years ago.</li>
      <li>And, I do think it makes my hair more shiny and manageable.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>i was able to find a good price on amazon, as opposed to bloomingdales, where i first saw this product........</li>
      <li>if this was the greatest shampoo in the world when it comes to thickness, bounce, or shine, there is no way anyone sensitive to powerful lingering perfume smells could use</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this shampoo is it smell good that is all.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair and this shampoo gives me the volume I need to style my hair the way I want to.</li>
      <li>it gives my baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Fast service, smells amazing.</li>
      <li>In fact, it is day two for me and my hair still smells very fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling weightless and clean, (a cleaning that lasts almost a week,  </li>
      <li>Not a bad thing.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather up much, but feels very rich when distributing into your hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>I guess i can deal with it, as long as it gives my hair good volume.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and definitely leave my hair shiny.</li>
      <li>I started using Philip B several months ago and find it an amazing product.</li>
      <li>For me the jury is still out on whether it is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>So worth the price.</li>
      <li>but definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>Yes, the shine is there, but so is the unexpected and welcome extra body.  </li>
      <li>Hair was softer and shinier after first use.</li>
      <li>Overall, I love this stuff...</li>
      <li>A LOT IN THE MIDDLE EAST----SAUDI ARABIAN PRICESSES,  THE REAL MONEY PEOPLE!!!!  </li>
      <li>did not use a large amount at all, so please no comment that I used too much.</li>
      <li>the shampoo works very well.</li>
      <li>I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T &amp;#34;</li>
      <li>very perfume fragrant...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a hairstylist and recommend this whole line of products to my clients.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know that it really gives me that MegaBounce.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE SEEN HIM IN ACTION!!!  </li>
      <li>hair feels super clean after using this and not weighed down by product.  </li>
      <li>so I may only use it for special occasions.</li>
      <li>TAKE A LOOK AT HIS FLOCK OF ULTRA SHINY HEALTHY DARK HAIR.....</li>
      <li>My very fine and dry hair has definitely improved by using this shampoo!</li>
      <li>perfume smell is so powerful you can smell it in the room when you open the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it did live up to the hype......</li>
      <li>but this one was new for me.  </li>
      <li>My hair is a dark blonde and when I use them together, they deposit too much color in my hair that makes it a very rich caramel.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong unappealing scent that takes a full day to air out.</li>
      <li>But if you are sensitive, like I am, you have been warned.</li>
      <li>, they do not turn out to be more expensive than other fine hair products.</li>
      <li>I have used other Phillip B shampoos and really like them</li>
      <li>It is difficult to pour out which makes it very easy to use only a tiny</li>

<li> I have used other Phillip B shampoos and really like them</li>
<li> It is difficult to pour out which makes it very easy to use only a tiny</li>
<li> This is a very thick shampoo that does leave your hair clean and shiny.  </li>
<li> It is very expensive but it satisfies me completely. :)</li>
<li> It is pretty thick and seems to clump in one place rather than spread out and work into the hair.  </li>
<li> The consistency is different from other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
<li> It really did give volume to my lately flat thin curls.</li>
<li> I have fine, wavy hair, prone to frizz or go limp, hard to find product that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down but still helps tame the frizz.</li>
<li> Very thick...almost like very thick cream.  </li>
<li> I realize the awful, powerful, lingering perfume smell might not bother people who are not sensitive to powerful perfume smells.</li>
<li> You only need a small amount in your palm, add some water, rub your hands together and then apply to your hair.  </li>
<li> Feeling not fresh.</li>
<li> Love how it works but hate how it smells.</li>
<li> It is expensive, but thanks to Amazon, it&#x27;s much less expensive than buying direct from Philip B.</li>
<li> I do not know why it is not full bottle.</li>
<li> I used very, very little of the product.</li>
<li> Not sure that I will by again.  </li>
<li> I can only theorize there is so much awfully pungent perfume in this hair shampoo because maybe some of the ingredients on their own smell bad.</li>
<li> it is so strong and awful, in my opinion.</li>
<li> I had high hopes, but am disappointed in the lack of results.  </li>
<li> It is just hard to get out of the container as it is so thick.</li>
<li> The only thing about it is because it&#x27;s not filled with nasty sulfites, it does not soap up as much as regular shampoo.  </li>
<li> The shampoo is very, very thick, making it hard to squeeze out of the bottle.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s expensive , so i use a small amount.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen results that dramatic.  </li>
<li> So, to mask that odor they filled this with a lingering perfume that is annoying and unpleasant and so bad</li>
<li> Too expensive to purchase again.</li>
<li> wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though.</li>
<li> It gives you bounce and thickness without any dirty or build-up feeling.  </li>
<li> This shampoo was very expensive</li>
<li> It dirties my hair and it is very expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells amazing and definitely leave my hair shiny. Beautiful product. Too expensive to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used other Phillip B shampoos and really like them but this one was new for me.  I purchased it on the claim of &amp;#34;mega-shine&amp;#34; but I will continue to purchase it based on the extra volume it gives my baby fine hair.  Yes, the shine is there, but so is the unexpected and welcome extra body.  His shampoos tend to run on the pricey side but they are so concentrated, you use just a tad, they do not turn out to be more expensive than other fine hair products.</li>
    <li> Gives hair great shine and smells luscious</li>
    <li> Fabulous shampoo and amazing scent!</li>
    <li> This shampoo was very expensive and frankly I could not tell any difference in my hair after using it.  The shampoo is very, very thick, making it hard to squeeze out of the bottle.  I had high hopes, but am disappointed in the lack of results.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I do not know why it is not full bottle. Feeling not fresh. Although very cheap, but I do not think it is good. It is different between  I bought from store before.</li>
    <li> bought for my sister and she loves it, adds shine and lustre!</li>
    <li> I started using Philip B several months ago and find it an amazing product. I have baby fine hair and this shampoo gives me the volume I need to style my hair the way I want to. It is expensive, but thanks to Amazon, it&#x27;s much less expensive than buying direct from Philip B.</li>
    <li> The fifth ingredient is perfume, and my gosh it is so strong and awful, in my opinion. I can only theorize there is so much awfully pungent perfume in this hair shampoo because maybe some of the ingredients on their own smell bad. So, to mask that odor they filled this with a lingering perfume that is annoying and unpleasant and so bad I cannot continue to use the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume smell is so powerful you can smell it in the room when you open the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if this was the greatest shampoo in the world when it comes to thickness, bounce, or shine, there is no way anyone sensitive to powerful lingering perfume smells could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of \\&quot;Forever Shine,\\&quot; it should be named \\&quot;Forever Smell.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use a large amount at all, so please no comment that I used too much. I used very, very little of the product. It is difficult to pour out which makes it very easy to use only a tiny amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the 5th ingredient is perfume. That speaks for itself. I realize the awful, powerful, lingering perfume smell might not bother people who are not sensitive to powerful perfume smells. But if you are sensitive, like I am, you have been warned.</li>
    <li> My very fine and dry hair has definitely improved by using this shampoo! It looks and feels healthier and is easier to manage. I love this product!</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this shampoo is it smell good that is all. It dirties my hair and it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick shampoo that does leave your hair clean and shiny.  It does smell good.  It is just hard to get out of the container as it is so thick.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Hair was softer and shinier after first use. I have fine, wavy hair, prone to frizz or go limp, hard to find product that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down but still helps tame the frizz. The scent I think is lovely, but it is very strong, so if you don&#x27;t like resin/incense/heavy warm scents this might not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped fast, good price.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I&#x27;m a hairstylist and recommend this whole line of products to my clients. You won&#x27;t be dissatisfied</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  The only thing about it is because it&#x27;s not filled with nasty sulfites, it does not soap up as much as regular shampoo.  You only need a small amount in your palm, add some water, rub your hands together and then apply to your hair.  It does deposit some gold flakes to your hair, but not enough to look like you&#x27;re a wanna be Las Vegas show girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels super clean after using this and not weighed down by product.  My only recommendation is to use this OR Forever Shine conditioner, but don&#x27;t use them together.  My hair is a dark blonde and when I use them together, they deposit too much color in my hair that makes it a very rich caramel.  Not a bad thing.  A great, great product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome! It became my favorite when I tried it along with the condiccioner 2 years ago. Even without the condiccioner the shampoo works very well. Leaves my hair feeling weightless and clean, (a cleaning that lasts almost a week,  and I have oily hair)  not even to mention how good it smells:) I just love it. It is very expensive but it satisfies me completely. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read a review in a fashion magazine that presented this shampoo as the greatest thing since volumizer.  The reviewer said she noticed an instant improvement in volume and shine.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen results that dramatic.  For me the jury is still out on whether it is worth the price.  The consistency is different from other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.  It is pretty thick and seems to clump in one place rather than spread out and work into the hair.  It also seems to knot up my hair as I&#x27;m working it into my hair.  I have no idea why.  I&#x27;m certainly glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay $75 to try it, but I&#x27;m undecided whether I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> very perfume fragrant...even my husband commented on it...had to give it to a friend</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know that it really gives me that MegaBounce.  Not sure that I will by again.  Too $$.</li>
    <li> I CAN GO ON FOR DAYS ABOUT PHILIP B.&#x27;S LINE OF HAIR CARE!!!  THIS MAN WORKS A LOT IN THE MIDDLE EAST----SAUDI ARABIAN PRICESSES,  THE REAL MONEY PEOPLE!!!!  THEY ARE CONSTANTLY CALLING FOR HIM AND HE LEAVES HIS CELEBRITY CLIENTELE IN BEVERLY HILLS TO TAKE CARE OF ROYALTY!!!  I HAVE SEEN HIM IN ACTION!!!  HE CAN WHIP A HEAD OF HAIR INTO PLACE IN NO TIME!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;AND TAKE A LOOK AT HIS FLOCK OF ULTRA SHINY HEALTHY DARK HAIR.....THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES!!!!  TRY TO SEE HIM ON A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE!!!!  I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T &amp;#34; GET IT &amp;#34; UNTIL I &amp;#34; GOT IT&amp;#34;!!!!!!!!SO GIRLS ( and guys )...........GET IT!!!!!!!  I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO READ YOUR REVIEW DESCRIBING YOU SHINY LOCKS!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very thick...almost like very thick cream.  Doesn&#x27;t lather up much, but feels very rich when distributing into your hair and scalp. I didn&#x27;t mind the scent at all. In fact, it is day two for me and my hair still smells very fresh and clean.  It gives you bounce and thickness without any dirty or build-up feeling.  And, I do think it makes my hair more shiny and manageable. Overall, I love this stuff...it is pricey so I may only use it for special occasions.</li>
    <li> great shampoo....it&#x27;s expensive , so i use a small amount.  i was able to find a good price on amazon, as opposed to bloomingdales, where i first saw this product........it did live up to the hype......wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though. but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser said this shampoo cost 100 dollars. So worth the price. My hair is colored and it is healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> Fast service, smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been a Khiels(tea tree shampoo and Formula 133) user for 20years. I have tried many products of varied prices and nothing is as great as this Philip B shampoo.</li>
    <li> It really did give volume to my lately flat thin curls. Love how it works but hate how it smells. It has a strong unappealing scent that takes a full day to air out. I guess i can deal with it, as long as it gives my hair good volume.</li>
