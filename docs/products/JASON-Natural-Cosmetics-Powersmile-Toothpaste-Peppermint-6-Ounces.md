      <li>A great natural toothpaste, but don&#x27;t expect whitening or strong plaque prevention.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be supporting businesses in your own community.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nonfluoride, which is important to me.  </li>
      <li>I really, truly, honestly did.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a toothpaste free of sls and fluoride but didn&#x27;t like the Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand because of the texture.</li>
      <li>No artificial preservatives in this product as many toothpastes have.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s incredibly whitening in my experience, but my teeth are left clean and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
      <li>My smile rocks!</li>
      <li>and I feel better using something more natural.</li>
      <li>There are better tasting natural toothpastes out there if that&#x27;s a top priority for you.  </li>
      <li>And yes, my teeth feel squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>I recommend using a toothpaste that is natural and has healthy ingredients to promote better oral health.</li>
      <li>Teeth feel so clean.</li>
      <li>It has a pretty good taste, and very refreshing definitely a natural tone of peppermint, but ever since I switched my teeth have been noticeably more yellow</li>
      <li>I am a bit of a toothpaste fanatic and this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Nor is it full of toxic chemicals.</li>
      <li>For natural toothpaste it&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>
      <li>Everyone in the family likes it, but we hesitate to use other peoples,&#x27; toothpaste lol</li>
      <li>and I have fresh breath and clean teeth.  </li>
      <li>It is super minty</li>
      <li>I would consider this a mild mint flavor and it is so bubbly and foaming.</li>
      <li>I love that the peppermint is strong enough to make my mouth fresh,  but not so over-powering that it makes my mouth burn.</li>
      <li>yum yum fresh and minty.</li>
      <li>It seems to make you think that you will have fresh breath for days after using it though, so there is that.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a more natural toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I like to use more natural products.</li>
      <li>The only kind of toothpaste I use.</li>
      <li>fresh feeling and cleans plaque ...</li>
      <li>Jason - Powersmile has no sodium laurel or laureth sulfates, no fluoride, no artificial colors, no preservatives, no artificial sweeteners, no saccharin, and no propylene glycol.</li>
      <li>but if it works it will be worth it.</li>
      <li>Has just the right consistency.</li>
      <li>We normally use Tom&#x27;s fluoride free toothpaste but tried this because it was on sale.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I are on a quest to resort to more natural, environmentally friendly products and steer clear of fluoride in our toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I wish it were available in Japan (where I live).</li>
      <li>VERY intensely minty.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this product.  </li>
      <li>and i&#x27;ve had visual buildup more often.</li>
      <li>how people with the same issue had better check ups after using Jason&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Finally,  it is so reasonably priced!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This toothpaste is everything it is advertised to be except pleasant to the taste.  Since taste is a matter of taste, I will concede that I may be too tough in my evaluation.  Good product that could be better.</li>
    <li> I try other natural toothpastes but I keep coming back to this one. It is super minty and I get compliments all the time ( even when I go to the dentist) about how white my teeth are. I moved to another state and couldn&#x27;t find it locally. Thankfully I found it here on Amazon. No more trying others. Why give up a good thing?</li>
    <li> always on my electric toothbrush that continually keeps my teeth clean!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is amazing.  It is very pleasant and whitening.  I have one by the bathroom sink, one in the shower, one in the gym bag, and one at work!  Great product and seller!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like to use more natural products. I have used the mainstream toothpaste brands, as well as some of the other natural lines, but I absolutely love this toothpaste. I actually enjoy brushing because of the wonderful, refreshing scent and consistency! And I noticed that my teeth look considerably whiter, healthier and shinier, than when I use other brands. I want to continue using this!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product.  I like the fact that it does not burn my lips like regular toothpaste.  I am still waiting to see the whiter teeth as promised by the product, but time will tell.</li>
    <li> My smile rocks! And people notice. Besides, it&#x27;s all natural. Need I say more?</li>
    <li> This is the best natural toothpaste I have tried.  Really like the mint flavor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been telling folks about it for over 10 years. Family, friends, dentists, zoo animals - whoever will listen. I&#x27;m a toothpastevangelist. Used to get plaque on the inside part of my bottom teeth. Used Crest, Colgate, etc and Listerine but the plaque remained. And so did the hygienist w/the metal scraper. No plaque since using this toothpaste. Bonus: brush your tongue and you&#x27;ll never have bad breath. There are limits of course: a whole foods diet and daily flossing are a must. One drawback is it doesn&#x27;t whiten my teeth, but i don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste, but too pricey.  I used it like 10 years ago and it was much minty-er...not so much this time.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste! Husband and I switched from Colgate after learning about dangers of fluoride and other chemicals in toothpastes. Tried several that didn&#x27;t leave the &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; we are looking for, but this has everything we want. We also love the Jason one with tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> We have researched and checked the ingredients on almost every toothpaste brand out there, and Jason is the one brand that doesn&#x27;t have any bad ingredients in it. We used to use Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but it has sodium laurel sulfate (SLS), which is supposed to be bad for you. Jason - Powersmile has no sodium laurel or laureth sulfates, no fluoride, no artificial colors, no preservatives, no artificial sweeteners, no saccharin, and no propylene glycol. Despite being all natural, the peppermint flavor is a fresh peppermint taste, it doesn&#x27;t taste nasty.</li>
    <li> I always buy this toothpaste and have used it for a long time.  It works well on my teeth.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are fans of Jason&#x27;s toothpaste. I don&#x27;t buy products from companies that test on animals so that really leaves me limited since SO many companies test on animals (Crest-Proctor and Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, AIM- Church and Dwight, etc) I also like that Jason products are a lot healthier than the other products on the market. I highly recommend this toothpaste. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Great product, just as advertised and good packaging. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I normally use tom&#x27;s whitening toothpaste, decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; and get the jason powersmile this time around. It has a pretty good taste, and very refreshing definitely a natural tone of peppermint, but ever since I switched my teeth have been noticeably more yellow and i&#x27;ve had visual buildup more often. I should note that I smoke and drink a lot of coffee, but I think that the fluoride/ingredients in tom&#x27;s just were better and more effective for me. A great natural toothpaste, but don&#x27;t expect whitening or strong plaque prevention.</li>
    <li> Great product, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever had, makes my mouth feel so much better than name brands, without all of the chemicals!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this tooth paste because my stomach has a fluoride intolerance especially after a night of drinking. I have not had that problem since using this toothpaste and its the only one I will use. 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a total toothpaste/weird taste snob.  I never wanted to try a natural toothpaste because I was afraid of the taste.  So, did my research and found this product had the best reviews as far as taste goes.  I&#x27;ve gone through 2 tubes now and can confirm this stuff is as close to colgate as you can get!  It is super potent minty freshness!  Zero chalky or salty flavor that I imagine would possibly result with other varieties.</li>
    <li> Best all natural toothpaste I have ever used (and i have trialed many)!  Love the strong peppermint taste and my teeth feel amazing after.  So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> Definitely notice teeth were whiter</li>
    <li> For natural toothpaste it&#x27;s pretty darn good. I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is looking for natural solution</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste.  I recommend using a toothpaste that is natural and has healthy ingredients to promote better oral health.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the chemicals that aren&#x27;t in it--and thanks to the other helpful reviewers for all their detailed information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s great and minty.  And yes, my teeth feel squeaky clean.  However…I&#x27;ve only used about a third of the tube and the toothpaste is slowly turning to cement.  I can hardly squeeze it hard enough to get it out.  So I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> One of the few toothpastes that do not have Xylitol or other ingredients that cause stomach upset for sensitive people like me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered several times and continue to like this product.</li>
    <li> yum yum fresh and minty. Everyone in the family likes it, but we hesitate to use other peoples,&#x27; toothpaste lol</li>
    <li> The jury is out until I have used the entire tube.  The taste is a little strong but if it works it will be worth it.</li>
    <li> Gum issues resolved. Chemicals gone. Healthy gums--back. My dentist said get rid of bleach and additives. Jason did it for me.</li>
    <li> I wanted a toothpaste free of sls and fluoride but didn&#x27;t like the Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand because of the texture. I read a review about this toothpaste in a magazine and decided to give it a try. I love it! It&#x27;s smooth and very minty and my mouth definitely feels clean after using it. It tastes like candy canes! This is what I buy every time now.</li>
    <li> So after reading how bad fluoride is for you when deciding if my daughter will get fluoride drops, I decided my husband and I should also make a change. He has bad dental checkups all the time even on prescription toothpaste and I read the reviews on here how people with the same issue had better check ups after using Jason&#x27;s. I saw people complaining about the taste - to me it tastes just like you popped a couple chicklets. It&#x27;s a fresh minty taste but goes away after a little while, just like the gum. Left my teeth feeling extra cleaning without residue left that I got with Crest Prohealth. It&#x27;s a little off putting looking at it - kind of the color and looks the texture of white clay but don&#x27;t let that turn you off, the rest of it is just like other toothpaste. I will update with more experience. Only reason I gave it a four was because we don&#x27;t have long term use of this and don&#x27;t know how it will do with our teeth over time.</li>
    <li> This is only toothpaste I buy. I LOVE this product and the product is 5 star, however the price for it is nonsense. It&#x27;s way too high when you can buy it cheaper at the store and you wouldn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping.</li>
    <li> a lot cheaper with Puritan.s Pride</li>
    <li> This is available for a lower price at my local health food store! Why would it be priced higher? just because of organic tag?</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothpaste. I am a bit of a toothpaste fanatic and this is perfect. I would consider this a mild mint flavor and it is so bubbly and foaming. My mouth always feels squeaky clean after using this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much I really like that though.  It&#x27;s a little harsh.  It seems to make you think that you will have fresh breath for days after using it though, so there is that.</li>
    <li> Clean&#x27;s very well and does not have a strong or bad aftertaste</li>
    <li> Has a great taste and NO poisons! Keeps my smile bright :) Definitely recommended for anyone who wants a clean mouth without artificial sweetners and toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> The main complaint I&#x27;ve heard about this toothpaste is that it has a bad taste or aftertaste.  I did not find this to be the case.  It doesn&#x27;t taste as synthetic or sweet as the average toothpaste, but there&#x27;s nothing unpleasant about the flavor IMHO (I didn&#x27;t notice any aftertaste whatsoever).  The flavor is one of relatively mild, natural peppermint (NOT artificial peppermint flavor, which is pretty different).  There are better tasting natural toothpastes out there if that&#x27;s a top priority for you.  Personally, as long as it&#x27;s not unpleasant, I don&#x27;t really care what my toothpaste tastes like.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, and my teeth feel nice and clean after each brushing.  I&#x27;ve also noticed a slight improvement in the brightness of my smile.  All in all, a good product for the price and lack of synthetic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste - very natural, doesn&#x27;t irritate my chemical sensitivity, tastes great, gets my teeth clean.  My family loves it too!</li>
    <li> Not much to say - I like it, it works and it&#x27;s nonfluoride, which is important to me.  My fave!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! This toothpaste is really whitening my teeth and it&#x27;s helping to keep my teeth healthy.</li>
    <li> Just went fragrance free and this is awesome toothpaste. $7 for toothpaste seems a little steep, but this toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling great for hours and without the harmful toxins and artificial fragrances that other companies use.</li>
    <li> Great product, very effective and refreshing *and* not tested on animals. Nor is it full of toxic chemicals. I wish it were available in Japan (where I live).</li>
    <li> Product delivered as promised</li>
    <li> Great product, please do not discontinue this sku.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an alternative to regular/chemical packed toothpastes on the market.  So far I really like it.  The ingredients are much safer, and the paste itself compares to regular toothpaste- which is a huge plus because I didn&#x27;t want to feel as if I was trading my Colgate for something that wouldn&#x27;t give me long lasting fresh breath.  Overall, very comparable to generic brands and much less harmful.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this.  I really, truly, honestly did.  My husband and I are on a quest to resort to more natural, environmentally friendly products and steer clear of fluoride in our toothpaste.  We normally use Tom&#x27;s fluoride free toothpaste but tried this because it was on sale.  Initially, it did the trick but my husband and I eventually developed strange sensitivity issues for the first time ever, his teeth began to ache like crazy and I developed sores in my upper palate.  We go to the dentist regularly and are not prone to these type of episodes.  We sadly had to resort to a generic Sensydine toothpaste (good luck finding THAT fluoride free) until our mouths were back to normal.  We tried Kiss My Face Aloe Vera toothpaste with similar results to what happened with the Jason brand.  Finally we used Burt&#x27;s Bees fluoride free and it was just as good as Tom&#x27;s, no sores or sensitivity issues when we used it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a more natural toothpaste. It&#x27;s very minty and I like the flavor. I have been using it since October 2012. I wanted to give a true review and not an initial impression. The toothpaste works well and I feel better using something more natural. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s incredibly whitening in my experience, but my teeth are left clean and my mouth feels fresh. Overall I like this toothpaste and enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> I loved this toothpaste - BUT - I&#x27;ve been using consistently for the past couple of month and my mouth is a burning wreck!  Never had this before.  Sore tongue, sore cheeks, and even irritated throat.  The peppermint BLASTS you away!  Which felt good and made you feel really clean but for me I think it is just too strong.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> Good tooth paste although I ordered paste instead of gel for my son. He still likes it and I began using it also. Makes my teeth feel clean, unlike the everyday toothpaste (Colgate, Crest, etc.)</li>
    <li> Does a good job cleaning teeth.  Has just the right consistency. Great flavor. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I had been using Jason&#x27;s Children&#x27;s strawberry flavored tooth gel because of an allergy issue. Now I feel like an adult again! Powersmile has a wonderful flavor, makes my teeth feel absolutely clean, and best of all, doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergy.</li>
    <li> fresh feeling and cleans plaque ... price too high online</li>
    <li> This taste good, and I feel better knowing I am not putting all those chemicals in my mouth.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Foams nicely; leaves mouth feeling clean and teeth looking brighter/shinier</li>
    <li> Stop buying regular toothpaste, it is full of horrible toxins that can cause mouth sores.  After switching to Jason Powersmile I haven&#x27;t had a single canker sore or cavity and my breath feels clean and refreshed all day.</li>
    <li> When they say peppermint to the max, they mean it. VERY intensely minty. However, it&#x27;s one of the best toothpastes I&#x27;ve ever found and always got my teeth very, very clean. Also the whitener seems to work. I was happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and so far I really like this toothpaste.  It tastes good and I have fresh breath and clean teeth.  That&#x27;s all I ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One comment on how you get your toothpaste...I was going to order it but then I noticed that shipping is $1.99.  I only order on-line if I think I will have trouble finding it locally or if it is vastly cheaper.  So, I went on a quick walk to a small market that has alot of organic produce and sure enough it was there...AND cheaper ($5.99).  May I suggest you try to find it locally before ordering because you will most likely pay LESS than $6.28 and you&#x27;ll be supporting businesses in your own community.  I&#x27;ve since seen that my supermarket carries Jason products in their \\&quot;Natural Products\\&quot; section so you could check there while doing your grocery shopping.</li>
    <li> jason power smile natural paste the best,,,here is the only place to find this toothpaste ... (:&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.  It is natural and does not contain flouride.  But I began to notice that my teeth were whiter after using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks.  I drink coffee every day and my teeth need extra care with whitening every once in a while, but not after using this product.</li>
    <li> The only kind of toothpaste I use. Because it doesn&#x27;t cause my mouth to break out.</li>
    <li> I was using Jason Seafresh spearmint gel, but realized it wasn&#x27;t a whitening toothpaste, so I switched to this.  It tastes just fine, being a paste, and definitely whitens (although not a ton).  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have ingredients that are harmful.</li>
    <li> No artificial preservatives in this product as many toothpastes have.  These other toothpastes make my mouth break out in painful ulcers.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely recommend this toothpaste to those who don&#x27;t want all those chemicals while still getting awesome results!</li>
    <li> Tastes great and does a great job cleaning!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been Jason&#x27;s oral hygiene products for many years now. My family tried other natural brands (such as Tom&#x27;s), but I always switched back to Jason&#x27;s when it was available. We just like it better than the others, due to the ingredients that are and are not in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched my family to products with no SLS in them because of the danger of SLS and fluoride (though the latter is really only an issue if it&#x27;s ingested regularly, so we also switched to non-fluoridated water at home). One of my kids was prone to cavities when she was small, so I made sure our dentist would do fluoride treatments on both of the kids and put a sealer on them too. The dental hygienists and the dentist recommended the kids used fluoride toothpaste and mouthwash as well, but I didn&#x27;t want them to if it meant using a brand with SLS in it. However, I did find one that Jason&#x27;s makes with fluoride but no SLS, so I bought that for them. Using that one, plus flossing more and using Jason&#x27;s mouthwash did make a slight difference in how often the one got cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends recently asked me how I keep my teeth so white without professional bleaching. I drink tea and coffee, and I eat berries and drink smoothies, all of which can stain teeth, but my hygienist has often commented too that my teeth don&#x27;t seem to build up much tarter or staining. Now I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to using PowerSmile toothpaste alone, or a combination of it with an Oral-B electric toothbrush, mouthwash and flossing, but if other people who know me, and know what I eat and drink, think my teeth are pretty white for an over 50 person, then I&#x27;ll keep doing it. Btw, I also add food grade 3% hydrogen peroxide to my mouthwash, so that too can help with teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed. Super fresh taste and feel.. Not your average toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Great product for those of us that cannot tolerate sodium lauryl sulfate which can cause canker sores.</li>
    <li> Only used it a few times but love it. Teeth feel so clean.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste! We avoid fluoride at all costs. Several natural fluoride toothpastes taste bad, but Jason is wonderful. We also use the cinnamon flavored as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste! My biggest complaint with natural toothpaste is that my teeth always felt gross a few hours after brushing,  and my mouth didn&#x27;t get that nice clean,  fresh feeling.  JASON toothpaste isn&#x27;t like the others.  My teeth  get very clean with this paste,  and I don&#x27;t get slimy,  gritty feeling teeth by mid morning.  I love that the peppermint is strong enough to make my mouth fresh,  but not so over-powering that it makes my mouth burn. Finally,  it is so reasonably priced!  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
