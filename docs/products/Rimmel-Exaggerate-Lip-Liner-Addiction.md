### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Beautiful color!!</li>
      <li>Perfect Pucker with these liners.</li>
      <li>This is THE BEST lip liner I&#x27;ve ever used it.</li>
      <li>This one is perfect.</li>
      <li>Another perfect color from Rimmel.</li>
      <li>Very good color.</li>
      <li>I think this is a great product for the price.</li>
      <li>Great color which no one else has, creamy (</li>
      <li>Amelia Liana (YouTube guru) said she loved it</li>
      <li>Just loved the color</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lip liner!</li>
      <li>A bit light for my medium coloring but still works great.</li>
      <li>Like all lip liners, it lasts longer than a lipstick, I always find lip liners stay best around the outline of my lips, but the rest of my lips fade, mainly because that&#x27;s the area with lipstick.</li>
      <li>Very creamy, beautiful color.</li>
      <li>Love this color, and am bummed that it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I have eastbend snob and innocent.</li>
      <li>I love the color of this lip liner.  </li>
      <li>however light to tan would be nice.</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and is a beautiful color!</li>
      <li>Go easy; product is creamy and applies easily.</li>
      <li>This is great under lipstick to keep color lasting for many hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite lip liner,but I use it as a full on lipstick.</li>
      <li>Really been enjoying this!</li>
      <li>I have fair-medium skin, and the color looks quite natural under a lightly tinted lip balm (I use Fresh Sugar in Rose).</li>
      <li>However, the color is my favorite, and the price of the liner is quite reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t extend the liner very much because it does break easily.</li>
      <li>Their other great color is Enchantment #070.</li>
      <li>Lost a star because can break easily if one uses too much pressure applying product.</li>
      <li>although a little cakey consistency), great price.  </li>
      <li>I love the color -- it boosts my lips from natural to just-a-few-notches-above-natural</li>
      <li>This is a good enough dupe of the charlotte tilbury lip cheat in pillow talk, and it&#x27;s really creamy.</li>
      <li>Easy glide and creamy soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>I have my favorite lip liner (jordana in tawny) which is a mauve-y purple pink, and I am always buying similar shades to that in lipstick because that&#x27;s just what I have been loving to wear,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light pink.</li>
      <li>I really wish I got a few of the east end snob shade as I am in love!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s re-sharpened and ready to go.</li>
      <li>I really like the design and feel of this liner.</li>
      <li>This is a nice soft pink, and I use a light pink lipstick over it.  </li>
      <li>I always buy this on Amazon since this particular color is Sold out every time I try to find it at Ulta or the drug store.</li>
      <li>Might be a bit too light for very dark skin girls (the east end snob shade)</li>
      <li>I just bought natural here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Really soft and blend</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so natural looking, I wear it every day</li>
      <li>So when I tried this and this was lighter and a bit more pink, I was very excited to have something nude-y but different from my typical everyday lipstick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands with colors that appeared similar, but they were too light or too dark or just didn&#x27;t go on very well.  </li>
      <li>A real thumbs down.</li>
      <li>Must be old, dry and/or a faulty formula.</li>

<li> Many products irritate my sensitive skin, but I have been using this almost daily for over a year and have not had any bad reactions or dryness.</li>
<li> It is long lasting.</li>

<li> I was looking for a lipliner that matched my lips, yet added a slight amount of color.</li>
<li> Unfortunately all out of natural.  </li>
<li> I wear this color both to work and out at night, usually with a slightly lighter lipstick or gloss over</li>
<li> Poor design for a lipstick that does not stay on the lips long.  </li>
<li> I find if i push a little hard the liner will break off but</li>
<li> not chalky or hard</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m medium-pale skinned with fairly thin, pale lips), and doesn&#x27;t stand out too garishly.</li>
<li> Poor quality of the liner medium breaks of and have practically used it all up trying to apply it to my lips.</li>
<li> Have yet to write a negative review of a product BUT in this instance, seeing as I was asked to do so, I MUST say this product was a disappointment.</li>
<li> but this is way too expensive for what you get.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I only wish it was the auto sharpen liner. Very good color. Love it</li>
    <li> It is long lasting. I was amazed by how it lasted in my lips even after eating</li>
    <li> A little lighter than expected</li>
    <li> Very creamy, beautiful color.</li>
    <li> Bought this locally in color 057 RAVISH.  Just loved the color but this is way too expensive for what you get.  Does not last long on my lips and the point broke off several times even though very little with sticking out.  This actually doubled my cost.  Poor design for a lipstick that does not stay on the lips long.  $5.50 for .008 oz. is ludicrous.</li>
    <li> I always buy this on Amazon since this particular color is Sold out every time I try to find it at Ulta or the drug store. This is THE BEST lip liner I&#x27;ve ever used it. It&#x27;s so natural looking, I wear it every day</li>
    <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s my favorite lip liner,but I use it as a full on lipstick.</li>
    <li> This is a good enough dupe of the charlotte tilbury lip cheat in pillow talk, and it&#x27;s really creamy. I use it almost daily for that pseudo-kylie jenner color everyone is scrambling over.</li>
    <li> Really been enjoying this! I really wish I got a few of the east end snob shade as I am in love! Amelia Liana (YouTube guru) said she loved it so I knew I had to try it. I have my favorite lip liner (jordana in tawny) which is a mauve-y purple pink, and I am always buying similar shades to that in lipstick because that&#x27;s just what I have been loving to wear, So when I tried this and this was lighter and a bit more pink, I was very excited to have something nude-y but different from my typical everyday lipstick.

Might be a bit too light for very dark skin girls (the east end snob shade) however light to tan would be nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the negative reviews. I think this is a great product for the price. I have fair-medium skin, and the color looks quite natural under a lightly tinted lip balm (I use Fresh Sugar in Rose). I constantly get compliments when I wear this in East End Snob.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip liner! It lasts a long time and is a beautiful color!</li>
    <li> I love the color -- it boosts my lips from natural to just-a-few-notches-above-natural (I&#x27;m medium-pale skinned with fairly thin, pale lips), and doesn&#x27;t stand out too garishly. I wear this color both to work and out at night, usually with a slightly lighter lipstick or gloss over it.&lt;br /&gt;One negative: it has broken on me several times now, even when I try to be gentle with it!</li>
    <li> Really soft and blend well  with the lipstick</li>
    <li> I love the color of this lip liner.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands with colors that appeared similar, but they were too light or too dark or just didn&#x27;t go on very well.  This is a nice soft pink, and I use a light pink lipstick over it.  I don&#x27;t extend the liner very much because it does break easily. However, the color is my favorite, and the price of the liner is quite reasonable.  I will keep buying this liner.</li>
    <li> Great color which no one else has, creamy (although a little cakey consistency), great price.  Lost a star because can break easily if one uses too much pressure applying product. Go easy; product is creamy and applies easily. This is great under lipstick to keep color lasting for many hours. Their other great color is Enchantment #070.</li>
    <li> Have yet to write a negative review of a product BUT in this instance, seeing as I was asked to do so, I MUST say this product was a disappointment. Poor quality of the liner medium breaks of and have practically used it all up trying to apply it to my lips. Must be old, dry and/or a faulty formula. A real thumbs down.</li>
    <li> A bit light for my medium coloring but still works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Wallgreens for $6.49 which is more expensive than Walmart or Amazon.  I really like the design and feel of this liner. Easy glide and creamy soft to the touch. not chalky or hard and the colors are well pigmented.  Perfect Pucker with these liners. I have eastbend snob and innocent. Unfortunately all out of natural.  I just bought natural here on Amazon. YAY!!! for $5.49. Another perfect color from Rimmel. I find if i push a little hard the liner will break off but no worries  no sharpening needed,just twist up and it&#x27;s re-sharpened and ready to go.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lipliner that matched my lips, yet added a slight amount of color. This one is perfect. It lasts several hours. Many products irritate my sensitive skin, but I have been using this almost daily for over a year and have not had any bad reactions or dryness.</li>
    <li> Love this color, and am bummed that it&#x27;s been discontinued. I&#x27;ve ordered a bunch of these online to use until I find a replacement color.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color!! I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very light pink. Images make it look a deep red or fuchsia.</li>
