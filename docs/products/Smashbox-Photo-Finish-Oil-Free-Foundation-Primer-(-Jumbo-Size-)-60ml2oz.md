      <li>Great product and fast delivery</li>

      <li>I put it on over the top of Clinique Moisturizing Gel</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s worth noting that I use very light foundations, and often just a tinted moisturizer - those might not be the best products to mix with this particular primer.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time, but it&#x27;s the best for your money.  </li>
      <li>goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when on.&lt;br /&gt;Picture perfect and nice that it is not tinted.</li>
      <li>My skin is very oily, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good primer that can be used under and over makeup.</li>
      <li>just perfect for every day use love how my skin looks super light jumbo size double than regular size amazing!</li>
      <li>I love that this leaves your face feeling very soft and smooth and allows your makeup to go on with a near flawless appearance...</li>

      <li>This stuff goes on and my skin feels baby smooth.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>As usual Amazon is the best place to find everything!  </li>
      <li>and then I use a super light liquid makeup (some drugstore brand).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used smashbox Photo Finish for the past 6 years and LOVE it!!!</li>
      <li>All of the reviews are right!</li>
      <li>It definitely helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles and gives the skin a nice smooth look and feel.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind!</li>
      <li>Photo finish is an amazing addition to my facial products.</li>
      <li>Makeup stays fresh all day.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product 4 years ago when I went to the mall inquiring about products to use for my wedding day.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t really need to use a lot of this; in fact, it&#x27;s kind of like a gel, so there comes a point when your skin won&#x27;t really absorb extra.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>This is the ecomony size and will last for many months.</li>
      <li>I would suggest Smashbox put it out in the larger size in more stores.</li>
      <li>I had to give the whole 2oz away.</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t have much faith it would make a difference</li>
      <li>Really helps my eyeliner from smudging during the day</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a few other primers and they were all incredibly oily.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It really gives my skin a &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34; look and the pores on my nose, etc are completely invisible.</li>
      <li>Not only does it make my face super soft, but it keeps my makeup on for 12 plus hours without allowing it to budge.</li>
      <li>container is so much bigger than the one they sell in stores and saved me so much money!</li>
      <li>The tube itself had no seal on it and the top had popped open during shipping &amp; half my product leaked out.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this item for several years and it really makes your skin look and feel softer.  </li>
      <li>now this is a must have product, talk about make a differnce  with the way you make up goes on, looks and feels it is a wow</li>
      <li>I read the reviews before buying and completely agree.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>so natural looking.  </li>
      <li>Really does blur away the pores and even some tiny wrinkles - while you have it on of course.  </li>
      <li>I received a half full tube.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased it to tame how greasy my skin looked in pictures.</li>
      <li>It applies easily and trust me when I say a little goes a LONG way.  </li>
      <li>It is a little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; feeling than the Cover Girl product that I&#x27;d used previously, and I actually prefer the way my foundation feels without it.</li>
      <li>The product is really great, and works as described.. but the liquid it is slightly separated and was difficult to mix back together.</li>
      <li>and I use just slightly less makeup, but it really doesn&#x27;t do any miracles.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot each time you apply; less than a quarter&#x27;s size.  </li>

<li> So, for far less money I&#x27;ll be buying the Monistat next time.</li>
<li> Having dry skin that flares up with acne with the slightest introduction of oily makeup, it&#x27;s pretty hard for me to find a product that works.  </li>
<li> I will definitely go to Amazon for anything I can get from them as other big chain stores</li>
<li> Unfortunately the tube of my Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Foundation Primer arrived unsealed.   </li>
<li> My skin also still seems somewhat dry, though.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;re wearing makeup every single day and using this, I&#x27;d estimate that this container would last you a few months- depending on how frugal you are with applying it.</li>
<li> My pores are maybe a little smaller after using this</li>
<li> That said, even though I sometimes put on too much, I haven&#x27;t broken out yet.  </li>
<li> I have tried other products and they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
<li> I could not trust the bottle for it appeared opened and like someone could have squeezed&lt;br /&gt;another product other than primer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff. Really helps my eyeliner from smudging during the day</li>
    <li> But will cake and flake when used with some products. Apply, foundation, powder then apply again seems to work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this product more than one chance, but I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels over my face. It&#x27;s a little more &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; feeling than the Cover Girl product that I&#x27;d used previously, and I actually prefer the way my foundation feels without it. However, it&#x27;s worth noting that I use very light foundations, and often just a tinted moisturizer - those might not be the best products to mix with this particular primer.</li>
    <li> I love this smash box photo finish oil free primer! It was a great purchase! It photos wonderfully and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Great price and great service!  What an amazing deal for Smashbox cosmetics!!  I will definitely go to Amazon for anything I can get from them as other big chain stores are way overpriced!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use under foundation!!  It definitely helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles and gives the skin a nice smooth look and feel.</li>
    <li> This product is so smooth and silky when applied. I love the way my skin feels with it on. I&#x27;m able to apply my foundation over this primer. And, I do think it makes my makeup last longer in the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other primers and they were all incredibly oily. They felt odd going on and they made my face shiny. This stuff goes on and my skin feels baby smooth. I put it on over the top of Clinique Moisturizing Gel and then I use a super light liquid makeup (some drugstore brand). I just started using this stuff and people compliment my skin and makeup all the time. Not only does it make my face super soft, but it keeps my makeup on for 12 plus hours without allowing it to budge. Another bonus is that my makeup doesn&#x27;t get cakey AT ALL throughout the day like it used to. I don&#x27;t have to touch up when I wear this under makeup. It helps keep the oil on my skin under control, which is a nice bonus. It really gives my skin a &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34; look and the pores on my nose, etc are completely invisible. I will certainly be buying more of this stuff! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This primer is an Amazing product! A definite must have for every woman.  Makes your foundation go on flawlessly!  Lessens the visibility of wrinkles &amp; fine lines.  Unfortunately the tube of my Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Foundation Primer arrived unsealed.   The tube itself had no seal on it and the top had popped open during shipping &amp; half my product leaked out.   I received a half full tube. I will be contacting Amazon customer service to see what they can do about this.  Customer Service has since responded &amp; is refunding my money.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> My skin is very oily, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good primer that can be used under and over makeup. Photo finish is an amazing addition to my facial products. I use it everyday, and I usually reapply around mid-day. It has a very strong chemical odor, but it goes away after applying. I just hold my breath and rub it in for a smooth matte finish. Try it, if you don&#x27;t want to test it on the expensive price tag through amazon, then go to sephora and use points to get a sample. That&#x27;s what I did before I purchased a jumbo size.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff in a sample and fell in love with it.  It makes my skin so silky, but not greasy.  It applies easily and trust me when I say a little goes a LONG way.  About half the size of a pencil eraser is all you need.  This made me feel better spending the $$$$ on it.  It will last.  When you apply your makeup it glides on effortlessly.  My skin has a different glow- so natural looking.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product 4 years ago when I went to the mall inquiring about products to use for my wedding day.  Since then, I haven&#x27;t put on makeup without this foundation primer.  It softens the skin and takes away the shine.  I apply this and then my compact foundation.  Even though it&#x27;s pricey, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it because I&#x27;m really satisfied with the product.  I&#x27;m a stay at home mom so I don&#x27;t put on makeup every day, so therefore my previous 2 oz bottle has lasted me over a year.  You don&#x27;t need a whole lot each time you apply; less than a quarter&#x27;s size.  If you&#x27;re wearing makeup every single day and using this, I&#x27;d estimate that this container would last you a few months- depending on how frugal you are with applying it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference between wearing this to begin and not wearing it at all. I don&#x27;t think it makes a difference whether this is on or not.</li>
    <li> This product is almost magical as it provides a silky, velvety base for any foundation or powder layered on top….really helps now in the winter months with excess drying of the skin!</li>
    <li> This is great! I read the reviews before buying and completely agree.&lt;br /&gt;This goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when on.&lt;br /&gt;Picture perfect and nice that it is not tinted.</li>
    <li> I like this primmer but not enough to order it again. I don&#x27;t like the feel of it at all. The consistence is like putting silicone on your face. Actually that&#x27;s exactually how it feels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used smashbox Photo Finish for the past 6 years and LOVE it!!! I originally purchased it to tame how greasy my skin looked in pictures. This product doesn&#x27;t just do that, but keeps your makeup on, and gives you a perfect matte finish. I also have acne prone skin and this product has never caused me to breakout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This container is so much bigger than the one they sell in stores and saved me so much money! It also works just like the smashbox Photo Finish I&#x27;ve bought in stores for the past 6 years! Most importantly, the product came to my house ever sooner than I imagined! Great product and fast delivery; I am very happy with my purchase and will definately be purchasing my smashbox Photo Finish from amazon from now on! THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This primer broke my face out in a rash, a flagyl rash.  I had to give the whole 2oz away.</li>
    <li> just perfect for every day use love how my skin looks super light jumbo size double than regular size amazing!</li>
    <li> love using this primer. Only complaint is that I found it to be like water on the first day using it. Maybe it was the heat, but after a few days It thickens up to its usual consistancy</li>
    <li> I HAVE to use this before putting on my cream blush - it makes the application so much easier and more uniform and sooth!</li>
    <li> Great base...all your make up will just glide on.  Non- oily.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at how smooth you skin feels.</li>
    <li> this stuff is like silk going on my face, I use it everyday, it does not take much and goes on evenly. will continue buying this !!!!!</li>
    <li> Didnt see a huge difference using this product</li>
    <li> I have mixed opinions on this product.  Having dry skin that flares up with acne with the slightest introduction of oily makeup, it&#x27;s pretty hard for me to find a product that works.  You don&#x27;t really need to use a lot of this; in fact, it&#x27;s kind of like a gel, so there comes a point when your skin won&#x27;t really absorb extra.  That said, even though I sometimes put on too much, I haven&#x27;t broken out yet.  My skin also still seems somewhat dry, though.  My pores are maybe a little smaller after using this and I use just slightly less makeup, but it really doesn&#x27;t do any miracles.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I can use that doesn&#x27;t make my skin peel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only primer that I wear which truly works. Amazing quality!!! A must have beauty for every gal.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t apply foundation without this product again.  The primer not only evens my skin texture and minimizes pores, my foundation stays on longer.</li>
    <li> i got this because everyone uses it on the makeup tutorials I have seen on YouTube. i didn&#x27;t have much faith it would make a difference&lt;br /&gt;but it definatly did. even my husband commented on how well my makeup has been looking and this is the only change i made.</li>
    <li> Love this! This is the best product for keeping your makeup intact. I have tried other products and they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> I love that this leaves your face feeling very soft and smooth and allows your makeup to go on with a near flawless appearance... however, I found a site that listed the ingredients of this (not on the bottle) and googled it only to find out it contains almost all the same ingredients found in Monistat Chafing Relief Gel. Upon further reading I read that several makeup artist use the Monistat the same way you use this product. So, for far less money I&#x27;ll be buying the Monistat next time. The added bonus is that it can be purchased at WalMart.</li>
    <li> All time favorite primer! Smooth and lightweight.</li>
    <li> at last.  I mix it with some makeup and use the two together.  Really does blur away the pores and even some tiny wrinkles - while you have it on of course.  But that&#x27;s what this product says it does, it does not claim magic powers.</li>
    <li> I love this primer, but the 2 oz was/is difficult to find.  It lasts a long time, but it&#x27;s the best for your money.  Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I could not trust the bottle for it appeared opened and like someone could have squeezed&lt;br /&gt;another product other than primer.  I did not trust its safety on my face. I will stick to&lt;br /&gt;buying cosmetic products elsewhere.  Unsure of expiration date as well which is a problem.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for sometime now. I could not find the 2 oz anywhere but got it on Amazon.  As usual Amazon is the best place to find everything!  It is wonderful alone, or under makeup.  It is a little pricey but worth it. I would suggest Smashbox put it out in the larger size in more stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 15 years I wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind! I&#x27;ve tried other kinds but they cannot compare to smashbox! It&#x27;s a little exsepsive but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this item for several years and it really makes your skin look and feel softer.  It deserves five stars.</li>
