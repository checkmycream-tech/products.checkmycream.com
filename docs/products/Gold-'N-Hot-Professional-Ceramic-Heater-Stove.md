    <li> The on/off switch is on the stove and not on the cord.</li>
    <li> The gold n Hot professional ceramic heater stove is a great item except the outer part of the stove get really hot so be careful.</li>
    <li> I like this! It&#x27;s one temperature, so you have to be really carefully not to burn your hair!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s works - just not temperature control. Shipped fast and in super condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have delicate curls, and my hair will break off with too high heat over time. Just have to monitor the stove to make sure you pull out your tools before they scorch. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This little stove certainly gets the job done...but I would have preferred to spend a little more money for one that had varied temperature settings.  This way you get a constant temp and don&#x27;t have to worry about burning your hair.  I&#x27;m thinking about returning it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little stove! It heats up quickly. You really have to be carefully and not touch the stove as the directions states because the metal on the outside get very hot. Be sure to keep it sitting on a smooth flat surface so that the air can circulate around it! Takes up little space on the counter. It also seems to be quite sturdy as I have already had the misfortune of dropping it, but it still heats right up. It surely deserves 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This review is from my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very good stove for a professional or experienced person who presses their own hair. It does not have temperature control. It gets your combs very hot. I really love it. Never leave it unattended. Keep children and pets away from it. Make sure you use it on a safe surface. Make sure you unplug when done and allow it to completely cool before storing it. It gives my hair a perfect press every time. You really have to remove your combs at the right time to avoid burning your hair. Always test on a white towel and if it turns brown, wait a few seconds or a minute before pressing your hair. I use 2 combs at a time, so when I finish using 1 comb and place it back in the oven I am ready for the comb that is now warm. Once you get the hang of using it you&#x27;ll be comfortable. Pressing with a pressing comb is a lost art. I prefer it because the flat irons don&#x27;t press certain areas.</li>
    <li> I am not an expert but I would like this product more if it got hotter, and if it had the ability to be set at different temperatures.</li>
    <li> Although it works well this product took quite some time to reach its heat potential. I would say at least an hour before it got hot enough to use in hair. I would recommend it but just be prepared to heat it an hour befor using it.</li>
    <li> Works great. I love having it. Anytime I need a little touch up. I just plug it up and go</li>
    <li> Only used twice but it still smells when on</li>
    <li> Great product... just the right size to fit at least 2 items if needed.  Heats up really fast and works very well.</li>
    <li> Great product, get very hot. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t get very hot. I went back to using the ktichen stove.</li>
    <li> Hi Natural Sisters! If you need one of these then you are doing an old fashioned press n curl! : ) or something like that. Anyhoo I remember back in the day when we would use the kitchen stove. I just bought a thermal flat iron (*note when we say \\&quot;thermal\\&quot; that means uses a stove and has marcel handles, some folks say\\&quot; Marcel Irons\\&quot;, it&#x27;s all where you are from). The reason why a thermal iron is often preferred is the iron quality. Quality iron is what produces a good finish. Electric irons use a different type of metal plate that does not work as well on coarser hair.&lt;br /&gt;Well when I pulled mine out of the box I was pleased. I received mine fast because Amazon was the filler. It is true, these ovens are hot hot hot around the outside so be careful. I had to order one because nowadays it&#x27;s just not proper to use the kitchen stove. So I bought for convenience and i luv it. the price is okay, wish they were cheaper and I wish we made them in the USA. Back in the day the cords were covered in a cloth because the cord can easily burn too if it touches the metal. I NEVER thought being in beauty school in the 80&#x27;s that we would come back to this way of doing things. But it&#x27;s good to be natural. Our hair really is beautiful just learn some styling tips on youtube, you can do it.</li>
    <li> My wife really enjoy this item. It work like it was expected to.</li>
    <li> This is excellent.  I used to go to my beautician and she uses one of these.  So I thought that I would order my own.  It works great.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Works great worth every penny I do me n my daughters hair all tha time love it n it saves me money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product I have had no problems with it!</li>
    <li> delivered on time and in one piece, feels very solid.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, easy to use and she uses it when she needs it, especially for times she&#x27;s gotta doll up</li>
    <li> Excellent makes me feel like a real hair stylist thanks. Brand new quality I am so glad for this avenue to purchase products.</li>
    <li> Take too long to get hot.</li>
    <li> Great product! Heats up quickly and is much easier than going back and forth to the stove</li>
    <li> I prurchased this ceramic heater to replace one I had for over 20yrs. I liked the older model much better because the opening where you put the iron in had a pass through to the back which allowed for using longer irons. This new model does not have that feature so the irons hang out in the front. Other than that, it works ok. I love Gold N hot products.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this is my 3rd iron. They don&#x27;t last long at all.  What a bummer.</li>
    <li> It works just like it supposed to. It&#x27;s very sturdy.The barrel is a little small, but it can fit 2 combs.</li>
    <li> Now I can do my hair all in my room. Before I had to keep going into the kitchen, then wait for the comb to cool down, then take it back into the kitchen, etc. This added probably an hour to my hair time. Now I just heat up my comb in my room with my mirrors and other hair products and I can get it done in about two hours rather than 3!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stove gets REALLY hot though. Don&#x27;t touch the outside and make sure it&#x27;s not around anything flammable. It&#x27;s very sturdy, seems like it will last me a while. I am pleased!</li>
    <li> my daughter need a new one so i pick  that one  because i like the price. and it was for  her birthday</li>
    <li> I purchased the ceramic heater for a great price. It arrived in the mail much sooner than expected. The price is really good. It retails for much more in my local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> The only thing that bothers me about this is that there are no temperature controls.  You have to be SUPER careful if you are going to use on your hair.  Check your iron with a paper towel and see if it is burned.  Better the towel than your hair!  Definitely work out what temp (how long you heat your irons) works best for your hair- not everyone is the same</li>
    <li> This hot plate is the best thing since a gas stove was invented I mean it took me back to my child hood days and the results were amazing .</li>
    <li> it great love the way it heats up and hold the product.  would recommend to others will purchase from you again.  thank you.</li>
    <li> A little small.Seems like it heats up on one side but I&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> As a professional for over 15 years this product has been around since I can remember I had one years ago. I had since upgraded to a larger double stove but that blew recently so in a pinch I grabbed this one and I must say I am not disappointed! This stove is pretty durable. Back in the day I remember dropping my old GNH and it was all bent up but it still worked so expect that this one will definitely last me a long time. Just a testament to good craftsmanship!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Great! This is just like what is used in salons, quick heat up, although you can only put in two tools at a time.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
    <li> This is being used to heat glass rods for lampwork... It was the best money I have spent in a long time...it warms my rods and now there is little or no glass flying around my studio.... Thermal shock is mostly a thing of the past.....not the intended use, I know.... But it works perfectly...</li>
    <li> My wife was and still thrilled over Gold N Hot  Stove and at a great price She Thanks You.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, because the item was new , the item was a gift for my daughter she was very pleased</li>
    <li> I am transitioning from using a chemical relaxer to wearing my hair in it&#x27;s natural state and this tool has made straightening my hair to maintain the look I am used to much easier. I thought that this would be a good investment but it has worked even better than I expected!!!</li>
    <li> on/off switch is not on cord as shown</li>
    <li> I got this hot stove for my hair dresser whom did not want to buy the entire Gold N Hot stove with curling iron. Every hair store we went to did not sale the single stove. It was great for the price and my curls look great.</li>
    <li> I love it ! Perfect because when im in between appointments. I can now touch up my hair as I need to, when I need to.</li>
    <li> The hot comb does not sit properly inside, so the comb does not get fully hot.</li>
    <li> GETS HOT BUT IT TAKES A WHILE. I LOVE MY BURNERS</li>
    <li> When you lay the comb onto the stove, the metal piece that sticks out that the comb lays on top of is to high. The comb does not heat properly. Very poorly constructed.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery!  Ordered it on Friday and it arrived on Sunday.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> My mother has had one of these for over 15 years and it has just gone out. so naturally you must by the same brand right? Love it</li>
