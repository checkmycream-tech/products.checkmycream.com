<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this when I was pregnant because I read it helps reduce stretch marks. I don&#x27;t know if it helps because I had to stop using it because it is very thick and left a film on my sheets that I couldn&#x27;t wash out no matter what I tried so I had to get rid of them.</li>
    <li> Does the job; use it with Rose Oil and Glyercin,  no need to buy products marketed by expensive companies.</li>
    <li> The quality is ok. The almond smell isnt quite as strong as some that I have previously purchased. Its also a little less thick.</li>
    <li> packed well  and a necessary oil</li>
    <li> Absorbs into skin to leave it silky smooth with no oily residue.  My skin stays smooth and hydrated all day. Plus I love that it is fragrance free so it does not clash with my perfume.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price! What a sweet deal. Excellent for our facial and massage treatments.</li>
    <li> Used in soap, worked great...</li>
    <li> This is a staple in my cottage body products ingredients list.</li>
    <li> This almond oil was just what I was looking for.  So far I&#x27;ve found it comparable to more expensive almond oil I&#x27;ve purchased and have seen no difference. It arrived quickly, brand new and sealed.</li>
    <li> I love Sweet Almond oil, but this has no scent at all. Not good , not bad, just no real scent. Otherwise a great oil. I use this on my skin. I use it in combination with other oils as a hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> Love it especially on my face and hair. Lubricates but not too greasy and smells sweet. Great for hands.</li>
    <li> Item just as described.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very very nice, not oily at all. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I love love love this oil! I am a natural product junkie and have tried all the usual suspects for a body moisturizer (shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter, jojoba oil, vit E oil, etc...) but nothing had moisturized my skin like this oil. It goes on feeling kind of thick and smooth, but ends up just feeling moisturized and soft and not greasy (once it has a minute to soak in). I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining on my clothes (shea butter stained my clothes), it has no scent so it won&#x27;t interfere with your perfumes, and it has a ton of other uses in DIY skin care and beauty products. It also makes a great carrier oil for essential oils. I&#x27;ve gone through multiple bottles just in the past 6 months. It&#x27;s a huge bottle for a great price!</li>
    <li> No scent.  I expected almond.</li>
    <li> Was greatly excited when this arrived due to it size but it did not&lt;br /&gt;have that sweet smell like I expected. None the less I love it.</li>
    <li> Came so quickly and packaged well but not so hard that hands could not open.  Product is great to mix with Lavender for dog flea spray.  Does not stain or irritate your animals but repells those awful fleas this time of year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this brand of almond oil. I use it for body lotion and it&#x27;s great. Has a very faint scent that I mask with lavender essential oil. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for making body butter.</li>
    <li> Works as promised - great price</li>
    <li> Essentially scentless, great for making lotion bars since the essential oil scents come through. I also like the fact that it comes in such a large bottle, it lasted me for a year of lotion bar making (I only make for myself, friends and family). I&#x27;m on my second bottle and they&#x27;ve changed the label to look a bit more professional. Not much else to say about it.</li>
    <li> always a good price, and a great product.</li>
    <li> This worked so great in the homemade products that I have used it in. Will certainly be ordering again when I need it &#x3D;) The quantity and quality were both great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what my husband plans to use it for.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and buy a bottle; I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great oil! I use it in the shower and rub in my skin. I also use it to moisturizer arms and legs in dry AZ. I am planning to add essential oils to it, but haven&#x27;t yet. It&#x27;s nice and unscented. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best bottle of almond oil that I have purchaced to date.  It was delivered quickly and I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Use it directly on my skin after a shower. Add it to enrich my castile soap for use in the bath. Will order it again.</li>
    <li> Best value of quality oil on the market</li>
    <li> Well I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin, not sure if this really this almond oil</li>
    <li> A good quality oil. Great as part of a moisturizing salt scrub.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome, I love it on my skin it smells so good.  I put it in my hair, my bath and on my skin.  The price is great too.</li>
    <li> Very Lovely High quality oil. You can smell the natural sweet. Bottle arrived clean, sealed and full. It makes the skin so supple and soft, without clogging pores. Use it in hair and on skin. Also, this size bottle will ensure I don&#x27;t run out quickly.</li>
    <li> I love Essential Depots products.  I usually order from them directly but I found this on Amazon for the same price and with free shipping.  Product came from Essential Depot with their normal packing.  High Quality!</li>
    <li> Very nice, wonderful smell, large bottle for the price.  Would definately recommend it!  The simple things make the best cosmetics</li>
    <li> Excellent product  and super fast delivery</li>
    <li> This is the best thing for my skin and it hard to find large bottles of it in stores. Very happy I found this and I will buy more.</li>
    <li> great product, great service, fast shipping, thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this oil to cook with and also to milk with coconut oil for skin.  Lately, I&#x27;ve mixed it with an oil I think is called Aragonic and it works well on my skin for lines and absorbs into the skin so it isn&#x27;t shiny and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
    <li> Great for all my body butters I make.</li>
    <li> A very versatile carrier oil. Mixes well with essential oils and fragrance oils. I&#x27;m using a tea light diffuser daily and this oil frequently. I highly recommend this oil for that purpose!</li>
    <li> This almond oil is a works great for sugar or salt scrubs. I also use it in some of my soaps</li>
    <li> I used for salt scrubs.  I love almond oil as a carrier oil because you make it smell however you want it to with other oils</li>
    <li> I use this for massage. The smell is subtle and very pleasant. It feels really smooth and spreads out really well--a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Perfect for making your own beauty products!</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin.I will order more. I have tried different lotions, and haven&#x27;t found one that works as good as Almond oil.</li>
    <li> It does not keep my skin as moist as olive oil. It is a nice light oil better suited for massage.</li>
    <li> This oil is very light and doesn&#x27;t make you feel all oily!!  I apply it to my entire body after I get out of the bath, before I towel off, then I pat dry.  It soaks in and has made the dry skin on the tops of my legs much healthier and supple.  I have also seen a HUGE improvement in my feet.</li>
    <li> Great Item will buy again if need to!</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of Almond Oil in the last two years and have never experienced anything like this. Almond Oil normally has a very light sweet scent. This stuff smells like used motor oil. I don&#x27;t understand how so many people are rating this so high. Especially the people who are using it in skin care products. It smells horrible!</li>
    <li> I kind of expected it to have some kind of scent, but there is little to no scent, which I guess is better than a bad smell. I do like the consistency and that it does not take a lot of oil for a massage, fairly pleased overall, and no problems with shipping. I lowered my rating because I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference between this &amp;#34;sweet almond&amp;#34; oil and any other oil.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil because it makes my skin super soft and really helps moisturize in this stupid desert climate BUT I can&#x27;t really smell almonds :( i asked my friend to smell it without telling her what it was and she said &amp;#34;it has a really SUPER light herb smell&amp;#34; i asked her if it smelled like almonds and she said no. I thought I was tripping but there is barely any smell to it. That was disappointing and makes me question its authenticity. Other than that, it is great if u live in the dry desert of So Cal :)</li>
    <li> fantastic price and item just as described , would by from again without hesitation. Looking forward to nice soft skin the only problem I can see would be how to get it on my hubby LOL .</li>
    <li> I tried this product for my business, because of the price. However, it did not hold up compared to another oil from another company. I wondered if it is 100% sweet almond oil?</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!  It has little to no scent which is what I need because i add oils to make them scented myself.  Great price for this quantity; i paid $7 at Whole Foods for probably 1/6 this amount!</li>
    <li> It was hard to wash out is the thing from 5 stars, but great oil and great price!Thank you very much!Peace!</li>
    <li> I use this oil for massage and it&#x27;s wonderful.  A great price for a beautiful and scent-free oil used in massage.</li>
    <li> Delivered right on time. I use this from head to toe and it makes my skin feel amazing. My skin is very reactive to unpleasant chemicals often found in some lotions/creams/etc, and I have had no adverse reaction to this oil after 3 weeks of use. I recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Lovely for sensitive skin!  Lasts a long time, too.  I have also used it many times as a carrier for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Good quality, pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been using this to make my lotion and everyone has been loving it! I will definitely be ordering more when I am out! Great product!</li>
    <li> This oil is AWESOME.  I use it blended with castor oil for oil cleansing in conjunction with my regular antibacterial skin care wash.  Straight out the shower or after a hot steamy shower so my pores are nice and open, I use the essential oil combination; massage in skin and remove with a hot towel wipe a couple times.  Leaves my skin feeling and looking GREAT!  It really even helps with my shaving irritation.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I have used sweet almond oil for years now as a whole body moisturizer. I buy other lotions and oils but always come back to this. I love to mix it with essential oils and make my own scents. I was so happy to find a quart size with such a great price!</li>
    <li> This was my second order of this stuff and I will definitely make a third. I make bath and beauty products and use this oil a lot in all sorts of ingredients, but mainly scrubs, lotion bars and lip balms. Great price for the ammount. Always arrives quickly. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother who requested it because she just had a tummy tuck and wants to minimize scarring.  I can&#x27;t really say how much it&#x27;s working as she just started using it, but one of her friends uses her oil for his face and says he sees an improvement in his scars, so I guess it helps!</li>
    <li> Intention was to use to make sugar scrub for Christmas gifts.  Now I use it on and with everything.  It is wonderful on your skin and does not clog your pores.</li>
    <li> Just started making my own DIY beauty products, and am loving this almond oil in my recipes - super light, and beautifully expresses the scents of essential oils. Great for body/massage oils.</li>
    <li> Decent oil for a good price. The pour spout is a pain and it leaks all over the bottle though so I ended up putting it in a different container.</li>
    <li> Excellent for making lotion.</li>
    <li> I like this product for dry skin; however, since it said &amp;#34;Sweet Oil&amp;#34; I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the &amp;#34;NON&amp;#34; scent. It is, however, good for really dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this to make my own body scrubs. It&#x27;s great, doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, and moisturizes as I shower.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and used to get the pint bottle.  Really does wonders for dry skin and now I use it for &amp;#34;oil pulling&amp;#34;.  After you brush and floss your teeth you swish around a tablespoon in the mouth for 10 minutes or so and supposedly absorbs any bacteria in the mouth then you spit it out and rinse with warm water.  Some claim it rebuilds the teeth and whitens them.  Not sure about that since I have only been doing it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt; Anyway I buy the quart size now and my skin feels really good. Even seems to take away small wrinkles.  No chemicals, just pure oil.</li>
    <li> Great price for what I received, however it has no scent to it. It was good they packaged each bottle up because one I re I ever them one bottle was leaking.</li>
    <li> I have to add to the growing one star reviews. This was not quality almond oil. I use almond oil for my salt scrubs frequently and this was absolutely not on par with what I normally purchase. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for many things...mostly on my skin and face and to make homemade lotion. I love it!</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and looks and feels great.  True confession:  I bought this quart size because my senior cat has become addicted to almond oil.  I have no idea what this means, but she comes to the other side of the house and talks me all the way to the back so I&#x27;ll serve her some more.  If that&#x27;s not enough of a recommendation, I don&#x27;t know what is.</li>
    <li> Went rancid within a week</li>
    <li> I love this oil...and it is a great price. I use it mixed with castor oil at night on my face. I do what is called, an oil cleaning method. You can google it. This oil is great because it is a light carrier oil.</li>
    <li> great product. will work with again!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  Not greasy just good an oily.</li>
    <li> Big bottle appropriately packed.  It is so lightweight on the skin. Could even apply to my acne prone skin without incident. No strong scent. Thumbs up</li>
    <li> Almonds oil is great for massages and for the skin in general. This quart bottle is significantly cheaper than other options on Amazon and the quality is on par. If you&#x27;re looking to buy almond oil grab this bottle and save yourself some money.</li>
    <li> Almond Sweet oil lived up to the hype.  It is great for evening skin tone, leaving the skin soft and replenished.  It goes on oily, but absorbs rather quickly and lifts dry skin.  I love it !</li>
    <li> Great for your skin...,, I use it in my homemade body butter, sooooo smooth!  Great for mixing with essential oils.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make brown sugar body scrub for a spa birthday party. I made 20 jars with this product and still had some left over.</li>
    <li> For my family, almond oil is used for moistening dry skin in winter - and this oil does the job very well.  Good value too - pretty big bottle.</li>
    <li> I havent used many other almond oils, but this seems good. It soaks in the skin well, but there really isnt a smell. So thats what Im not sure about. Is almond oil supposed to smell sweet??</li>
    <li> great size for the price, and so far seems to be a great quality carrier oil for my whipped body butter. ordered other products from this vendor and so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have always loved almond oil but until recently it was difficult to find it unscented (I would buy massage oils). This enormous bottle is perfect! I mix it in my lotions, put a few drops in my hair, even use it on my pups paws when they dry out in the winter.  Being able to buy it in a big container is nice, I just purchased two or three smaller bottles, and refill as necessary.  Truly one of the better products out there for you.  Stop wasting your money on expensive salon and drugstore chemicals - go natural.</li>
    <li> Totally scent free and very gentle.  I use this on my baby and love it.  Works just as good as any commercial baby oil, but totally natural and safe.</li>
    <li> Used in my bath bombs that I plan on making as Christmas gifts.  They turned out very good and I will be making more of them</li>
    <li> This product is a great way to buy almond oil in bulk- I use mine as a face wash, and as a make-up remover!</li>
    <li> Came with no leaks.  It&#x27;s a big bottle....best value I&#x27;ve found anywhere.  I will refrigerate portion not being used to keep it fresh.  Great carrier oil.  This and coconut oil are the only two I use.  Absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this oil.  Although it has nearly no fragrance to it, it leaves skin feeling soft and luxurious.  Because it has no lasting scent, you can wear perfume or scented lotions also and not alter the fragrance.  I like this and mix it with the avocado oil to really leave my skin soft and supple all day.</li>
    <li> Slight sweet scent. The oil rubs on evenly soaking into my skin leaving me feeling soft &amp; silky. Best product for my skin.  I am never dry or itchy. I will always buy this product from this seller.</li>
    <li> My wife has psoriasis and curly hair so she uses this as a conditioner and this is the least expensive I have ever seen it.</li>
    <li> It was everything it needed to be. I used it in a soap making project. Next time I&#x27;ll order 2 quarts!</li>
    <li> Enjoyed this item very much great price also</li>
    <li> Will have to update as I use. So far, great price for quantity, and seems nice enough texture wise, but with no discernible fragrance at all, it could be canola oil, for all I know. Some reviews say it smells great, or smells like almonds, and I am not getting that at all. One other review said something about liking it because they have a hard time finding unscented...so, I am confused and undecided.</li>
    <li> This almond oil works great in lotions and body butters I have made. It smells good and absorbs quite well.</li>
    <li> GREAT BUY!!!! LOVE NATURAL ALMOND OIL!! I USE IT EVERY DAY IN THE SHOWER ON MY SKIN AND A BIT IN MY HAIR MAE MY SKIN SOFT LIKE BUTTER!! GOOD FOR SO MAY THINGS!!</li>
    <li> I keep having to fight the urge to steal some for the stove top. It smells really good. This one weighed just shy of 1000 grams in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Great price and smells great (no smell, which is right)</li>
    <li> Ok I guess, it&#x27;s almond oil which is what I expected.  We use it for massages and it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Works great as one of the ingredients to make body lotion - love this stuff - keeps skin soft, even through the worst of winter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what process They use or if this is in fact 100% almond oil as most other brand I have used are much oilier and much sweeter.&lt;br /&gt;For the price however it is divine. I use almond oil for making massage oil and home made natural lube and this works just fine I just wish it lasted a little longer as far as before it rubbed in all the way like other brands I have used.</li>
    <li> and I like using it on her.  It is slick but not greasy.  Absorbs well usually she gets a shower after the massage but she would not have unless she were putting on dress clothes.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, good value. I regularly order almond sweet oil and i will definetely order this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Still early days to know the full results of the oil, mine and my daughters hair feels lovely and nourished.</li>
    <li> Large quantity for a reasonable price. Works wonderfully for many different purposes (I use it for hair treatments, oil cleansing for my face, and as a base for roll-on perfumes).</li>
    <li> I use this for everything. It&#x27;s amazing and the price can&#x27;t be beat! Things I successfully used it for: moisturizer, cleanser, hair growth serum, making chapstick</li>
    <li> As described. Great shippingl</li>
    <li> Works great, i use it with my mango butter to make my body oil. Works like a charm. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this oil last September because it was an ingredient in a fluffy moisture lotion recipe. Well, it&#x27;s been in the back of my fridge because I didn&#x27;t find time to make the lotion. Today, I decided something must be done with it. So I gave myself a massage. The guy who referred to it as motor oil in the question section hit the nail right on the head. I had to lather up three times in the shower and I still feel like an oil slick; I&#x27;m afraid to put my clothes back on for fear of ruining them. Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t get it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before my attempted massage, I asked the question: \\&quot;Can this be used for cooking\\&quot;? I&#x27;m deleting that question and certainly not using it for cooking. My bacon grease is lighter.</li>
    <li> Not organic.....full of pesticides.... Can&#x27;t imagine this absorbing into your system!!  If you want neurotoxins that will harm you....beware consumers</li>
    <li> I use almond oil mixed with my lotion. This is a great value and I recommend putting it into a bottle with a pump for easy use,</li>
    <li> The almond oil sweet oil is great for massage for patients. It provides a smooth glide and yet with just a dab I can do deep tissue. I would recommend this product to all massage therapists.</li>
    <li> great product with a good scent and it has many uses.</li>
    <li> Soaks in and seals moisture after shower.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin so soft. I love it for my body and my hair products. The price is good too.</li>
    <li> Love this oil as a carrier. I use it in my sunscreen and deodorant.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and nice product!!</li>
    <li> I started using oil on my skin years ago after sensitive skin lotions still weren&#x27;t moisturizing my skin without leaving a obnoxious residue and smell. I tried almond, jojoba, avocado, and coconut. Almond oil is by far my favorite. It moisturizes with quick absorption (I use a small amount and spread it around.) It&#x27;s affordable and offers me higher quality than regular lotions.</li>
    <li> I use this for massage oil, but disappointed that it really has no almost scent to speak of.  I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> Great.  Lightweight and nice for your skin.  I used it to make hand lotion. I would recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> I bought for homemade cosmetics, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as great as the almond oil I usually buy from my local health store - I guess I should have known that if I wanted to pay less, I would get a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> I use it right after I shower. The scent is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Use a lot of this so glad to be able to get this bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this to wash her face, and I mix it with jojoba oil as a beard oil, so we tend to go through a good amount of this stuff.  That said, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to run out of this any time soon!  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Great for homemade soap.</li>
    <li> a great carrier oil for my massage essencial oils. glides on easily for clients. thin in consistancy and i love it</li>
    <li> This product is excellent choice for an alternate to baby oil-goes on easily and is mildly fragrant. I definitely will be reordering this again!!!</li>
    <li> This turned out to be much better than the almond oil we pick up at the stores.  Definitely a re-order with free shipping!</li>
    <li> Happy except for the 2 pimple poppers. didn&#x27;t know they were coming from CHINA!!!!!!! &amp; They came with no instructions on HOW TO USE THEM, and were not wrapped up or nothing</li>
    <li> good oil for the money</li>
    <li> Great, no smell and one of the most affordable carrier oils (not a fragrance oil) you can buy. The bottle is a sturdy open mouth plastic bottle nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> perfect natural treatment for skin moisturizing</li>
    <li> The best lotion! Nothing else really moisturizes and nourishes skin like pure sweet almond oil. Absorbs more easily that olive or other nut oils. I feel confident about using this stuff. Little or no scent. Quells dry winter skin, prevents flaking and itching and lasts! I just apply immediately after I get out of the shower and even 24 hours later  my skin is still soft.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Wish it came with a lid that you could squirt a small amount out at a time instead of having to pour it out.  It absorbs well into the skin and is odorless.</li>
    <li> Best quality almond oil AND the price is amazing!!  I recently started the oil cleansing method-my skin looks and feels so soft and smooth.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money for almond oil and yet, I wanted a high quality product.  This is by far the best you can get.</li>
    <li> i love that its not so greasy and it stays on the skin really nice</li>
    <li> My massage told me about this and I used it everyday and put on my skin.  It keeps my skin moist, and keep me from digging my skin when scratching it.  I even put a smail drop and rub my hands together and put in my hair right before I wash it and then my hair is not so dried out.</li>
    <li> Great price and long lasting</li>
    <li> The oil is thick and very moisturizing. As many people stated, does not have the almond scent. I don&#x27;t mind not having the almond scent but what remains almost smells burnt -disclaimer, I have a crazy strong sense of smell. The amount of oil you get for the price cannot be beat, just don&#x27;t expect a sweet almond scent.</li>
    <li> Great quality, perfect lightweight smell. Use for homemade sugar scrub. Great value.</li>
    <li> I wish it had a pour spout top to keep the oil from dripping down the edge of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product love the price</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my natural beauty products and it works great.  I buy it over and over again, and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use almond oil in my soap and beauty products. This was a nice starter size.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to make my own reed infusers at home (or more like refill the 10 odd empty bottles and reeds I have rather than buying yet another I feel bad throwing away the empty).  It&#x27;s a nice oil and doesn&#x27;t have much sent of it&#x27;s own.  I&#x27;m still learning how to do this correctly.  but all in all I&#x27;m happy with the product and the quantity+quality to price ratio was the best I found.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful.  Mix it with equal parts of olive oil and coconut oil and pour over sugar to make your own luscious sugar scrub for the shower.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  I use this in my homemade body &amp; hair butters.  This feels so good on skin and hair I have been using it on my skin after shower and after co-wash on my natural hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great and was perfect in my bubble bath mixture for family at Xmas.</li>
    <li> This was the best price I found for almond oil and I didn&#x27;t see any difference between this and other brands I have bought. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I mix Almond Oil, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E, and Coconut Oil for a wonderful Face and Body Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very good buy. Husband was purchasing Almond oil 1/3 the size of this for the same amount of money. So I was happy to find a better buy, that I can forecast that it will take him about 6-9 months to go through.</li>
    <li> Great quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> i have purchase other sweet almond oil with more of an almond fragrance other than that i am very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite oil to use in my sugar scrubs and lip balms and body butters. I love the scent of almonds and it adds a richness to the lotions/balms/butters that I cannot get with other liquid oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have in my book!!</li>
    <li> A lovely moisturizing oil that is very light and absorbs well. In soap it produces a low, stable lather, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than about 5% - 10% in soap - as it&#x27;s not a very hard oil in soap.  Wonderful for dry, inflamed, or irritated skin. It&#x27;s really nice in lotions, massage bars, bath bombs, bath oils, and especially in salt and sugar scrubs.  Excellent as a massage oil. Sweet Almond Oil is renowned for its rich concentration of oleic and linoleic essential fatty acids which help to give it unequalled penetrating and restructuring properties. This oil also makes an unparalleled carrier for salt (for use in salt scrubs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatty Acids:&lt;br /&gt;Oleic 64-82%&lt;br /&gt;Linoleic 8-28%&lt;br /&gt;Palmitic 6-8%&lt;br /&gt;Stearic 2%</li>
    <li> Works great. Has no scent and is easily absorbed. I use it along with a scented lotion to make my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> used this to make homemade vanilla sugar scrub: equal parts almond oil &amp; brown sugar. mix well then add a little vanilla extract. it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Great for making sugar scrubs!</li>
    <li> I will never buy oils from Whole Foods again thanks to this purchase; much better value for the buck and amount!</li>
    <li> I needed something that was natural and steroid free to ease the eczema on my leg and arm. There are no worries of using too much for too long as there is with a steroid.</li>
    <li> I keep glass vase of this near my bed. It&#x27;s great for massages and lubrication. My one complaint is that the bottle&#x27;s opening is hard to pour from. If you want to pour it into a smaller bottle, you&#x27;ll need a funnel.</li>
    <li> Great value, works well for massage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a masseuse, but this oil got me and my gf giving each other massages about once a week!</li>
    <li> good product good price and quantity</li>
    <li> Love the size for the price. Please keep it that way. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This oil is very nice ! Leaves your skin baby bottom smooth , its VERY light and not greasy feeling .</li>
    <li> Great value and great product!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD VALUE. ABSOLUTELY NO SCENT.</li>
    <li> Nice oil to use in homemade beauty products. Mild smelling and moisturizes well. I&#x27;ve never tried to use it for cooking.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition but it just wasn&#x27;t enough for what I needed it for. If i needed smaller amounts i would buy from them again or see if they have it in larger volume.</li>
    <li> almond oil Sweet oil from what I understand it is a carrier oil. Although I expected something that smell like almond oil. This did not. I am somewhat disappointed. As I&#x27;m trying to make a lotion for Christmas I will however be returning some of the oil some of the essential oils. And trying to find some more to my liking. As a carrier oil I&#x27;m sure this will be fine.</li>
    <li> This is a decent quality product for the price. Worked well for me making home made balm. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is very pleased I bought this. I am pleased she is pleased. Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Almond Oil Sweet Oil - 1 Quart</li>
    <li> Great value for this oil.  Scentless.  Absorbs easily.  Will use in homemade lotion to reduce the greasiness factor.  As always, I am pleased with this Essential Depot product.</li>
    <li> This is virtually odorless- I used it to make some sugar scrubs, and it worked out very well. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This almond oil is lovely for dry or chapped skin. I&#x27;ve been mixing fragrance oils with small amounts and using it on my hands and elbows. Sinks in quickly and, with the added fragrance, smells divine. I don&#x27;t smell much of anything when it&#x27;s straight out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> The oil that I received was a bit on the thin compared to other Almond oils I&#x27;ve purchased. It will work for the sugar scrubs that I&#x27;m making with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine for making body lotion bars.</li>
    <li> Use this for my homemade products. Nice oil...not much to say as it is just great oil, I&#x27;d get it again.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Great product.  I&#x27;ll be ordering again!!!</li>
    <li> We were looking for skin moisturizers that were not filled with chemicals or have been overly processed&lt;br /&gt;What people don&#x27;t realize is that 99% of what they buy to moisturize with has all the chemicals and things that are in the oils you cook with that are not good for you</li>
    <li> I love almond oil and this is a wonderful product, I used it make christmas gifts for my friends and loved ones</li>
    <li> Good price, good quantity.  Oil can be gently wiped off using a paper towel.  Moisturizing.  No noticeable odors.&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product.</li>
    <li> Lasts forever.  Wonderful on hair and skin.  I use with essential oils as well.  Smells good.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.  Great shipping.  Amazing quality.  Really love this almond oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had keratosis pilaris since I was a kid. If you don&#x27;t know what that is, it&#x27;s scaly bumps usually found on the upper arms. It&#x27;s not pretty but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I bought this oil when I found out I was pregnant. I use it all over my body every time I bathe. My husband noticed a couple of months ago that the skin on my arms was very soft, not bumpy at all. Thanks sweet almond oil!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOOOOVE this product!!! I&#x27;m always having dry skin and I go to school in Ohio and we all know how dry and cold the air gets in the winter time! I do not like the smell at all! It smells like cooking oil! I was hoping for that sweet almond smell. I mix it with my regular lotion for the fun of it. BUT! It does get the job done! I use it for my natural hair too!</li>
    <li> works well, mixed it with lavender fragrance and I oil myself with it daily</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly, great moisturizer.  I love to use this in my hair as an oil treatment.  It is the only oil I have tried that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, just soft and silky.  I also used it while pregnant on my belly and ended up with no stretch arks.  And this was my second pregnancy.  I recommend this sweet almond oil!</li>
    <li> The oil was ok- expensive for so-so quality. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Use this for making soap. Expected it to smell but I&#x27;m not too familiar with it...maybe it doesn&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> I use this oil daily for homemade facial scrubs, hair conditioning and as a hand moisturizer. This is a high quality product and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.  It lasts a long time, but when I finally run out I will reorder this product.  It has a *very* light scent so when I add essential oils the finished product smells like whatever I added without any residual odors.</li>
    <li> Great product for everyday skin care and for DIY projects.</li>
    <li> Almond oil is an ingredient is several bath oils, soaps and lotions I made this holiday season. Loved the quality of this product and that it shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
    <li> Great stuff for soap making and lotion making. Will order again when I run low. Very high quality.</li>
    <li> product is working very good with my projects and products, I will probably start using more of this product and seller more often.</li>
    <li> Great and Exceptionally Speedy Seller! I bought this to add to my collection of oils because I love reading about oils and their use and purpose. The great deal from Essential Depot allow me to feel free to mix until my heart is content.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price!  I love that this oil is basically unscented.  I make my own products, so it takes far less essential oils to mask some other carrier oils scents.  Just a few drops of an essential oil to a few ounces of this and you have an instant massage oil that absorbs and moisturizes!  So many uses!</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it every night on my face with my all natural oils. I have not had any problems with break-out like I have using lotions. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  I used up the first one QUICK! I use it for my skin and my hair, works well mixed with essential oils.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Used in a salt scrub and left my skim feeling wonderful.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  I purchased two (1 quart bottles), of this oil to use as a carrier with Lavender.  A few drops of lavender oil in 8 ounces of this oil was tooooo much.  I used the almond oil on my body and had to re-apply after about an hour because I felt super dry.  I would think twice before reordering</li>
    <li> My dughter got this for something, don&#x27;t know what, but she said it worked well. Guess that is all need be said.</li>
    <li> I use this for my homemade beauty products. This was a great value for my money. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love Essential Depot products, have consistently been good quality and good value. This almond oil is light and has no fragrance. Have used it for a carrier oil for EO, and in facial moisturizer and soap making. Has worked well in all applications. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love it: good quality and large volume.</li>
    <li> This is good Almond oil.  I use this everyday on my hair I add it with my other products and it work will</li>
    <li> I use this with a few drops of tea tree morning and night after washing my face. I love it! My face loves it! It goes on oily, but soaks in so fast and doesn&#x27;t leave oilyness or shininess. My skin never feels dry after I use it, and doesn&#x27;t get too oily during the day. This was the best price for the most product that I could find on Amazon, which is why I ordered it. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great oil for massage therapy. I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions with other oils, and even bacterial issues, but the mildly antibacterial nature of this oil makes it great to use on your entire body. No scents or smells is a plus for sensitive people. Highly recommended, along with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I use this almond oil as my hand and body lotion. It works wonderfully. Soaks in pretty quickly and no oily residue.</li>
    <li> I loooove sweet almond oil. I mix this in with my body lotion, face moisturizer, and hair leave in conditioner. This helped so much with my scars. It took about a week of continous use for my arm scar to completely fade. This also made wonders on my face. My face is free of blemishes and it&#x27;s so smooth. I purchased this a couple of months ago and you would think that I used this up pretty quickly since I put it on most of the products that I use. But nope, the bottle is still pretty full. This would last me a really long time. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower right before I&#x27;m ready to get out. It traps the moisture that way and leaves my skin feeling soft. If you do this, though, leave a washcloth handy to wipe any spillage off the floor or your husband will get all growly with you about &amp;#34;slipping and almost dying in the shower&amp;#34;. He&#x27;s a wuss.</li>
    <li> I use this product exclusively following my regular swimming exercises, as an alternative to moisturizing body wash products; a bit greasy, as one would expect.</li>
    <li> Great bargain!  I use it to make a bath scrub.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> Since I started moving towards all things organic and natural I love using this in my homemade cleansers.  My skin feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Item as promised</li>
    <li> Great deal, nice oil. Bought with pack of Soft &#x27;N Style Classic Lotion Dispenser Bottles.  Great combo</li>
    <li> quality oil from a quality company. light, sweet. a reorder and will continue to order in the future.</li>
    <li> Making lots of soap with it.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> great stuff!! i use this oil for everything..my baths and skin moisturizing and leave in conditioner for my hair before i wash it and its just an amazing silky feeling...can help with many skin conditions including acne and stretch marks...</li>
    <li> This oil is great for skin care. Smells lovely.</li>
    <li> I use this as an ingredient for the lotion I make.  It works well and hydrates my skin nicely.  Both times I ordered this the lid wasn&#x27;t securely fastened and leaked about an ounce into the box.</li>
    <li> Went through it so fast. I need more lol</li>
    <li> Went through the whole bottle already. Has worked great for Cold Process Soap, Body butter, Lip balm, eye make up remover, and moisturizer</li>
    <li> The best skin and hair moisturizer you can buy.</li>
    <li> Great base oil for essential oils.  Nice for massage, very light.</li>
    <li> Thanks good price great product</li>
</ol>
