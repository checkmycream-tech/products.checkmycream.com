<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this product.  Easy to rinse out and smells great!  She receives compliments all the time on how great her hair looks and smells.  Customers for life!</li>
    <li> Hard to rinse out, but afterwards my hair is softer and more manageable, but I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Nothing like Wen. Leaves hair greasy after a day. Smells nice and easy to pump, but it didn&#x27;t work like I wanted.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this product entirely misses the mark.  I was looking for a Wen replacement, and this is not it.  Where Wen is thick and creamy, this product is thin and runny.  Before I even got it onto my hair, I lost most of it because it ran through my fingers. The scent is absolutely not coconut at all, which you would expect to be light and airy -- instead it is very heavy and musky -- gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> I waited awhile before reviewing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: IT WORKS! My hair is soft, clean and easy to style. I don&#x27;t really have &amp;#34;bad hair days&amp;#34; anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The pump is really hard to pump.&lt;br /&gt;Random comments: The product viscosity is fairly thin. I have never used a cowash before, so I have nothing to compare the viscosity to.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that need to use a good amount of product per use. Not a big deal - the product is still a good value for the price - just something to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would recommend this product and I would buy again. Despite the packaging (I don&#x27;t like the pump!) it has consistently worked great on my hair.</li>
    <li> My new favorite Renpure product - it cleanses very well, has a pleasing smell, and leaves my hair shiny &amp; moisturized. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, better than the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34;. I have been using Renpure products for years. I really like them better than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; one. Beside this Coconut Creme Cowash Cleansing Pudding, I have used Renpure Lavender Cleansing Conditioner, Renpure Solutions Cleansing Conditioner, Sweet Pomegranate, Renpure Solutions Cleansing Conditioner, Rosemary Mint and Renpure Coconut Creme Cowash Cleansing Conditioner. They all have a amazing scent and are better for you hair and scalp, than regular shampoos.&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B00JJQ73EM Renpure Coconut Creme Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, 16 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> NO comparison to WEN.  I felt like it weighed my curls way down.  It was heavy and I did not control the fuzz.  I think it could be good for straight hair.</li>
    <li> The product was very thin.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but the consistence was thinner than expected.</li>
    <li> Good alternative but not a replacement for Wen for me. I loved the smell and hoped for better results. The consistency is too thin and watery for me and I use Wen diluted at 50% with only 6-8 pumps where Renpure took at least 12-15 pumps to cover my medium lenght hair (shorter hair than the girl on the bottle). Because I needed to apply a lot of product I felt it wasn&#x27;t much of a cost savings.</li>
    <li> I agree with many previous reviews. Wen is expensive, so I was shopping for something natural simular results to Wen. This is not it. After washing my hair with Renpure, my hair felt like not alive,I tried few different conditioners, so I could be able to brush my hair. It does cleanse well though. I do not know, may be, if your hair are not colored as mine, it will work for you. It didn&#x27;t work for me. Back to Wen.</li>
    <li> Never used a cleansing conditioner before, and I enjoy it. Makes my hair soft and manageable, and I have some very think curly hair. Although I do not use for every wash, I feel as if there is too much build up, so I use regular shampoo in between (every 3-4 washes) then use the cleansing conditioner as a replacement to conditioner, and back to just cleansing again.</li>
    <li> I purchased a couple of these products after seeing the infomercials on an expensive name brand,as this is very much the same. I had to wash my hair a couple times the first time to remove all the product buildup(shampoos,conditioners, treatment, mousse, hairspray ,root lifters, and my hair is foil colored. I have never been able to get a brush or comb thru my hair without alot of conditioner after washing or even getting wet, even trying to run my fingers thru would pull out a hand full of hair using a reg conditioner,I could run my fingers thru this without taking any hair with it! My hair feels so soft and clean and smells fantastic! My husband kept playing with it as it&#x27;s so soft. I will never go back to sulfate shampoos.This will leave your hair soft as silk.</li>
    <li> It smells nothing like coconut. But it still has a good fresh scent &amp; it cleans well &amp; conditions too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thin, and takes quite a bit of it to fully coat the hair; which in turn makes it a very time-consuming process. Also, the smell is sort of baby powderish, which is most definitely not what I was expecting from a Coconut Creme Cowash. Call me crazy, but I sort of expected it to smell like coconut.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. This is my favorite Renpure cleansing conditioner! I use it in conjunction with the &amp;#34;As I AM&amp;#34; coconut cowash after I&#x27;ve been in the pool or ocean to add extra moisture and for easy detangling. The rest of the time the Renpure is perfect on its own!  Great smell, rinses clean!</li>
    <li> Cheap and smells great</li>
    <li> Really good. Smells great!!</li>
    <li> perfect wash for natural hair, provides enough suds to clean hair and moisture to give you the shine as traditional conditioners</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been comparing a lot of these cleansing conditioners for a while now.. I like the idea of WEN, but would never pay that much for a shampoo... I&#x27;ve tried quite a few others, and have to say, I like the way my hair looks the best using the Renpure products..&lt;br /&gt;I really did not expect to like the Renpure line because it is very thin and runny, compared to other brands that are very thick. At first I didn&#x27;t feel like it could possible clean my hair, as it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough body to do anything, but my hair actually does look, and feel better using this line than any other.&lt;br /&gt;I do feel I use more of this product than others, but I don&#x27;t seem to use the bottle any quicker.. I have thick, curly, shoulder length hair, and I need about 20 pumps of this per wash compared to about 10 or 12 pumps of others.. Seems like the bottle would empty quicker, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I get my hair really wet in the shower, massage this in really well and let it sit while I bath... Then I massage it in again and rinse... I have also added a little dab of it to my towel dried hair, but honestly, when I forget to do that, my hair turns out the same. After my first use, I was afraid it would be hard to comb my hair, but it really isn&#x27;t.. I just detangle it with my fingers as I&#x27;m rinsing it and it combs out fine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 60, so my hair has become much dryer than it ever was before, so I can only wash my hair a couple of times a week now... This product keeps my hair fresh and clean in between washings...&lt;br /&gt;This product (the coconut creme cowash) has a very nice, light, pleasant coconut smell. I wondered what the difference is between the Renpure coconut creme cowash and the Renpure coconut creme cleansing puddings, so I purchased both.. They appear to be the very same product, only the pudding has a different fragrance (more flowery than coconut)... Other than that, I would say they&#x27;re the same product.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a month I started noticing dandruff. I&#x27;ve never had dandruff before. Gross! I&#x27;m back to regular shampoo and conditioner now.</li>
    <li> I love it. It hidrates my hair and makes it really manageable.</li>
    <li> This has such a stong perfume scent that I can&#x27;t use it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut at all which would be ok if the scent wasn&#x27;t so strong, I had to rehash my hair to keep from getting a migraine.  I&#x27;ll stick to the pomegranate stuff.</li>
    <li> This cowash is more watery than I was expecting. I have purchased &amp;#34;As I Am&amp;#34; cowash in the past and just thought I would try something different. This cowash just doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean and leaves it feeling flat and with less fullness and body as &amp;#34;As I Am.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;As I Am&amp;#34; is closest to the Wen products that I have used but more reasonably priced. I will go back to using &amp;#34;As I Am.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo, gets better as you use it more. First couple of times I was not so impressed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have used Wen for several months and I&#x27;m excited that this is almost better than Wen and much less expensive.</li>
    <li> I hated this product.  It is nothing like the 4 other cowashing products I have tried.  For me the whole draw of a cleansing conditioner is to have gentle cleansing and wonderful conditioning that truly leaves my hair feeling light and not weighed down.  This product performed the opposite of that for me.  I used it twice with the same result both times - hair that felt thick, greasy &amp; horrible within about 12 hours of use.  I am generally an every other day type of person with hair that does get greasy at the root by the end of day 2 - but never on day 1!  Horrible stuff.  If it helps, I will also describe that I have extremely thick, coarse color-treated hair in a slightly longer than chin length bob.  This felt like a leave in conditioner it was so sticky in my hair even after rinsing and rinsing and rinsing again (especially the second time I tried it, as I thought maybe I just did not rinse enough the first time around).  I do not recommend this at all.  It did have a lovely scent which I found to be very coconut (I see a lot of negative reviews on the scent being more powdery but I thought it was a nice scent).</li>
    <li> I bought this trying alternatives to Wen. Although I love the smell of it, it is so thin and runny. It does not lather at all. I found it more useful as a body moisturizer right out of the shower. I do not find it a good substitute for Wen</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, but I can&#x27;t rate it highly because of the ingredients. This creme cowash is not free from harmful ingredients like Renpure advertises. It contains a formaldehyde releaser called Diazolidinyl Urea. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen, and not something I wish to put on my hair or skin. While I&#x27;m glad Renpure does not use parabens, I&#x27;m disappointed about the Urea. I think Renpure should reassess their ingredients and not mislead their customers into thinking we are using a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; product. Though I cringe to pay the high price for Wen, I would rather occasionally treat myself to Wen than expose my skin to formaldehyde.</li>
    <li> Artificial coconut aroma and texture thin and leaves hair greasy.</li>
    <li> works great for my daughters think curly hair !</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have bought it 4 different times. My hair is soft and very shiny and my husband loves it for his beard too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but I have to go back to Wen products. I have color treated hair, thick and curly. I wanted to scream as I was brushing my hair after washing my hair. It was all matted tangled and almost got the hair brush stuck in my hair. I can&#x27;t use this product any more I doubt they will give me my money back. I was truly looking for a replacement for Wen. I will pay for Wen from now on.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Isn&#x27;t as thick as some of the other cleansing conditioners and is easier to get into the roots of your hair to rub in. Love this one the most out of all the RenPure fragrances / formulas.</li>
    <li> Would not purchase this product again. Disappointed in the performance. Did not feel good from first application. Not a very effective conditioner.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but....Amazing product! I used the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method for a long time, which balanced the PH of my scalp nicely, but unfortunately because my hair is so long (below my hips) the ends were getting too dried out. I really didn&#x27;t want to go back to regular shampoo and conditioner, as I knew the harsh chemicals would wreak havoc on all the work I&#x27;d done to cut them out in the first place. I tried Wen for awhile, and although it had more chemicals than I would have liked, I did enjoy it. However, it was insanely expensive and I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep it up. I made my own cleansing conditioner using all organic oils and essential oils, with a specially chosen &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; conditioner (btw, if you have the time to do this it is well worth it!) but because of an increasingly hectic schedule I kept running out before I had time to make more. Enter RenPure. I was hesitant to try this, as I&#x27;d seen a lot of cleansing conditioners that just weren&#x27;t effective or had too many fragrances, chemicals, etc. The RenPure product is indeed a bit thinner than Wen as some people have mentioned, but I&#x27;ve found that this only helps it to last longer as a little goes a long way. I was using a whole bottle of Wen every 2 weeks, but I&#x27;ve had this product for almost 2 weeks now and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent. Don&#x27;t forget - I have extremely long, thick hair that is very fine. This product cleanses well and leaves a beautiful shine, but does not leave a greasy residue or weigh my hair down. I was at my wits end, because my hair had started to be unruly, frizzy, and weird, which it never had been in the past....but after only a few uses of this product, my hair is back to being luxurious, soft, and smooth. I have mostly straight hair, which is slightly wavy, and this cowash allows the wave to come through by not weighing it down, but does not leave my hair frizzy which is what was happening with a lot of the other products I&#x27;d tried. The scent is also fantastic!I love coconut, and this scent is tropical and sweet without being overpowering. I also have the rosemary mint cc and I love that as well!</li>
    <li> It smells so nice and really keeps my hair soft and healthy looking..Renpure is a very good product Ive been using it for about 2 years</li>
    <li> Searching for a Wen replacement, strictly because of the cost. I am 60+, long highlighted hair, thick, slightly wavy. I used Wen for a couple of years and I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s the reason my hair has stayed thick and healthy, despite the abuse of sun in the summer and highlights in the winter. I tried the Renpure because of other reviews. I am disappointed in it. It is VERY thin and watery, so it takes a LOT of pumps to saturate my headful of hair. It has zero &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so I still need to use a conditioner or I will never get a comb through my hair. Leaves my hair fuzzy and parched looking and feeling. Back to WEN I guess :-)</li>
    <li> This wash works fairly well, but I still have to scrub my scalp even though the directions say do not scrub. The consistency is very thin, but I put it on, scrub my scalp, and comb it through with a wide tooth comb. What I do not like is the fragrance. The smell has actually kept me from using the product unless I am out of my other co-washes. It would make sense for the fragrance to be coconut, but instead it is a strong smell like cheap men&#x27;s cologne. It is overpowering, so if you are sensitive to strong odors, pass on this shampoo. Update: I  bought another bottle after smelling the new coconut fragrance. Gone is the old man cologne smell, so I am changing my rating to four. I do have to use a lot of the product, and it is rather thin, but it does work as well as Wen.</li>
    <li> Only four stars for the scent, which has something in addition to the coconut that gives it a bit of an earthy scent. I will buy a different scent from Renpure when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the differnece in my hair since using this.  No frizz, soft and smooth and manageable.  I just bought 4 more bottles of this!.  I tried Wen before but my goodness the price is ridiculous!!!  This is reasonable and works great and the smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> Leaves a film in the hair, as if you hadn&#x27;t rinsed enough...tames the frizz. Would use with shampoo first.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair but a lot of it, it is heat and color damaged as well. I also have a scalp that dries up and gets red and irritated by most shampoos. If I wash daily with shampoo, my scalp gets flaky. If I skip washes to reduce the scalp irritation, my thin hair gets oily. I&#x27;ve tried dandruff shampoos, low sulfate/low sud shampoos, &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;, to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was watching bad tv in the middle of the night and saw an infomercial for Wen. I googled it, saw a ton of bad reviews for the price, so looked for a comparable product that cost less. I found Renpure. I started with the Rosemary Mint cleansing conditioner. It cleaned my hair and my irritated scalp healed for the most part, but I was a bit underwhelmed and felt it was still too drying. I had to use a separate conditioner still which seemed like it defeated the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this next because it was advertised for damaged hair. Since you just apply it to the strands and don&#x27;t rub it into your scalp like shampoo, you get no build up. My hair is like fabulous salon commercial hair now, and I don&#x27;t need an additional conditioner, even though I just bleached my hair. I think I found exactly what my hair needs. I use a shampoo brush to run it through every strand, then massage my scalp as I&#x27;m rinsing it to keep it clean. No more angry scalp, no more sad hair.</li>
    <li> I love this cowash. It keeps my hair manageable and hydrated without buildup.  I use it as part of the curly girl method and it has worked well for me!</li>
    <li> This works great and is what took the place of Wen for me.</li>
    <li> very runny, Im used to using Wen, so I was not pleasantly surprised! The price, I knew it was to good to be true!! You get what you pay for. Although, it had a nice smell!!!</li>
    <li> My hair felt like I had a sticky film on it - so much so that I could even run my fingers through my hair without them getting stuck and tangled.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that leaves my hair clean and conditioned. I have thin and fine long blonde hair so I was very concerned that a conditioning cleanser would weigh down my hair. It doesn&#x27;t! It is soft and still has clean volume. I would recommend this all my friends. I use it every other day or when I have worked and and just need a quick rinse.</li>
    <li> It is to thin of a product, does nothing for me</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m just use to Wen, I love that product, this one is way to much perfume in it and seems watery, I wanted to give it a try but I wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> This does not smell like coconut AT ALL. It&#x27;s a very strong perfumey smell that gives me a headache.  Also it seems watery and does not leave my hair feeling soft at all. Sadly, thumbs down.</li>
    <li> This is my new absolute favorite in hair care! I have used other conditioning cleaners and liked the way my hair felt. But my complaints about the other brands sent me back to using regular shampoo. The thick consistency of the other brands I tried did not work too well in pump bottles. I had to use quite a bit to cover my hair. I would go through bottles quickly because of having to use so much. Also, there was always a lot of product left stuck in the bottle that would not come out. If you can manage to cut those thick plastic bottles in half when they&#x27;re almost empty, I guess you could get it all! Not only that, but a 12 oz bottle at $10 and up just isn&#x27;t cost wise. When I ran across this new product by Redmond, I had to give it a try. I LOVE IT! The bottle is larger, 16 oz. The consistency is more liquid-y, and I actually use less. The scent is awesome! The price is the same, making Renpure a much better deal all the way around!&lt;br /&gt;I love the Renpure line of products - NO harsh chemicals and NO animal testing. I hope they don&#x27;t ever stop making this product because my hair loves it! I highly recommend this for anyone with chemically treated or dry hair. I believe this would also be safe on keratin straightened hair because there are no sulfates or sodium.&lt;br /&gt;If, like me, you have tried other conditioning cleansers and been disappointed, give this one a try. I really think you&#x27;ll be impressed!</li>
    <li> Smells good. Cleans very well. Leave hair soft.</li>
    <li> This is an ok Cowash. I think it&#x27;s great for the price, but Wen works better. I&#x27;ll purchase again simply because Wen is way out of my price range and I really like being able to get out of the shower faster by combining shampooing and conditioning. Didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or heavy. If anything it was too light of a conditioner.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an ok cleansing conditioner. Nothing like Wen cleansing conditioners, which are WAY better (although very pricey). Was really hoping Renpure would be great since it&#x27;s so much cheaper than Wen, but not so.</li>
    <li> I have used both the Pomegranate and Rosemary Renpure Conditioning Cleansers and and have been overall happy with those products.  They all clean really well and leave your hair soft, manageable and shiny.  I get considerably less hair fall with these products and I don&#x27;t feel the need to scrub at my hair and scalp to get them clean.  I love that the Renpure line has no harsh chemicals that can upset the balance of your hair&#x27;s natural ability to keep itself moist and healthy and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the bottle of the Coconut Cr&amp;egrave;me Cowash, I was expecting it to smell like all the other coconut products, but I was amazingly surprised and pleased to find it had this amazingly rich scent that I fell in love with right away. It smells so rich and beautiful that I actually smiled as I was using it.  I use less of it than some of the other co-washes I had purchased (I have course, curly 3a hair) and my hair feels good and moisturized right after using.  Hours later it still smells wonderful and is shiny and curly and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am so very pleased with the Renpure line, but especially with the Coconut Creme Cowash and I highly suggest trying it for any hair but fine hair.  I think that it would weigh down fine hair slightly, so it may not work as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just discovering cowashes (cleansing conditioners) and because of them I am finally able to wear my fine, wavy hair as just that - soft waves and curls.  Previous to this, I never was great at coaxing curl that looked good and wore my 2a/2b hair straight, dealing sort of poorly with the consequences if high humidity hit.  I tried this and the Coconut Cleansing Pudding of the same brand simply because I was curious about Wen, but the price and &#x27;subscription&#x27; service tripped my scam/cheapskate alarms.  So, I&#x27;ve never tried Wen but I&#x27;m thankful it exists, because before hearing about it I never knew that cowashing existed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to my actual experience with the product -- My hair and scalp feel clean using this and I think I produce slightly less oil, though I still use this everyday (I do not know how people can skip washes, but I think they have a whole technique to it that I am not privy to).  This product leaves my hair healthier and more moisturized than shampoo and condition combos ever have, and I&#x27;ve used many kinds including high end.  I&#x27;m not really hard on my hair -- I air-dry or blow-dry, but don&#x27;t color, straighten or use curling irons -- and this still improved the way my hair felt.  I never realized that it had a bit of dryness to it!  Now, it feels more quenched.  I always thought I over-conditioned, but I guess the conditioners just weren&#x27;t as effective, or the shampoos caused too much damage for the conditioner to make up for.  While this made my hair feel healthier, it did not block out the frizz that well or bring the curl out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I like this cowash, but I LOVE the pudding version.  The pudding does everything this cowash does, except it takes it to ELEVEN!  Hair is fully quenched with moisture, softness, shine, frizz is locked out, and my curl appears out of nowhere.  I freaking love my hair on the pudding!  I can air-dry without looking like a frizzenstein experiment and without product.  I actually air-dry or blow-dry justthe top of my hair and it looks great, from soft waves to a sexy bedroom/beachy look.  My hair looks and feels better and I&#x27;m spending less time styling it.  If you have fine hair like me, you can definitely use this stuff and, in my case, the heavier, more moisturizing version worked better and gave me more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be able to use the rest of this bottle, but it doesn&#x27;t do what the pudding did -- it appears I need more moisture than this cowash provides to get the optimal results.  I could, of course, wear my hair straighter with this, but I&#x27;ve confirmed that my hair will respond to some kind of moisturizing product after using this wash and the curls will pop out/frizz be gone.  I tested this with a sample of Agave healing oil treatment that I had and the results were great (and smelled heavenly).  Keep in mind that I was going straight before this and use minimal products anyway, so if you are a curly girl with all your usual products at hand you may not even have any issues with this cowash (but try the pudding when you get a chance!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So blah blah blah... this stuff is pretty good, pudding is great, and here are my only issues overall, which I&#x27;d like to direct to the Renpure company:&lt;br /&gt;1)  The difference between the pudding and the cowash is not at all explained on the packaging.  If you look at the ingredients, they appear to be the same.  In actuality, the pudding is much thicker and works differently because of that.  It would be nice if Renpure would indicate usage/recommendations/anything to help customers know which version might be best for them.  This also goes for the differences, if any, between the different scents of cowash.&lt;br /&gt;2)  I have mostly positive things to say about the aroma.  Both versions smell identically, and while I like the smell, I don&#x27;t love it.  It smells a bit like real fresh coconut mixed with drugstore fragrance base...or something to that effect.  I&#x27;m fine with the smell, but mostly I am bored ofit.  Renpure, please make other flavors of Pudding!!!!  If you prefer the cowash to the pudding, they have already got you covered in this area.</li>
    <li> I used this for two weeks on my very, very thick hair. It basically felt dirty for those two weeks. It was hard to brush all the time, and the build up on my scalp was gross and made my hair greasy after a few hours (I can usually go 2-3 days before it gets visibly greasy). I switched to another brand that I don&#x27;t like as much for scent, but that actually works for my hair. Bummed it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> Love love love it! I&#x27;ve used wen, Pantene, you name it I&#x27;ve used it if it said cleansing cream. This by far best product for the price. Very affordable and I love the coconut scent! It&#x27;s not too over powering which is great!</li>
    <li> Luv it. Needs more coconut smell tho</li>
    <li> I stopped using shampoo about 4 months ago. Initially, I would just rinse my hair, but I found it difficult to detangle my hair after rinsing it. I have hip-length hair that is very fine and I usually have to use a lot of conditioner (an entire handful) just to make my hair manageable enough to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Renpure at a local drugstore (where it costs 11 dollars) and tried it out. It has a very thin texture and does not lather. The scent is pleasant. (I think the Coconut one is the best one, but they all smell good.  The Coconut one seems to be a bit creamier than the other varieties.)  The bottle says to use 10+ pumps, but I find that I have to use 20 pumps or more because of how long my hair is. I put most of it onto my scalp and I massage it in. I add a splash of water and work it down to the ends of my hair. After I&#x27;m done with the rest of my shower, I rinse out the Renpure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week of using Renpure, I noticed is that my hair seemed to be falling out more than usual. First, I thought it was postpartum hair loss. Then, after I did some research, I learned that many regular shampoos and conditioners contain binding agents that prevent detached hair strands from falling out, giving the illusion of more volume. In other words, even though most people lose about 100 strands of hair per day, many of those strands stay on your head attached to other strands of hair if you use volumizing products. Many people who stop using shampoo experience increased shedding because these 100 strands actually fall out instead of falling out and getting stuck to other strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months in, I notice that I lose about 10-15 strands of hair each time I use Renpure, which still alarms me, but I suppose it&#x27;s normal after all.  My hair is softer and in better condition than ever before.  It is so much easier to detangle, and I can go much longer in between &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note: I have gone through about 8 or 9 bottles of Renpure, and 3 of them have had defective pumps. I was unable to get the pump to work. Not the end of the world, but it&#x27;s an annoying manufacturing defect.s of Renpure, and 3 of them have had defective pumps. I was unable to get the pump to work. Not the end of the world, but it&#x27;s an annoying manufacturing defect.</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks.  It is very runny and diluted..do not recommend AT ALL.</li>
    <li> have to use a lot to have my hair conditioned well</li>
    <li> A little heavy and strong perfumed scent but very moisturizing and works good especially as a leave in conditioner for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be as good as Wen cleansing conditioner, so much cheaper!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Cleans very well, leaves hair SOFT, and the smell is perfect. I liked it better than the higher priced cleansing conditioner that I have used in the past. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Smells really great. Leaves it easy to comb through when finished. Does what it says. Affordable.</li>
    <li> I have very curly and firzzy hair, this product is Great. My hair does not feel dry and looks healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really been like this so far! It&#x27;s a very pleasant product! When I originally opened it I thought the smell was a little rough, and I&#x27;m all about the smell - so I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it. When I used it in my hair, contrary to what I was suspecting, the smell was very pleasant. It&#x27;s a faint, yet sweet scent of coconut. The smell doesn&#x27;t last too long, but unlike other people I don&#x27;t care how long the smell actually lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this product you should use the directions that wen gives. Make sure your hair is SOAKING wet, put it in generously, be sure to massage it through, and then take your normal shower. I recommend leaving it in for a least 10 minutes after applying it and massaging it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve most definitely noticed that my hair is much more manageable and softer after only a month, a really great product! The one reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the product consistency, I would prefer for it to be a little thicker.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  Makes my hair appear thicker and it feels better!!</li>
    <li> This cowash is the best.  I makes my hair soft, smooth, and even straightens it a bit, which I love.  I have wavy, frizzy hair that will usually start to wave after a few hours from drying it straight.  This really keeps it straight, throughout the day, even if I let dry naturally.  Lasts longer than WEN, is thinner in application BUT just as effective, very smoothing, smells better, is cruelty free, and has a better makeup than WEN.  Love all my Renpure products.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as Wen, but for the price, I can use it daily. I&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
    <li> When I purchased Renpure, I thought it would be thick like the other co-washing conditioners I purchased.  The consistency is to THIN.  Now I know what I like &amp; do not like.  I like AS I AM.  It is thick &amp; creamy.</li>
    <li> I like it but still prefer WEN although WEN is pricier.</li>
    <li> A thinner consistency than Wen.</li>
    <li> Works great and does wonders for my hair. All I could ask for.</li>
    <li> I am going to start with the smell, it is amazing. It smells JUST like coconut cream pie mixed with vanilla ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was poor, the pump had leaked all over the plastic it was wrapped in, however, it was wrapped in plastic so the product did not get all over everything.&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly effective. I have damaged hair from bleaching and hot tools and such, and it has really improved the softness of my hair (split ends as well) , BUT! It does make my roots super oily. If you are looking for an alternative to wen, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. It is a great conditioner, but shampoo will be needed twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I think this is a great product to use just as conditioner.</li>
    <li> love renpure products.... makes your hair soft and hairdye lasts longer</li>
    <li> I like it but prefer the thicker richer wen products. But for the price compared to wen-total thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Let me pre-empt this review with the fact that I used Wen for almost a year (loved it, miss it), but it&#x27;s way out of my budget right now. So, I&#x27;ve started the same search as many past Wen lovers for a similarly performing cleansing conditioner. This is the 4th one I&#x27;ve tried (I&#x27;ve used As I Am Coconut Cowash, Herbal Essences, Lisa Rachel and this one) and honestly, I&#x27;m a little disappointed - maybe my expectations were too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, my hair type: I&#x27;m caucasian with 90% gray hair that is colored (L&#x27;oreal Preference, every 3-4 weeks, roots only), slightly wavy (that gets frizzy, naturally and can look damaged even when healthy and is soft to the touch), long layers, shoulder blade length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointment came, mainly, because this stuff is SO thin. I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; as thin as a shampoo - actually thinner than my Redkin Real Control shampoo. I actually had to use more because it&#x27;s so watery - it dribbles out of your hand if you&#x27;re not careful and to get it from your hand onto the top of your head and then worked through feels ... like you&#x27;re working with water. It&#x27;s hard to tell where you&#x27;ve gotten it into your hair and where it&#x27;s still just water. So, I probably use more pumps just to ensure my hair is thoroughly saturated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say to apply once, massage through, leave in for a few minutes and then rinse. Well, even though my hair is colored, it&#x27;s still in healthy condition, I still needed a second application to get any kind of &#x27;slip&#x27; or detangling action. And I left the first application on for at least 5 minutes while I showered, shaved, etc. (with a shower cap on). Even after a 2nd application, I needed to spray on a leave-in conditioner to comb through when wet. Now, that being said, when I tried ONLY the Renpure and then let it dry uncombed, it did turn out soft and somewhat shiny. So, if you&#x27;re OK with not combing until dry you may be able to get by with just the Renpure. It doesn&#x27;t calm the frizz as well as Wen - I&#x27;d sayit does abut 75% of the job that Wen would do. The scent? This one smells awesome and leaves a clean, fresh, slightly coconutty scent behind when hair dries - my hubby agrees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a good product - I just wish it was thicker and felt more conditioner-like when my hair was wet. If I were to go with another cleansing conditioner that I&#x27;ve used previously, I&#x27;d go back to the As I Am Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner. I&#x27;m about to order either the Salon Grafix Healthy Hair Nutrition Cleansing Conditioner or the Pantene Pro-v Truly Natural Hair Co-wash Conditioner, and hopefully one of those will work for me. But if not, I have a feeling I&#x27;ll go back to the As I Am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> The scent of this cleansing shampoo is amazing. It is quite a bit thinner than Wen, but I can&#x27;t really stand any of the smells of their shampoos. They always seem super chemically to me. My hair feels great after use. I have noticed less hair fallout with this. I rotate with ColorProof shampoo and conditioner for the UV benefits and color protection. Also because I put hair color in my conditioner and like to use it periodically to help my color stay vibrant. I am not sure if this shampoo would work well that way and don&#x27;t want to waste the hair color or the shampoo itself trying it out.</li>
    <li> The difference this product made in my hair was amazing! After the very first use I noticed  more shine and body than my hair has had in a very long time. I was a long time WEN user and this product is way better for my hair. I have bleached hair and the Renpure has made it softer and fuller than any other product I have ever used. Thank you</li>
    <li> My hair type tends to be a bit on the oily side, so I found that my hair gets greasier faster with this one. If you have oily hair, I suggest the mint version, it worked wonders!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other (expensive) cowashing cleansers and this is by far my favorite.  It makes my damaged flat hair look and feel soft,  fill of volume,  and Shiney but not oily.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Works just as good as Wen for me at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It seems like I have to use two or three big handfuls of this product for it to work. It is a bit thin, I&#x27;d say baby oil consistency. It has a subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t linger. I prefer the Pantene cleansing conditioner.</li>
    <li> I got it. I tried it. When my hair dried out It had that silky smooth feel I wanted, instead of my usual dried up frizz. And I got 2 bottles for less than half the price of one bottle of Wen. Oh, my hair smells yummy coconut too ;-)</li>
    <li> smells good and makes my hair feel clean and full</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit that I was skeptical about this product actually cleaning and conditioning my hair. I had tried a sample packet of a Hair One&#x27;s brand of cleansing co-wash, and it had a minty tingle that became unpleasant after a few minutes because it grew in intensity, and it smelled really weird. It also did not leave my hair feeling clean or conditioned. So I was pretty certain I wasn&#x27;t going to like the Renpure cleansing co-wash, either. I tried the Renpure out the other day, and wow! I really did not expect my hair to feel clean. When I was putting it in my hair, it was kind of thin. It would melt into my hair quickly, but it didn&#x27;t have that extra slippery feel that hair has when you put conditioner in it. I massaged my scalp as if I was shampooing my hair, and then I combed my fingers through my hair several times before clipping my hair up while I finished showering. When I rinsed the co-wash from my hair, my hair actually *felt* clean, like I had just shampooed it. Color me impressed! It also smells really good, like coconut cream pie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really speak for the conditioning properties of this product because I always put conditioning treatments in my hair after I shower, but I did comb my hair with a wide-toothed comb before I applied my conditioning treatments and I did not encounter any snags or tangles, so I am happy with it. This cleansing conditioner will help me extend the color in my hair and also prevent my from washing away the oils my hair needs. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I love the other Renpure cleansing conditioners, so I was excited to see the coconut kind. Unfortunately, it did not clean my hair as well as the pomegranate and the mint, both of which I give 4 stars. My hair looks limp and in need of a wash after only 12 hours.</li>
    <li> Made my hair smooth and silky... but for some reason it smells STRONGLY like a Catholic church.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this hair cleansing creme. Leaves my scalp and hair exceptionally clean soft and shiny.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Thought it would work as well as the other conditioning cleanser I&#x27;ve used for years, but it leaves my hair dry.</li>
    <li> I do really like most RenPure products, but I don&#x27;t like this one at all.  It does not smell like coconut at all.  It smells exactly like the regular shampoo they offer in the white and blue bottle.  I don&#x27;t even really understand it.  It doesn&#x27;t explain what &amp;#34;CO WASH&amp;#34; really is.  It says shampoo causes damage, so is this supposed to take place of shampooing? It&#x27;s confusing, and leaves me hair feeling greasy and straw-like.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have curly hair- we love this product</li>
    <li> Does not feel like wen at all. This is a very runny product. I will be giving this to a friend.</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and fine with multiple textures. It&#x27;s permanently dyed. My water has a very high iron content.  This shampoo is perfect for my problematic hair! I no longer feel like I am fighting with my hair to bring it back to civilization after I wash it! My hair is sleek and smooth and easy to comb right out of the shower!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling clean without extra greasiness like other heavier cleansing conditioners...</li>
    <li> Love the new way to wash your hair. Has a nice fresh smell. Does not produce a lot of lather, but does a gentle and clean hair wash.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. One of the best alternatives to Wen. It leaves your hair shiny, clean, soft and it smells amazing. (I have straight/oily hair)    Even though the product is runny (also creamy) but I found it works really well with the small pump it comes with. I tried a lot of other alternatives and the most complain I have is the pumps being so small that very little product comes out no matter how hard or how many times you pump. I always end up screwing open the top and just dump it onto my hand. It completely defeats the purpose of having a pump. With the consistency of this product it works great!</li>
    <li> I will keep ordering this !</li>
    <li> Product not as creamy as expected, i feel like i have to use more of this product than others. Smells great though! and leaves hair feeling great!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut like I thought it would. Smells like a men&#x27;s hair product and is runner than wen.</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair without stripping out.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with the level of cleansing I got from it, although I had to use much more than a few pumps due to the thickness and length of my hair. I thought moving to a cleansing conditioner would be good for my super damaged, color treated hair, but after about 2 months of use, my hair had dried out so much more than it already was. I had been trying to save as much of my hair as I could, but the damaged parts got so much more dry and I ultimately had to cut a lot of it off. This product would probably be great for completely healthy hair, but if your hair is even remotely damaged from coloring or heat styling, proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to try this because it was my1st attempt with Cowashing. The product is a very thin liquid so you do need to use ALOT more than what the directions say. That being said, I absolutely LOVE it. My hair has never looked better!</li>
    <li> This product is a bit thicker than other Renpure cowwash products, but it&#x27;s still runny compared to WEN. But for my long, fine, wavy hair this works and it&#x27;s way easier on my budget than Wen. I do combine it with As I Am coconut cowwash, which is thicker than Renpure, but lacks the coconut smell this Renpure has.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. Use a little more but not tested on animals, annals great, hair feels and looks great, super affordable. Will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! I don&#x27;t know how this got so many great reviews, it&#x27;s awful! I have been co-washing my hair for over a year now and I have used Wen and love it! But Wen is very expensive and I was trying to find a cheaper alternative. I bought this based on user reviews and I wish I hadn&#x27;t. It smells awful and made my hair very sticky. Fortunately I had some sulfate free shampoo on hand from when my hair was going through the transition to co-washing and I had to use it to get the stickiness out of my hair. It is also VERY runny.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I have seborrheic dermatitis and I cannot use most shampoos without breaking out every other week but with Renpure I have not had a break out in over a month!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I recently came across renpure coconut cleansing cream and the coconut milk conditioner at winners thought I would try it out. It is incredible. No rashes, my hair had genuinly never looked healthier in my life and it is so soft. Will definitely recommend this company to anyone.</li>
    <li> Purchased this cowash for my grandbabies hair. They are girl 4 and boy 3. They both have really dry dry scalp. The sulfates in the shampoo were not helping.&lt;br /&gt;This is awesome gets out mustard,sweat and raw egg they are really busy! Scalp less dry hair is more manageable. Granddaughter has very thick very course hair. We are trying to train it now to avoid a lifetime of relaxers and extreme heat. Wish us luck.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this stuff. I am natural and it&#x27;s hard to find a good cowash that cleanses.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a leave in conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I was using WEN since I have been letting my hair grow and then I found this item at a friends&#x27; home and she let me try it......LOVED IT EVEN MORE THAN MY WEN so when Wen was all I ordered this on Amazon and so glad I did.  I have a thick head of fine hair and it is beautiful and straight (little bit of wave toward ends) and it is really silky and shiny since using this and I love the way it smells.  Leaves hair soft, silky and shiny and never tangled or fly-away with broken ends anymore.  I am 65 yrs.young and still loving my hair.  Oh yes, the price is excellent.....I follow with Renpure Coconut Whipped Cr&amp;egrave;me Leave-In Conditioner.....(I used to have to wash my hair at least 4 X&#x27;s per week to keep it clean and healthy and followed with a lot of conditioning products....No more!!! I only wash my hair 2 x&#x27;s week and it stays beautiful.)  I am loving my hair again and going to continue to let it grow and grow.</li>
    <li> Love this! Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it, but it works really well. I have longer hair, past my shoulders, dry &amp; frizzy and need a moisturizing cleanser. This cleans &amp; conditions my hair without needing an additional conditioner. I wet my hair use enough product to cover my hair, it doesn&#x27;t lather, (not supposed to lather) then work it through my hair then rinse. I repeat process, but leave it on a few minutes before rinsing, for extra conditioning. It&#x27;s thinner consistency, not thick, but again works well. It also smells nice. Leaves my hair baby soft. Great bargain!</li>
    <li> Love it! A friend of mine gave me a sample of Wen and it was great also. I didn&#x27;t want to get into a subscription plan and so I checked around and came upon Renpure and thought I would give it a try. It works just as well as the Wen. My hair is thicker and fuller. Smells great also. I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m not loosing as much hair as I did before. It feels much healthier. Also, I don&#x27;t have to keep track of separate containers of shampoo &amp; conditioners running low. Highly recommend trying the Renpure. It also comes in different fragrances. I&#x27;ve tried the Coconut &amp; also the Pomegranate. I like them both.</li>
    <li> Great non-SLS shampoo!!!! Much more affordable than than &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand (which I absolutely love...)</li>
    <li> I have fragile, fine hair and have happily used Wen (all of the basic ones, as well as some of the special edition formulas) for over a year.  I ordered the Renpure Coconut Cr&amp;egrave;me Cowash through Amazon on a recommendation and found it to be MUCH more drying than any of the Wen cleansing conditioners.  My hair felt like straw after using it, although the addition of a moisturizing styling product saved the day.  I have decided to use this as a body wash instead, as it works well for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I received the Renpure Solutions Rosemary Mint cleansing conditioner as a gift and used it last night.  Surprisingly, that product is far different from the Coconut Creme cleansing conditioner--my hair felt soft, shiny and clean afterward, and the results were exactly like what I&#x27;d get from any Wen product, for a much lower cost!  I was so excited that I ordered another bottle, along with the Pomegranate (will review that formula after I try it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This experience has led me to wonder if the Coconut Cr&amp;egrave;me product on this link is a fake. I have noticed that the labels are slightly different and that the Coconut Cr&amp;egrave;me product is made by &amp;#34;Renpure,&amp;#34; whereas the Rosemary Mint product label says &amp;#34;Renpure Solutions&amp;#34;.  Just a thought.  I&#x27;ve known Amazon to sell knock-offs before (Timex 1440 watches, specifically). So maybe that&#x27;s the problem here. Not sure, but I am certain there is a vast difference between the Renpure Coconut Cr&amp;egrave;me Cowash and the Renpure Solutions Rosemary Mint cleansing conditioner formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful for anyone like me who needs a very gentle conditioning cleanser like Wen but would like to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this one. I found it very soupy and hard to keed in my hair. The smell was ok, but I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> This is great for cleaning my hair when I do not have time to wash and condition.  It does a great job and makes my hair so soft and silky and it smells amazing as well!  Also no harsh chemicals to damage your hair.  The price is also amazing compared to other cowash products.</li>
    <li> Makes me break out on my scalp, just like Wen did. It did make my hair feel clean and smooth, however this product as well as the more expensive Wen product a lot like it, both make me get small pimples on my scalp and hairline. I threw most of the bottle away unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for Wen that would be cheaper.  So far this seems to do pretty well.  My hair is nice and clean and there&#x27;s no residue.  It does seem that I have to use more of this product that I did using Wen so long term it may not be as economical.  I would also prefer a slightly thicker consistency that didn&#x27;t drip so easily.  Other than those two items, I&#x27;d count this as a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who thinks this smells like men&#x27;s cologne? ? My hair feels great but I have to use an extra spray to change the smell..</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to try a Wen type cleansing conditioner, this is it.  The jury&#x27;s still out, but I tried it for the first time on 8/2/15 and it immediately made my hair super soft and tangle-free.  I&#x27;m feeling really good about it.  When I get through the whole bottle, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
    <li> My hair was clean and not stripped which is awesome, however, the smell really is very strong. I read a lot of reviews saying they either liked or didn&#x27;t like the scent, but not describing it. It is a very masculine, musky scent, not coconutty at all. It smells like an old fashioned men&#x27;s cologne. My husband will be using this one from now on.</li>
    <li> I like it. It certainly does what it says by gently and simply cleaning the hair leaving it soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great for damaged hair. Made my hair shinny and tangle free. This is a great pice and way better than Wen!!</li>
    <li> If you  are looking for anything close to WEN this is not the product. Have used WEN for years and decided to try this idea, it seemed similar in the common points of conditioning not stripping, no suds, no chemicals etc. But it was a very milky, loose, no firs cream texture. One put on the hair they state to comb the hair...that was near impossible since the hair felt like there was no moisture and it was very rough feeling (recommended 12 pumps - so watery had to use 2xs the pumps). So to give it a fair shot I didnt put a leave in conditioner in to see if it really would condition, so I towels dried, since very rough feeling used my fingers to comb thru and let air dry. Needless to say it looks dry the next morning like I had washed and not used conditioner for a week. The smell was great and the smell stayed but there was no moisture. I was in for one stop hair cleansing &amp; conditioning like with WEN but this just wont be the product. (my hair is to middle of my back, not chemically treated, not fried/no split ends and still.... just not a thick, rich, creamy,conditioning,comparatively (simple Suave kicks its butt in the conditioning) priced for performance product.</li>
    <li> I like this more than the Pom and the Mint version. My hair is smooth, friz free and feels more fortified and strong. The smell is like a coconut cream pie but smooth and light. Not overpowering at all. Only thing I did not like was it was very runny  so it will spill if you put too much in your hand at once.</li>
    <li> I use it instead of WEN products. Love it.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time this morning.  Needed about 8 pumps on my shoulder-length hair.  Didn&#x27;t notice a coconut smell - or any smell for that matter, which is fine with me.  Was very easy to work through hair.  I combed it through as directed.  It rinsed out easily.  For good measure, I applied it a second time.  When it was time to style, I noticed that my hair was much easier to comb/brush - none of the usual snarls.  I was super pleased with that!  It was also a bit easier to style.  BEST OF ALL, I actually got a compliment from someone at work: &amp;#34;did you do something different to your hair?&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Ummmm, does it look good or does it look bad?&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;No!  It looks really good.  Very shiny and blonde.&amp;#34;  I let her touch my hair and she said it felt super sleek but did not feel greasy.  I will continue to use and, if these results continue, I will be a regular user.  Very pleased to far.</li>
    <li> I would give 5 stars but the sandalwood smell is really intense, especially disappointing when you happen to love coconut smells and coconut is in the title. I don&#x27;t hate sandalwood now but might by the end of the bottle. I have long Caucasian hair that gets oily really fast and tends to be limp. This stuff cleans well but doesn&#x27;t overdo the  conditioning and leaves my hair with some volume, unlike WEN. I also think WEN smells bad by the way...</li>
    <li> LEFT MY HAIR DRY EVEN AFTER LEAVING IT ON FOR A FEW MINUTES. VERY WATERY.</li>
