      <li>I really liked this product.</li>
      <li>After washing my hair with the Evercreme shampoo, I applied this and sat under a warm hooded dryer for about twenty minutes.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery, great experience</li>
      <li>I use a good quality shampoo and a light conditioner every time I wash my hair, but once a week</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the best \\&quot;drug store\\</li>
      <li>But this mask is magic.  </li>
      <li>my hair feel nourished and healthy after I use it.</li>
      <li>I really love the sulfate-free line from Loreal.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I also love that it is part of Loreal&#x27;s sulfate-free line.</li>
      <li>and I love the results.  </li>
      <li>The best deep conditioning masque I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good and it leaves my hair smooth and nice.</li>
      <li>My hair was soft and smelled great, but I think the softness may have come more from the Evercreme than from this.  </li>
      <li>I use this twice a week paired with the Sulfate Free Shampoo &amp; Leave in Conditioner and my hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
      <li>this is so good for your hair, i use it all the time and leave it like 5 to 10 minutes in my hair, i has helped me so much</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s much easier now to get good looking hair</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t knot up easily like it used to and is silky and shiny.</li>
      <li>Best when used with other sulfate free products.</li>
      <li>I have fine to medium hair.  </li>
      <li>the smell is so pleasant, my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>FABULOUS...</li>
      <li>those are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>From the sulfate free family products.</li>
      <li>for this, it leaves my hair smooth and great-smelling.</li>
      <li>I get older and is also becoming more damaged.</li>
      <li>Additionally, this is a very good conditioner, but very pricey since the container is only 5.1 oz.    </li>
      <li>Double good.</li>
      <li>Honestly, the Herbal Essence Long Term Relationship Conditioner is much better as a hair mask.  </li>
      <li>But luckily I found it here on Amazon</li>
      <li>/&gt;This hasn&#x27;t really made my feel hair amazing or better than prior to using...but will continuing trying it out.</li>
      <li>Has helped my hair for the very first time I used it and am still using it.</li>
      <li>The everstrong brand is pretty good, i have brittle ends from constantly flat ironing.</li>
      <li>I was so surprised with how much better my hair looks and feels.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product even though I have been trying to convert to a more natural lifestyle.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair noticeably more soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Fingers go right through all the way to the ends.</li>
      <li>I used it about 2 to 3 times a week and overall, this product was great with keeping my hair hydrated and healthy, but I feel like there are other products out there that work better with my coarse, processed hair.</li>
      <li>I use this once a week, leaving in for 5 minutes, and the rest of the week I use the regular ever strong sulfate free conditioner.</li>
      <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t bother me and I did find that using a little extra at the tips and leaving it on for about 2 minutes gives me the best result.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I kept it in for the recommended time, I think it was 5 minutes</li>
      <li>and I got a result just from the first use.</li>
      <li>I am currently in the process of growing my hair out from a pixie cut, and I wanted a hair masque that would help get my hair in better condition so that it can grow longer.</li>
      <li>course, everybody is different and what didn&#x27;t work for me might work wonders for you, but I suggest you try to find the cheapest jar out there first - or better yet, borrow it from a friend and try it out before shelling out your $$.</li>
      <li>First, some background.  </li>
      <li>Made the switch to sulfate free because I thought it might help with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is more of a regular conditioner.  </li>
      <li>This does not even make my hair as soft as cheap conditioner</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only found one better and it was a 45$ salon treatment from Japan.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not bad, but could have saved my money and just worn my normal conditioner longer.</li>
      <li>deep replenishing masque smells fantastic, is creamy but not too heavy, and when you rinse it out it leaves your hair smooth and silky-  simply fantastic!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells great and the scent is subtle.  </li>
      <li>I have been coloring it myself with professional products for 30 years and everyone says it looks natural and is so shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I use it every few hair washes, sometimes more depending on what kind of trauma my hair has recently endured (I change the color often).</li>
      <li>I use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercreme Sulfate Free Intense Deep Nourishing shampoo and conditioner and</li>
      <li>This stuff does absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier combing my hair with it.</li>
      <li>My hair is manageable, not frizzy and very shiny.  </li>
      <li>I really prefer pumps or squeezables for hair products.  </li>
      <li>Even when I blowdry my hair straight and use serums, leave in conditioner, etc</li>
      <li>Returning, this has intense smell to it that gave me one of my migraines</li>
      <li>I tried this masque and after only one use my hair was smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>I purchased shampoo and serum of the same brand a month ago, and had fantastic results.</li>
      <li>Even so, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>The jar is incredibly small and anyone with more than an inch of hair will get three uses out of it tops!  </li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel particularly soft, it was difficult to comb out afterwards, and I just can&#x27;t recommend it over the dozens of cheaper and more effective products out</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos, and have been leaning toward the sulfate-free for the last year or so.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores (only the tubes which are not the same), so I will continue to purchase this online.</li>
      <li>The product is pretty thick and creamy, and it smells lovely.</li>
      <li>I talked to someone who said L&#x27;Oreal had a new product...</li>
      <li>My hair is much smoother afterwards (not straightened, just smoother), and looks much healthier overall.  </li>
      <li>As with most deep conditioner, make sure you rinse well after using or it will feel heavy, weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</li>
      <li>My hair is color treated but otherwise is very normal - mostly straight, neither very oily or very dry, not real thick and not real thin.  </li>
      <li>My hair dresser has noticed a huge difference in my hair -  less split ends, I can grow my hair</li>
      <li>Although my hair is currently untreated, it certainly has sustained damage over the years.  </li>
      <li>In addition, I color my hair which strips away natural moisture as a result.  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly with a tendency towards oiliness near the scalp and dryness towards the ends.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I used it twice a week, and it keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes) and that isn&#x27;t mentioned  in the online description.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am currently in the process of growing my hair out from a pixie cut, and I wanted a hair masque that would help get my hair in better condition so that it can grow longer. I have used both the EverStrong shampoo and conditioner and absolutely love them! I have also tried the EverCreme system, which is also awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this, it leaves my hair smooth and great-smelling. I also love that it is part of Loreal&#x27;s sulfate-free line. However, I was surprised and a little disappointed to notice that this product didn&#x27;t work as well as some less expensive masques I have used before such as Aussie&#x27;s Three-Minute Miracle. My hair didn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; with this masque as it has with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it seems to add moisture to my hair, so I will keep using it until I&#x27;ve run out and hope it does in fact make my hair stronger and less prone to breakage!</li>
    <li> The best deep conditioning masque I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair feels softer, looks shinier, and the frizz is GONE. I use this twice a week paired with the Sulfate Free Shampoo &amp; Leave in Conditioner and my hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
    <li> I really love the sulfate-free line from Loreal.  I have rather thick, slightly wavy hair.  I spent years coloring my hair, and even had a \\&quot;brazilian blowout.\\&quot;  Although my hair is currently untreated, it certainly has sustained damage over the years.  I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos, and have been leaning toward the sulfate-free for the last year or so.  I use this masque and the coordinating shampoo, and my hair does MUCH better than with my very expensive alternatives.  Because my hair is thick and dry, I actually use this every other day.  I apply in the shower, and leave on for 3-5 minutes.  It really does an excellent job.  My hair is much smoother afterwards (not straightened, just smoother), and looks much healthier overall.  My only complaint is the packaging.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the \\&quot;tub\\&quot; of goo.  I really prefer pumps or squeezables for hair products.  Even so, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> First, some background.  I am an African American woman with relaxed hair.  I wash my hair once a week at a Dominican salon, getting a shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner (protein when I relax, moisturizer every other time), roller set, and blowout.  This is the only time I put heat on my hair.  To maintain my blowout, I wrap my hair every night and cover it with a silk scarf.  I use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercreme Sulfate Free Intense Deep Nourishing shampoo and conditioner and those are fantastic.  I wanted to try the EverStrong masque because it is supposed to strengthen hair, but this definitely wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and the scent is subtle.  The jar is incredibly small and anyone with more than an inch of hair will get three uses out of it tops!  This is not deep conditioner.  It is more of a regular conditioner.  After washing my hair with the Evercreme shampoo, I applied this and sat under a warm hooded dryer for about twenty minutes.  I rinsed and applied the Evercreme conditioner.  My hair was soft and smelled great, but I think the softness may have come more from the Evercreme than from this.  After roller setting my hair and drying it under the hooded dryer, I noticed my hair felt crunchy and dry (which doesn&#x27;t usually happen with the deep conditioner at the salon).  The crunchiness didn&#x27;t go away, even after I used my ORS Carrot Oil (which usually makes my hair soft and shiny when I apply it to my scalp).  I watched it over the next few days and it stayed crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that this is bad for everyone&#x27;s hair, but I think my texture of hair is not good for it.  It&#x27;s not so expensive that you couldn&#x27;t order it if you wanted to, but I will not order it again.  I&#x27;m not gonna try the Evercreme masque either because rubbing alcohol is very high on the list of ingredients (though I don&#x27;t think it should be there at all), and that will definitely dry out my already dry-prone hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, long, wavy hair.  It&#x27;s fairly broken at the ends.  Even when I blowdry my hair straight and use serums, leave in conditioner, etc, I can barely run my fingers through my hair because the ends continue to become tangled and brittle.  After one use of this conditioner, my hair is like silk!  Fingers go right through all the way to the ends.</li>
    <li> The only way to get rid of split ends is to CUT YOUR ENDS. There are split end binding treatments out there but they do not actually get rid of the split ends. The everstrong brand is pretty good, i have brittle ends from constantly flat ironing. i dont expect this to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; my ends just something to keep my ends looking healthier in between cuts. and hopefully ease the pain of future breakage.</li>
    <li> My title says it all. I really liked this product. It smells pretty good and it leaves my hair smooth and nice.</li>
    <li> My hair is color treated but otherwise is very normal - mostly straight, neither very oily or very dry, not real thick and not real thin.  I wash it almost every day because I get sweaty almost every day.  I use a good quality shampoo and a light conditioner every time I wash my hair, but once a week or so I like to use a deep conditioning product and leave it on a big longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had run out of my usual deep condition product and had the urge to try something new.  I ended up with this Masque based on the product description and the reviews.  Well, this stuff might be a miracle for some hair types but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for mine.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel particularly soft, it was difficult to comb out afterwards, and I just can&#x27;t recommend it over the dozens of cheaper and more effective products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, everybody is different and what didn&#x27;t work for me might work wonders for you, but I suggest you try to find the cheapest jar out there first - or better yet, borrow it from a friend and try it out before shelling out your $$.</li>
    <li> I have fine long hair, that is fairly thick. Due to improper hair care and use of heated tools, my hair is getting thinner as a I get older and is also becoming more damaged. I purchased this hoping it would help stop the \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; of broken hairs and help repair my split ends. My split ends are not any better, but I am shedding a little less. Additionally, this is a very good conditioner, but very pricey since the container is only 5.1 oz.    I am a natural blonde and this product leaves a greasy residue on hair, especially at the roots. My hair does not feel any stronger, but it does look a little shinier and little more manageable and less tangled.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. If you leave it in your hair for several minutes, it moisturizes and makes your hair really soft. My friend used it and she loves it, too. In fact, I ordered this for a Christmas present for her because she has been looking everywhere for it and couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  My 4b hair loves it.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done! I like</li>
    <li> This product makes the hair very very dry, almost impossible to brush it even when it is very wet, I was disappointed.It is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have dry coarse hair and this conditioner has really transformed the condition of my hair. The thing is to keep it in your hair for at least 30 minutes. The first time I used it, I kept it in for the recommended time, I think it was 5 minutes and my results were minimal. The second time I used it, I left it in for 30 minutes, and OMG.... there was definitely a noteable difference in my results. This product is a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product even though I have been trying to convert to a more natural lifestyle. My hair still requires chemical intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hasn&#x27;t really made my feel hair amazing or better than prior to using...but will continuing trying it out.</li>
    <li> I like how thick it is. It&#x27;s much easier combing my hair with it. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff does absolutely nothing.  I tried this after I ran out of a sample bottle of Garnier hair masque.  My hair can become oily, but it is in great condition.  This does not even make my hair as soft as cheap conditioner would.  Honestly, the Herbal Essence Long Term Relationship Conditioner is much better as a hair mask.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> After conditioner, apply the mask and feel the difference on your hair. The frizz and the dryness goes away ,leaving my hair silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair which I deep condition at least twice a week and  I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a great conditioner.  This is, by far, the best \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve only found one better and it was a 45$ salon treatment from Japan.&lt;br /&gt;The deep replenishing masque smells fantastic, is creamy but not too heavy, and when you rinse it out it leaves your hair smooth and silky-  simply fantastic!! My hair dresser has noticed a huge difference in my hair -  less split ends, I can grow my hair even longer w.o. It looking scraggly.&lt;br /&gt; Last year they stopped selling this masque in drugstores -  thank goodness amazon still sells this b/c my hair would not be the same w/o it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have long hair- or are growing your hair out, this product is a must!!</li>
    <li> this is so good for your hair, i use it all the time and leave it like 5 to 10 minutes in my hair, i has helped me so much</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically to repair damage after using a hair color removal system.  I do believe it has restored some moisture to my hair but there has never been a &amp;#34;OMG it&#x27;s a miracle worker&amp;#34; type moment... after using it per instructions my hair feels the same as it does when I leave my standard conditioner in my hair long enough to shave before rinsing it out.  Not bad, but could have saved my money and just worn my normal conditioner longer.</li>
    <li> My hair is long so sometimes it can be difficult to comb it with ease. I tried this masque and after only one use my hair was smooth and silky. I feel that I could apply this product every time I wash and my hair would not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I have long, but damaged hair. It started to break a lot, feeling very dry, having no shine. I purchased shampoo and serum of the same brand a month ago, and had fantastic results. So I bought the mask, using it for about two weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the smell is so pleasant, my hair soft and shiny. Stopped breaking, hair looks healthier, and feels stronger.</li>
    <li> I leave it for 10 minutes and I got a result just from the first use. Hair are silky and a little bit straightened after use and it&#x27;s much easier now to get good looking hair</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for a year and a half and stopped only because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere to purchase. While using it I noticed my hair was really healthy, hardly any split ends, and my hair would stay a dark color for some reason. Now that I don&#x27;t use it I notice my hair has done the complete opposite. I tried using other products but nothing was really helping and my hair would get oily. But luckily I found it here on Amazon so I ordered it asap and can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> This actually made my hair break off.  I have fine to medium hair.  It is below my shoulders.  I thought I would try this out as a treatment so that I could grow my hair longer.  I used it once.  My hair came out all over the place.  I could tell that it broke off rather than came out at the roots.  I will not use this ever again.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly with a tendency towards oiliness near the scalp and dryness towards the ends.  In addition, I color my hair which strips away natural moisture as a result.  I&#x27;ve been using this masque for two weeks now, alternating it with the Everstrong Moisture Masque(specifically for color-treated hair) and I love the results.  My hair is manageable, not frizzy and very shiny.  The scent doesn&#x27;t bother me and I did find that using a little extra at the tips and leaving it on for about 2 minutes gives me the best result.  Also, this conditioner has helped me retain my hair color (fading was always something I dreaded) and it looks great.  It will definitely remain a part of my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> The product is pretty thick and creamy, and it smells lovely. I use it every few hair washes, sometimes more depending on what kind of trauma my hair has recently endured (I change the color often). I use the L&#x27;oreal Everstrong/Everpure shampoos and conditioners and this is masque is a good addition to the range. I apply it after shampooing and leave in in for the duration of my shower. It leaves my hair noticeably more soft and manageable. Plus, it makes my hair smell AMAZING so that&#x27;s a bonus!</li>
    <li> My hair is long (old), colored, and permed.  It can be very fragile especially since i use blow dryers and curling irons.  But this mask is magic.  I use it as my regular conditioner.  It keeps my hair as soft and supple as is possible, considering how badly I beat it up.  I will despair if they ever stop making this!</li>
    <li> Returning, this has intense smell to it that gave me one of my migraines (I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes) and that isn&#x27;t mentioned  in the online description. Went to local drug store where I could smell the stuff, AND it was cheaper!</li>
    <li> Great for hair that has been processed since it is sulfate free. As with most deep conditioner, make sure you rinse well after using or it will feel heavy, weigh down your hair and make it look greasy. I used it about 2 to 3 times a week and overall, this product was great with keeping my hair hydrated and healthy, but I feel like there are other products out there that work better with my coarse, processed hair.</li>
    <li> Terrific and used every time I wash my long &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; hair:) great!</li>
    <li> Made the switch to sulfate free because I thought it might help with my sensitive skin. I was so surprised with how much better my hair looks and feels. It doesn&#x27;t knot up easily like it used to and is silky and shiny. I use this once a week, leaving in for 5 minutes, and the rest of the week I use the regular ever strong sulfate free conditioner. I have also noticed less burning and irritation of the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
    <li> This conditioner really does moisturize your hair without weighing it down - a small miracle in itself. I used it twice a week, and it keeps my hair soft and shiny. The smell is awesome, and it rinses out very quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great experience</li>
    <li> Good. Good. Double good.</li>
    <li> I have really dry, thick hair so I&#x27;ve been looking for a deep conditioner.  I use this product during my evening shower and when I wake up the next morning, my hair is so shiny and soft.  I have tried tons of deep masques and conditioners, and still continue to try others, but this is the one that I notice a real difference to my hair. Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores (only the tubes which are not the same), so I will continue to purchase this online.</li>
    <li> I have always had great hair. I have been coloring it myself with professional products for 30 years and everyone says it looks natural and is so shiny and healthy. For some reason, still have not figured it out it started getting dry and dull...I was stunned and started to research. I talked to someone who said L&#x27;Oreal had a new product...DO THEY EVERSTRONG! This works...I mean really works...FABULOUS...I love it and have been telling everyone to order!  I also purchased the shampoo, the conditioner and the night treatment...I will never use another product on my hair....wonderful!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. From the sulfate free family products. Leaves hair ultra soft. Can notice the repair and nourishment. Does not leave hair greasy. Best when used with other sulfate free products. Great smell too. Get compliments from people all the time now.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Affordable and has great results!</li>
    <li> Will buy this again.  Has helped my hair for the very first time I used it and am still using it.</li>
    <li> I like using this product on my hair - make&#x27;s my hair feel nourished and healthy after I use it.</li>
