    <li> Best thing for frizzy hair EVER!</li>
    <li> this gel is very thin so it works on my fine hair.  I use the product to protect my hair from heat styling.</li>

I&#x27;ve tried other hair gel products but they leave white flakes, weigh down my hair, or don&#x27;t hold. Biosilk Glazing Gel is perfect for my hair.  I receive compliments on my hair all the time and am able to fluff up my hair to show them how natural it is and it still looks the same.  Please don&#x27;t ever let this product go away.

    <li> Nothing to really rave about. I&#x27;ve used it twice and it certainly doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair which is a plus, but it&#x27;s holding power isn&#x27;t that great. I&#x27;m going to use it a little more by trying different ways, for example on wet hair. If it&#x27;s better that way I&#x27;ll definitely come back with an update :-)</li>

    <li> I purchased this item in a gift package one year from jc Penney.  This product is the best for curly hair.  It&#x27;s not greasy, nor does it have the alcohol mousse can have.  It leaves your hair naturally curly and shiny.  Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I used bio silk products awhile back.Very pleased with this and proud to be able to order on line since you can&#x27;t find around where I live. So proud to be able to get.Love the way it fills on hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this from another site for 13 bucks plus 5 dollars shipping.  Way less than the 30 or 40 dollars you find on Amazon.  I was using Matrix Vavoom Glazing gel which I can no longer find.  This glazing gel is a lot thicker but the hold is light.  It&#x27;s not as much a wet a look even when I tried again on wet hair.  But close enough.  My biggest complaint and why I gave it two stars is the smell.  It is the strongest smelling product I&#x27;ve ever used.  First time I tried it, the smell was overwhelming.  I had to wash it out after a few hours.  I decided to give it another try watered down.  The fragrance was still too overwhelming.  If there is a similar product without a strong smell, please let me know.  I&#x27;d buy it.  This doesn&#x27;t hold exactly as the same as Matrix Vavoom glaze gel but it&#x27;s closest I can find.  But I won&#x27;t use the rest of the bottle due to the smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for curly hair. It cuts down on frizz, encourages curl and keeps hair in place without being excessively crunchy or stiff. It makes hair very shiny. The only bad thing about the glaze is the unpleasant smell, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger on the hair once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> my hair dresser told me to use it, I have part grey/white coming in all over, so it is corser than regular dark hair, and it smells so good, it is just enough hold to keep it nice in Fl weather, I have natural curly hair, thank you</li>
    <li> Leaves a ton of residue on your hair.  If you touch your hair, it flakes off and also floats off in the air as if you had lint and/or dirt stuck to your hair.  That made it useless to me.  I can&#x27;t use a product that makes my hair look dirty and filthy.</li>
    <li> For my naturally curly hair, this is the first product I found that REALLLLLY works well without making my hair sticky or plasticy</li>
    <li> Works exactly as I was expecting.  Shipped fine.</li>
