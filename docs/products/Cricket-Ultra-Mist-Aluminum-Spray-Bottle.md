      <li>While I really liked this bottle because it was made of aluminum, had a nice trigger sprayer nozzle, isn&#x27;t too heavy and looks nice too, the main problem is inside the bottle itself.</li>

      <li>The spray works pretty well.  </li>

      <li>but this is the REAL deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>high and 2&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t saturate it too much like a normal spray bottle, but mists it just enough for me to reshape my curls.</li>
      <li>Smaller and skinnier than  expected, but turns out to be easy to handle</li>
      <li>There is a yellow residue or paint on the inside of the canister part that came off and there were these large chunks of what appeared to be paint floating in the liquid on the inside.  </li>
      <li>I really like the spray bottle, it just seems to be a bit smaller</li>
      <li>dia  (8&amp;#34; high, overall).</li>
      <li>use distilled H20, and the mist is pure, wide mist, no leaking or droplets.  </li>
      <li>No regrets.</li>

    <li> The spray works pretty well.  Though it sometimes gets stuck.  I did find pieces of paint inside one of the bottles.  I hope it lasts</li>
    <li> Great water bottle!!!</li>
    <li> While I really liked this bottle because it was made of aluminum, had a nice trigger sprayer nozzle, isn&#x27;t too heavy and looks nice too, the main problem is inside the bottle itself. This is supposed to be a bottle that holds water (advertised as an H2O bottle), but for some unknown reason the manufacturer decided that spray-painting the inside of the bottle with a latex paint was a good idea. The problem is that when you add water to it, the paint peels off the inside and clogs up the sprayer rendering it unusable. If you decide to buy it anyway and your sprayer suddenly stops working, check to see if the paint has come off inside the bottle. If it has, DO NOT dump the water out in your sink, all that paint can clog your drain. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice water bottle! It is a little smaller than I expected but it is a great water bottle. I love the design, it&#x27;s very professional looking which is what I wanted for my salon environment. it is exactly as described, fine mist. I would buy another one in the future.</li>
    <li> Was hoping not to kick myself for spending 10 bucks on a mister. . .The canister part is a little over 6&amp;#34; high and 2&amp;#34; dia  (8&amp;#34; high, overall). Smaller and skinnier than  expected, but turns out to be easy to handle and I like it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use distilled H20, and the mist is pure, wide mist, no leaking or droplets.  Well made, looks great.. No regrets.</li>
    <li> I love this spray bottle!  It&#x27;s a nice size, looks great and works well providing a fine mist.  I use it on the mornings I don&#x27;t wash my hair to refresh my curly locks.</li>
    <li> I really like the spray bottle, it just seems to be a bit smaller then I&#x27;d pictured</li>
    <li> I know this wasn&#x27;t meant for what I&#x27;m using it for, but if you are looking for a fine mister this is it.  I sew quite a bit and wanted a light spray when pressing so this is it, works great.  Just wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these and the same problem happened with both they just quit spraying. When it worked i liked the spray stream but for the price they do not work long.</li>
    <li> Water bottle is smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> This really does have an ultra fine mist.  Some say they do and don&#x27;t but this is the REAL deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.  Think I may have to buy another one soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in my bathroom with my homemade poo-pourri.  It works perfectly.  It&#x27;s really cute, too, so it looks good in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Excellent mister for beauty, kitchen or laundry.  The sprayer is made in Japan and is good quality.  We have bought 2 and plan to get 1 more.  Follow-up 2-11-15  Sprayers (2) still working well but the bottle lining ( latex-like)  came off after a few rinses.  Now that that&#x27;s cleaned out, both are working well.</li>
    <li> Cute bottle. The mist created by the nozzle is very fine.  Nozzle is listed as being Japanese-made and seems to be a quality sprayer.  Unfortunately, the bottle, which is listed as made in China, is not at the same quality level.  There is a yellow residue or paint on the inside of the canister part that came off and there were these large chunks of what appeared to be paint floating in the liquid on the inside.  For us, that was a deal-breaker as we did not want those chemicals on us and did not know what the paint was covering.  Wished that the canister was better quality.    Submitted a return request that was accepted.  Unfortunately, we have to pay for the return ourselves and were warned on the return document there may be a 20% re-stocking fee, making it not worth our while to return.  Caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> I use it for hairspray and it works great -- nice fine mist and it hasn&#x27;t clogged once!</li>
    <li> this spray bottle has the perfect amount of misting for re-scrunching my hair in the mornings after I&#x27;ve slept on it or put it in a messy bun. It doesn&#x27;t saturate it too much like a normal spray bottle, but mists it just enough for me to reshape my curls. I like the size of the bottle, which is a little smaller than a normal can of hair spray. I really like that the canister is metal so I don&#x27;t have to worry about screwing it up if I pack it or of it cracking. Make sure to keep the clip that keeps the bottle from spraying when it arrives. You&#x27;ll thank me later when putting it in an overnight bag, or your purse when you&#x27;re on the run. After filling it, it usually lasts about 3 weeks for me. and I used it 1 to 2 times daily on my long hair.</li>
    <li> I would not suggest these. I ordered 1 for each of the stylist in the salon and they all stopped working in the first couple of weeks. They also had the inside of the bottle pealing off in the water and clogging the sprayer.</li>
    <li> I liked this sprayer so much I ordered two more of them.  Unfortunately, the cream colored paint came off the inside and I had to pull big blobs of paint out of it.</li>
    <li> Recieved on time.  Nice mist i like that it doesnt shoot a straight stream of water on my clients head. Nice bottle looks nice not cheap constructed.</li>
