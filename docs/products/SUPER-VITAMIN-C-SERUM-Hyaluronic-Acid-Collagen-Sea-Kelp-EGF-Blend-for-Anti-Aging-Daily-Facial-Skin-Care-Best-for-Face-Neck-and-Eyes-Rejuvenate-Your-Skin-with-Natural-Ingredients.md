<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old, my renkle become more visible. I started to use the product two weeks ago. I can  definitely that is works</li>
    <li> This is a nice product and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have  mature skin, but take very good care of it. It can get expensive! After reading the positive reviews, I decided to try this reasonably priced Super C. I&#x27;ve only been using this a couple of weeks, but am pleased with the feel of it on my skin so far as well as its pleasant citrusy fragrance. It has a gel like consistency so that a few drops go a long way as there is time to spread it to all areas of the face before it absorbs. My skin feels very smooth, firm and thicker after using it. It&#x27;s also a very soothing balm to the areas of irritation I get after using my retinoid cream. I will try the other C serum they have and see how it acts as an exfoliant in combination with this Super C.  I&#x27;ve been applying it before bed because my morning rush doesn&#x27;t allow for the few seconds it takes to get it from and return it to the fridge, but I&#x27;m told the best time to use it before exposure to the elements. I Iook forward to seeing the long term effects and will post my findings again later.</li>
    <li> I started using this Super C serum a month ago and my skin is softer and firmer and sun spots are getting lighter. It tales only a small amount and goes on smoothly and is immediately absorbed.  I use it every day and waiting to see my wrinkles getting smoother.</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome and the price is one of the best things about it. My skin is healthier and brighter with the use of the serum. I would recommend this product to anybody looking to improve the quality of their skin, no matter their age. BTW it has a pleasant subtle scent that I enjoy putting on every morning.</li>
    <li> After purchasing Coui Natural Vitamin C Serum and being happy with it, I decided to try the Super C Serum.  I like the fact that this product has hyaluronic acid in it.  My skin feels soft and supple.  I have noticed that it feels a bit tacky before it dries completely but that will not keep me from using it.  Hats off to Coui for a great product!</li>
    <li> this is not what I expected</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels on my face. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed softer skin and smaller pores since using it regularly (morning and most evenings) for 2-3 months. The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love it, smells good, have been using it after my TCA peel I did a week ago. best vitamin c serum I have used to date. Will buy again and recommend for those doing chemical peels, just make sure you wait 24 hours from time of doing the peel.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 times this product,it is good for face or hands. It erases the wrinkles on my face and my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Now my face and my hands look younger.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at day for face and at night for hands.</li>
    <li> Received this product as a birthday gift a while back and had been using it the last couple months.  I have combination skin and am very sensitive to skin products.  This product does not make my skin itchy at all.  My skin feels hydrated and skin also absorbs this product well.  I highly recommend this product and would definitely be purchasing this products for myself and family members</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different. I might just get the regular serum next time.</li>
    <li> Love this Super C Serum!  Most serums are runny &amp; you lose half the product before you get it on your face.  This serum is perfect!  My face drank it up-my eyes didn&#x27;t water &amp; my skin didn&#x27;t sting.  You don&#x27;t have to use much at all-so it will last a long time-I&#x27;m going to try it on the backs of my hands &amp; my neck!</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with my prescription tretinoin cream at night. Sort of like an overnight facelift in combination.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this. Use it everyday after serum and before make up and each night as top layer before bed. I think it helps my skin repair itself. I will reorder for myself and already got one for my niece.</li>
    <li> Great Serum! Keeping it in the fridge is a plus, it soothes the skin after derma rolling.</li>
    <li> love it!  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> very nice stuff. I cannot stay out it, my skin says thanks ...</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel so much smoother. This is now part of my daily Skin  routine  and that&#x27;s impressive since I&#x27;ve never had a skin routine before. LOL</li>
    <li> Send was great fast shipping ! Can&#x27;t really give 3 stars because I do not know if it works ! So far I did not see any difference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34, got few little wrinkles because I smile to much.  Maybe I&#x27;m expecting a miracle, but this wasn&#x27;t it.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong stuff was very great as a moisturizer and made my skin soft, but it did not give the results I was expecting from reading reviews.</li>
    <li> If you want to have beautiful skin.  Please try this serum.  What a difference this has been for my face.</li>
    <li> Love this. Goes on smooth and absorbs well..</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, Does everything promised and more, I will use this product forever more!  Great prices and fast shipping, owners even send you emails for how to use their products !  Love this company!  I recommend to all my friends and family and have gifted it also!  I also use Coui C Serum with also amazing results! Recommended by my Dermatologist who also told me amazon.com had the best prices!  3/4/15  I am still using this wonderful product with still amazing results!  I love this product and I will continue to use it as long as it is offered!  It is part of my ritual, alternating with the Vitamin C Serum, 20%.  I use the guidelines that the owners of the company so generously provide with the products.  They also will answer your questions directly by email.  Love this company and their product line.  And their products were recommended by my Dermatologist !! So, I know they are the best !</li>
    <li> I loved the other serum also. I like this one because it seems to go a longer way. I hope it is doing a little more because of the collagen in it as well. I am looking forward to trying the cleansing oil soon! Now in the colder weather, I will try the Gold Serum. I love nourishing oils at night, and this one has got to be as wonderful as all the rest of the products!!! My favorite part of this line is that it&#x27;s small and specific.Just a few exception products and an amazing group of people ensuring it&#x27;s quality and customer satisfaction. No risk with this line and Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> very nice will buy it again</li>
    <li> I just turned 50 this year but most people think I am much younger. I have pretty decent skin to begin with, but this serum REALLY helps plump fine lines and wrinkles and gives a nice smooth texture to the face.  I use the regular C Serum as well, which has decreased dark spots from sun damage and really gives my face a fresh look. Great products that actually work.  Love them both!</li>
    <li> this is great serum, I don&#x27;t break out like I use to, I love it</li>
    <li> I live in S. Florida, and have sun damage to my Décolleté.  I have tried all sorts of moisturizers, skin firming products as well as bath oils to get rid of the splotchness and redness. NOTHING has worked....until I started using Super C Serum!!!  In a week&#x27;s time of daily use (morning and night), I can clearly see a difference in the amount of redness and splotchy parts starting to fade.  In addition, my face looks brighter. Some of the melasma I have on my forehead and cheeks have also started to fade. I am excited to see the results after 4 weeks of using this product, and beyond!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3-4 weeks and it has helped my hyper pigmentation so much! I bought this product specifically for acne scarring and discoloration. This has helped a great deal and besides the problem areas it leaves your face tighter and just all around better looking. I will def be using this product every day for a long time.</li>
    <li> Fa La la la la la la la laaaaaaa!!! I&#x27;VE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! I feel like I could bust out into an opera song! I am a PRODUCT JUNKIE and I have searched the world high and low for something to help with my crow&#x27;s feet, smile lines, and overall skin dullness. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything: from drugstore merch to super duper expensive brands. I have a graveyard of wrinkle creams/serums that represents a LOT of wasted $. I&#x27;ve tried so many products that did absolutely nothing for me, and I&#x27;ve tried products that seemed to have helped a little bit - but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a million reviews, I bought the COUI Super C Serum and the COUI Vitamin C Serum 20%. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month, and I&#x27;m so happy to say that I&#x27;m finally not disappointed this time! Within 3 days my skin had improved - it looked brighter and rejuvenated. I deal with adult acne, and this has also helped with that. My skin is clearer. It hasn&#x27;t eliminated my acne completely, but my breakouts are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My MAIN concern is my crow&#x27;s feet, and this is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that has softened them. I&#x27;m sure there are other good products out there, but I think you have to find the product that works for YOU. And I have no idea why, but absolutely no other product I&#x27;ve tried has helped my crow&#x27;s feet. (Hyaluronic acid will help temporarily for a day fix - but I&#x27;m referring to long-term.) My crow&#x27;s feet haven&#x27;t vanished (this isn&#x27;t botox!), but I can visibly see that they are less harsh. Thank you!!! I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use it will only get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Super C 2x a day - morning and night. It&#x27;s clear and light and feels refreshing. I use the Vit C 20% at bedtime every other night. It&#x27;s sticky and can&#x27;t be worn under makeup. It exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that this company has got it going on! They sent me an email with information and step-by-step directions. Then today I got a coupon for future purchases with them. It&#x27;s apparent that they care about what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you COUI for making an incredible product that doesn&#x27;t break my bank!!!chases with them. It&#x27;s apparent that they care about what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you COUI for making an incredible product that doesn&#x27;t break my bank!!!</li>
    <li> This does help take away wrinkles, I takes care of mine.... don&#x27;t need to use it very often, because of good skin care routines.  Love the packaging because the dropper puts &#x27;C&#x27; right where you need it, and keeps the product &#x27;fresh&#x27; for the next application.</li>
    <li> Have never been so disappointed with a product. It does absolutely nothing for my skin. Nothing good or nothing bad. Another waste of good money. I believe there isn&#x27;t even any Vitamin C in this product!!  Really want my Money Back.  Oh also makes skin tight with residue not firming feel!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to spread &amp; goes on smoothly</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It has made a huge difference in my skin and I will continue ordering it!</li>
    <li> Ok I have been using for couple weeks now and love this. I was hesitant to try but thought well why not. So glad I did! I had deep wrinkles on my forehead and I hate them....well this stuff has really helped them! I plan to keep using them and hope that it keeps improving my wrinkles! YAY!</li>
    <li> Using this product for 2 weeks now,  and I CAN see a notable difference already</li>
    <li> Excellent product that shows a difference in your skin in no time. My skin was dry dull and aging, now it is glowing and has helped with my wrinkles! Even friends have noticed the difference. Anything COUI makes is top grade and lives up to it&#x27;s promises,due to the high percentage of excellent ingredients they use in their products. The best serum out there, besides their other vitamin c serum 20%.I will keep ordering from them! And I have tried just about everything that is out there. Thank you COUI!!!</li>
    <li> OMGoodness, I just received this serum, today but I have already tried it and I am amazed.  I am refrigerating it, as suggested, you can automatically feel the replenishing effect of the collagen.  Thank you COUI, I love you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Serum does smooth out lines. After it dries, one can feel the skin tighten a bit. Although, I do not smoke, I have some wrinkles along the upper lip and some crows feet. This product smooths these areas very well.  I used a lot of it, but a small amount does the trick as well. I have been using this for 2 weeks, once a day in the morning. The bonus is that it makes the sun spots on my face fade.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  I had some redness around my nose and on my cheeks that is evening out.  It also seems to be helping with my acne scaring which is exciting. I have only been using it a month.  I did take before pictures so I could record any progress and there is a difference.  Also it is smoothing out my crows feet and forehead lines.  It is sticky so I usually put it on at night as I don&#x27;t have the time in the morning to let it absorb before putting on my make up.  The customer service has been great.  They sent an introductory email and then a follow up to see how I liked it.  I had a question and they got right back to me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other serums over the years, including several highly rated ones sold at Amazon which I was sadly always disappointed by despite some great sounding ingredients &amp; promised results.  Some serums were too thick &amp; some too liquid making them tough or unpleasant to use or not very cost effective if it takes many drops to cover one&#x27;s face.  Others were only ok in terms of not making any noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE FIRST SERUM THAT HAS BEEN PURE JOY TO USE.  It goes on easily, only taking a drop to cover my face so it lasts a long time &amp; the consistency feels ideal in how easy it is to work with &amp; how it feels as it goes into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS LEAVING MY SKIN FEELING A LITTLE DRY OR TOO TIGHT BUT IT TURNED OUT TO JUST BE THE INITIAL ADJUSTMENT AS WITHIN A FEW DAYS IT ONLY LEFT MY SKIN FEELING &amp; LOOKING GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT MAKES ME SUPER APPRECIATIVE OF THIS SERUM is it&#x27;s the first skincare product I&#x27;ve found that has a long list of truly beneficial &amp; great anti-aging ingredients that come together in a way that feels &amp; looks great.  Before this I&#x27;d had to choose between more commercial products with less than ideal ingredients that worked better in practice than products with super healthy sounding ingredients that just don&#x27;t come together well in practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp; I JUST FOUND OUT THAT THIS SERUM CAN EVEN BE USED ON THE EYELIDS AS WELL AS ALL AROUND THE EYES SO I LOVE THE SIMPLICITY &amp; EFFICIENCY OF THIS ULTIMATE ANTI-AGING FACE SERUM covering everything as very few products work well around the delicate eye area &amp; even fewer for the eyelids despite those areas needing anti-aging help even more than the rest of our face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some very helpful emails from the company clarified that the ideal combination is to alternate this serum with their Vitamin C serum which uses a different form of vitamin C for its exfoliation benefits. I will therefore soon be trying that out as well as their SPF moisturizer given how highly they rave about that product also including by backing it all with refund guarantees.  And a fantastic eye cream is coming out soon so I&#x27;m hoping the rest of the line works as ideally as this serum which has made me not want to go back to what I was using previously despite having several bottles of that left!izer given how highly they rave about that product also including by backing it all with refund guarantees.  And a fantastic eye cream is coming out soon so I&#x27;m hoping the rest of the line works as ideally as this serum which has made me not want to go back to what I was using previously despite having several bottles of that left!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. My skin is glowing. It took about 5 weeks or so but afterwards I was hooked.</li>
    <li> It seems to work, but the fishy smell bothers me. It smelled fishy fresh out of the box. Perhaps it got too hot during shipping, but there isn&#x27;t much you can do about that.</li>
    <li> The product has good quality. good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Supurb product,  Amazing Results. Visual Sun Damage on face and neck softened within one week of directed use. I am 59  and have tried many products over the years, Have spent big $$$$ on most,  Until now;  I&#x27;ve  never felt satisfied enough to even consider,  writing  a review.  I am very exited about building a skin  care regime using Coui line.  Please re-ad me to the Coui mail list</li>
    <li> I really wanted to believe this would work and sometimes I thought it was but then I thought maybe I was just hoping really hard....  I kept waiting for someone to comment &amp;#34;your skin looks great what are you doing?&amp;#34;... didn&#x27;t happen.  Sadly I didn&#x27;t get the results so many others said they experienced even though I used it consistently until the bottle was gone.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works I have been using it for about 3weeks now and have already noticed that my wrinkles are smoothing out and my age spots are definitely getting lighter. I love this product and will definitely keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I bought this and the vitamin c serum. Everyone&#x27;s reviews were wonderful, but for me it didn&#x27;t work. It actually broke my skin out worse. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, but my skin just didn&#x27;t take to it well. I wish it had worked for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Super C Serum for a couple of months now and I love it. My skin looks and feels smoother and healthier! I love how a little really does go a long way. I would highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. !!! FAST DELIVERY. PRODUCT WELL PACKAGED AND I THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  Great results for the price.  Impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a recommendation from my dermatologist.  Within a few days of using it I could see a noticeable different in my skin.  I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s and have sun damaged skin from many years of sun worshipping before we knew about sunscreen.  My skin is softer and the finer wrinkles have softened or disappeared  as well.  The overall tone of my skin has improved dramatically.  As I said before I would not have even thought to order this product had my dermatologist  not recommended it.  I have tried so many products and spent tons of money on useless products.  I don&#x27;t do Botox or any of those types of facial products.  So I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to have such great results with this product.  And, on top of a fabulous product, they have wonderful customer service as well</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now and see absolutely no improvement of any kind.  had no effect on the brown spots or any other condition that it was supposed to fix. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use this at night after washing my face, I put it all over my face and neck then let it dry for about 10 minutes before applying my night moisturizer over it. It has helped my face have a more even tone and my skin feels firmer too. I think I look healthier! This is my 2nd bottle and I plan on using this permanently. It does have a strong smell, like citrus, but after it dries the smell is almost gone, and then my night cream covers any leftover smell. It doesn&#x27;t stink, just a strong citrus odor.</li>
    <li> Love it. With each day I am seeing fine lines around my eyes fade. My skin looks more lustrous and the pores look smaller. I love the texture and that there is no odor.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I believe this helped my second degree burn to heal..as I applied to the new skin layer when it seemed ready:) Helping reduce scaring from the beginning! :) The burn area is smooth and flat &amp; color becoming normalized sooner than without this &amp; Vitamin E to follow. *This also seems to minimize facial lines:) &amp; with Vitamin E ~ for moisture ~ as they advise. I am Thankful:) They include information &amp; email for support if you need:)</li>
    <li> I like this oil and it seems to lessen my wrinkles</li>
    <li> As a 62 year old woman I have developed lines in the hollows of my cheeks. This Super C Serum really plumps them up! People have been asking me how I&#x27;m getting younger. I won&#x27;t leave the house without it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my Super C Serum! It leaves my skin smooth and slightly tight to touch. I can actually see a difference in wrinkle-reduction under my neck! I strongly recommend this product-only from Amazon though. The quality of service is amazing at Amazon!!! I love the fast shipping, no-hassle returns if you&#x27;re not pleased with an item. Give it a try! You will see fast results if used as directed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and I&#x27;ve seen great improvement on my face especially on my acne marks that has been bothering me for almost 2 years now. I have acne prone skin and this does not cause me to break out. I also like the glow on my face looks when I wake up in the morning. I am sooo glad I came across this product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and really  love this product and feel its been more effective for my skin than previous products I have used. My skin seems smoother and brighter already. Will see how it works in the long term.Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Caramar</li>
    <li> Incredible results so quickly  ..... deep forehead lines fading, nose to mouth () are at least 70% softer, even the &#x27;puppet&#x27; lines from mouth to chin have improved.  I did find that this needs to be the first product I put on my skin before using any other anti-aging cream or moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really impressed and will make this a part of my everyday routine (the other anti-aging creams I rotate). Ordering a second bottle so I don&#x27;t run out.&lt;br /&gt;Turning 65 y.o. in a few months, so I can&#x27;t wait to see the results a few weeks from now!</li>
    <li> This has really helped my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
    <li> I put it on my lips before make up sometimes</li>
    <li> Just ordered and received my second bottle of Coui Super C Serum. I first noticed an improvement in breakouts, almost immediately. There have not been nearly as many and they fade within a few days. Breakouts typically leave scars and dark marks on my face, but the Super C has faded those and rare new breakouts don&#x27;t get nearly as dark. The attached photo shows my eye area prior to using Super C to now, about 5 weeks later. I see a marked improvement in fine lines and dark spots, as well as overall texture. I have recommended the Super C to EVERYONE that I can get to listen. An amazing product!</li>
    <li> Have used daily for over a month.  Remarkable difference in skin and pores, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of product.  Am extremely pleased, am ordering again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is phenomenal. Of 100 products I try and have an opinion of, I may write one review. Well, this is it. I have been plagued with rosacea and what I would describe as &#x27;hormonal skin&#x27; (I am in my 40s). I have tried everything OTC and prescriptive, with the exception of Accutane.  I cannot explain why this completely cleared my rosacea overnight, but it did.  I have no explanation, but that was my result. Amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Super C Serum for about six weeks and very happy with the results. I first noticed the results around the eye area not long after using the serum. I plan to continue using it!</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many skin products over the years, including some that are very pricey.  I did as they suggested and took a before picture to see if it made a difference. I clearly saw an improvement in my fine lines and skin tone in a couple of weeks.  I also feel a plumpness in my skin. I then went and purchased the Vitamin C serum as well.  I am very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> i have use it for two months,This is a wonderful product and suiltable for me. My skin look more radiant and healthier than befor, i feel it becomeing tighter. i have recomended it to my friends.This is my second time to buy it. i think i will use it in the furture.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this serum twice now and love it!  My complexion is brighter &amp; has more even tone.  I highly recommend COUI skincare products; they work and are a good value.</li>
    <li> I love the Super C Serum; it is a quality product at a reasonable price.  COUI vitamin c serums have improved the brightness and clarity of my skin since I started using them.  My dermatologist even commented on how good my skin looks.  I have recommended COUI products to my friends and family and will continue to be a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I saw result within 1 month; skin feels and looks firmer and smoother, especially lines around the mouth</li>
    <li> Another Great Product from Coui!  It&#x27;s a little on the thick side, but absorbs pretty quickly. Very soothing to the face. Just started using it so I can&#x27;t comment on the anti-aging part, but so far so good. Keep it in the fridge; not only will it last longer, but feels extra soothing and cool on your face! Thanks Coui!</li>
    <li> Very sticky. I would not recommend putting on right before bed. I have seen some results and Vitamin C is very good for the skin.</li>
    <li> works really well!! I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle. price is very good for what it does!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of weeks, no breakouts and it seems to make my skin more tight and the crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes are mostly gone...already. I am a guy and believe in great skin care. Almost 50 and people guess my age in my late 30;s, early 40&#x27;s and I will take it...lol  It has evened out my skin tone and definitely makes me look younger. This is a miracle in a very affordable bottle!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality. My dark spots is lighter every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now. I certainly do not expect miracles, however, skin is firmer &amp; a few people have told me I look &amp;#34;rested&amp;#34; Hey, I&#x27;ll take that compliment! I plan on continuing use &amp; purchasing another bottle. I am cautiously optimistic about this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product with equally wonderful service!  Highly Recommend!!  I have incorporated this skin-care product into my daily routine and feel it is making a difference, including skin tone.  In fact, I was so certain it was making a difference that I replenished my supply without hesitation.  Having quality products to nourish the skin is absolutely essential--and makes all the difference in results.</li>
    <li> I like this serum so far, takes time for a product to work so I will have to wait out. I got this serum to use mainly after derma rolling but use every night. My skin does seem smoother and cleaner looking I love the shiny clean moisturized look and I get that smooth clean look with this serum :) I love the ingredients also that&#x27;s why I am using this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Will purchase again, as it works like a dream.</li>
    <li> Great product, work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
    <li> This is another fantastic Coui product.  I use this mostly for it&#x27;s hydrating and repairing properties. My skin definitely holds on to moisture better with this product. I have even started mixing a few drops in with my foundation to dilute the coverage and it works great.</li>
    <li> The skin feels and looks great after applying this serum. The first bottle is not finished yet, and I have ordered a second bottle already :)</li>
    <li> amazing product. this is my second time buying this (for my scars) and its really helping my face. as we all know....well most should know, scars is not easy to get rid of, so i KNEW it was going to take some time. anyway with this super c serum and my derma roller, i really feel my scars going away.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome !! My skin has definitely changed. Friends keep asking me if I&#x27;ve had a facial!! My skin is brighter. I love this product. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> this is a very good product, I believe it will help my skin very much. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My skin feels softer. There is a very strong smell, but the smell is more bearable after I refrigerated the product. Let&#x27;s hope I see some results quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used two bottles of the Super C Serum to date since first trying the product.  I use the Super C twice a day, and the Vitamin C serum once a day.  There is noticeable improvement in the fine lines around my eyes, plus my facial skin tone is just brighter in general.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> COUI has the right idea and genius behind creating a collagen and super c serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the fact that my sensitive dry skin FINALLY looking my hydrated, awake! I kept mine in the fridge for an added &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Color, No scent, Non irritating this is an ideal serum for anyone who wants wants a serious&amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; in your overall...complexion, hydration overall healthier skin without any fluff, fillers, junk!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 3 days but already seen some slight improvement. Hope I&#x27;ll see a lot more in next 2-3 weeks. After 3 weeks of religious use my under eye wrinkles and above my eyes near my nose is almost completely gone. Love it. I&#x27;m 57 and have tried everything. Compared to what I have paid this is inexpensive. Love Coui</li>
    <li> A MUST! I am a 37 year old male who has oily skin with past acne scars. My skin has never looked great. It’s not as oily and my skin has more of a smoother look. I will be ordering again. I AM HOOKED! Thank you so much!  I just ordered again because  I notice my skin looks smoother and more even toned in  pictures I don’t have to use that much filter. HA! Honestly I won’t be going without using the serum. It’s like my key to having glowing skin!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if the serum decreases the wrinkles you already have, but I can tell that my skin is very soft since I started using it.  Typically my skin gets very tight and dry during the winter months, but since I started using COUI, I’ve noticed none of that.  What’s more it absorbs quickly and does not leave you skin oily (which also prevents break outs).  I’ll be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago, love the price, great product!  Face seems smoother, brighter, tiny lines not as pronounced!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with the Vit C serum and have been surprised-I use it in the AM after washing my face and it feels like it soaks in quickly (it&#x27;s alittle sticky at first) and that my face says &amp;#34;yes!&amp;#34; My husband is even using it. It doesn&#x27;t make my wrinkles go away and I&#x27;ve only been using for a month but I bought another bottle-so we&#x27;ll see,</li>
    <li> I have sun damaged skin and this product has started to heal it after just one month of use. My overall complexion is more even and I have noticed a decrease in fine wrinkles. I will continue to use this product as long as they keep making it! It is not harsh at all and I have had no dryness, redness, or unpleasant side effects at all. Great product! I plan on buying more from the Coui line!</li>
    <li> This is the best product  I love how it makes my skin look and feel!!!!</li>
    <li> A good product.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> This serum smells great and goes on smoothly. Helps soften skin in the morning to prepare for makeup application. It seems to add a glow and an overalll brightness and tightness to skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> Radiant Skin! Freckles have almost faded. Fine lines at corners of eyes have smoothed out and are hardly visible. I applied twice daily to clean skin and started to see results after 2 weeks. This product has worked better on my skin than other products I have tried, that cost me 3 times as much as the Super C Serum. The Serum arrived 2 days after purchase, It has a clean citrus smell. I love it.</li>
    <li> This seems to work pretty well.  I noticed a difference in my skin tone and wrinkles and I&#x27;m 75!</li>
    <li> I have been using Super C serum and I have found a vast improvement in tone, texture and brightness. I still have some age spots, but patches of discoloration are gone. I live in Hawaii where the sun is relentless! I use a different sunscreen Elta, but they go together very well.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS SERUM TWICE A DAY SINCE ABOUT THE 19 OF FEB. BUT I&#x27;VE YET TO SEE LESS WRINKLES ON MY FACE OR ANY IMPROVEMENT, I&#x27;M 51 AND MOST PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE I&#x27;M 51 BUT I DO HAVE THE NASALABIAL LINES AND A FEW AGE SPOTS. PRODUCT DOES FEEL AND SMELL GREAT AND A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
    <li> I had accepted this as a complimentary review product for my mother&#x27;s sake. She is an absolute LOVER of these topical C solutions, using them daily. And this one by COUI Skincare has some elements that do indeed put it on top of the many other competitors out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I always glance at, with pretty much ANY product, is the ingredients listing. Listing is kind of long, but that was before I realized this was more just than your usual run-of-the-mill topical C serum. It also incorporates a host of other ingredients, such as Kelp (think facial mask base), Hydrolyzed Collagen, Vitamin B3, Lemon Extract, and more. The whole EGF thing has been around for awhile, it&#x27;s discovery earning Stanley Cohen and Rita Levi-Montalcini the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine in 1986, so the concept has had quite some time to be refined in terms of optimum mixtures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle comes with glass eyedropper, not the usual chintzy spritz top many lower priced products use, and a particularly nice touch is a easy to find, clearly printed MANUFACTURED ON date... my sample having been made on 07/10/14, a mere 10 days earlier than the writing this of review. Hah, talk about fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smelling it, I can detect the lemon extract, and although there is still a &amp;#34;medicinal smell&amp;#34; to the serum itself, it doesn&#x27;t linger long. The texture is smooth almost-cream like, likely due to the hydrolyzed collagen, and does leave a slightly sticky residue; however, this is meant to be put on, wait for skin absorption, then application of skin moisturizer (or in my case, my self-concocted mixture of patchouli oil, rose water, and distilled witch hazel). The bottle does state that for best results, this should be stored in a refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, COUI Skincare&#x27;s Super C Serum is a serious powerhouse compared to the three other bottles of topical C serum sitting on my mother&#x27;s &amp;#34;facial station&amp;#34;. However, although I had initially gotten this product with my mother in mind, I think I shall be keeping it on hand to see how it works with the dark circles under my eyes that I have had for years. :Puct with my mother in mind, I think I shall be keeping it on hand to see how it works with the dark circles under my eyes that I have had for years. :P</li>
    <li> Just got this.  Not sure yet so I&#x27;ll keep trying it.  Very sticky wet and dry.  But it could be me so don&#x27;t rule it out.</li>
    <li> The best love it. Let me know if ever a sale on it please ty</li>
    <li> Okay, this is coming from someone who has rarely ever used any type of skincare product (unless you count sunscreen--when I actually remember to put it on--and your basic soap and water combination) and never any type of serum. In fact, I always associated the word &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; with blood rather than skincare. That said, I noticed a significant difference in my skin as soon as I used this product for the first time. And my skin, especially my face, has really been put through a lot throughout my four decades-plus of hiking and camping and getting way too many sunburns, along with the extreme heat and cold and wind. This may sound far-fetched, but the Super C seemed to erase at least some of that sun and weather damage within the first week of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I left for a week of more camping and hiking, sun and dirt and rain and wind, without taking this product along, and I could really feel the difference--the lack of using it--well before I got home. Now that I&#x27;m back to using it daily again, I again notice a significant difference, more so in how my skin feels than how it looks at this point, but we&#x27;ll see if it creates visual changes over time as well. This bottle should last quite awhile, because it doesn&#x27;t take much to &amp;#34;do its thing,&amp;#34; but at this point, it&#x27;s making enough of a difference and feels good enough to make me want to purchase a new bottle when this one gets low.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it just once a day (even though the directions recommend twice....it&#x27;s just easier for me that way and fits into my routine better), and I can definitely see results, especially around my eyes. The lines there are softer, shorter, and definitely less pronounced. My overall skin tone seems brighter and fresher, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff Wrks!! I use this 4 times a wk. Leave it in fridge. Alittle goes a long way. I put it on at least 45 minutes before sleep it&#x27;s super sticky so to avoid your covers, pillow getting it put it a gd while before. What I have notice is my face looking youthful can&#x27;t explain it exactly. I&#x27;m 29yrs old this is the first time I started a face regimen and it&#x27;s nice it&#x27;s wrkng. I also use there Vitamin C product. I got coupons/discounts which you can&#x27;t complain when something wrks!. I use it mainly around my laugh lines,cheeks,the side of my eyes where crows feet can form. I&#x27;m also taking  ,collagen pills, always lots of water and coco water ect.. It does tingle little when you apply it but nothing painful. I leave it on till next morning then wash it off. I would say it 2 wks to a month I started noticing my face nicer. Like I say with other Amazon products that I actually like try it if you don&#x27;t like it get your refund. I&#x27;m Happy! My skin is sensitive so I try not to mess with it much. Anyways hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t write product reviews until I&#x27;ve used something long enough to be able to judge it&#x27;s effectiveness but I already love this one after using it for just a few days. COUI seems to ramp up the effectiveness of both my Retin A and my normal daily moisturizer. Not only is my skin noticeably softer but the lines around my mouth and the bridge of my nose have almost disappeared. This in just FOUR days! I&#x27;m finding that it really doesn&#x27;t take much of the serum and though it&#x27;s a bit sticky when you first apply it, once you add the moisturizer, that disappears as both are drawn deeper into the surface of your skin. Thankfully, the scent is light and refreshing and not overpowering, too, which is important. I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects on the loss of collagen and volume that we all experience as we get older. If it&#x27;s anywhere near as impressive as what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I&#x27;ll be a fan for life.</li>
    <li> I have been on a bit of a quest to find a skin care product that will help fend off the results of 46 years on the planet that included too much sun exposure! Add to that the fact that I am very fair skinned withe freckles and my options seemed very limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Super C Serum is fantastic! After the very first application I felt that his skin care product was something different. Its fresh, clean scent along with slightly viscous texture blended seamlessly into my skin. After waiting a few minutes, I was able to finish my usual makeup routine. Throughout the day I found myself touching my face. Super C Serum gives me a dewy complexion again! It feels smooth and supple at the same time. All this after only 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is my overall skin texture changing but the tone is evening out,with my freckles looking less splotchy (a minor miracle!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to those women who have sensitive and/or fair complexions!</li>
    <li> I think I look 10 years younger already!  My sister is an aesthetician and recommended this product.  I keep in the fridge.</li>
    <li> I received the superc serum free to test since I had ordered oui twice previously. I have been using it about a month. I love the way it softens and tightens my skin.  Makes me feel good to see wrinkles lessened. And fine lines disappearing. I like both the superc serum and the coui products and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> The serum was nice, and gave my skin a pretty glow. However it only earns 2 stars because it made my skin sticky. I would not buy again.    UPDATE: I received a refund from the company due to my dissatisfaction with the product. This is excellent customer service, and makes me happy, even though the serum did not. Although this will not change my original viewpoint, I will be sure to give other Coui products a try, since I know that they back their products up 100%.</li>
    <li> good so far only have used it a week</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I really like the 1st product Vit C serum because of the orange exfoliate and it smells very good. The super Vit C serum smells just as good and goes on is like silk. My face has never felt and looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is ok. I was looking for something a little stronger. This would be great for someone who has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Having tried the original Vitamin c Serum and completely fell in love with it and loved the results, I was very excited about the Super C Serum. I received the complimentary product as a trial and noticed the texture and smell were a bit different, both for the better! The smell is citrusy and the texture is thinner, so it spreads better.  The results were as pleasing as the product itself! I have continued to see age spots lighten and fine lines fade. I have gotten compliments on my tone lately as well! I love this product even more than the original! Keep it up...you guys are creating some unbelievable, affordable products that are easy to use! Look forward to the next creation!</li>
    <li> This new Super C is amazing!!...it feels like you have this protective layer on you skin which does protect your skin from the everyday elements.  A must try!!...Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I use this product along with Coui Vit C 20%.  I keep them both in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;These products have made a huge difference in my skin.  Lines are diminished, my pores are unnoticeable and any brown spots GONE !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for several months now and will definitely continue to.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing!  BTW  so is their customer service.  They will personally answer your emails.  I love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell or thick consistency.  It may be a great product.  Just my personal issue.</li>
    <li> I love the Super C Serum, I use it with the Vitamin C Serum and have been using it for a while now with great results.  I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller quite a few times and have had great service every time.</li>
    <li> Although not instant, I noticed a slight but very real difference in my skin after a week of using Super C. I&#x27;m a huge believer in a high quality serum, it&#x27;s the most important step in skincare as it lays the foundation, helping whatever cream you layer over it to work better.&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight citrus/herbal aroma that dissipates. Very silky feel as it is applied.&lt;br /&gt;Although it wasn&#x27;t a dramatic change, I noticed a more even skin tone, my normally ruddy areas around the cheeks looked less red and congested.&lt;br /&gt;The company does a good job of explaining the ingredients so I won&#x27;t go on about that aspect, and instead share that at least for me, it calmed down areas of my face that tend to look slightly inflamed, and skin is softer.&lt;br /&gt;So, after receiving and testing a sample of this product, the results were good enough to give a five star review and recommendation.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I was using a serum prior to this one and was getting some results, but, when I switched to this one I noticed greater success with minimizing pores, others noticed as well. I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Wife keeps buying it. Must be good :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and can see and feel a difference in my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and the Super C Serum is working for me.  Have noticeable change, less lines and more even skin tone.  I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Ms. Poletti</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for my skin,&lt;br /&gt;which is fair with a lot of damage from&lt;br /&gt;exposure to the sun. I am seeing positive&lt;br /&gt;changes in texture &amp; skin color as the spots slowly fade. As I am almost 67&lt;br /&gt;years old, I expect the changes will be&lt;br /&gt;slow to show subtle dramatic changes &amp;&lt;br /&gt;so far think the serum is doing a good&lt;br /&gt;job. Very happy with the product !</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  Have tried others with very little results.  I have used this for a week now and have definitely seen diminishing wrinkles and fading sun spots.  My face was in poor condition to begin with and to see results in that time frame was, for me, nothing short of a miracle.  Was skeptical in the beginning due to past experiences with other products, but decided to give this a try, and I am so glad I did.  I thank the makers of this product for providing something that actually works at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love the way it get quickly absorbed by my skin and make it look younger.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  My skin has shown some improvement in a short period of time. I would recommend it because of the effectiveness and the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks and have received 2 complements just this week on my skin.  In fact one woman who I ran into yesterday that I had just seen a few months ago asked me if I had work done to my face and another women that works in my bldg that I pass in the hall almost daily asked me if I had gotten Botox, so I&#x27;d say this serum is working quite well.  I have already ordered another bottle.  It is sticky when wet but drys smooth and is not smelly.  I am 55 years old and don&#x27;t normally spend that much on skin care.  I have always used Johnson &amp; Johnson Pupose moistureizer with 15 sunblock and nothing else until now and I have to say I have seen an improovement in my skin.</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist told me to use this and order it on Amazon.  I have used it for about a month, it is easy to use and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Too early to see a big difference in my skin yet. I plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Love love this serum. It smells, feels and works just like a very expensive night serum by a high end perfume company.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product for skin care I have ever used. I mix a bit in my body lotion and use it all over. It&#x27;s not just for your face. It does everything it says it does!!</li>
    <li> When I received the Super C Serum, I read the directions on the outside of the small box that contained the serum.  Users are advised to refrigerate the serum for added results and extended shelf life.  I did that and then forgot about the serum for several weeks!  In my defense, I had out-of-town company for two weeks and was not focused on other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my company left, I tried the serum and at first, was concerned.  It seemed very sticky and took a long time to be absorbed.  The next few times I used it, I was careful to use a lot less and it went on much more smoothly and absorbed well.  My advice is to be careful to use just enough to apply a thin layer to your skin and be sure to give it time to be absorbed.  I normally rely on hyaluronic acid serum for my face and love it.  I was surprised that this Super C serum makes my skin extremely smooth and actually shiny once it is absorbed.  That is not a problem, but a plus since the moisturizer I use next glides on easily as does my foundation.  There is no shine when I have applied my make-up, yet the smoothness gives me a refreshed look and feel.  I like the fact that one of the ingredients in the Super C Serum is hyaluronic acid since my skin does respond well to it.&lt;br /&gt;When I agreed to test and review this product, COUI Skincare provided me excellent information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions for use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Our serum can be used until 6 months after opening the bottle. We believe that after 6 months of opening the bottle, no product can really be effective or of high quality. If kept sealed, shelf life is extended for a few more months. The manufacturing date should appear on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;* We recommend keeping your serum in the fridge after opening, as this will not only extend its lifespan but also make its antioxidants more effective. Please remember that we use the best active ingredients and although it might be a pain to keep it in the fridge your skin will really reward you J&lt;br /&gt;Please shake your bottle well before each use so that you may benefit properly from all the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply on a cleansed and dry face either with the dropper or with your fingertips. Apply using massaging circular motions in an upward direction. Apply to your face, neck, eye area and especially jawline and let it sink in for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;* If applying during the day please use it under a moisturizer and or sunblock. If applying at night please use under a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few important cleansing tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Please don&#x27;t use alcohol or menthol based toners .These consist almost solely of alcohol and water and will only dehydrate your skin .If you insist on using a toner then look for an alcohol free one or rose water.&lt;br /&gt;* Also don&#x27;t cleanse with hot water and soap as this will extract essential fatty acids from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;* Check your cleanser to see that it does not contain \\&quot;Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, this is used in many cleansers, as this ingredient will remove essential lipids from your skin, those that ensure your skin cells work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this serum can take a little longer to be fully absorbed than one of the hyaluronic acid serums I have tried, I use it nightly and in the morning only if I am not rushed to get out the door.  The results so far have been excellent for me with fine lines disappearing, my skin feeling very soft and smooth, and in some places, the skin looking less translucent so spots and tiny veins seem to be less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this Super C Serum is like a beautifully engineered luxury car.  If you read the directions, take care of it, and don&#x27;t misuse it, it will perform amazingly.  I am grateful I was given the chance to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided]&gt;Please shake your bottle well before each use so that you may benefit properly from all the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply on a cleansed and dry face either with the dropper or with your fingertips.

    <li> My skin has never looked better! I love the consistency and smoothness of this serum. I apply it nightly to my face and hands, and wake up to smooth, soft skin. I feel it has really improved the texture and feel of my skin, plus it is fading an age spot on my face! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered this the first time based on some of the other reviews here.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but when it arrived and I tried it, I was SO impressed.  This stuff is amazing!  My skin felt and looked hydrated and it stayed that way all day (or all night).  The effect was even better for the morning application after I used my Mia facial brush.  After using this alone for a couple of weeks, I decided to try it in combination (every other night) with the Vitamin C 20%.  Both are outstanding products and I love that they are affordable.  I&#x27;m a devoted customer now and have the Super C, Vitamin C and the Sunscreen.  By the way, the sunscreen is no slouch either.  It&#x27;s the ONLY sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually feels really good on my skin.  (Note: I live on a boat at the coast and have tried probably every sunscreen out there)</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. I went to ebay and got the Babyface with EGF and vitamin C and I see positive results already in one week. With this serum, since my skin is young, it apparently does not work as well for me. I bought this to help correct hyper pigmentation and it failed to work.&lt;br /&gt;It may work for you if your skin is older though. They said my skin already has good leaves of EGF so that is why it is not as effective to my younger skin. Maybe the Feriuc acid or whatever in babyface is doing the try but I am not a Biochemist.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I put this stuff behind my sisters ear on her neck and she said it irritated her skin. She has sensitive skin. I put some say yes to blueberry moisturizer behind the other ear and she said it didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;You all wasted my time COUI. That is why you deserve this review even though you did indeed refund my money and tell me it was because my skin is too young and what not. Check your advertising wording if you do not wish for a bad review. I own my own small business so my time is valuable and I feel I was misled into buying this product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Definitely helping clear up some sun spots from summer and general redness in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks plump and fresh.  Just what this 45 year old is looking for at a good price!</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my skin. I can&#x27;t even believe it. I use underneath or with another product and I have seen transformation in just a few weeks. Even my estiatician noticed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it!!!!!!! It is sticky,  absorbs badly, unpleasantly on skin.  And no results. It&#x27;s terrible!!!!! Don&#x27;t waste money. I bought it coz it has so many high reviews but really it makes face messy and I want to wash my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb.</li>
    <li> Am I dreaming?  Today is the third day I&#x27;ve used Super C and there is a marked difference in even the worse area on my face.  I knew I &#x27;felt&#x27; a difference the first time I applied it but discounted that to be just wishing.  Now, if I walk toward the mirror I can&#x27;t see any problems until I&#x27;m within inches of my reflection.  Whole face feels more solid . . . firmer, stronger even when I awakened this a.m.  What the heck is in this product???  You wouldn&#x27;t believe how much I&#x27;ve spent on such items.  I don&#x27;t even want to mention that.  I am absolutely thrilled!  And this is only day three!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and my crow&#x27;s feet have all but disappeared.  I am 76 years old, so that&#x27;s saying something.  I would highly recommend the Super C Serum. I continue to use all of the Coui products.  I love the serums and love the results I am seeing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th Bottle, need i say more. Try it, it will be sticky, massage it in well, and moisturize afterward. I now have better Skin than a 30&#x27; 40&#x27; or 50 year old. Someone asked me how old I am, I asked her to guess, she guessed 40-45.  This sweet&lt;br /&gt;Lady made my day, week, month and year. Well People I am 65 years young and would NEVER be without SUPER C SERUM. I love it and I&#x27;m sure you will too. Good Luck. Spoil your Skin, you will look better.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of vitamin C serums recently, because after having my first child, I noticed that the lack of sleep and the nutritional drain on my system from pregnancy and breast-feeding was starting to make my skin look its age. I&#x27;ve tried three different vitamin C serums, and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the ingredients look reasonably similar on all of the different varieties, for whatever reason, this one just seems to sink in better, leave my skin almost immediately glowing, and overall it makes me feel confident that I look like I got a good night of sleep, whether or not that is the case, and don&#x27;t look older than my years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence about which vitamin C serum to try, I would absolutely recommend this one. I don&#x27;t usually expect skincare treatments to do much that his dramatic, but this had a notable difference on both my looks and my self-esteem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;very been using Super C for alost a month now and I&#x27;m starting to see smaller pores on my face. The serum like it&#x27;s waking up my skin. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product</li>
    <li> Love it. No irrititations to my super sensitive skin. Just some very minor flakiness that my exfoliant and moisturizer handles fine. Most products cause rawness, breakouts, and complete skin shed for me, but not this one. Scent is so light it&#x27;s really not there. Just a bit of sticky at first but nothing after moisturizer and foundation is applied. Doesn&#x27;t bother me if I sweat. Doesn&#x27;t cause meltdown of foundation. My skin looks, feels, great.</li>
    <li> Great product!Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Love love love love!!!! Thank you for making my face feel wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I have used the regular vitamin c serum made by COUI and loved it. So when I recently had the opportunity to try their newest product free, I was super excited. I received the sample promptly along with helpful instructions on how to use the product to obtain optimal results. I have been using it twice daily now for about a week and a half and I am delighted with the results I am seeing so far. My complexion is luminous and has a clarity that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.The deep lines around my mouth have really diminished, along with the lines around my eyes. My jaw line is lifted and more pronounced again, and the skin on my neck is smoother and firmer as well. The fine lines on my forehead are a little more stubborn, but I am seeing slow improvement there, too. I am 46 and I won&#x27;t tell you that this stuff makes me look 25, but I can say that when I catch a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror or in a shop window, I am still taken aback by how much younger I look...and this is all within a relatively short time of use. People have asked me what I have been doing to my skin-even my Doctor noticed!!&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have pretty much covered the quality of the ingredients list, so I won&#x27;t go into that, but I can tell you that the consistency of this product is nice and it only takes a little to cover my face and neck. It is a little sticky for about 3 minutes or so after applying it, so you may want to wait before applying anything else. The smell is mild and somewhat \\&quot;citrusy,\\&quot; and my skin feels wonderful all day after applying this in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The price is amazing considering the results and the fact that one bottle should last a month or two- depending on how you use it- and the customer service is excellent. I would recommend this serum to anyone who is interested in maintaining beautiful, healthy skin! I personally will continue to invest in it!</li>
    <li> I REALLY LOVE how this makes my skin feel...again, it&#x27;s a little early to tell how much this will improve my skin, but I am very confident that it will make a big impact</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying products from a Doctors offices for years, X out department stores a huge waist of money! Great skin care now available at a great price. Now I&#x27;ll pass up the Doctors office saving a huge amount of money allowing me to use my product liberally as it should be used. So Glad it&#x27;s available. These products are the most important part of a skin care routine. I give you 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I received Coui Super C as part of the product&#x27;s complimentary promotional launch. I am 59 years old and consider myself basically Low-maintenance but am serious about my skin care products. I have tried everything from the drug store items to the top of the line.  I have found what I have been searching for in this product. It is reasonably priced with high-end ingredients and RESULTS. The serum is light and absorbs quickly. I use it in the morning and evening without any sensitivity, Many times I use it alone without a moisturizer and my foundation glides on  beautifully. I am completely happy and excited that I found it.</li>
    <li> I love this new Super C Serum!  It feels great on my face, and I can see a difference.  Just the other night I was at a friend&#x27;s birthday party, we were talking about grandchildren and someone asked how many children and grandchildren I have, when I told them 4 adult children and 7 grandchildren, they were shocked and asked how old I was, when I told her I turned 59 in April, her jaw dropped, she was amazed and said I didn&#x27;t t look like I was 50!  Wow, that made my day, and it was actually the second compliment I had that night! So obviously something is working for me!  I give credit to the vit C serum I have been using, but I have to say, I take good care of my skin too.  I want to thank COUI for the complimentary gift to try their new Super C Serum.  Thank you!  And keep making great products!</li>
    <li> As described it is better to use in small amounts.  If you feel it sticky then you used too much.  After loving the results on my face age spots (fading away...) I convinced my husband to use it for his skin condition: he has a bad skin condition on one of his ankle: his skin is blackish and sometimes turning darker...the dermatologists have no cure and basically told him to just keep it away from the  sun and use cream.  Well after trying Super C Serum doe just a few weeks we can see improvement in the color of his skin...it works!</li>
    <li> Make my skin very smooth</li>
    <li> Wow!  A little goes a long way.  I have been using this product now for a few weeks and I can see how the skin on my face and especially my neck have gotten firmer. I started my wt loss journey a year ago but recently kicked it up a couple of notches.  The skin under my neck was getting loose, not loose enough where it looked like waddle, but loose enough that I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed considerable less looseness since starting Super C Serum.  Purchasing more is definitely in my future.&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to share....my forehead is wrinkle free.  I have lost #17 in the past month and one of my biggest concerns was my face getting all saggy and wrinkly in my journey.  This morning I had to do a double take, the wrinkles are gone.  I also started using this on my stretch marks. To soon to review that yet but I will definitely update.</li>
    <li> Have tried two other Vitamin C Serums -- Paula Dorf, Timeless. I think the COUI Super C is the best and I will probably repurchase.  I bought this in early November, and now in early February my bottle still has about 35-40% of the contents left.  I use this every morning, on my face and the backs of my hands.  It spreads easily -- two-three tiny drops  cover everything.  I use a little bit of moisturizer over this. (I like Sukin).  Because I started on a regimen of .1% Tretinoin about a  year ago, (I use this every night) I cannot be certain how much of the improvement is a result of each product.  I think that using both has been very beneficial -- I have witnessed significant smoothing of the surface and increased evenness/decreased discolorations from melanoma and age spots (these were not very bad to begin with but are less visible now).  I think that Vitamin C serums do help but Tretinoin makes the biggest difference.</li>
    <li> I am slowly but surely seeing my dark circles fade</li>
    <li> I tried this product just because it&#x27;s on sale but I am impressed! I am 44yr old Asian female. My skin is combination with some dark spots. I used the super C serum only at night time with my regular night cream. I went to bed around 1am but I woke up with the skin looks brighter~ love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at that age where my appearance is constantly on my mind. I have used a variety of anti-aging products in this price range in the past and none of them did a good job. Honestly this is better than anything else in this price range. I&#x27;d say the Super C Serum is comparable to products twice and three times the price. They have a loyal customer in me. I will definitely recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I am on a constant quest to find skin care products that work.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin is getting drier and has lost some of its elasticity.  I&#x27;ve read that Vitamin C is good for skin since it is a powerful anti -oxidant that neutralizes free radicals.  It also helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles and age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It doesn&#x27;t sting or tingle when I apply it.  Since my skin is dry, I have to be careful on which products I use, since some can be very drying.  I always follow up this product with a nice, moisturizing face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  My skin looked noticeably brighter after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The quality.  The partial list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Distilled water&lt;br /&gt;Kelp ferment filtrate&lt;br /&gt;Collagen&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Lemon extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a Vitamin C serum that works, you might just enjoy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample of this product for testing and review.</li>
    <li> It goes on fine but it is too early to know if it works.</li>
    <li> I love this product - I love the customer service - I have tried a lot of &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; serums over the years  - Coui the best one yet.  I will order again and again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love! I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks and I can definitely see results. My skin is much more clear and it has a nice glow. I use this product daily and I use the professional vitamin C serum twice a week. The super C serum does moisturise my face, but doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and my face doesn&#x27;t get oily throughout the day which is great. Originally I used the professional vitamin C serum by itself, but using the 2 products together has worked better than I expected. I have definitely found 2 great products that I will continue to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now, plenty of time to see some sort of difference. It made my skin sticky which I was willing to deal with if it made my skin look better. But... my skin looks worse.  I have some pimples I didn&#x27;t used to have and if anything, my skin is less smooth. The good news is that it wasn&#x27;t hideously expensive. I&#x27;m done with it and throwing the rest out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this company vitamin C serum before I tried this one (I have posted a review about that product as well)... I was contacted by the company and offered an opportunity to try this product as well (for free!!) They also allowed me to share this with a few friends as a promotional offer. I sent this to my stepmom as well as a few ladies I work with. In comparison to the vitamin C serum I really like the consistency of this one more. This has a thicker feel to it and has a light scent that reminds me a bit of eucalyptus and oranges. I was first a little worried that this was thicker because I thought it might not absorb into my skin, the other product has a thinner feel to it but left my face a bit sticky (I really didn’t mind at all because I was using this at night). To my surprise this product soaked right into my skin and left it feeling moisturized and soft. I use this only at night along with an under eye cream and my moisturizer, I wake up to my face feeling soft and not dry at all! I live in AZ so I struggle with dry skin and this has taken all of my dryness away. I am 25 years old and I had terrible scars on my cheeks from old breakouts those scares are gone now and my skin looks fresh and plump! The sun here in AZ takes a serious toll on my skin and I have notice a great difference in my complexion. I definitely recommend this product. My Stepmom has said “I look 25 again!” lol she told me that her skin has never been softer. She uses the Vitamin C serum from OUI in the morning and the super C at night.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this. I used it as directed for a month and have noticed a bit of a difference. It is certainly easy to put on using the dropper (included) and it disappears quickly. I noticed some lightening of my (one and only for now) brown age spot. Pretty neat I think since I hate seeing that in the middle of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, at least one that lingers and although I know that my skin changed in the summer sun, tightens a bit naturally, this made a difference on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review.</li>
    <li> Best product EVER!!!!! I&#x27;m sold! So far it does everything that it claims to do and I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> Great product ... Added to moisterizer and it seemed to plump up my skin,</li>
    <li> Nice product that moisturizers &amp; makes my skin look better.</li>
    <li> Very good. It is a very good serum.</li>
    <li> I am a man who uses this product every day.  I&#x27;m 37 yo and recently started to notice that I was getting some wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes.  I don&#x27;t want to advance into old age without at least putting up a fight, so I started with the Coui 20% Vitamin C serum, then eventually moved to this.  This product is great, easy to wear, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or get shiny.  My wrinkles are disappearing and it helps with my age spots as well.  Here&#x27;s my daily routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning:&lt;br /&gt;1) Take a shower, dry off, apply Super C Serum all over my face including my neck and jawline...also under my eyes&lt;br /&gt;2) Let it absorb for about a minute or two, then I apply Kiehl&#x27;s Line Reducing Eye Brightening Cream under my eyes (This stuff is also incredible!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Bed:&lt;br /&gt;1) Use face cleansing cloths that don&#x27;t require that you rinse your face off (I&#x27;m too lazy)&lt;br /&gt;2) Every other day I use the Coui 20% Vitamin C serum again all over my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it, I realize it&#x27;s 3 separate products, but this is a great regimen for me</li>
    <li> This works well in rejuvenating the skin. I apply it at night and follow up with my regular moisturizer after letting it soak in for three to five minutes. I find that it is not good to use in the morning as it leaves my skin a little bit sticky whether I use it alone or in combination with something else.  This fades dark spots really fast - faster than hydroquinone cream.</li>
    <li> Awesome product that is great for combating the chapness of winter weather</li>
    <li> notice skin tone getting better and dark spot start to disappear. took a photo of myself before and after (2 weeks), notice deep wrinkle between my eyes shallower. have not seen pores getting smaller though.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference on my skin :(</li>
    <li> I got this to use 2-3 days after dermarolling. It&#x27;s a pretty good thick, but still liquidy consistency and the smell is okay. (Although it smells a little fishy upon application) I can&#x27;t tell if this is what&#x27;s been helping with my skin, or everything else I&#x27;ve been doing/using. Either way, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing me any harm, so I&#x27;ll continue using it. I&#x27;m pretty pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love it so far. It absorbs easily, it feels great and I see already difference in skin appearance. I am happy with this product, most likely will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Works great, on my 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> This serum is a bit thicker than most but goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum! It is a part of my nightly routine. I have a very light complexion so this helps reverse the sun damage and freckles. I used to have a lot of sun spots around my mouth and within a few weeks of using this product they were gone! I&#x27;ve given a few bottles to my sisters and they love it as well!</li>
    <li> my skin is so bright and smooth now thanks to super c serum.</li>
    <li> Love this serum, so results in just a few days. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much as so many products promise and don&#x27;t deliver--this one does</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Super C , Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid treatments from Amazon. I&#x27;ve had nice results with some but they seem to stop working after a month or so. I have been using this one for 3 weeks and noticed the most amazing difference in just a week. Once you get past the 1st week of very slight irritation ( cut back to every other day). It just getting better. Can&#x27;t wait to pair it with the SPF 30 moisturizing lotion. The under eye circles are GONE and the hollowness under my eyes has plumped. Very satisfied! Thank you COUI</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing.  Makes my skin feel wonderful all day.</li>
    <li> Great product, as an esthetician, I am always looking for a quality product this one truly works miracles! Customer service is always following up on product, I appreciate the attention to detail. I would highly recommend the super c serum.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how Super C works on wrinkles or aging skin, but I love what it has done for my acne-prone skin. I bought this stuff to use along with my Salicylic and Glycolic acid toners(both 10%) for cystic acne. I put The Super C Serum on at night after toning with SA or GA, and then moisturize with Organic Hemp oil. In the morning, I wake up with tight, bright, and smooth skin. The serum rejuvenates and heals my skin after the chemical exfoliation. On my nights off from the strong acne treatments, I use Coui&#x27;s other serum (Clinical Strength). I am not sure that I would use the Super C Serum alone on my acne, but It is game changing along with my acne treatments for damage control. It reduces the redness/irritation and brightens scarring without all the oils that other C Serums have that can make me break out. Plus, It contains Hyaluronic Acid instead of Glycerin (not that I am against Glycerin, I just like HA better). Great for my skin! Thanks Coui!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for myself (female age 49) and my son (age 19). For me I wanted to see a tightening and toning of my skin, and for my son a reduction in acne scarring. Both of us are experiencing great results. For me I was surprised at how quickly my skin tone brightened and evened out (an unexpected benefit as I didn&#x27;t think that was an issue for me), while the firmness of my skin improved noticeably even around the eye area. My son&#x27;s acne scarring is years old, but it is noticeable that the depth of the scarring is decreasing, as well as the redness. He also has a much brighter and healthier overall skin tone. Because his scarring is fairly significant and old, and we have only been on the product a few months, I can not declare that he will be rid of all the scarring. I can say that it is noticeably improving and that is saying a lot. I definitely recommend this product and look forward to continued use.</li>
    <li> Love this Super C Serum.  I keep it in the refrigerator as it suggests and after I exfoliate and clean my face in a.m, I put this on and let it soak in.  It goes on very silky and a little goes a long way.  I also put on my eyelids and it is not irritating at all.  It does feel a bit sticky for about 5-10 min after applying but that goes away once I put my daily sunscreen over the top.  Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> Within a few days of using Super C Serum I saw immediate results. I have very sensitive skin that often breaks out when using new beauty products. At the time of purchase, I had some patches on my face that were red and irritated, and which I assumed would soon turn into a breakout. Within a couple of days of using the product I noticed those patches of irritated skin soothed and evened out. With continued use, I am noticing the general quality of my skin has improved. The serum is easy to apply and rapidly absorbed by the skin. I am very pleased with this product and will definitely be using this from now on!</li>
    <li> At 73 and living in the high desert, a couple of hours away from Las vegas, you can imagine that my skin is dry. This product does just what it says it will do, my skin is soft, smoothing out lines and little wrinkles and people keep asking me what are you doing to your skin. I wish I had this product 50 years ago, start young ladies you will be amazed at the results!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this product! I have been using for about 4 months. My brown sun spots have completely faded it does not clog my pores and I LOVE it.  I buy many expensive face products from Sephora and Ulta and this is by far the best combination product I have ever used. Do not miss out. I&#x27;m 34 and this is helping me look in my 20&#x27;s still.  There vitamin C serum is also great and I use that in combination with this every other night.  I also put this on every morning underneath my make up as a light moisturizer</li>
    <li> Really like this serum. It&#x27;s thicker than expected, but still light weight on your skin. Its much better than others I&#x27;ve tried. Minor results are immediate and I plan to stick with this serum after trying 4-5 different ones over the past year or so.</li>
    <li> I really love this serum.  I can feel the difference every day and I will continue to use this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This product works like magic, the key is to be constant.</li>
    <li> I just got the product and have just started using it. The one thing I noticed the second I put it on was the smell. It smells like fish...Its not a good smell at all. I will come back &amp; post another review after I use it longer, but I wanted to mention that it does sort of stink.</li>
    <li> Notice a big difference in my skin, wrinkles appear diminished and less noticeable. Skin looks more even and smooth. Used to spend $75 on a very similar product, this is a great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I use this underneath my moisturizer and have noticed a small improvement.  I am 58 and believe me have tried everything that is available from high end creams to procedures and to be honest this has been showing more promise in only 1 month then I have seen in years.  The price is perfect and I do keep this in the fridge.  Nice wake up call in the morning after a shower.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results I see using the first bottle, I have ordered another bottle and will report on the continued results.I continue to be pleased with the results I see from this serum. I fe3el that the serum seems to tighten my face once it is applied which leads to a smoother looking complexion. My overall facial condition seems to have improved. I plan to continue its use.</li>
    <li> I have brought this for my wife and could see the difference on the first use itself. Due to some reason her facial skin was became dark. She could see the difference once she started using this product. The facial skin color started to lightening back towards original color which she had one year ago. Its been 10 days of using this product, so far good. The price is also not too much and its worth it. I am giving five start because of no side effects and it worked.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Makes my skin feel soft and has already made in difference in my skin&#x27;s elasticity and tone.  Very pleased.  This company also provides excellent customer service.  They truly care about their product and the customer.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It really works. Obviously you won&#x27;t see changes overnight. Not even a plastic surgery since you look swollen for a while. I tried a couple of other products. THIS IS THE BEST!!! you can feel soft, radiant skin almost inmediately.&lt;br /&gt;People dont believe my age, but i do share the secret...</li>
    <li> Definitely works on my acne scars! Love it and reordered!</li>
    <li> This Super C Serum feels so good on my skin.  I cleanse my face and then smooth the serum from hairline to neckline.  After a few minutes to allow it to thoroughly absorb into my skin, I apply my daily moisturizer and I am good to go.  It gives my skin a glow and the fine lines are much less.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Super C product for a few weeks. I&#x27;m not refrigerating but keep it in a cool dark place. I use it 2x per day so assume I&#x27;ll go through the bottle while the ingredients are fresh and potent. I can&#x27;t really say if the product is as remarkable as other reviewers have as I changed a lot of my skin care routine all at once including adding prescription Retin A for fine lines and brightening. Nor did I take any before pictures. Some people are overly optimistic and maybe exaggerate in their minds the changes they see, I&#x27;m probably the other way around, maybe I&#x27;ll take a picture after I post this ;-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I&#x27;d been using very expensive name brand products, without much effect assuming that they were better quality, their claims verified and that these less expensive products sold only online were likely using low quality ingredients or ineffective concentrations of the same ingredients (or not at all). None of these products are regulated no matter how much you pay. I have decided that just because they are carried in a store doesn&#x27;t mean they are better or more legitimate than these less expensive products. I did do some research into making my own C serum and realized that all the skincare products and recipes are readily available for consumers to buy. If a small company wants access to these products they don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;international laboratories and scientists&amp;#34; which the brand name companies like to use as a selling point. Since it&#x27;s a bit more complicated than I wanted to deal with I felt this was a good compromise for quality and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided that I&#x27;d rather be duped out of $30 than $130 - I purchased this product and the 20% C and that definitely does some exfoliation and causes a tingling sensation for a few minutes which estheticians say is a sign it&#x27;s penetrating into deeper layers. This one is a bit sticky and gummy if I use too much or it collects on the rim of the bottle. Use a small amount and let it sit on your skin before applying makeup or it may &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off. Since I like the active ingredients I am willing to deal with the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly pleased with the skincare company and will continue to use the products for that reason alone. They have sent messages and discounts for future orders. Of course this is smart marketing but it also shows an investment in their product and in gaining long-term happy customers.it sit on your skin before applying makeup or it may &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off.

    <li> I am an esthetician and have extensive knowledge in multiple product lines. I love this product and for the price, you absolutely can not match its results! Anywhere!  Def buy, you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
    <li> my mother in law loved it</li>
    <li> Fantastic ingredients, incredible results.  I&#x27;m a 40 year old man with few wrinkles so this is more prevention for me at this point. In addition to bringing a glow and clarity to my skin, there&#x27;s something psychologically pleasing knowing i&#x27;m feeding my skin with a product with proven, pure and powerful ingredients.  I&#x27;ll ordering the Vitamin C serum also.&lt;br /&gt; I moisturize with my own facial oil blend of Acai, Blueberry, Marula, Broccoli seed, Meadowfoam, Prickly Pear, Black Cumin and Sea Buckthorn. My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I love this serum! There is a definite brightening of my skin and the tone looks so much better. This product has not caused any breakouts either which is an absolute plus!!!</li>
    <li> I have only used this serum twice and it feels wonderful.  Cannot wait to see what it does after two weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different Vitamin C serums and hyaluronic acid serums in the past couple of years that they&#x27;ve all blended together in my mind as \\&quot;skin serums\\&quot;.  Frankly, I have to say that I&#x27;ve liked them all, even if there isn&#x27;t one that stands out as top of the heap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the latest Vitamin C serum that I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s as good as the best of them (whichever one that was) or maybe is the best of them.  What I especially like is that this serum seems to moisturize my skin better than the others.  All the serums tighten pores but some have a tendency to dry my skin, making it a necessity to put moisturizer on after the serum has been absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this Coui serum, on the other hand, sometimes I don&#x27;t bother with a moisturizer, except for a little under eye cream and a bit of cream around the mouth.  The serum seems to plump up areas that need plumping, thus reducing temporarily the look of wrinkles, and it tightens skin or reduces pores at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell too.  So why not give it 5 stars?  2 main reasons:  (1) I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading of age spots.  I have one on the side of my nose that I&#x27;m using as the test spot.  It looks the way it always has.  (2) There&#x27;s a stickiness factor.  Even if using only a small amount, it takes a long time to be absorbed and can leave the skin feeling a bit tacky.  However, I&#x27;d already mentioned that this serum moisturizes better than other serums I&#x27;ve used.  Maybe that goes hand in hand with this \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  This is very good.  I like it and will probably buy more after my sample has run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sample provided by manufacturer.)</li>
    <li> Use before bed and face seem more shinning and hydrate the next mornig.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> after one use my cold sore on my lip started to heal.  Delivery was prompt and I am very happy</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the great reviews.  Can&#x27;t say I see a great deal of difference, but my skin feels good.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have tried this one and other one.  I&#x27;m not sure which is my favorite, but I will update when I do!</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to actually work.  I am having issues with wrinkles on my forehead and around my mouth and eyes (everywhere I guess 😊). I was starting to panic because I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would work.  I used this for two weeks and noticed I wasn&#x27;t obcessing on the wrinkles anymore and that they were actually going away.  I can still see the ones on my forehead but they&#x27;re way better, and I can&#x27;t even see them anywhere else.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s temporary or not, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m impressed so far. I keep mine in the fridge like the product suggests. This was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! It has completely transformed my acne-prone, acne-scarred skin. I plan to continue to purchase this product. I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  It smells lovely without any added fragrance, which is great for my sensitive skin.  It also feels wonderful going on and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month and I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement.  My aesthetician remarked that my pores were looking smaller and my skin much clearer.  I have suffered from acne in the past and I still have some scars and dark spots from sun damage, but both are fading with regular use of the Super C Serum.  For reference, I am a 34 year old female and I have combination skin with some chemical sensitivities. If this can work for me without causing irritation, it seems like it would work for most skin types!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 to 4 weeks now and I see no results. This is even a follow instructions started every other day, put in fridge, and I am up to daily use but my skin has no improvement. I did give this two stars  because delivery was prompt and I received an email after I bought this about the purchase which was nice.</li>
    <li> Great product, just finished my first bottle and ordered two more. The first bottle lasted about a month. I&#x27;m a 49 year old male and it really has made my skin feel and look younger..</li>
    <li> Another great product from Coui. I  use both the C Serum and Super C Serum. It is truly effective as described and I&#x27;m enjoying the compliments. I definitely recommend Coui. I&#x27;ve tried other Serums but this is the best by far.</li>
    <li> Love this product as it is kinder to &amp;#34;this old face&amp;#34; - could use the other one just every other day or every third day, but this one is better for everyday use.  Also thank you for the Coui UV Facial cream - will use that if and when the sun shines here in Pittsburgh.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Super C having liked the results of the Vitamin C serum; I&#x27;ve seen the best results with these two products than with any other  anti-aging products. The products dry and don&#x27;t leave a tacky feel like some others. This works wonders on combo skin for a general healthy skin look and diminished sun and old acne scars. I have received many compliments that my skin looks great and what I had done. I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles but it has helped the fine lines that I do have. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now and can definitely tell a difference.  Much smoother skin and less wrinkles!  Love it</li>
    <li> I USE IT WITH MY DE ROLLER. ITS VERY GOOD....I SEE LESS DARK SPOTS ON MY FACE AFTER USING IT...</li>
    <li> I have used both the super c and the 20% vitamin C. I don&#x27;t think the super C is any better. It is thicker serum, quickly absorbed into skin. I feel that I am using more of this serum as compared to the other. Also the super C seems to make my skin feel a little tighter, that&#x27;s good I think. I am not sure whether it is making the wrinkles less apparent. But I don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles just yet. Is it making my face more radiant?, not really. The dark spots?, well not sure which work better for the dark spots, I think the other one does a better job. After all that, I do like both serum, will continue to use the 20%, still not sure about the super c. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think it&#x27;s a good serum especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product , made my skin bright and vibrant .</li>
    <li> I luv this product and will order more!</li>
    <li> This product does everything it claims. My skin (face) feels and looks great. I also use it on my neck and my redness has pretty much disappeared.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;After using original C Serum I was thrilled to be able to try the new Super C product.  It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now and the only reason I&#x27;ve waited till now to write a review is because I was away on holiday.  But, while I was very impressed after just the first week, three weeks into it and I&#x27;m Super Sold!&lt;br /&gt;Love, Love, Love the texture of the Serum.  A little thicker, not clear, smells like orange blossoms, glides on like silk, and dries quickly.  My skin reacts very well to it revealing an even smoother, glowing texture and look.  I use the Super C at night after cleansing my face before bed. My complexion is even toned, most days i wear a light moisturizer and blush with mascara and lipstick or gloss....I&#x27;m receiving compliments from my friends and family and even a Doctor I had to see recently for an upcoming surgery complimenting me on ho&#x27;dw young I look.  I&#x27;m 56 years but my skin does not reflect that.  Also, I was (and still, i admit) I still love the sun but with this Serum you&#x27;d never know it!  I also rub the excess on the back of my hands, not to waste a drop!&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, don&#x27;t hesitate with this product, you will love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Made my skin soft and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
    <li> Very sticky on my skin.  I feel like due to that stickiness any dust in the air was drawn to my face like a magnet. I ended up breaking out.  Not sure if it&#x27;s this stuff or something else that broke me out. I wanted to like it. It&#x27;s just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT***&lt;br /&gt;This vendor is top notch!  They gave me a refund for my dissatisfaction which was totally unexpected and uncommon nowadays.  Excellent customer service!  I now intend to research their other products further even though this serum didn&#x27;t work for my skin.  Added a star because I am so pleased with this outcome.</li>
    <li> Super C Serum is a great product!  My skin is very oily and I feel this product have helped heal my pimples and scars, leaving my skin with a glow.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Coui</li>
    <li> nice product - it saturates the skin with superb ingredients that allow your skin to thrive</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product in the mail! But, after using it for 4-5 days I had a massive breakout all over my face. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I really like this product. My skin felt softer, and it never felt after it was applied sticky in my opinion. But just because this product didn&#x27;t work for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you. (I have skin semi-sensitive skin, and eczema!) It&#x27;s extremely unfortunate that this didn&#x27;t work out for me, and quite unfortunate about the massive breakout that occurred.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks now and I love it.  I also use OUI&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum which I&#x27;ve been using for over 6 months now.  I honestly can&#x27;t say that the Super C is better than the regular V-C product, because my skin is in pretty great shape after using the V-C Serum for over 6 months!  Regardless, if you want to address fine lines, sun damage and loss of elasticity, try this product.  I promise that you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I like to use it at night and I wake up in the morning with my skin feeling soft. I really am beginning to see a difference in my skin. Great!</li>
    <li> This company continues to impress me with their products.  This c Serum is no exception.  Great quality,reasonably priced and  feels good on your skin and absorbs quickly.  Your skin will feel so smooth.  They also have fantastic customer service.  Keep up the great work COUI!</li>
    <li> I love this new SuperC serum! Just ordered my second bottle. It truly has made a difference in my skin in the 6 weeks that I&#x27;ve used it. Actually, results showed in half that time. People have commented on my skin, saying that it glows and looks more supple and youthful- almost daily! I have shared my &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; with them- Super C serum. As others have said, it is a bit sticky at first, but absorbs quickly- in less than 3 minutes. Aroma is faint and pleasant. Just a few drops goes a very long way. I use half a dropperful twice a day, and apply it to face, neck, chest, and top of hands. I am 50 years old, and get almost daily comments that I don&#x27;t look my age. Get this product in your life!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous Vitamin C Serums (over 7) as I&#x27;m trying to test out which one I would recommend to my clients being that I&#x27;m a licensed Esthetician. Well, so far I like this one the best and see some difference. In comparison to the other ones that I have tried, this one product glides on beautifully, doesn&#x27;t sting, and absorbs onto your skin very nicely. You can see a difference after the first application. I highly recommend this C serum.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and I have been using it for several weeks now.  It has greatly improved my dry and wrinkled facial areas.  This is a good replacement (and cheaper) for the Hydroderm product, which I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Love this vitamin c serum! Have ordered it multiple times. It lasts longer than other vit c serums due to it&#x27;s thickness. My face hands and chest are definitely brighter and younger. Sticky at first but seeps into the skin after about 5 minutes then I apply SP moisturizer or sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I was informed that due to aging and years of &#x27;neglect&#x27;, my poor facial skin lost elasticity and is in dire need of intensive moisturizing.  I was told to go with a collagen product.  And so began my search.  On board a ship, the masseuse wanted to sell me a brand called Elemis.  I&#x27;m sure it would also have been wonderful, but I don&#x27;t like making uninformed decisions, especially when the product is pricey.  After perusing many of the Amazon collagen product info pages and reviews, I decided to go with Super C Serum.  I can tell you without question that my face feels more like it did when I was a young man.  Softer and more supple.  Whether or not the few wrinkles I have actually disappear, remains to be seen. But I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it and perhaps try some of the company&#x27;s other offerings.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and it is a bit tacky for a few minutes after application, but overall I really like it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I apply it twice a day, morning before makeup, &amp; evening before bed. I like that even after I wash my face, I can still feel the effects of this product. I also use it as a spot treatment on a blemish &amp; it seems to heal quicker. Highly recommend this product for a more glowing, smoother, youthful appearance of skin.</li>
    <li> I have decided not to leave a feedback yet right after I got the item just because I wanted to see if the product works. I&#x27;ll tell you, this product  works wonder for me! I can see my pores were getting smaller &amp; not even two weeks yet since I used it. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a couple weeks before I could give my opinion about this product and I am glad I did. My skin has never been this naturally glowy and soft. I had minor breakouts the very first week I used it. I assume my skin was just reacting to the new product. Now, don&#x27;t freak out! The breakouts were not big, just tiny little ones. As if the serum was purging all my blackheads and uncloging those nasty pores. I am definitely going to repurchase this product! It is my new beauty secret. To properly see all the benefits of it, I apply it every night and always keep it in the fridge. It feels super refreshing! Do yourself a favort, ditch those unnecessary expensive serums and buy COUI Super C Serum!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It does a great job.  I am not in the habit of using a million dubious skin care products.  This is the real deal and a good price for the product.  The little bottle lasts a couple of months!</li>
    <li> I have just recently started using the COUI products and have started with the Super C Serum and I can definitely see results in my skin being tighter and having a glow.  I will continue to use this product and plan on next ordering the Facial SPF....Also had a question to ask re: the super C and wrote to COUI and was immediately answered by Alessandra Poletti who responded not only quickly but answered the question and was super polite.  Great people with a great product...</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old. Dry skin for the winter. But did not feels nothing.</li>
    <li> Good product. Just a little messy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> UPDATE....&lt;br /&gt;By far the BEST C SERUM EVER!! I&#x27;ve tried so many and really like another brand but after trying COUI, I won&#x27;t go back to anything else!&lt;br /&gt;I urge you to at least try this serum, give it a chance and watch your skin evolve from dull, dry, sick looking, to glowing, plump, clearer, brighter skin! AMAZING STUFF!!&lt;br /&gt;What else do you have Coui? I&#x27;d love to sample other products by this company!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the vitamin c. Use nightly.</li>
    <li> After a month, I see a significant improvement in my skin texture. I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Great company,  good value, awesome product.  They care about keeping customers.</li>
    <li> Will keep buying  again and again</li>
    <li> This vitamin C skin serum is slightly milky and viscous, with a fresh citrus scent.  It is bottled in amber glass to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy application.  It can be kept in the refrigerator for a cooling, soothing, and slightly tingling sensation when applied to dry, irritated, or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has a formula different from other serums and includes fermented sea kelp filtrate and epidermal growth factor as well as other ingredients known to benefit the skin such as glycerol, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  It also minimizes the appearance of enlarged pores and decreases shininess in oily areas.  It is intended for use on the face, but is equally effective on problem areas like elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  The hyaluronic acid may help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F A Poletti provided a bottle of serum for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. It leaves a sticky film feeling on my face, and absorbs badly. I have not seen any results and it has actually made my face break out more.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any difference. I will continue to use it till its all gone, but so far it hasn&#x27;t done anything.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  Have been using for approx 3 wks now and can tell noticeable reduction in fine lines. Not only good for your face!  I wish they made a larger bottle because I have been using on hands and forearms.  I am 69 yrs old and have very fragile skin due to sun damage in younger years and skin tears really easily. This has helped to firm up skin on my arms and my skin does not tear as easily and it makes your hands so soft. Just ordered two more bottles. I will continue to use this products.  Thanks Coui for a great product.  10 stars!!!</li>
    <li> THE BEST SERUM EVER AS REQUESTED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST TO START USING.  ALREADY SEEING FADING OF DARK SPOTS AS WELL AS SKIN IS MORE ELASTIC.  I USE IT UNDER MY ESTEE LAUDER PRODUCTS AND HAVE PURCHASED FOR BOTH MY SISTER AND HUSBAND.  GREAT BARGAIN AS WELL AS COUI SENDS COUPONS FOR AN ADDITIONAL 25% OFF</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product it is really helping my aging skin. I break out from eveything, this has not broke out my skin</li>
    <li> I thought this was the same OUI product I had bought &amp; loved in the passed. I assumed the packaging was the only thing that changed. The other packaging with tan instead of blue on the box never caused flaking or sensitivity to the skin. This one does. I hope I can still find OUI BY F.A. Poletti LTD in the tan &amp; white box. I won&#x27;t by this again.&lt;br /&gt;I apologize the blue &amp; white COUI box is a different product I purchased then the tan &amp; white box. However, my review stands the same on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have also purchased the recirnt tan &amp; white box &amp; thought I was purchasing the same product as I did in the passed but it is not the same. This one also makes my skin sensitive &amp; causes it to peel. They changed the name to COUI from OUI and is no longer sold by OUI Skin Care. So sad because it used to be a great product! I won&#x27;t be purchasing either of these products again from COUI.</li>
    <li> I took advantage of this Super C Serum by COUI Skincare as a complimentary item for review.  I was not disappointed.  I have to be careful with Vitamin C serums as they can dry my skin out.  I first used this once a day for a week and then increased it increasing it to once a day for a week, then finally twice a day since.  I have not been disappointed in it since.  I live in Arizona and it is so dry here.  I was skeptical in using another Vitamin C serum this time of year but I decided to take a chance. I made the right choice.    When they say it is a Super C Serum., they are right!  There are other goodies in this serum besides Vitamin C.  Two key ingredients are collagen as well a hyaluronic acid which are great anti-aging ingredients.  I didn&#x27;t see much benefit immediately but I did notice a little more moisture in my skin.  After a few weeks I could start to see some fine lines diminish around my eyes and lips.  No one has commented on the difference but I do notice them looking.  I have tried enough products to know that they notice results.    The bottle comes with an eye dropper rather than a pump which I prefer.  Also, there is a date stamp on the bottle. This is fresh serum!  The date stamp is July 10, 2014.    This is definitely a serum I would recommend.  I will definitely be getting another supply.</li>
    <li> Coui&#x27;s Super C Vitamin C Serum is without doubt the best vitamin C serum for my skin.  It&#x27;s not just the C in the serum but the entire complex that makes it work for me.  As the manufacturer suggests, I keep my bottle in the refrigerator, and that may make a positive difference in its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer also suggests you begin by taking pictures of your skin before you start using the serum, and then take more pictures after you&#x27;ve been using it for two or more weeks.  This I did, and the results were remarkable, fewer wrinkles, brighter skin, and, best of all, deep wrinkles are filling in.  In addition, this product is inexpensive, especially when you consider the prices of many anti-aging serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I found this serum.  I&#x27;m buying more so I will have a bottle for travel and an extra on hand so I won&#x27;t run out unexpectedly.  This serum is for me truly a find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this product and I jumped at the chance. I don&#x27;t normally try these fancy serum, vitamin, anti-aging skin products, so to have the chance to get one for free was great. I really like the bottle and packaging and immediately I thought the smell was wonderful. It smells fresh and slightly floral. The texture is also nice. A little bit goes a long way and applies smoothly. I have been using it once or twice a day for two weeks and my skin definitely feels softer. I wish I could say that my wrinkles appear diminished, but I can&#x27;t with certainty. I do love that this is good for sensitive skin. Harsh products just don&#x27;t work for me, but this is gentle and has not irritated my skin at all or caused me to break out. Overall, I like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This smells. After it dries if you rub or touch your face it rolls of like you put a layer of elmers glue on, kinda gross. Didn&#x27;t absorb or change my skin at all, just makes it feel gross. It kinda stings too. To many gimmicks- i knew it wouldnt be magic but i was hoping for some kind of result...</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels on my face. I get comments about how nice my face looks.</li>
    <li> Used 2 x daily for 4 months and got no improvements whatsoever. If anything my skin is worse now that when I started.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C products as part of my facial regime for years.  About a year ago, I started using more concentrated serums to fight the dullness and loss of tone in my over 50 skin.  Tried a few different lines and liked them, but hadn&#x27;t found &#x27;the one&#x27; that gave me the results I was looking for.  THIS IS IT!  My skin absolutely loves this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 months and I swear my skin looks 5 years younger.  My tone is so much better it looks like I&#x27;ve lost weight.  My skin looks smoother and pores are smaller. I do follow the manufacturers recommendation to store the product in the fridge.  The texture is unusual - sort of a slimy serum, but it soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any film or residue.  I also find the smell unusual - all I can think of is &#x27;organic&#x27;, sort of like cut grass?  But again, the smell disappears quickly after application so it isn&#x27;t an issue.  There has been no irritation - in fact, I find the solution is soothing.</li>
    <li> as advertised, improved skin texture.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and somewhat sensitive skin. This product feels like silk and hydrates my skin very well. I am on my second bottle, a little goes along way. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> To be beautiful inside and out at any age...&lt;br /&gt;1. Eat whole, non-gmo, organic foods.&lt;br /&gt;2. Balance hormones. A must for optimal health!&lt;br /&gt;3. Exercise.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use Coui Super C serum. Works just as advertized! Love this stuff! Make sure to follow their directions exactly to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll look and feel your best!</li>
    <li> This has clearly decreased some of my deepest lines on my forehead and neck.  It makes my skin feel good - I rarely use foundation make-up at all.  You only have to use a small amount so a bottle lasts for some time.  Plan to continuing using indefintely!</li>
    <li> Becareful if you habe sensitive skin. The vit c in this gave me a few burn spots on my skin. I have to use this ever other day and mix it with my night cream. It does give an overall radiance to the skin. Worked on my moms liver spots on jer hands. She applied it twice a day and they started to fade and peel off. They are less noticable but not completely gone. Shes happy. As for me this is a bit too drying on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I can actually see that my wrinkles have soften and my skin feels smoother.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle. Starting to see significant results with regular exercise and eating better. Keep the serum in the refrigerator for best results and be consistent with your regimen.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT. IN FACT, IT&#x27;S THE BEST I&#x27;VE EVER USED, AND I HAVE USED ALMOST EVERY PRODUCT ON THE MARKET. AS A FORMER MODEL I AM USED TO TAKING CARE OF MY SKIN. THIS DOES THE JOB. IT&#x27;S REMARKABLE AND THE RESULTS ARE ALSO REMARKABLE. I USE IT DAILY AND AM GRATEFUL TO HAVE IT IN MY DAILY ROUTINE. IT&#x27;S THE BEST ON THE MARKET.</li>
    <li> This is the second serum I have purchased from COUI. I really like this product too. Feels great on my skin. I use on face,neck and chest. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product has a pleasant smell and leaves my face feeling firm.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it makes my skin look younger, still has not done too much for my acne scars, but maybe that will take more time for those to fade away.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like my skin, but love it now.  Thanks for the wonderful product~</li>
    <li> This was a wow!  As an aging baby boomer, I have tried almost every product on the market, especially C serums.  The first time I put this on my face I noticed how great it felt.  I was an immediate convert.  I cant wait to try their other products.</li>
    <li> This is good quality serum.  Soaks in well, smells pleasant but not too fragranced and &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; my skin nicely.  I will agree with a previous reviewer that it is a bit sticky, thus I don&#x27;t use it in the morning as it tends to look like peeling skin if I use liquid concealer or foundation.  I generally use medical grade skin care but I certainly pay dearly for it.  This is a very reasonably priced, quality serum for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. My skin is softer, clearer and looks so healthy. It is a great price. If you got this much C Serum in a cosmetic you would be paying mega bucks.</li>
    <li> I saw no difference in my skin I used it every morning and evening just as the box told me to... and nothing...</li>
    <li> This is the second or third time I bought Super C Serum. I also use the 20% C Serum 20% by COUI. Although I don&#x27;t stare at myself in the mirror much I think it is reducing lines firming my skin and giving me a nice glow. A couple of months ago I was out and slow to reorder. I noticed a huge difference from non usage. I know there are tons of c serums out there. COUI seems like they are a real company and are not a flyby company just jumping on the band wagon. I</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried this product. Has a nice feel, consistency. Absorbs well if you apply very sparingly. All this to say I will stick with the product to see if it helps aging skin, I live in hope. Will also try other products by this company out of curiosity and gratitude for the fact that they make an effort to reach out to new customers. A rare and beautiful thing these days!</li>
    <li> Love this serum!  I have tried alot of different vitamin C serums and this one is by far the best!  It contains so many great ingredients that benefit your skin and the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have never used a Vitamin C serum before so cannot compare this product with similar products on the market.  I wish I had found Coui earlier because I love it!  I am in my early 60&#x27;s and have been using Retinol products for several years. For the past year I have been consistently using a popular &amp;#34;rapid wrinkle repair&amp;#34; product day and night.  Instead of looking better my skin looked dull, uneven and I even had some  breakout around my mouth and chin.  The last thing I expected in my 60&#x27;s was a pimple problem!  It obviously wasn&#x27;t the right product for me. On a whim decided to try a Vitamin C serum and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  After only 2 weeks my skin looks brighter, more even and no more breakouts.  I have already ordered the other Coui products and am very pleased with them also.</li>
    <li> March 4, 2015  I read the reviews and purchased the product. Ive been using it for a week and do show my cheeks are &amp;#34;filling out&amp;#34;. It has a great light scent and a little does go a long way as other reviewers have stated.  The customer service is OUTstanding, answering your queries in not a word or two but paragraph. It is a big reason also why I purchased from them.  Ill keep updating weekly but so far, I am pleased and will be buying 2 more bottles as the price is unmatched for the item :)  UPDATE: March 10: I had 2 people I know at our local food store ask if I had &amp;#34;face work&amp;#34; done. I can see for myself that my face is brighter and less &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34;. My cheeks after 2 weeks are plumping out more. I just bought a 2nd bottle bcse of the great price and COUI sent a 25 percent off coupon. A steal :)  UPDATE: March 20: My cheeks are &amp;#34;plumping out&amp;#34; which is why I bought the item.. I am going to continue using. Also, the infamous crows feet have lessened. My whole face looks tighter :)  Update: March 31: It has almost been a month and I have really seen a difference.. COUI sent me a coupon for the Vit. C Serum and I feel you must use both to show any real changes. I can feel the Vit. C tingle when first applied. I am going to keep using and updating :)  Update: April 8: I went to get a hair cut and the gal asked what was different about me. It was my skin. The overall tone and shape.. I honestly believe that this product works IF you use it as directed. Th Vitamin C Serum is a plus :)</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding !  I use it 3 to 4 times a week at night.My skin looks so much healthier it has a healthy glow.My wrinkles are less noticeable,I finally have an even tone to my skin.,my pores are smaller and I have a lifted,look to my skin.A small amount is all you need.and your skin will just drink it up and you will feel it working .Using this product along with the regular 20% vitamin C has changed the appearance of my skin.I can go without wearing make up and have a healthy,glowing younger looking skin.which was something I could never do.At my age this is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Just make sure you stick with it to get the best benefits.Lets face it these products are best for your skin and the price is right.you cant go wrong..ENJOY SEEING THE BENEFITS !!!!</li>
    <li> I am applying the serum to my face after cleansing 2-3 times a week and after the 2nd application I already see less redness and my skin looks healthier and feels healthier and silkier overall.</li>
