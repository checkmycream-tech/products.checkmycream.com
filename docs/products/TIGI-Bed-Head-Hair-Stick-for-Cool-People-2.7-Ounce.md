      <li>The real stuff, and for a much cheaper price than buying at the salon.</li>
      <li>Fast, fast delivery.</li>

      <li>When my previous product was discontinued, I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to find something to replace it.</li>
      <li>ok, so i first came upon this in the late 90&#x27;s at a hair salon in downtown baltimore.</li>
      <li>My negatives about it would be that it rubs off when it comes into contact with other things, like sunglasses on top of your head (sometimes they&#x27;re smeared when I put them back on) or hats, etc.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t messy, is insanely easy to apply and one stick lasts me about 6-8 months.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small, easy to use, and it lasts FOREVER.  </li>
      <li>It works very well for my short hair (about an inch long).</li>
      <li>Easy to use, no sticky mess to clean up, but a little tough to shampoo out.</li>

    <li> Easy to use, no sticky mess to clean up, but a little tough to shampoo out.</li>
    <li> ok, so i first came upon this in the late 90&#x27;s at a hair salon in downtown baltimore. In 30mins, I went from dork to leading man.  I have never gone a month without it since. My grandpa used to use Brillcreme (alittle dab will do ya). Even I used it once or twice, but this is my generaton&#x27;s brill creme. If bedhead suddenly went out of business, I would immediately drive to the Headquaters and buy up all remaining stock of the TIGI bedhead stick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost ten years, it works great -- just a couple of swipes and you&#x27;re all set, and it&#x27;s not all residue-ey.</li>
    <li> arrived super fast exactly what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping my hair in place and for styling.  Doesn&#x27;t make hair feel sticky or goo-ey.  Fast, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for almost three years. When my previous product was discontinued, I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to find something to replace it. Much to my surprise, TIGI is even better. It works very well for my short hair (about an inch long). It isn&#x27;t messy, is insanely easy to apply and one stick lasts me about 6-8 months. It retains the \\&quot;hold\\&quot; all day without leaving a slimy, gelled look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many things, this is by far the best. Can&#x27;t find it in stores, have to order off Amazon.</li>
    <li> love it! good quality product that works great! a staple in my hair care collection. love love love love love</li>
    <li> It was very easy to get my wax, it came in a 2 pack and was delivered very quickly. I have done this several times and have always had a good experience.</li>
    <li> The real stuff, and for a much cheaper price than buying at the salon. The only place where I could find it cheaper would be an Armstrong McCall, but you have to have a stylist&#x27;s license or be registered under someone&#x27;s name that has a license.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair wax for a few years now. This purchase was a replacement/refill. I have fairly short hair and I dab this on to keep it from lying flat - makes it a little spiky. It works great for that. My negatives about it would be that it rubs off when it comes into contact with other things, like sunglasses on top of your head (sometimes they&#x27;re smeared when I put them back on) or hats, etc. Also, the way you extend it as you use it is to push a sort of plunger from the bottom. It doesn&#x27;t hold, so as you use it up, you have to hold the plunger with one of your fingers or it slides all the way in. I wish it had a twist to extend it, like a tube of chapstick, but I like the product, anyway!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stick for years.  My hair is thick and when it is short, it tends to stick up everywhere.  A few years ago, I was looking to deal with this problem but without giving my hair a wet, slicked back look or a crunchy feel.  This is the perfect hair product for men in this situation.  It&#x27;s small, easy to use, and it lasts FOREVER.  I use it almost every day and I probably only replace it annually at most--that&#x27;s way better than most waxy hair products.  Scent is also very pleasant and mild and not feminine.  Yes, it may seem a bit pricey for what it is, but given the quality and longevity of the hair stick, it&#x27;s totally worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I have baby fine short hair that nothing seemed to work on until I found this - and I have tried ALOT of products over the years that were supposed to be designed to add volume and hold a style!! You only need a little bit but it adds volume and keeps my hair styled all day long!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years.  It smells great - it holds really well - simply awesome.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product never found a good alternative for this product that works.</li>
    <li> My son has been using this product since it was first introduced. He loves it! It is always on his &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; for birthday and holiday gifts!</li>
    <li> Love this hair stick.  keeps my hair in place and looks great!</li>
    <li> I simply cannot get enough of this. I search for the best price- but this product is to die for.</li>
    <li> Works great on my flat top.  Not sticky or gooey and easy to comb through.  Lasts almost a whole year.</li>
    <li> great price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Why are they phasing this out? It&#x27;s awesome! Easy to use, travels great and works!I hope they have a new alternative</li>
    <li> Pretty much the only product that lasts in my short curly hair love it</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. If they ever discontinued it I would seriously consider shaveing my head and going bald. It seriously trumps all other products I have tried. It has a great hold without being stiff and I honestly have never found another product like it.</li>
    <li> This is the best price for this product! More than a 50% savings based on the price in the beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> The only problem with this product is you can feel it in your hair until the next day. It&#x27;s a little thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use on longer hair, it tends to make your hair look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product for styling very short hair.</li>
