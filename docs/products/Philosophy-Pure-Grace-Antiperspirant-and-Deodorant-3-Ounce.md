      <li>The fragrance is light and not overpowering, it is a great way to have a good smell and not be doused in perfume.</li>
      <li>so I had to try the deodorant, love it!</li>
      <li>I like Amazing Grace much better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s antiperspirant quality is fair, there are much better products available.</li>
      <li>he said this deodorant works better than the one I use......</li>
      <li>I love all of the Philosophy products</li>
      <li>I will surely buy it again.</li>

      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>So many compliments throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I used to purchase Philosophy products from QVC, but the cost of shipping and handling is more to my liking from the seller on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, the antiperspirant aspect works for my body chemistry.</li>
      <li>Besides the wonderful, light scent; it doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts under the arms like I&#x27;ve had with many other deodorant/antiperspirants.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant smells wonderful until you put in on and are active.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t pay attention that it was Pure Grace because I was looking for Amazing Grace but</li>
      <li>Always clean smelling and works just fine as a deodorant.</li>
      <li>It has a clean just shower scent.</li>
      <li>It is a clean, not over powering scent.</li>
      <li>I love the clean, soap-and-water fragrance of Pure Grace; it isn&#x27;t clawingly sweet at all.</li>
      <li>The deodorant fragrance has not dissipated in the container; it smells as fresh and clean as when I received it.</li>
      <li>While I wear Amazing Grace perfume occasionally, I mostly wear other perfumes.</li>
      <li>Working as a cosmetics counter person at Nordstrom back in the day; I of course tried many different products and would have to say this was by far one of my best finds.</li>
      <li>I continue to use the product but unfortunately can no longer enjoy the wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>It had a fresh scent as well.</li>
      <li>so the price is worth it.</li>
      <li>I truly love it...never want to go back to drugstore deodorant.</li>
      <li>, love the soft scent, it does not leave a white or sticky residue on my garments and it really works better than most other deodorants I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>#34;made for a woman in mine strong enough for a man&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>so it is actually comparable to super market brands.</li>
      <li>and I live in Florida so that is saying something.</li>
      <li>While on vacation my husband left his deodorant; I told him to use my Pure Grace for the weekend.</li>
      <li>one so far,</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to my sensitive sinus like regular perfume.</li>
      <li>Love Pure Grace products and scent, this product was a disappointment.</li>

<li> Since the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product over ten years ago - I was addicted.</li>
<li> The deodorant fragrance dissipated in the container within only a few days.</li>
<li> However it is not a strong enough deodorant to keep away the ugly odor from heavy sweat, so I wear it on easy work days.</li>
<li> I have purchased this product at least five times over the last few years.</li>
<li> It is dry, crumbly and hard to apply and does not work.</li>
<li> I usually like Philosophy items, but this is not worth the price.  </li>
<li> The shipping seem to be a little slow.</li>
<li> And a lot less expensive buying it here than going to Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> It had a weird fragrance once I was wearing it for a few hours.</li>
<li> I am addicted to this fragrance.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to find so</li>
<li> I thought spending 18 dollars plus shipping was way too expensive...</li>
<li> I will be very sad when and if they ever stop making this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> While on vacation my husband left his deodorant; I told him to use my Pure Grace for the weekend. It has a clean just shower scent. He push back that&#x27;s a ladies deodorant. I said just try it...&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the trip he said this deodorant works better than the one I use...... I&#x27;m keeping this; please buy some for me. LOL!!&lt;br /&gt;I know this phase has been taken but it fits; &amp;#34;made for a woman in mine strong enough for a man&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I thought spending 18 dollars plus shipping was way too expensive...but this is the best anti-persperent deodorant I have ever used. It lasts all day long and I live in Florida so that is saying something. Plus it lasts for about 3 months. I  would have to buy 3 or4 regular products...so the price is worth it. I love all of philosophy&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> The scent is heavenly and leaves my clothes smelling better than when I put them on.  Besides the wonderful, light scent; it doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts under the arms like I&#x27;ve had with many other deodorant/antiperspirants.  And it works.  I truly love it...never want to go back to drugstore deodorant.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this fragrance. I have purchased this product at least five times over the last few years. Always clean smelling and works just fine as a deodorant. I also use the lotion, shower cleanser and perfume. It is pricey, but love,love,love it. So many compliments throughout the day. People have commented that they like to visit my office because it smells so good in there. Try it you&#x27;ll like,no love it!!</li>
    <li> This is a very great product who protect and don&#x27;t stain your shirts or t shirts!  It&#x27;s difficult to find so once you find it get as many as you can</li>
    <li> GREAT DEORDORANT, BUT NO ONE SEEM TO HAVE IT IN STOCK ANYMORE.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product! I love, love the soft scent, it does not leave a white or sticky residue on my garments and it really works better than most other deodorants I have ever tried.  Since the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product over ten years ago - I was addicted. Working as a cosmetics counter person at Nordstrom back in the day; I of course tried many different products and would have to say this was by far one of my best finds. I will be very sad when and if they ever stop making this product.</li>
    <li> I have no sweating underarms. It last way longer than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Best one so far, because I tried a lot of the others but cant compare to this one. I will not be using none but this one. Does the job for me</li>
    <li> I love all of the Philosophy products so I had to try the deodorant, love it! It is amazing!! Works really good</li>
    <li> I usually like Philosophy items, but this is not worth the price.  It is dry, crumbly and hard to apply and does not work. At the end of the day it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I Love the Philosphy  line of products. I used the Grace body wash and spray cologne so the deodrant was a no brainer. The layering effect help to allow alonger lingering the scent. It is a clean, not over powering scent. I will surely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Works great, smells great.</li>
    <li> And a lot less expensive buying it here than going to Macy&#x27;s.  One tube lasts over three months so it is actually comparable to super market brands.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is light and not overpowering, it is a great way to have a good smell and not be doused in perfume. It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to my sensitive sinus like regular perfume. However it is not a strong enough deodorant to keep away the ugly odor from heavy sweat, so I wear it on easy work days.</li>
    <li> Love Pure Grace products and scent, this product was a disappointment. The deodorant fragrance dissipated in the container within only a few days. I continue to use the product but unfortunately can no longer enjoy the wonderful scent. It&#x27;s antiperspirant quality is fair, there are much better products available.</li>
    <li> Although there have been complaints about the faintness of the scent, I personally don&#x27;t want my deodorant to over power my perfume. While I wear Amazing Grace perfume occasionally, I mostly wear other perfumes. Most importantly, the antiperspirant aspect works for my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> A great anti-perspiration product  which  I use daily. It keeps the armpits dry and it doesn&#x27;t flake with is a big plus! It had a fresh scent as well.</li>
    <li> The shipping seem to be a little slow. I didn&#x27;t pay attention that it was Pure Grace because I was looking for Amazing Grace but that wasn&#x27;t the seller fault. I like Amazing Grace much better.</li>
    <li> I love the clean, soap-and-water fragrance of Pure Grace; it isn&#x27;t clawingly sweet at all. My experience is different than another reviewer. The deodorant fragrance has not dissipated in the container; it smells as fresh and clean as when I received it. I used to purchase Philosophy products from QVC, but the cost of shipping and handling is more to my liking from the seller on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells wonderful until you put in on and are active. It had a weird fragrance once I was wearing it for a few hours.</li>
