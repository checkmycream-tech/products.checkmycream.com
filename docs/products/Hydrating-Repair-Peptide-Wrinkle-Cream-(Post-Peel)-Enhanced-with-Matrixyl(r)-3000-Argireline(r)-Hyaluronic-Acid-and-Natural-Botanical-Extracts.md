<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used many different products that costs an average of $100-$150 per for a moisturizer.  My sister gave me a jar to try and I was very skeptical... It was too cheap to be a good moisturizer. Then I gave it a try. I didn&#x27;t notice anything right away. It took about couple of weeks to see the visible difference in the skin texture. My skin looked more hydrated. I use it not only on my face but all over my neck and chest area. It&#x27;s very light but it get absorbed very quickly into the skin. It feels like pouring water into the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that works for me. It works miracles! It takes cracked dry skin and helps it glow :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 5 months and absolutly love it. Skin is smoother and fine wrinkles have diminished.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and used together with their peels keeps skin soft and receptive to products that insure healthy dewy skin.  I have reordered several times.  Very dry here but even though this is light ...it works really well.  I love it..and it does smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is sold as a cream. when I used it I was holding container at a slight angle and a third of the lotion poured out! I was so upset. I closed it immediately and then I shook it for two minutes. It seemed a little firme but still not a cream. I think that the product is either old or defective. As far as the product..it seemed ok.not great. Similar to using ponds cold cream.would not reccomend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I contacted seller.never got a response.</li>
    <li> Left skin feeling hydrated and moisturized.  Smell nice and feel silky on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is a great wrinkle cream when used with the Salicylic peel and exfoliating cleanser.  I&#x27;ve never used a more effective system before.  The peel will be the foundation that makes it work and then the cleanser and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you are using a separate sunscreen when you peel, otherwise you will have a mess on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little pricey but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Very happy, not heavy or perfumed as described in effect. Only used a couple of weeks with good results, plan to give as holiday gift</li>
    <li> The is a great product and it does what it says.  I have been using with Retina A and I have not had redness or peeling since I started using. It is a nice light cream that works great under makeup and at night.  It keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works....results after two weeks</li>
    <li> good cream for after chem peels as promises, but feel the peptide percentages are too low to be effective. This cream is also oil free which is great for combination or oily skin, but for those with dry skin you will have to layer it with another product.</li>
    <li> I have used the glycolic and lactic acid peel from perfect image since November. I recently added hydra repair wrinkle cream to the routine and this stuff works! I am 51 and have tried botox twice and filler once (about 5 years ago). The procedures only provided a quick fix and my complexion  was still dry and crepey. I was putting bandaids on a broken leg. Useless! I peeled at 30% once a week for 3-5 minutes then after 8 weeks I went to twice a month. I catch My man staring at me smiling more often and he can&#x27;t stop touching my face :)&lt;br /&gt;I look younger now than late 30&#x27;s. These products will be in my cabinet forever.</li>
    <li> Great lotion..did a lot of research before purchasing it..I am happy I I found this one..it is perfect for my skin</li>
    <li> I love this cream! It&#x27;s great for cold climate. And for my oily and sensitive cream. Use it as a daily moisturizer during winter. Will continue to order</li>
    <li> great moisturizer for the peels. nice texture, very clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Day 3 of using this product and really like the way it feels.  I have also applied to one hand to see if there are any changes and I must say the one hands appears to look better then the other (less wrinkles). It&#x27;s to bad it contains alcohol I would love to use it with my High Frequency facial.</li>
    <li> I love this cream as it delivers exactly what it promises. It&#x27;s perfect to use for speedy skin repair after a chemical peel or after sun exposure. I also use it each morning and night, and I cannot believe how much my complexion has improved. I would recommend this product to teenagers and /women of all ages!</li>
    <li> This has become my go to moisturizer-and now my husband uses it, too!  Very light, non-greasy (even in summer) no breakouts-just great moisture.  I have had several compliments on my skin since using this cream.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s very light, and you do not need much to hydrate your skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers from high - to low end brands, and this product is the only one that doesnt break me out or give me that oily look.</li>
    <li> I repeatedly ordered this product, considering the moisturizing aspect wonderful for a mature woman.  I generally use as a night cream and skin feels great in the morning.</li>
    <li> my face loves this stuff! this is really great for dry skin. i use it at night right before i go to  bed.</li>
    <li> The first day put it on feels good. But used it for a week break me out :(&lt;br /&gt;Now I stop it to see if it&#x27;s breaking me out.</li>
    <li> First of all, it has fragrance. Perfumy. Second of all, after application it remains on the surface, and tacky to the touch.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this product. That rarely happens. Product is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Used other products that cost much more and didn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt; Easily applied lasts a long time.  Not greasy. Excellent ingredients for the price. Hydrates well.</li>
    <li> Did not work out for me.  I had a breakout immediately.  Will not purchase again or recommend. I purchased Derma -E (all natural) anti-wrinkle cream w/peptides-wonderful results!!!</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well and I was very satisfied with the results. The product did make my skin feel a lot smoother.</li>
    <li> This helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines while reviving my dry skin leaving it feeling smooth and rehydrated .</li>
    <li> I love this product, it leaves your skin feeling very soft and smooth and is very light on your skin.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy, absorbs quickly, feels nice on my skin.  Love the matte finish it gives.  Maybe making me breakout a little, but overall skins looks better.  Hopefully not my imagination!!</li>
    <li> Very good cream. Love the smell of it, too.</li>
    <li> I have use this for sometime and love it. IT is on the higher price side for the size. But does give wonderful results.</li>
    <li> Great cream, smooth and pleasant on skin, plumped my skin up over the weeks of use. Read lots of article metrixyl 3000 and seems to be a confirmed collagen booster!</li>
    <li> This does a fabulous job of relaxing wrinkles cause by expressions, forehead, crows feet etc. I preferr unscented products but while the fragrance is noticable it fades quickly. I have oily skin and this does not leave my feeling like a greasy mess.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that I am female, in my 40s with incredibly sensitive, dry skin. Anything and everything makes me break out. I&#x27;ve struggled to find products that help with aging without giving me acne. This particular product has been a homerun for me and I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 18 months or so. My skin is noticeably younger using it (particularly in conjunction with the Perfect Image Glycolic Peel). So happy to have finally found a moisturizer that works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never invested in a nice face cream and let me tell you I&#x27;ll never use regular lotion on my face again. This stuff is amazing. It is super creamy, but feels so light on my face. A little dab goes a long way, I think this jar will last a while. I was really breaking out the past couple months and I needed a fix bad. I bought this along with the Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel and my face really has improved a 360 in just a week. I still have some acne scars and small bumps under my skin, but I have no doubt with repeated use it will look great. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or irritate, love this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product after the first time I used it!It helped to moisturize my skin after peels.It will start up with a little bit oily feeling after you just put it on,but within the massaging on your face in circles you will find out a big change which is the oily feeling disappeared and it turned out to be a hydrating feeling and make the skin feel even more better!!</li>
    <li> My skin looked good and felt much softer after using this lotion. However, I will not purchase the lotion again and the only reason for it is its smell. It was so strong (and in my case it was unpleasant) that I ended up using the lotion on my feet because I was getting nauseous with the smell if I used it on my face or even on my hands.</li>
    <li> I had been previously paying over a hundred dollars for a cream in Australia. This cream is better, its awesome. I will continue to purchase it indefinitely. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase so that says it all.Being in the skin care industry I felt it my duty to add a few words to my review. This was a random purchase, was looking for some peels for my office.&lt;br /&gt;So as advised I picked this moisturizer too.&lt;br /&gt;To my pleasant surprise I was quite impressed by its firstly texture , and how it felt on my skin . It&#x27;s a moisturizer that does not have any perfumes and secondly felt light &amp; dewy. I liked the way my skin felt the next few days as I am quite a critic of all those products with Empty promises( seen enough of them in my 23 yrs of practice). We have a few great products in our office which have gone through trials and errors and eventually have been around for the last 6/7 years for acne and pigmentation but truly not found a good moisturizer for dry skin which could be for daily uses . I am not sure if I could suggest this for acne prone skin but as of now its been good for my skin . ( just as a moisturizer )but I can&#x27;t say much for fine lines and wrinkles like I have noticed a few reviews out here... Lets see how the second round goes , I shall keep u all updated. My concerns are dry dehydrated skin with fine lines esp during winters so hopefully the second jar addresses the other issues too.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this product for a while before writing a review. Its been about a month now and this cream is absolutely amazing. It goes on the skin very smoothly. It is very light with a lovely scent, and it does not feel greasy or oily. This will be a staple in my skin regimen since I will continue to use the peels from Perfect Image.</li>
    <li> Very good product  made face feel smooth and silky liked this product would recommend this produce if looking for good wrinkle cream</li>
    <li> Normal is not bad, not great, but good moisturizer and smell ... I thought it was the best ... but it&#x27;s not bad anyway ...</li>
    <li> I like this cream it has a nice fresh scent that I enjoy each time I use it. Its very soothing and makes my skin feel smooth but not greasy. I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my skins appearance but its moisturizing and I would probably re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I alternate between the lactic acid and tca peels from Perfect Image (love them both!) and use this immediately after. I have extremely oily skin but the tca peel causes a decent amount of flaking (which is great since I&#x27;ve had peels at my derm&#x27;s office that don&#x27;t produce this effect). This cream is amazing! Soothing, not even a tiny bit greasy, and skin is glowing in the morning. I&#x27;m so thrilled with this cream that I now use it every night as part of my skin care routine, not just post peel!</li>
    <li> Very hydrating without causing any breakout or acne..great to use after any type of peel,or on dry/combination skin type.worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of weeks and my sensitive skin seems to love it. For moisturizing and no perfumes or unnecessary additives and a great price!</li>
    <li> Excellent skin cream to use post chemical peels. This cream did not cause breakouts and absorbed well into the skin.  It feels lightweight and I can wear it alone or under make-up.  Have seen great results and will definitely repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs quickly and I get no &#x27;breakouts&#x27; from it. It does exactly what it says it will do; I saw a change within a few weeks. My skin is very sensitive and this cream is as gentle as a baby&#x27;s lotion; it&#x27;s the best. I really think that if you give it a try, you too, will become as big a fan as I.</li>
    <li> Being a professional in this industry for ten years ive come across hundreds of products, a small percentage capture my commitment. The Peptide Repair Cream absolutely has surpassed my expecations. It smells wonderful and feels nice and light on the skin but incredibly hydrating. I use on all my clients now after their skin care services</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample to try out.  I didn&#x27;t realize that this cream is specifically marketed for people who had had a peel done.  I have not had this procedure done.  It is fairly thick, more like a gel then a cream. It goes on your skin fairly thick as well. Feels cool and soaked into my skin well.  I have very dry skin.  I need a pretty heavy moisturizer to keep my skin healthy.  I had no trouble absorbing this cream.  However if you have oily skin then it may be a problem.  It did not feel greasy or heavy on my skin.  I think this a pretty good product.  I can&#x27;t speak to how it works after a peel though.</li>
    <li> I have been using Perfect image products for 6 months now and really love them. This is the second bottle I have purchased and it is almost gone...luv the stuff, not stinky or greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t make me breakout or anything.  Luv it</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. I only use it after peel but I am very happy with it. I choose organic stuff for daily use but for a few days after my peels this stuff is GREAT!  I wish it had less chemicals but I will take the good with the bad.</li>
    <li> I bought the Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream and am very satisfied with the results! Skin is much smoother around the eyes and not greasy! Will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 12, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still really satisfied the product! Use it twice a day and wrinkles are much less apparent and skin healthy looking. Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I have no problems with this item. It seems to hydrate nicely. I use it nightly as well as post peels.</li>
    <li> I just got it and have used it about three times.  How would I know?</li>
    <li> This is the first anti aging cream that doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to burn and water and I can actually notice faster healing of my skin.</li>
    <li> This was ok. Second time I tried it. I don&#x27;t think it is any better than many creams with a much lower price. Didn&#x27;t seems to moisture much.</li>
    <li> I love theis after a peel!!! I think the healing products are great, and sometimes a peel goes dep and you sure do not want infection. If I do burn I use extra first aid kit iodoine.</li>
    <li> Perfect for after peels or any time. Won&#x27;t irritate, and is super light, soft, and nongreasy. I use argan oil at night but this during the day and have super soft skin after using a pumpkin peel.</li>
    <li> I have never had a cream like this, after having put it on the night before, and waking up with my face feeling completely hydrated and new. The smell is wonderful- clean, fresh, and the quality of the cream is one of the highest I have ever used. You can just feel the cleanliness of it. It is absolutely AMAZING, especially after using the gel face wash and toner. I will never use any other line other than this one. So thankful for such a great facial product, that I know is trustworthy in the ingredients</li>
    <li> I have used many face creams, from the cheaper ones to the more expensive. I like this product the best.  I especially like that it goes on very lightly, is not greasy, but still moisturizes as well as, if not better, than the heavier or thicker face creams.  I am on my second jar now and will continue using this product for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problems with acne or breakouts of any kind from this product.  I am 58 years old, and know that nothing short of surgery is going to take away the wrinkles I&#x27;ve accumulated.  But this product does seem to minimize them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I loved Skin Science&#x27;s product [[ASIN:B0069YCYB4 COQ10, Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl 3000 and Argireline Cell Repair Concentrate Serum..Boost Collagen, Repair Cells, Tighten and Smooth Wrinkles]]and had great results.  Unfortunately, after several months I developed a reaction to it and had to give it up.  I missed how great my skin looked and went looking for something with the same ingredients.  I came across this and I am so happy I did.  Since it says it is for recovering from a skin peel I hoped I could avoid a reaction.  No adverse effects and I see the same great results using it as a regular face product. It is more a lotion than a serum so it is more pleasant going on.  After a couple of weeks my skin has the fresh, healthy look I missed.  The one ingredient this doesn&#x27;t share with the skin science product seems to be COQ10.  However, on my doctor&#x27;s advice I&#x27;ve been using a vitamin C cream at night for a year and I think that probably provides the same benefit as COQ10.</li>
    <li> It is watery, not heavy and sticky, and feels good.  After using strong chemical peel, it helps a lot to reduce appearance of dry skin that is about to be peeled.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I use after a peel. have no idea if it works great but hey it didnt make me break out nor did it clog my pores, for that alone its a great product. But seems hydrating. Alternate with Hyaluronic acid.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel like this was very moisturizing, nor did I see an improvement on my skin vs. any other lotion. (Yes, I followed the directions) For the price, I would have expected better, but honestly, I feel like I get better moisturizing results with cetaphil cream or even just plain ol&#x27; petroleum jelly. It isn&#x27;t bad, but because it&#x27;s a bit more on the spendy side, I&#x27;m only giving this two stars since I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can compare this cream with creams that cost +$100, why pay more when you can save some money, and get the same results.</li>
    <li> Love this cream, not greasy, nice fragrance, and  softens well. highly recommend to anyone wanting a smoother softer face without paying a ridiculous price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My newest shipment was horrible. I opened the jar and it poured out on the counter. It is the consistency of milk. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE it , I use it after I sonically wash my face and it feel like heaven . Thank you !</li>
    <li> I am a 41 yo male, my skin is a bit oily and light brown.&lt;br /&gt;I was using Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream regularly at night before bed for a bit more than 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;I just have 1 or 2 wrinkles between my eyebrows what seem to be diminishing or at least not getting bigger. So honestly can not say I noticed a bit change with this product.&lt;br /&gt;There is no miracle cream, it is many factors: the way we eat, how much water we drink, how well we sleep, sun exposure, genetics, smoking, etc. what influence the way our skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;First time I bought it, read some reviews and seemed to me this was the best option because of the components in it.&lt;br /&gt;What I know about how ingridients are listed in labels is that they are depending on the way they are most present, so check that because Hyaluronic acid is almost in the middle and could not identify Matrixyl and Argireline (mabe they have a different name?)&lt;br /&gt;Well label is not clear to me, but at least there is a list of the ingredients (have you noticed that some expensive brands they do not show the content?), besides this cream smells like flowers wich personaly do not like it.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up buying another option here in Amazon wich by the way has no label but says contains 60% Hyaluronic acid (Elings Dream) lets see if this works better, at least does not smell and feels real good over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Something very important: A great exfoliator is BASIC! if your skin has a lot of dead cells over even the best prduct will not have a gret effect (check this:Cure Natural Aqua Gel 250ml).&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps you.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my Mama to use after the peel procedure. My Mama used it after she did the peel, and said she would continue using it on a regular base as an every day hydrating cream.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to purchase it for myself today.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, absorbs right away, and my skin feels soft. Great price too. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok.  I was expecting something a little more light.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone; better than some others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> This is my first time reviewing a beauty/skin care product. Usually nothing really stands out to me. However,I was looking for a good eye cream that had the argiireline for my crow&#x27;s feet . I am in my mid-forties and have Asian skin. This product isn&#x27;t sold as just an eye cream but I thought I would try it anyway. Well, I have used it all over my face and as an eye cream the past two weeks and it has worked better than any eye cream I have tried. With the other creams, which have included to over the counter products such as L&#x27;Oreal to more expensive brands such as Clinique and Lancôme, I have had to reapply midday because my crow&#x27;s feet would reappear. However, with this cream the effect has lasted the whole day. And when I use it as a night cream, when I wake up, my eye area looks brighter. I am very satisfied with the results so far because not only did I save money because I didn&#x27;t have to buy separate products for my face and eye cream but I finally found something that has helped my crow&#x27;s feet. It has also helped with a few dry spots around my lips.I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of pricey in my opinion, but it&#x27;s worth it. My skin instantly feels less inflamed. It soaks in and my skin looks so wonderful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream to use after peels.  As advertised, it is gentle and soothing enough to use immediately after a peel to ease the burn.  I also like it for general use since it is lightweight with no oily sheen and absorbs quickly.  This isn&#x27;t a special effects cream with &#x27;brighteners&#x27; or &#x27;blur&#x27; technology so it might not knock your socks off when you first apply it.  Rather it&#x27;s the type that works inside and makes your skin feel really really soft.  I like to alternate between several products and this is a nice part of the mix.</li>
    <li> But does not deliver everything promised.  It&#x27;s an ok cream, but I rather use it something that helps me maintain a more youthful complexion, like artistry.</li>
    <li> I did not see any thing from this cream.  It is way to thin &amp; does not feel like you have any thing on your face.  I only bought this so I could buy the Derma Roller, this cream was not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a light cream. Clean light fragrance which is so minimal my husband is comfortable wearing it. I use this at night before I go to bed or after an at-home peel. The only problem is the jar is too small! A little goes a long ways. People are always complimenting how young my husband looks and how he has no wrinkles-He&#x27;s 67 yo and passes for 55 yo. I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s and look 40&#x27;s. Definitely worth it! We live in Hawaii so our skin gets a weathered beating. During the day we use ROC product with sunscreen and evening time we use this wrinkle cream. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer overall. I purchased this to use post-peel but found that I liked it so much that I use it every evening over my regular retinol treatment. I found that using this in combination with my retinol night cream prevents my skin from becoming flakey and prevents dryness. Love this!! Also, the price point is amazing for what the product offers-would recommend highly!!</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the salicylic gel cleanser and salicylic gel peel.  The combination of all three has changed my skin!  I love this product and recommend it to anyone with problematic skin!</li>
    <li> It smells very nice, but really doesn&#x27;t do anything that a cheaper moisturizer would do.</li>
    <li> This was too smelly for me to use so I gave it to my sister.  I don&#x27;t&#x27; understand why they make things that go next to your nose with such a strong perfume smell.  It also conflicts with your own perfume choice.  Nasty.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product really works well for my skin type.  It is very light and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This product moisturize the skin after peal or darma roller.&lt;br /&gt;I used several products for after peel treatment, but this one was the most effective once so far.</li>
    <li> I am in my fifties and people always ask me &amp;#34;what do you use on your Skin!&amp;#34; My husband was stealing mine so I got him his own for his very sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Nice cream that goes smoothly, without greasy feeling, I  think it tightens up skin a little bit. I am 48 with moderately fair skin. If you are looking for a magic elixir of youth, I haven&#x27;t found one, but this little cream makes skin feel good, does not puff out skin, and makes it smooth and a bit tighter. I am on my third jar, and will order more. It takes just a little dab for a night treatment, and goes a long way. Probably lasts me 2-3 months to use once daily - I use a different cream in the morning. I think it is priced fairly for the quality.</li>
    <li> All the right ingredients- only need a small amount- very pleased. Will try other products from this line too.&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait!</li>
    <li> Great Product, not oily but enough moist to leave skin soft almost all day,&lt;br /&gt;This is more kinder than the Lactic Acid, it helps a lot, but gotta use it carefully case it burns</li>
    <li> Works great! I used it 2x daily. It didn&#x27;t give me a breakout that&#x27;s why I love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Pineapple Pumpkin Enzyme Skin Peel (you can read my review) and used that first.  After I washed the enzyme peel off my skin and applied the cream my skin felt incredibly soft and looked great!  The cream completely absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I actually started buying this for my Mom more than a year ago, and she still continues to use it up till this day. She says that the cream leaves her skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
    <li> This cream is very effective for dry skin, but a little goes a long way so use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product (and I&#x27;d purchase it again).</li>
    <li> I was looking for cream with peptides as ingredients, as my dermatologist told me that peptides absorbed by skin fast.  So after reading the reviews, I decided to give this cream a try and am extremely happy with it.  The cream absobed really fast, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky/oily feeling thereafter, it makes my skin really hydrated as if I have just splashed it with plenty of water.  I love the fresh smell as well, it is not overpowering.  Love it!  Linda Budi</li>
    <li> I ordered that cream after I lost weight due to stress and sickness. I thought I aged of 10 years in 6 months. I&#x27;m just amazed! Light scented, non greasy and quick to give me back a healthy and younger skin. Just great. I clean my face, apply that cream in the morning...and all day I look younger. Just amazing! Im 51 and look 10 years younger. Great for the neck too! 40+ &#x3D;&amp;#62; I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer during the winter and after my weekly TCA peels. I currently use the Salicylic acid cleanser and the 15% TCA Peel with Salicylic acid. These products are wonderful. Most moisturizers break me out, but this one has never given me one pimple. It absorbs into the skin very easily and is non-fragrant.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my skin in fact is caused some acne so I stopped using it. When I was using it after 4 weeks as directed I did not notice any improvements or positive changes only change was some acne.</li>
    <li> I used better brands, this is low quality and does&#x27;nt work like they say</li>
    <li> Use this nightly and seems to work ok</li>
    <li> Great product - so moisturizing. My skin feels like a baby&#x27;s bum. And appreciate the quick response to my order concerns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, so writing about a moisturizer is a little out of character for me, but if you are hemming &amp; hawing about whether or not this skincare buy is worth it, I have to say yes. I took a chance on this product because I wanted something with hyaluronic acid, Matrixyl 3000, &amp; argiriline all in one package. All I have to say is --- Wow! I really do like this product. Not greasy, no flowery smell, &amp; very hydrating. For me, having an odorless moisturizer is a big plus. Do you know how hard it is for a guy to find a top end moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make him smell like cold cream or rosewater? I will be buying it again. Honestly, after a couple of weeks, my skin&#x27;s texture has improved noticeably. Maybe it&#x27;s just that I was being consistent with application, but I can tell there is a difference. If you are expecting this to make you look 20 years younger or like you just got a facelift, you are just being unrealistic. As a general use product that does what it says, though, it is well worth the money. Extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make me break out. Feels nice and worked after I had dermal abrasion (sand your face) and laser resurfacing (burn your face) done without the sting. I live in a very dry climate -- Utah, similar to Vegas. Good Stuff, bought it a few times.</li>
    <li> bought as remedy for sun damage, works impressively well, but must but &amp; use consistently or wrinkles reappear, (26 yrs old, Florida resident whole life)</li>
    <li> Here is the place to go to find out any and all info on skin, collagen production, creams, products From Doctors, surgeons, etc... :    [...]    Now with that said, do you own research. This is a wonderful site with unbiased Doctors opinions.  I have to use the above Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream  at least 20 times/words as Amaz*on states..please bear with me.  Below you will find sniplets off the site regarding collagen production:    [...]  Beware of claims by manufacturers about reducing wrinkles or stimulating collagen  Unfortunately, claims like these are made by numerous manufacturers without any scientific or factual evidence behind them. Topical argireline, hyaluronic acid, or matrixyl do not prevent or reduce wrinkles and likely don&#x27;t stimulate collagen production. Most over-the-counter \\&quot;creams\\&quot; only provide moisture to the the superficial layer of skin and have little other benefits.    +11  As you age the following things take place in your skin:   1. The amount of collagen produced is diminished and the type of collagen changes from a more youthful type of collagen to an older type of collagen. The production of collagen never ends.   2. The Elastin in your skin decreases in content as well as production. But it also does not completely stop being produced.   3. The Melanin granules (color/pigment in your skin) in the upper layers of your skin coalesce into pocket, we call them freckles, sunspots or brown spots.   4. The cells of the skin age and more dead layers of skin pile up in the upper layers of the skin.   5. Skin cancer risks go up because of environmental influenced - sun, pollution.  What you can do to correct these problems:   1. Retin-A - increases collagen production, slows the loss of elastin, decreases the production of metalloproteases, cause the dispersion of melanin granules, reduces the rate of topical skin cancers, exfoliates the dead skin layers and improves acne as well. the down side to retin-a is complinace - you have tostart at a low concentration and move to the highest concentration as your skin allows.   2. Hydroquinone - Bleaches the sunspots and retards the production of melanin.   3. Sunblock- Zinc Oxide sunblock is the best. I sell EltaMD in my practice.   4. Alpha Hydroxy acid- does many of the same things as retin-a but not as effective. Can be used as a lunch hour peel at the doctors office - very effective at that dose. Better then microdermabrasion of photo facials.   5. Anti-oxidants - Cellex-C, Prevage or Revale are the best available.    The Archives of Dermatology.  The articles states: \\&quot;A recent review in The Archives of Dermatology concludes that three anti-aging treatments are proven clinically effective: the topical application of retinol; carbon dioxide laser resurfacing; and injection of hyaluronic acid, a moisture-retaining acid that occurs naturally in the skin  Retin-A  +8  KTLamb, I feel one of the easiest and least expensive ways to stimulate collagen synthesis in your skin is Retin-A. Retin-A is a form of Vitamin A which comes in creams and gels.  Exercise skin to produce collagen  +6  One sure way to produce collagen is to exercise the skin. By exercising the skin, we mean to exfoliate. By exfoliating, removing the surface layer of dead cells, the skin is shocked into production of new cells which helps stimulate new collagen production.. Exfoliate the skin to keep your skin in shape and producing new collagen.  Retin A, Glycolic Acid products, microdermabrasion and manual facial scrubs are all good ways to exfoliate the skin.    My practice offers products which have very effective anti-aging treatment ingredients, such as the NIA 24 skin care line. Products in this line are clinically shown to improve skin tone and texture.  At the risk of sounding TOO technical, one of the effective ingredients in NIA 24&#x27;s products is the 5% Pro-Niacin, which is a very potent anti-oxidant agent. This ingredient allows for conversion of Nicotinic Acid, which plays acentral role in energy metabolism. This process helps repair skin damage and promotes skin cell generation.  I agree with my colleagues below- Retin-A as part of a good, prescription level skin care program supervised by your Board Certified Plastic Surgeon or Dermatologist is a great start. Avoiding sun-worship and eating healthy/drinking lots of water are requisite to good skin health as well. Once you&#x27;ve followed these guidelines, further improvement is possible through skin resurfacing techniques.  In my practice I use the Mixto SX laser for skin resurfacing (but many good options exist) and have had great (often amazing) success improving the health and appearance of my patients skin, beyond what Retin-A and skin care had done. Over 3-4 months, the laser treatment leads to increased collagen production with improved firmness and tightness of the skin. Start with the basics- avoid the sun, drink lots of water, and consider a physician guided skin care program. Then, if you want more improvement ask about a laser like the Mixto    The two best things you can do to keep your skin youthful is to first use daily sunscreen that is broad-spectrum and blocks both UVA and UVB rays. Sun exposure (including tanning) causes the most damage to skin including loss of collagen and textural changes including wrinkling. The second is to refrain or quit smoking as this is the second most skin damaging thing you can do.  As far as treatments, a moisturizer with an antioxidant like Vitamin C and sunscreen is the best topical treatment you can apply. Retin-A (tretinoin) is available only by prescription in the US and is the only topical medication that has proven clinical benefits by stimulating collagen deposition and reducing fine lines. Botox or Dysport are both excellent options for treating and preventing wrinkles around the eyes and in the forehead due to facial expressions. I hope that helps. Best regards.    To answer some of the plastic surgeon&#x27;s questions above: there isboth a degradation of collagen and a decrease in the formation of new collagen. The sun and various toxins (pollution) form reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion, peroxides, and singlet oxygen (oxidants.) These oxidants damage DNA, cell membranes and most importantly collagen fibers. These reactive oxygen species increase matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), which breaks down collagen.  Many of us dermatologists feel that there is an inflammatory process taking place and anti-inflammatory agents are helpful along with antioxidants. This is controversial. Myself, I am in the above school of thought and feel antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents are both beneficial. Therefore, I recommend orally CoffeeBerry, Resveratrol, Pynogenol, Acai, green tea, Vitamin C (get the Ascorbyl Palmitate version), and Nicomide. These are all potent antioxidants.  An antioxidant is nothing more than a reducing agent (if you can remember your high school chemistry). The above ROS are all greedingly and aggressively looking for an electron. They try to grab one from the DNA or collagen. The antioxidant is a generous fellow and gladly gives one up, calming the ROS down and stabilizing the situation. I also believe that Oracea, Doxycycline 40 mg. a day, does well. In animal studies it substantially decreases the amount of MMP&#x27;s.  Topically: I agree with the above that Retin A is tried and true. I like Tazarac better. Our dermatology literature shows that Tazarac works a little better than Retin A. Differin o.3 has yet to be studied in a comparative trial.  OTC Retinol is not bad either. ROC makes a good and fairly stable one. The alpha-hydroxy acids are similarly tried and true, glycolic acid being the best. Neo-strata is a great brand.  Also, I must partially disagree with my colleagues above; While there is a lot of hype to other topicals, and skepticism is healthy here, I feel that dermatopharmacology has improved greatly and many of the ingredients, especially peptides and hyaluronic acid, are small enough molecules and can penetrate the epidermis. Without a lengthy discourse on peptides, I feel the carrier peptides which bring zinc and copper into the dermis can increase collagen production (Neova and Osmotics higher priced Neutrogena&#x27;s Visably Firm other end). Also the signaling peptides (when collagen breaks it spurs collagen production, hence the value of IPL and laser treatments; Collagen fragments are peptides; a signaling peptide signals the fibroblast to make more collagen!) can cause you to make collagen.  The much touted Strivectin (Better Than Botox...come on give me a break!) has Matrixyl, a signaling peptide as does the far cheaper Oil of Olay Regenerist. Hyaluronic acid products, if they are micronized (broken into molecular sized fragments), can penetrate the skin. They sit on top of the skin and make a great moisturizer and Bionect and Hylira are absorbed into the dermis and fill in your ground substance, the stuff that collagen baths in.  maintain skin thickness    To answer some of the plastic surgeon&#x27;s questions above: there is both a degradation of collagen and a decrease in the formation of new collagen.

    <li> I began using perfect images glycolic acid gel peel and felt that his would help with moisturizing. It didn&#x27;t do enough for me. Found myself using another less expensive moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very good! Scientifically based, no &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34;, like parabens. Will keep on using</li>
    <li> This is very nice, super hydrating. I haven&#x27;t used it after a peel yet, but I think it should be good for that. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream together with another products (serum and toner) and started to use them as a part of my daily routine. I got a lot of breakouts like if they were mosquito bites, the skin around my eyes got red and sensitive, I didn&#x27;t know which product caused this and I stopped using them. Then I started to try each product one by one and it came out it was this cream causing me such problem. When I read all negative reviews I understood that I&#x27;m not the only one having this kind of problem. Plus, I didn&#x27;t like the way the cream absorbs - my skin never had this feeling of moisture or softness, instead I felt like if my face was covered by a dry layer of glue. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream for over six months and I love it. I use it after washing my face&lt;br /&gt;and it leaves my face with a cool and smooth feeling. I use it in combination with another wrinkle cream. The two together&lt;br /&gt;are a power house at keeping my face wrinkle free. Our body chemistry is different one from another and it takes time finding the product or products that work well with your body&#x27;s chemistry. I hope this product will continue to be sold&lt;br /&gt;on the market</li>
    <li> Post-peel moisturizing is a definite must but every moisturizer I have ever used makes me break out-defeating the purpose (my main purpose) of the peel. I have not seen any increased break outs since using this product. It also does not leave a greasy or oily feel to my skin. I am almost out and will be ordering more today!</li>
    <li> This is terrific cream...doesn&#x27;t look all shiny on my face. It is great for after a peel...but you can use it other times as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. It has a very light fragrance, almost unnoticeable, and it has all the right ingredients to smooth and perfect an aging face. I don’t use the peel very often but I use this cream every night. I think you’ll see a difference in just a few days if not immediately.</li>
    <li> First time using this product, never heard of it before. Purchased it because based it seemed like a professional grade product. I have been using it for almost four weeks and it feels very good and my skin looks healthier and younger. Very good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every cream out there ... This one is very cheap in comparison to others and I have noticed a slight difference in my wrinkles.  It has only been a few months so perhaps I need to wait longer, but so far so good.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles from any cream so I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m disappointed, I&#x27;m just not totally impressed, never am with any product.  Aging just sucks!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of creams and usually change my facial cream with the seasons.  My skin will get used to one cream and then I need to change because it starts to dull my skin and not really work.  I found this cream worked in the summer and fall.  I haven&#x27;t used it in the winter but it is so rich I think it might work.  Finding a cream that works year round would be great.  It is rich, creamy and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. I would not post anything, but I felt the product and price was worth a quick comment.</li>
    <li> the first morning after i felt like i had baby skin.  buying 2nd jar today.  it is the greatest night cream</li>
    <li> I like this product because it smells good and feels good on my skin. It&#x27;s easy to apply at night. Now, does it work for wrinkles? I am still evaluating this product. Check with me in two months.</li>
    <li> This product is really helpfull for healing right after you had a chemcical peel. It really works plus it reduces the healing process. For example normally i take about 4-5 days to heal from my TCA 12% gel peel but when I used this it takes me about 2-3 days to heal. I love it the only problem is the price. It will start to add up if you where this everyday.</li>
    <li> This being my first foray into skin care products (I&#x27;m 32 and my girlfriend SUGGESTED I start moisturizing), I was unsure as to what I should expect. I ordered this along with the 30% glycolic acid peel, using the peel once a week and this cream twice a day (morning/evening before bed). The combination of these two products significantly reduced the age lines that were beginning to form around the corners of my eyes and gave my skin an overall more vibrant appearance and evened out my complexion. Again, I have little to compare this product with but for the money I was very, very pleased with my order. I&#x27;m writing this review because Perfect Image is offering a discount on a future order with completion of feedback. Seeing as how I will definitely be ordering from them again, this was a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> When  I used this product at the beginning period, it seemed too lighter  than I thought. However, the product is lighter, it does not irritate my face and I realize that my face is not drying out any more after using a few weeks later. Now I love this product. If someone has very sensitive and problematic skin, that will work for them just like working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  [[ASIN:B00700H128 Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]]</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It truly does make your skin feel like silk</li>
    <li> Im a real ingredient stickler. I like most of the products the Perfect Image has and this is one. I am always looking for a good moisturizer that does more than just wet the skin. I want the skin to be fed as well. I use this with alot of other serums and creams and it works quite well.</li>
    <li> great product will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over four months. I love the simple but powerful ingredients. I use it at night. I will keep ordering and using this cream. Makes my skin sooooo soft. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I use this product in the AM and PM after cleansing my face.  I have not had a face peel, but use it to keep my face moisturized.  I love the way it feels in my fingers and on my face.  It is a light moisturizer and not at all oily.  I use it under my make-up also.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect after peel moisturizer.  It feels light and silky, but is very rich and a little goes a long way.  I am prone to blackheads and oily skin but this stuff is very light and creeamy.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product line! Everything I have ordered I have loved and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great product for a very good price!!</li>
    <li> This cream is great for every day use but I especially like it after using the pumpkin peel. This product hydrates and helps my skin recover. I like the creaminess of the product and how easily it absorbs into my skin. I highly recommend this product and the peels.</li>
    <li> Hydrating Repair Peptited Wrinkle Cream is a light weight cream that makes my skin look and feel readiant!  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> This cream has a pleasant smell, is non-greasy and is easily absorbed into the skin.  I use this hydrating cream after a chemical peel with either lactic acid or glycolic acid and I continue to apply it daily for the next 2-3 days.  It makes my face nice and smooth and prevents my skin from drying out and flaking.  Between peels, I try and use this cream 1-2 times each week.  If my budget could afford it, I would use this as my daily moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> I would totally recommend this product for a post-peel moisturizer.  It really helps with the dryness after a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My skin felt very nourished. I love the texture and fine lines were reduced.</li>
    <li> i began using perfect images glycolic acid gel peel and felt that his would help with moisturizing.  It didn&#x27;t do enough for me.  Found myself using another less expensive moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing but still feels light on the skin.  I wore it after my TCA peel and have continued to use it as a night cream and around my eyes and mouth wherever I&#x27;m extra dry under my daily sun block.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for after a glycolic skin peel at lactic acid peel!</li>
    <li> At first I thought see some difference in my little wrinkles, but there is not a difference. Smell nice and leave my face soft and fresh but don&#x27;t work for the fine lines in my face. I like it as a regular face cream but not for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product. Lightening fast shipping and great discount! I also bought facial peel. Love it too! I am a licensed cosmetologist and very particular about the products I use.</li>
    <li> Love the product. It penetrates skin with no oily sensation. I feel my skin really hydrated.I&#x27;m using it dayly and it works for me</li>
    <li> The cream is okay but is not moisturizing enough.</li>
    <li> I have heard the ingredients in the cream work great for wrinkle prevention and repair. Works as a great moisturizer as well!</li>
    <li> Wonderful texture, silky smooth and it really helps calm my face post-peel. I will purchase again, and at the sale price, it&#x27;s very affordable for what you get.</li>
    <li> This product is a very nice hydrating cream that I use after I clean my face.  On my face, neck and breast area.  My skin is soft, smooth and it has a pleasant fragrance.  Just a very nice cream.</li>
    <li> This was another rip-off - am returning in the AM - after using for a week, got no visible results, only drying, flaky skin to an already dry condition</li>
    <li> It you know anything about facial care, peptides are vital to a successful regime. You don&#x27;t have to rob the bank either.</li>
    <li> Listen, I&#x27;m going to shoot this too you straight.  If you want a post peel face cream to dab on your face at a fairly reasonable price then this is your cream, keeping in mind, pretty much any face cream- cheap or expensive will do the trick.  You don&#x27;t need the post peel neutralizer- that&#x27;s 100% BS- if you want to neutralizer your face wash off the peel with cold water!  I&#x27;ve used this cream for a few months and I&#x27;ve not noticed anything change.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, the smell is faint and pleasant, it&#x27;s light and not heavy or greasy, and it has some &amp;#34;peptide&amp;#34; stuff in it so it kind of makes you think it&#x27;s gonna be just great haha but it&#x27;s not THAT great.  Again- I&#x27;ve been using it and I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely no change in texture of my skin let alone anything to do with fine lines or wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t believe this cream is good for wrinkles at all and it feels too light for it to really do any real moisturizing.  It think this is a fail face cream altogether.&lt;br /&gt;But like I said before, if you want a post peel face cream to cool off your face (not hoping it helps with wrinkles or any sun damage just something to slap on to cool you off) then this cream is perfect!  But then again so is ANY face cream you put on.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cream when Amazon was selling it for 14 bucks and I wouldn&#x27;t say it was worth the 14 I spent on it and it sure as heck is NOT worth the upped price of 29.99 lmao!  I&#x27;m sure it sold more jars of cream at 14 bucks than it will at 29.99.  I think that price, while still fairly reasonable when it comes to wrinkle cream, it&#x27;s a joke for this particular wrinkle cream.  SAVE YOUR MONEY this is a waste of time and hope.  What this really is, is a five dollar jar of cream they marked up to 14 and then jacked up to 30.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> We use this with the glycolic peel from Perfect Image.  They&#x27;re a great combination.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin soft without being sticky or greasy. This light but effective skin cream absorbs quickly into the skin and reduces inflammation.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful. Not at all greasy, absorbs quickly and no breakouts. This stuff does exactly what it says it will do. I saw a definite change within one week and after a month or so my large pores were almost nonexistent.  I have sensitive skin (to say the least) and after using almost two jars I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or rashes. As for as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s the best. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product! Tried once and use it all the time since that. It is very light and my skin feels so soft!</li>
    <li> It does not work what the manufacture is saying does. I have not noticed any improvement in my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product to use it after my first peel and I have been very happy with it. The cream left my skin soft, bright but not greasy. It has a nice texture that is easy to apply just by using a little bit and at the same time is friendly with your skin in case you have few breakouts. Highly recommendable!</li>
    <li> I use it along with  TCA 15% for peel .... It did not moisturize my skin but it helps in accelerate  peeling process to my skin in certain areas ... I may not going to use it any more</li>
    <li> This cream has not only become an essential component in my anti-aging arsenal, but one of my favorite skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my fair, hyper-sensitive complexion and having just turned 40, this cream delivers the perfect balance of hydration, calming botanicals and trusted active ingredients. The formula absorbs quickly and leaves no shine or sticky residue. It even wears well under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I believe many factors contribute to how gracefully we age, it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt to have a couple of tricks up your sleeve. Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream by Perfect Image is one of mine, and it costs a whole lot less than most others ;-)</li>
    <li> This is the first cream I&#x27;ve found that helps after laser treatments. I mix it with a moisturizing mask and let them both sit. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using Perfect Image products for several months now and really like this cream. I have oily skin but it hydrates and does not feel heavy or greasy. Will definitely reorder and would recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it makes my skin feel velvety.  I&#x27;m running low so I need to order more.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers I found to work well after peeling. Non-greasy yet effective. Absorbs fast. The only negative is that it runs out faster than I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> It has always been a challenge finding the perfect face cream. Too thick, not thick enough, pore blocking. I’ve finally found the RIGHT ONE. I have naturally oily skin, so most creams leave a horrible shiny gloss on my face unlike Hydrating Repair Wrinkle Cream from Perfect Image. I truly love this stuff. It offers all day hydration support. Skin hydration is very important for me, as I’m currently undergoing medically suggested facial laser hair removal. The procedures leave my skin very dry but the Hydrating Repair Wrinkle Cream brings it back to life.&lt;br /&gt;Friends are constantly saying how smooth my skin looks now. Amazing product and it leaves your skin feeling Awesome!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about a month and use it with some other \\&quot;new\\&quot; products so not sure if it is this, that or both but in any respect the sagging and overall texture of my skin has improved. Especially, the saggin around the mouth area.</li>
    <li> Before finding Perfect Image&#x27;s Peptide Winkle Cream with Matrixyl, Argireline, and Hyaluronic Acid, I used a well known \\&quot;doctor&#x27;s\\&quot; cream with the same ingredients that cost over $200. Never did I imagine this cream would work as well and feel as luxurious! The ingredients in this product truly work as a collagen enhancer and moisturizer. I am in my 50&#x27;s and have depended on products with&lt;br /&gt;Matrixyl, Argireline, and Hyaluronic Acid for years (I  constantly am told how beautiful my skin is) so I had standards for this product and it delivered all the way. I will buy it again and again. Wish they had it on auto-ship! I use it nightly after retinol. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy- for maximum results use nightly - not just after a peel.</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it after my shower, before bed.  It, plus a good exfoliation routine, has cleared up almost all my acne.  I don&#x27;t use it during the day as it makes my face feel a little greasy by noon.  I have not found a good daytime cream, but I would be willing to try another cream by this same company.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.  It&#x27;s very light weight and feels great on my skin.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any visable differences however, it is extremely hydrating just as the cream advertises.  I&#x27;m sure even bigger and better benefits are on their way.  I will continue to use and purchase this product!</li>
    <li> love this product , im so happy i found this , the value and the delivery is amazing. the cream is very smooth and the smell is great . I used to use other very expensive cream and now this is all i use im 40so i need to take care of my skin , this product is great for me, i think everybody should tried because is not expensive so is not too much to loose and im pretty sure you will see results</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this cream, because it has great reviews and good ingredients, but each time I used it (and I spaced usage by several days) my face would burn and brake out into kind of weird tiny hives/bumps (fortunately not very noticeable).  Also, if the cream was applied close to eyes, my eyelids would be slightly swollen in the morning.  These problems would disappear in a day or two, but reappear when cream was again applied.  Although typically my skin is not very sensitive, I cannot use this cream.</li>
    <li> The perfect image products are spectacular.  I&#x60;ve been using this product for 3 months and everybody is telling me how great my face looks and wriknle fee.</li>
    <li> I used Roc products for years.  Then, after an allergic reaction I started using La Mer products.  I was really happy with them.  The problem is now that I am retired, I decided to look for another product less pricey that would give me comparable results.  I tried a few others until I found this cream.  My face, neck and decollete feel wonderful.  It lasts me about three months. I really like it.  I will continue to buy this product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good moisturizing anti-wrinkle cream,At least when rub it on my face, very smooth, I use it has a week, on the face the feeling is very comfortable. It at least on my face feel.English is my second language, so only simple said.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the 3 main indregedients,  Matrixyl,HA and Argireline.  All of these products have been shown to be effective in helping  wrinkle/skin hydration or the production of collagen.  Just a little bit goes a long way,  I apply it to my problem areas like outer eyes, forhead,  upper lip and nasal labial folds.  It&#x27;s truly as if your skin drinks this in, the product disappears into the skin sooo easily.  For the daytime its great for layering on top of a serum...and before you apply your sunscreen.  At night, I apply it only to certain areas after I apply my retinol cream or matrixyl serum.  The smell is just sooo yummy, I dont know what I like better, the effects of the cream or the smell?  I plan on stocking up on this product, in case it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of background.....46yrs old but people always say that I look 10yrs younger, olive complexion, dry skin, loosing  fullness in my cheeks...some hyper pigemtation and sun damage visible, always looking to  add moisture to plump up the few static wrinkles I have...and trying to postpone the dynamic wrinkles from becoming static!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drugstore brands like Roc &amp; Neutrogena are good if your looking for mild retinol products.  I have used both product lines intermittantly for years, along with Strivectin and Retin A.  I have done at home beta hydroxy peels and facial pad peels like Avon Anew.  All of these products have helped me maintain a younger than my age appreance, thankfully!  However, as I get older, I realize  that my skin needs more than just mild retinol found in drgstore brands and yet I hate to pay triple the price for high end products.  Soooooo I did my share of research by Amazon-ing, You-tubing, and by visiting beauty or esthetician forums.  My best research has been learning from dermatologists by reading their opinions on current anti-aging treatments and asking my own Derm Dr for advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My research over these last few years has led to me look for products containing Peptides like Matrixyl, Matrixyl 3000, Hyaluronic Acid, Topical anti-oxidants C,E,  Tretinoin products from mild Retinols to pure Retin-A...Organic Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Grapeseed, Olive Oil, Vitamin E oil, oil cleansing, at home facials using honey, lemon, egg whites, buttermilk....and a few more premium store bought ingredients.... and a few really remarkable beauty tools like Palovia, Nu Face Trinity,  Aurora Light Therapy and an at home dermabrasion system.... .. and I still have more secrets....but I wont over-share,  wink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline, I buy things when I find the ingredients I am looking for and when it comes from a lesser known company, versus a high end product.  It doesnt take tons of money to look good,  just good habits, good ole common sense and some quality research.</li>
    <li> This cream is light and it really does reduce wrinkles. I have sensitive skin do I was a little worried but it did not bother my skin at all. I recommend this cream for anyone looking to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Ok but not as good as olay referents</li>
    <li> I use this after the salicylic or glycolic acid peel and it makes all the difference!  Calms my skin and makes it soft and smooth.  I also use it as a nighttime moisturizer pretty regularly because it does such a nice job.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Loved using this on my face after using the Pineapple Pumpkin Enzyme peel.  It is defiantly a must to have.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful!  It really helps in keeping your face moisurized after the peel (TCA 12% Gel-Peel) and stops my face from getting the super tight, if I smile I&#x27;ll crack feeling!  Highly recommend this!  I even use it as a daily moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> I am at the bottom of the jar and ready to order more!  Very pleasant smell and does the job.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing cream. Does not sting my sensitive skin or eyes. Noticed a difference in my skin within days. Fine lines around my eyes and lines in my forehead seem less noticeable. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of silky smooth skin and this is exactly what this product delivers.I alternate this product with the diary blue hydration masks for added moisture.This product is packed with the best topical properties on the market.I am a lifer of this moisturizer..</li>
    <li> I bought this hydrating cream after I had purchased their 50% lactic acid peel for added peptides and hydration. I think everyone should be putting peptides into their skin because its like reversing back the time and the damage you have created from your earlier years.....It is a great hydration without feeling too thick. I like it for a night cream and feels expensive.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream about two weeks ago following the skin peel treatment.  The first couple of times after I applied the cream, I did not notice any differences.  However, as my skin began to tighten up and dry out from the peel, I noticed the soothing feeling when applying this cream.  I like the pleasant smell of this cream.  It appeared to relief the burning sensation on my face as soon as I applied it.  Love it and will continue to use it with the peel treatment.</li>
    <li> I have been trying different anti-aging moisturizers to use after my glycolic acid facial wash, which peels my skin and leaves it dry. I have been using Peter Thomas Roth Mega Rich Intensive Anti-Aging Cellular Cream. It is expensive, but it leaves my skin moisturized, soft, and glowing. In hopes of finding something cheaper and something that provides more prominent anti-aging benefits, I tried Perfect Image Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel. However, I was not impressed. The cream is thin and it has given me a little acne. In addition, I cannot see a difference in the overall state of my skin. If I look at photos of myself when using PTR vs. using Perfect Image, my skin looked better before. I do not have deep wrinkles, but I have small lines around my eyes and acne scars. I noticed previously all of my skin issues had diminished, while now they are apparent. It does its purpose as a moisturizer, but if you are looking for something to enhance the youthful look of your skin or provide anti-aging benefits, then you should look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream a few months ago and I am down to my last few dash.  Honestly, it is one of the best face moisturizer I have ever purchased - love it, love it, love it.  My skin is smooth and very soft.  I am planning to buy my second jar very soon. Really would encourage those who wants smooth and hydrated skin to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product goes on the skin but I have only been using it for about&lt;br /&gt;a week. This cream goes a long way on the face and neck~</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is nice and light.  It is very smoothing and can be worn under make up.  The fragrance is nice.  I cannot attest to its wrinkle reducing powers as I just started using it, but I will continue to use it as a daily moisturizer even on the days I do not use a peal.</li>
    <li> i like this product but dont know much about fancy moisturizers so cant really grade it on any kind of scale.  it does what its supposed to and smells nice.</li>
    <li> Dr. OZ recommended the ingredients in this product and I’ve been using this product for over two years with great results.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t use it enough to know for sure, but im acne prone not sure if it was helping brake outs</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried other similar moisturizers since having this&amp;nothing compares.It gets rid of dryness, helps remove dry, dead skin patches &amp; leaves new soft,healthy skin.&amp;It&#x27;s a must have when using acid peels(which the ones by Perfect Image LLC perform wonderfully)You really get your moneys worth with them. Great company, Great products. Look into them ;)</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t hydrate, doesn&#x27;t moisturize. imagine wetting your face. well that is this product. it feels wet but then does nothing.</li>
    <li> My new favorite face cream</li>
    <li> Allergic to it.  It doesn&#x27;t work like I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> I really liked this lotion and bummed I tried something else recently. It&#x27;s light and gentle. Great for after chemical peels. Better than planet earths after chemical peel lotion. Price good too.</li>
    <li> This cream works better than some of the expensive creams I&#x27;ve purchased from department stores. It&#x27;s light and not greasy. It absorbs very well into the skin. Can be used on neck as well, which elminates the need to buy a seperate cream just for that. I found a product that works great and at a fraction of what I paid for other expensive creams that most likely had parabens in them.</li>
    <li> Best night cream ever. I have mixed skin with tendency to impurities and acne, first I used it after glycolic peeling and than daily before going to sleep. It also works well after long air flights.</li>
    <li> Reduced my fine lines and wrinkles.  Felt light, clean and refreshing.  I am a male and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I loved how this product kept my skin hydrated.  It softened my skin and softened the look of wrinkles. Much better than any that you can purchase in a department store.  Plus the price is right.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it has a very light consistancy which is great for my oily skin.  I use it every night and it works great for wrinkles especially between the brows.  This is my go to cream.</li>
    <li> this product is good for your skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream, a little watery, but absorbs well.  I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions, no breakouts, but no real improvement to my skin texture either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MANY creams over the years - from budget over the counter to $300 a jar miracles.  Because of the potent, high quality ingredients, I decided to try the Perfect Image Wrinkle Cream.  I use this cream as a base and mix in some vitamin E oil and DMAE powder.  Wow!  Best face cream ever.  Absorbs quickly, no oily shine and I look great.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This cream soothes and cools my face and throat after I do a peel.  It&#x27;s not greasy or shiny and I occasionally use it as my daily moisturizer.  A little goes a long way and I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This product is okay for sensitive skin but do not expect miracles. My skin doesn&#x27;t handle many products, it is very sensitive. But this did was okay, I used it as directed and i experienced mild redness for a few hours and just a little bit of peeling. I did not see significant improvement on skin, my sun spots seem to be the same and the overall appearance of skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be any different. But it didn&#x27;t damage my skin either.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any changes.</li>
    <li> It didnt suit my skin i wouldnt buy it again, i prefer skin doctors cream,it did not suit my complexion, so i will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Google: COMEDOGENIC INGREDIENTS or go to [...] &amp; U will see what ingredients cause acne. Dr. James Fulton created this scale of acne causing ingredients....in the 80&#x27;s here in Chicago. My best friend was one of his nurses. All were former patients whom he cured of acne! Now he is Newport Beach, CA. But, his work lives on! Isopropol palmitate is a 5 in the scale. Worst! 0 is the BEST! Amazon has Dr. Fulton&#x27;s book about acne causing ingredients! Watch what U put on your face, ladies! One ingredient can be causing your acne. Even oil free products can have a synthetic oils and call it OIL FREE! Synthetic oils have smaller size molecules and cause acne FASTER!(write the government, they allow this labeling! How can we win?) I have used this method of avoiding acne causing ingredients for 20 years, and it is RARE if I get a zit (maybe 2 x&#x27;s a year from stress!) Good luck ladies!! Learn comedogenic ingredients and save you face forever...be acne free!! You will be raeding labels and teaching the gals at the cosmetic counters which ingredeints are bad (cause acne). They actually ASK ME about ingredients! Being a make-up artist &amp; reg. artist makes me want my face to be a clean pallett. Love, Blondie</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t expect to love this cream as much as i do now because of the low price. Majority of my creams are $100+ and some creams i have smell like dirty underarms and do nothing other than make you feel like a big sweaty underarm. This cream smells FANTASTIC - fresh and light, it definitely moisturizes skin really well and makes your skin feel supper soft without making you look like you just felt face down into pot of frying grease. I peel/exfoliate my face quite often and this cream is the best moisturizer i&#x27;ve had to put some moisture back. going to buy more when i run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Now, after using this cream for about 9 months i can clearly see some results! perhaps this cream is not as fast acting as some other supper expensive serums out there but i am in love with it because its a great addition to my daily routine and maintenance if you want a healthy looking skin. I am not sure if people expecting to see botox-looking results in two days that will last for the rest of the live, that&#x27;s not gonna happen with any cream but my expectation is that this will improve my skin and keep it looking healthy going forward and that&#x27;s exactly what i&#x27;ve got.&lt;br /&gt;1. this cream feels light and one of not many creams that i can actually tolerate - i don&#x27;t get eye irritation or allergies as some other anti-wrincle creams or serums that cause my skin inflame and red eyes. i have very sensitive skin and while using majority of serums i can only use those at night because they cause allergies, this cream is the best because it doesn&#x27;t cause any of this madness.&lt;br /&gt;2. As i mentioned before, this cream might be slower than others but i can see a big difference after using it for about 9 months - my skin is smoother, looking healthier, has less wrinkles, my tone is improved and that is after using this cream only and nothing else, i gave up on the serums, actually i keep forgetting to apply them while this cream is part of my daily routine after shower orwashing my face, etc.&lt;br /&gt;3. i saw reviews of people saying this cream causes acne - i don&#x27;t know how much of this is true because my face has tendency to break out badly, i use peroxide face wash so maybe that is the reason why i don&#x27;t break out but i do have extremely sensitive skin that is very clear now and no issues with acne. I think if you clean your skin well and kill bacteria that causes acne before applying any cream you should be good to go so look into Benzoyl peroxide face wash, salicylic acid is good but will make your face peel and cause even more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I used this cream after 2 days all my face look like  Large red sores as mosquitoes bit me ...i will not returned it...i will use it for my hands or my feet...&lt;br /&gt;The cream arrived by time..&lt;br /&gt;after i used the cream on my hand my skin looked very soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream several times and think it&#x27;s the best cream out there. It instantly melts into your skin and hydrates and removes any wrinkles, typically when using the product for over a month.  This is the best wrinkle cream out there! I use in in conjunction with Perfect Image, Inc. Glycolic Acids and other wrinkle products.  I like this product because it has done exactly what it says it is going to do.  It is similar to the other &amp;#34;top sellers&amp;#34; only I like it better.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, very good for maintaining and hydrating the skin. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Product works wonders for my skin. It looks very smooth after applying. I received the product fast and have been using it for few months. I will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She says she really likes it and prefers it to the product she was previously using. It seems a bit pricey, but if she is happy, then I am happy.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It is a great post-peel moisturizer and leaves my skin very soft.  It helps get rid of the skin peeling after the chemical peel.  I recommend using it with the Perfect Image Chemical peels.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy. Slides on smooth. Performs exactly as written up. I will order this product again and continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Used with perfect image face peel...wife loves this.  (Don&#x27;t tell anyone, I use it sometimes too).. Great for my eyes, forehead and neck</li>
    <li> I bought this product in conjunction with the TCA 12% peel.  I used this product immediately after the peel and for several weeks after the peel.  It was very hydrating and gave my skin a smoother appearance.  Great quality product.</li>
    <li> Great peptide cream/lotion, feels cool, light, moisturizing, good for eye areas. Scent is nice but a bit strong. Will be better if unscented.</li>
    <li> This cream is ok, but notice no difference.  I am hoping its too soon.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, my expectations were definitely higher. I used it after a peeling with Skin Obsession&#x27;s 40% Glycolic Acid Peel and It gets absorbed very fast so just a few minutes later you feel the skin again, rigid as cardboard. If you will order this cream  to use it a post-peeling, try Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge intense. It definitely works way much better, is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to be used as advertised: as a hydrating cream to follow a salicylic acid peel (another great product from Perfect Image [[ASIN:B006ZA0A5Y Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Green Tea Extract (Professional Chemical Peel)]]). Because this is recommended for post peels I figured it would be an oily and heavy cream -- beneficial after a peel but not a good choice for regular use given my acne-prone skin.  To my surprise this was not the case and I now use this cream nightly in addition to post peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is surprisingly light but provides excellent hydration while also being easily absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and it has a pleasant scent without being overpowering. In addition to which the cream has an impressive ingredient listings, which is why it&#x27;s a terrific choice for regular use.  Ingredients such as Matrixyl 3000, Argireline and Hyaluronic Acid have a proven track record and are dermatologist recommended for anti-aging skin care. They are also placed relatively high up on the product&#x27;s ingredient listing, which indicates that they are contained within the cream at a percentage high enough to be truly effective for anti-aging. And if all of this wasn&#x27;t enough, the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great anti-aging skin care product at a cost that is reasonable... what more can you ask for? Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me.  I&#x27;ve decided all these type of products are gimmicks.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream that does not go on heavy.  My opthamologist recommended using something with Matrixyl because she feels that is THE best skin care ingredient.  It also has a very nice silky feel and is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I think this is the very good skin care products for my sensitive skin - I love the price too.  It takes about month to really notice, but it is as good as Levela I tried.</li>
    <li> It is helping to heal my skin.  I have a lot of sun damage. I would  recomend this product to my friends &amp; family.&lt;br /&gt;So far  it seems to be a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Beverly Stango</li>
    <li> it worked for a while.</li>
    <li> I have noticed such a difference in my skin this product is fabulous!!! My skin has never felt softer and I will buy this product all the time</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use as a post light acid peel cream.  I also use it as a night cream.  It smells wonderful and leaves my skin looking healthy and rejuvinated.  It is the best facial hydrating cream I have ever used.  My skin glows now!  I love this entire line and have already recommended it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer, that I would highly recommend.  It is very light and non-greasy.  I break out easily and thus is one of the only ones out there that prevents beak outs.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues choosing a good cream. My skin would break out and get oily pretty much 99% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve NEVER had any of the mentioned conditions after I started using this cream. For the price it was offered here it&#x27;s a bargain! I purchased their Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser - Enhanced with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Green Tea Extract and Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Tea Tree Oil and Green Tea Extract on Groupon few months back. The day I got them marked a new life for my skin. This stuff is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bad skin for the past 20 years (I&#x27;m 31 now). Trust me, nothing could impress me. I was very sarcastic about the new stuff. Surprisingly, my skin LOVED the new products. I barely have any breakouts; my skin has cleared up DRAMATICALLY. It&#x27;s too bad this company doesn&#x27;t have a referral program - at least 10 of my friends and co-workers got different products from here. I ended up buying more stuff as well (additional cleanser and this cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the cream is discontinued or out of stock (I hope it&#x27;s the second case!!!!!!!!), I&#x27;m seriously terrified. I&#x27;m definitely not ready to go back to my bad skin. I will probably have to pay twice the price on other website which doesn&#x27;t excite me at all.</li>
    <li> I really like this creme, especially after using one of the gel peels.  I can feel my facial muscles relaxing a bit - which is one of the benefits of this product.  It smells great and is a great hydrator.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re applying chemical peels, this is the product for you (and me, too). It helped to moisturize my skin after my peels and is a good product if you have dry skin like me.</li>
    <li> Not really that effective - I&#x27;m not seeing any difference at all - I have been using this everyday -&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend - it is not working for me!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t  notice anything different with use of this product,except a slight drying of my skin. So, it&#x27;s not for me but may work ok on another skin type. I have fair,sensitive, skin that usually responds to products one way or the other and this was basically neutral for me</li>
