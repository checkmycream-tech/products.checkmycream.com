      <li>Nothing better.</li>
      <li>, I love that.  </li>
      <li>This gel liner goes on more like a cream liner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used MAC fluidliner for years and this is a comparable product, just makes your eyelashes more sticky than MAC.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who rarely writes a good review.</li>
      <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>

      <li>so creamy easy to apply</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a gel liner so pigmented and strong as this one.</li>
      <li>It is a deep beautiful pigmented color</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best eyeliner on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>best black gel liner ever.</li>
      <li>I guess if your eyes don&#x27;t get oily during the day you will be fine.</li>
      <li>Excellent black shade.</li>

      <li>You have a little time to smudge it, move it, perfect it.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly....</li>
      <li>Unforgiving on mistakes so be precise with it if you get one</li>

      <li>I use it on my waterline when i want a more intense look, stays put there too.</li>
      <li>you will know for sure that it&#x27;s the real thing</li>
      <li>Beautiful smooth jet black stay all day line!  </li>
      <li>I love my new gel liner!</li>
      <li>Information you should know: I have super oily eye lids...</li>
      <li>I will say I get just the smallest amount of product in my eye when I put it on, but a quick sweep with a Q-tip does it.  </li>
      <li>waterproof, very very very black, matt, last longing, best one yet, better than mac and sigma gel liners</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and a nice jet black color!</li>
      <li>I have experienced crispy black lines, breakage, and severe smudging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few drugstore gel liners and this one is great.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, very dark and  long lasting.</li>
    <li> love it! it&#x27;s always sold out but thankfully i found it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! I guess if your eyes don&#x27;t get oily during the day you will be fine. Mine can get relatively oily and I got racoon eyes!  It started to smear in the first couple hours and got worse throughout the day. It does not stay on as what most people say here.</li>
    <li> Wow...works very well. Holds throughout the day. Look more like a raccoon in the morning..but it is a small thing considering it works so well. Don&#x27;t have to use a lot, so it should last a long time. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect eyeliner! totally worth the buy, will not be going back to my old eyeliner</li>
    <li> This is the best gel eyeliner I have ever tried. it&#x27;s an awesome consistency and stays in the waterline as well. It&#x27;s easy to smudge out and doesn&#x27;t move! Totally worth the few extra dollars versus a drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> Glides on smoothly and long lasting.</li>
    <li> i love it! so creamy easy to apply</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me ;(</li>
    <li> Its very smooth and its easy to use BUT! S*** smudges really bad looks like I was the PANDA QUEEN lol.If you have oily eyelids this is not good for you.</li>
    <li> Beautiful smooth jet black stay all day line!  Cat eye perfected!</li>
    <li> This stuff is lethal.  The black you crave from a liquid eyeliner and its so workable but once it sets its there- its basically perfection- but be careful when applying</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner! I use an angled brush to apply it and it looks amazing and it goes on fairly easy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still new to using this product. It didn&#x27;t stay put for me. May be putting too much on.</li>
    <li> good pruduct, just one issue after hours of wear tends to smear.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly....once dry stays on all day.  I found other gel pots dry out quickly. ..this one has not</li>
    <li> but you have to wait for it to dry</li>
    <li> This is a great eye liner and the darkest I&#x27;ve gotten so fare. Goes on damp and drys fast and dark.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this gel loner, I would definitely recommend. ....</li>
    <li> I love my new gel liner! #77 I find it works best with a straight skinny liner brush, not angled. For ME</li>
    <li> I got this gel liner in black and it is fantastic,,I have tried smashbox,,laura geller,,bobby brown,,and illamasqua for the tightline &amp; waterline,,,and this beats them all,,,it doesn&#x27;t come off when eyes are watery and doesn&#x27;t smudge,,it lasts all day,,,you won&#x27;t loose it,,,gonna get a few more,,,oh and I do like Mac fluidline,,,,,but this is the best,,,,try it if you do the waterline &amp; tightline,,,,,,,,,,,,</li>
    <li> I like the product, very opaque and glides on smoothly, however I do not love how it makes my eyelashes stick together! It makes it very difficult to curl my eyelashes and they stick to my eyelash curler. So I&#x27;ve had to switch up the order I apply my eye makeup now but it&#x27;s just a small hiccup. I&#x27;ve used MAC fluidliner for years and this is a comparable product, just makes your eyelashes more sticky than MAC.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and a nice jet black color!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. I am drawn to the blackest of black liquid and gel liners and this is definitely one of them. I usually use Mac fluidline which i have been using for years. I wanted to switch it up to a gel and decided on this one. IF YOU HAVE OILY EYELIDS (like myself) you need to use a eye shadow primer and set it with a black shadow. I use noticing a black shadow on my lids throughout the day which i HATE when i didnt use primer or shadow. Otherwise, its a great liner. I use it with my sigma liner brush.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is amazing, beats anything MUFE, MAC, Illamasqua or other high end brands have put out and also the blackest I&#x27;ve seen on my NC45 skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, go to the Inglot website and find a store near you or a Macy&#x27;s that has an Inglot booth, it will cost $12!! Not the $14 on here, and you will know for sure that it&#x27;s the real thing (and you wont have to pay shipping costs either!)</li>
    <li> I cannot even guess just how many pencils, gels, and liquid eyeliners I have purchased and used for my waterline and tightline with no success. I have bought high end to low end and they all come off within a few hours......until this product. It is FABULOUS!! I put it on in the morning and it is still on when I remove my makeup in the evening. It is also very black and goes on so easily. It is well worth the money and it should last a long time since you use so little with each application. So if you are like me and always in search for that product that will stay on for the entire day, this is it.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! It goes on really black and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Water proof and it doesn&#x27;t smudge ... Great choice</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get any blacker and stronger than this gel! I&#x27;m shocked! I&#x27;ve never seen a gel liner so pigmented and strong as this one. It won&#x27;t come off! It just won&#x27;t. You&#x27;ll need a strong and good quality waterproof makeup remover to get this baby off. I love it! Unforgiving on mistakes so be precise with it if you get one as once it dries, that&#x27;s it. It stays on as a tattoo.</li>
    <li> best black gel liner ever. I have tried all different other black ones over the past year and the others are great... but this is the blackest gel liner out of them all. by far my favorite. the first one I ever bought I used daily and I still had so so much left but I had to throw mine out after having it for about 9 months because it was starting to dry out. I must not have put the lid on tight enough. my fault. but this is the best gel liner ever</li>
    <li> Meets cult expectations. Beautiful consistency and color!</li>
    <li> Best eye liner I ever use&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Goes on awesome but it smears and smudges easily. I like regular liquid liner better bc it doesn&#x27;t smear. If you have oily skin this isn&#x27;t for you!</li>
    <li> This is the HG of gel liners. WILL NOT SMUDGE OR FADE. Invest in a good eye makeup remover</li>
    <li> By far the best, the blackest, long lasting gel liner I&#x27;ve ever used. Applications is bomb and it doesn&#x27;t dry out after a month or two like all the other&#x27;s, both drug store and high end, that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The best gel eyeliner on the market. It is so much darker than Mac&#x27;s &amp; Bobbi Brown&#x27;s liners. It doesn&#x27;t budge &amp; I personally did not find it too hard to remove. If you&#x27;re looking for the blackest eyeliner, look no further!</li>
    <li> Did not like it at all it was ruined when it reached me and dry</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best eyeliner on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many eyeliners, and nothing holds a candle to inglot.  I&#x27;ve tried Nars, Mac, Kat Von D, Marc Jacobs, Urban Decay, and everything from liquids, to gels, to pencils.  Nothing is as good as Inglot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super pigmented, creamy, lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge or budge, even with tearing, crying, sweating, rain, you name it, it stays.  This is my holy grail of eyeliner.  It&#x27;s even mild enough to put along the water line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s matte and lovely, I love that.  This is a great eyeliner, and the pot will last you forever.  I&#x27;ve had the same pot of Inglot for a year and it&#x27;s still almost full and I use it nearly every day.  Other pencils last a month maybe two, then it&#x27;s gone.  You get so much bang for your buck with the Inglot, it&#x27;s almost like you are paying pharmacy prices for high end makeup.  Honestly, you&#x27;re paying less than pharmacy prices, it lasts forever.  It&#x27;s out lasted my liquid pens and gel pens by far.  my Mac, Nars and Kat Von D pens where dried up long before the Inglot even had the slightest dent in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive eyes, the Urban Decay liquid liner made my eyes burn, while the Inglot doesn&#x27;t even bother me being right in the water line.  The Inglot is great for sensitive eyes too.</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I have tried many different eye liners and this is a definite winner! Goes on so smooth and is a very intense black. An absolute must have for beginners and pros!</li>
    <li> Will buy again, great product</li>
    <li> FABULOUS!!!! Truly matte when dry.  A little goes a very long way.  Excellent black shade.</li>
    <li> Loveee!!! I&#x27;ve tried a few drugstore gel liners and this one is great. It&#x27;s a matte black finish. It&#x27;s soft and creamy. It&#x27;s glides when you apply it. Love it. The only downfall is that it took about 2-2 1/2 weeks to come.</li>
    <li> Information you should know: I have super oily eye lids... most gel eyeliners after a several hours end up going from matte to this shiny black and they do not last. I have experienced crispy black lines, breakage, and severe smudging. I also believe in using a primer (Urban Decay Primer Potion is my go to) regardless of eye shadow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with that all out of the way, I simply ADORE this eyeliner. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a more affordable product that gives intense black pigmentation, that is matte, that just glides onto the lid effortlessly. There is something about this product that enables me to create decent looking winged lines. It is perfection and also waterproof because it is incredibly difficult to take off. I can&#x27;t live without this liner, honestly. It puts shame to Blacktrack from Mac and forget comparing it to drug store gel liners. No comparison. There&#x27;s no point in trying different higher end liners when this product delivers and meets all of my expectations at an amazing price. I will say that if you are in the area with an Inglot Store, pick it up in store because it is $12 and not $14 on top of the shipping from the website. Oh and one more thing, the liner lasted about 7 months before it started to completely dry out on me. Best there is and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product that lasts all day with intense, rich color</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this gel liner as I had heard so many good things about it. However, I found it to be extremely messy. The gel does not dry quickly, and I spent almost 20 minutes doing a cleanup around my water line and near the outer corner of my eye when I tried to create a cat eye. It&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s a gorgeous black color. This gel liner goes on more like a cream liner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after watching a Youtube tutorial on non-transferring eyeliner. I was looking to tightline just my top lash line, not my lower waterline, so I needed something that would stay put and not transfer during the day.  The video I watched said this Inglot was THE eyeliner for me and would stay put no matter what. Wrong. For me, this transfers to my bottom waterline immediately no matter how long I give it to dry before blinking and no matter how little of this eyeliner I use. Now I&#x27;m using Too Faced&#x27;s 3-Way Lash Lining Tool and it works perfectly! However, if you are looking to use eyeliner to tightline BOTH your lash lines or just want to use it on your lids then I would wholeheartedly recommend this 77 because it is a rich, deep black that looks great on any eye.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this particular eyeliner because of everyone constantly raving about it. Now I will say in the very beginning of purchasing this product, it was a dream to work with and very black but when I started using it more and more it started to get dried up and I added Duraline to it in an attempt to revive the eyeliner but it turned very clumpy. Maybe I&#x27;ll give this eyeliner another shot and purchase another soon.</li>
    <li> if you have a liner brush that you can control and know how to handle it, this is the liner for you! waterproof, very very very black, matt, last longing, best one yet, better than mac and sigma gel liners</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner I have ever purchased.  Well worth the price.  It is the blackest black I&#x27;ve ever seen and it stays on intact the whole day.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Wow! This is the richest, blackest gel liner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Can be stubborn to get off but this stuff is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I wear contacts and this doesn&#x27;t both my sensitive eyes.  The gel liner takes some getting use to but it&#x27;s great ad stays put.  Nothing better.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner! Very high quality.  It arrived on time and as advertised. Thank you</li>
    <li> works just like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Inglot is the only eyeliner that stays on like glue.  I have worn it for over 8 hours and it still stays put on my waterline.  This is pricey but well worth every penny.  I can&#x27;t go back to any other liner.  This is the best of the BEST!</li>
    <li> loved it!!! I don&#x27;t need any other eyeliner</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  After doing a YouTube search for lining the waterline I came across a video raving about this product.  I always loved the look of black liner on the waterline but had always tried it with pencil liners and of course, they would wash away within an hour and end up as a gloopy mess in the corner of my eye.  Not the look I was going for.  This gel liner does exactly what I want.  I apply it once, in the morning and after 60 seconds it is dry and DOESN&#x27;T BUDGE for the whole day!  Even when I take off the rest of my makeup, most of this liner is still on the waterline.  Okay, so it takes a little more to get rid of it, but frankly, I don&#x27;t care.  I have been using for about a week and you use such a very tiny amount and get such great coverage that this little pot will probably last a year.  Be sure to close the pot completely so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  I will say I get just the smallest amount of product in my eye when I put it on, but a quick sweep with a Q-tip does it.  Love love love this liner!</li>
    <li> Excellent. This eyeliner gel is the most black of all I&#x27;ve had. I really love it...</li>
    <li> I really sattisfied with this product. It&#x27;s really stable on skin. Also seller was really kind to us.&lt;br /&gt;I will refer this product to all of my firends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this eye liner, it goes on so smooth and it even dries on my water line and lasts all day. No other eye liner compares!</li>
    <li> The main reason I purchased this product was because I was so tired of eyeliners that don&#x27;t stay put.  The color was good, but after an hour the product would bled under my eyes.  When you spend a good amount of money on an eyeliner it is so disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who rarely writes a good review. I just don&#x27;t take the time. But this product is worth a great review.  First, as others have stated, I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING out there, from department store, to MAC to, well, you get the point. My issue is allergies. My eyes are watering all the time so I really need an eyeliner (and mascara) that stay put.  This is the winner. I finally found the ONE.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, it glides on smoothly and you only need to use a tiny amount because its so pigmented. You have a little time to smudge it, move it, perfect it. But once it sets, it stays. And stays. And stays. Until you take it off. I use oil free eye makeup remover to take it off and have no issues, no rubbing or tugging or anything. I expected it to be difficult to remove with such staying power. But its not.  I don&#x27;t know how it stays on so well but removes with usual effort. The pigment is very deep and very matte, just like I like it. I use it on my waterline when i want a more intense look, stays put there too. You just have to hold your eyes open for a few seconds to allow it to &#x27;dry&#x27; after application. Then it stays put.  The only complaint I have is of course the price. I mean really....its a hefty price and you can&#x27;t get it locally near me. Its so pricey that I can&#x27;t convince myself to purchase an additional color. Sticking with black and loving it.</li>
    <li> The only liner that is truly waterproof in waterline all day long. A bit tough to get all off but I do use a thick line on the top lid and tight line top and bottom. That&#x27;s a lot of product to remove. Love it!</li>
    <li> Looks good on &amp; it&#x27;s easy to apply on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this gel liner has become my fav. Very creamy</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner for your water line and tight line. Really stays in place.</li>
    <li> Eh. It is a deep beautiful pigmented color but my problem with this is that it smudges terribly making me have raccoon eyes. Was really excited to get it in but I&#x27;m Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Okay where to start... This product is wear-able with a black eyeshadow to set it. If not it will transfer to upper lid throughout the day. Also smears... If you were to rub your eye for any reason whatsoever, expect to look like a raccoon. I was expecting waterproof, transfer-proof, smudge proof... FAIL. I will say the texture is nice and it glides over eyelid very smoothly. Save yourself $8.00 and go to your nearest cvs, or target- look for the brand Milani and buy the infinite liquid liner with the gold cap. The texture is hard to work with.. But once you&#x27;ve nailed it nothing will be able to take this off (other than an oil-based eye remover) YOU WONT REGRET THAT PURCHASE! Xo</li>
    <li> I tried Inglot because my eye area apparently produces oil of steel, that can destroy any eyeliner I put on them, and a Youtube &amp;#34;guru&amp;#34; suggested it for those who do have a problem with eyeliner running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- great consistency, creamy without being greasy&lt;br /&gt;- beautiful matt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it still ran down my eyes halfway through the day (despite my adding a primer and powdering with a black shadow over it)&lt;br /&gt;- because of its incredible staying power, that probably works on regular eyes without super oil, I couldn&#x27;t simply wipe it away. It smeared all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have crazy eye oil, I think this would be great for you. If you have crazy eye oil, try Stila&#x27;s Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner. It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner ever ♥♥♥</li>
