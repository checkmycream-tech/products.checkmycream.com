<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells good. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as regular conditioner. But works good for what it is. Perfect detangler.</li>
    <li> This is a good leave on to moisturize hair a little, but it doesn&#x27;t detangle or anything.  It&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Love this product as it tames frizzy hair and creates beautiful body and volume while smoothing dry flyaway hair. Especially excellent in the summer.</li>
    <li> I use this on the days I use regular conditioners. It helps brush out my hair nicely. Would recommend to anyone with medium-long hair.</li>
    <li> I have veryyy curly hair and this product not only makes it smell great but it keeps my hair from looking dry or frizzy all day :)</li>
    <li> Saves time and helps take care of my hair needs without spending extra time conditioning my hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair very soft and silkie and I love it.  I gave some to my sister and he loves it too.  The only negative for me is it smells of coconut and I hate that smell, but I&#x27;m getting used to it because the conditioner is sooo good!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best for my hair.  Quick and easy to spray on after the shower, gives a little hold without getting stiff and eliminates any frizziness.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. A nice lite conditioner that moisturizes without leaving any residue. Good for wavy/curly hair. For some reason CVS no longer carries it.</li>
    <li> I was using It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave-in spray but found that over time it was making my hair dry. I believe the reason is the alcohol.  The Aussie product has no alcohol (and is about 1/6 the price of It&#x27;s a 10) and it leaves my hair nice and soft. Note that the price on Amazon is for 3 bottles, so it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Arrived on time and well packaged.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It did NOT ship in a timely manner!!!</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this a few years ago and it had tea tree in it and it was absolutely amazing stuff and really great for my itchy scalp. My hair never looked better. Now, they&#x27;ve replaced the tea tree with aloe and it now has a better pina colada type smell. Delicious, summery smell, by the way. Without the tea tree, the product is not as good as it used to be, but I will continue using it because the ingredient list is top notch and the smell is so yummy. There&#x27;s really no need to spend more money buying salon products when you can get stuff that&#x27;s just as good or better for a fraction of the cost. One bottle of this is $2.50 at my local Wal-mart. You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> It was great to find this when I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local store. Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky, nor heavy residue in hair!</li>
    <li> I have color balanced my hair twice and have used plenty of products. When I was recently in Thailand my sister-in-law recommended Aussie leave-in products for my burnt, fine hair. Bought this last night and saw great results asap. After years of torturing my hair, I forgot it was wavy and could be soft. I do not use a regular conditioner only leave-ins, so if you have thicker hair you might want to do some experimenting.</li>
    <li> Smells good holds well is easier to apply and I can take it with me and spray it when I need it. I&#x27;m sticking with this one it makes hair soft shiny smooth silky and it smells amazing. Really good for long curly hair. :D Im buying more tomorrow.</li>
    <li> This is great with curl cream, but not so great as a detangler. I usually have to use a detangler first and then put in the leave-in conditioner. But, it is great for my fine, thin, curly (frizzy) hair since it&#x27;s lightweight and smells lovely. Great all day long without feeling oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> Smell good, but too strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m becoming obsessed with hair products so now I always like to have something in my hair even when I&#x27;m not styling it. I love this product because it&#x27;s a spray, and it&#x27;s quick to use. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky, and I can put it in my hair as soon as I get out of the shower. I use it before I use other hair products too. Plus, it smells really good!  I mostly love it because it&#x27;s a spray and not a cream. It&#x27;s cheap, and I will definitely be buying this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Fast &amp; easy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair as so many leave-ins do. Works really well as a detangler, which is exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair smell and if wearing my hair flat it&#x27;s great no frizz and a nice silky shiny finish.  But when I curl my hair the curls seem to last even less than when I wear no product. I have thin weave somewhat dry, hair maybe it has something to do with my hair type</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it on my grandaughters hair. Makes her hair easy to comb out. Smells nice also</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff,it can be hard to find around our area.The price on Amazon is best you will find,tried the product myself and for it to be pretty good.</li>
    <li> I love Aussie products for their smell and this spray has great detangling properties on my hair. I have very thick curly hair and this product helps detangle while damp.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 15 years, but this will be the last bottle I buy.  The ingredients used to list Tea Tree Oil...no more!...and the fragrance is now fruity.  There are other spray-in conditioners, and now Aussie has lost its advantage for me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite leave-in conditioner.  I have very long, fine hair, and I use it on myself as well as my daughters and even my son.  It is a great fragrance that isn&#x27;t too girly to use on a boy- my son LOVES the smell, just as much as all of us girls do.  I have asthma that often reacts to perfumes &amp; such, but this does not affect it at all.  It also works fabulously.  I appreciate that I can buy it this way- in a pack of 3, and have it delivered to my door.  We couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Give it a try and you will be coming back for more!</li>
    <li> I ran out of my other conditioner so I bought this since it had some things going for it. I was wrong. I have used it twice and my hair is drier and tangled horribly. I was trying to save money and not go back to my other one for $19 but it is well worth it after seeing what this crap does.</li>
    <li> it was alright it smelled good but i didn&#x27;t see alot of change on my hair. just made it wet</li>
    <li> i usually spend about 20$ on my name brand \\&quot;curly\\&quot; moouse that i put on my hair after my shower. it was OK but my hair felt too light and frizzy. i saw this on the 2011 summer must haves.. it was around TWO $ so i was iffy about it.. but i saw on the reviews that every loves it! i finally got to try it out [ im obsessed with the smell of it! ] i sprayed it in my hair after my shower and combed it through and i scrunched it a little... let it air dry.. my hair is SO curly... this allowed my natural curls to come out.. it smell AWESOME..hair isnt sticky or anything! feels SO natural and it controlled my frizz 99.9% .. i LOVE IT! i&#x27;m so glad that its only a few dollars because i&#x27;d pay SO much more for it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both Aussie Hair Insurance and also Aussie Sun-Touched Shine. Here&#x27;s what I found...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aussie &#x27;Sun-Touched Shine&#x27;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;1) Smells great! Sort of grape-y.&lt;br /&gt;2) Excellent detangler.&lt;br /&gt;3) Hair feels super soft, even after it is blow-dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1) I have a perm, and it seems &#x27;weighty&#x27; and seems to flatten my curls, especially the longer layers in the back. (Shorter layers on the sides seem to have more defined curls after using this product, however.)&lt;br /&gt;2) Hair can feel almost too soft, especially on high-humidity days. On high-humidity days it can actually make hair feel greasy, almost dirty.&lt;br /&gt;3) Hair takes FOREVER to blow-dry. I can spend twice as long blow-drying it, and 2 or 3 hours later it is still damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aussie &#x27;Hair Insurance&#x27;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;1) Smells great! Sort of grape-y.&lt;br /&gt;2) Helps somewhat with detangling (though not as good as the Sun-Touched Shine).&lt;br /&gt;3) Hair feels softer (though again, not as good as the Sun-Touched Shine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1) Slightly less effective detangler than the Sun-Touched Shine.&lt;br /&gt;2) Slightly less effective at softening hair than the Sun-Touched Shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have a perm, I prefer the Aussie Hair Insurance. But perhaps if I had straight hair, I&#x27;d prefer the Aussie Sun-Touched Shine? I still plan on alternating both, however, since sometimes my hair needs a good softening.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but doesn&#x27;t have enough detangling power for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. It is inexpensive and does a great job. Used to buy it in stores, and now it is very difficult to find and much more expensive than buying it online.</li>
    <li> Convenience for use and easy &amp; obvious effect.Good product!</li>
    <li> I put this on every day when I get out of the shower, and I never have to deal with any tangles whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I use Biotera leave in conditioner on my daughter&#x27;s biracial hair and we go through about a bottle every two weeks. It gets expensive so I thought I&#x27;d try this Aussie product since I really like their deep conditioner 3-minute miracle. This stuff sprays on like sticky water, does not help condition, detangle or anything except smell nice. I was very disappointed. I now have 2 extra bottles which I will try to jazz up by adding other conditioners to it. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because it does have that nice, weird grape bubble gum smell, and it didn&#x27;t do anything awful like make our hair fall out or change color.</li>
    <li> I have used conditioning sprays by dove, loreal (costs $9 a bottle!) and frizz ease. This stuff is by far the best and only $3 a bottle at the store. I haven&#x27;t gotten my hair cut since FEB and it is now NOV and I dont&#x27; have any split ends. I use it on my son too because he gets \\&quot;crib head\\&quot; or whatever it is called where their hair is all nappy in the back from how they lay on it, even though he is 2. This is the best priced and best working spray. I use sulfate free shampoo, skip the conditioner and just use this. I have naturally curly hair if that makes a difference, it is a tiny bit coarse, it isn&#x27;t thick or thin. This stuff doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either or make it oily, I still only wash my hair every other day.</li>
    <li> THIS leave in conditioner has made my dry hair soo moisturised and soft!! very hight quality like most of aussies products! i really recommend this to anyone who has dry hair and doesnt wanna spend a a lot of money!LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great to use both a leave in conditioner or a detangler. Great scent Will be ordering again when I run out of my current order</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t condition my hair at all.  My hair is just as dry and tangly and hard to brush as before!  I regret buying a 3-pack.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years. good straight forward leave in conditioner for dry hair.</li>
    <li> im african american with kinky hair and  this item was gr8 when i put it in but after like 30 min my hair began shedding heavily. i dont think i want to try other aussie products...lesson learned</li>
    <li> I always use leave in conditioner and have for the past 10 years.  I couldn&#x27;t find my regular brand so I tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well, but I feel like I have to use more squirts than I did with my other brand, but my hairs also longer so I&#x27;m really not sure.  It is not heavy and leaves my hair light and flowing.  I often spritz my hair at bedtime and twist my hair up into a bun with a scrunchee.  I can usually style my hair in the morning without having to wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is much less \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; and now my husband is using it also, though I don&#x27;t know why.  His hair is thick and gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again, very good for the $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and it has helped tremendously. My hair used to have lots of fly-aways every time I would blow dry it, and would feel rather dry. After using this it is much silkier and smoother. I went without it the other day and could see a huge difference. I only spray it about 8-9 times on my hair, and have had no trouble with it looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I LOVE the smell! Spraying a little on a brush and then brushing your hair is a great way to freshen it up.</li>
    <li> Very light, no buildup! I use it daily on my naturally curly hair) but I do suggest just adding 1/4 cup of the conditioner to a spray bottle full of water because this stuff seems to be a bit concentrated so  a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, but I wish it still had tea tree oil in it.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what i wanted. Cannot find this in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I like changing up what i use in my hair... my responds very well to things whether they be good or bad.  It had gotten kind of dry, so i bought some of the aussi 3 minute miracle deeeep conditioner, i use a little on my tips with my regular conditioner and it makes it sooo soft, so i thought why not buy this and seal the healthy hair deal!?  well... I bought a bottle and have used it after every shower on damp hair for 2 months and it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.. it doesn&#x27;t feel any more moist or smooth.. and it smells good in the bottle but it kinda has a weird smell once applied, at least to me... i don&#x27;t see a difference so i won&#x27;t buy again, I&#x27;ll just stick to my usual creme leave in conditioner :P</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving the leave in because the hair stays hydrated without being oily! Worth, not to mention the price compensates much!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have been using this stuff for years now. Amazon has the best bulk price that I can find without having some crazy license! Its perfect for taming curly hair!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for a couple years now and it has since been discontinued at the store I was getting it from. I found it online and it&#x27;s exactly like what I have been getting in the store and at a better price! Turns out the store did me a favor by getting rid of it so I could find it cheaper elsewhere! Arrived on time and as described. Very Pleased with this experience.</li>
    <li> The best smelling and most effective leave in conditioner for the price.&lt;br /&gt;At least out of all the ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is that if you have really thick hair you have to use a lot, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> No grease or oil. Just a nice leave in conditioner that deals with dry looking frizzy hair. Worked with my hair type - good stuff!</li>
    <li> I use this after my morning shower, and it makes my hair easy to brush out. It&#x27;s sort of a no-tangle-guarantee for me. Perhaps people with different hair types may find other things work better for them, but I have thick, straight, and long blonde hair, and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> Aussie conditioner is the only product i will use, i will buy again, its worth the money, excellent, more expensive in store</li>
    <li> Not what I expected for a leave in. I am glad it does not have any parabens in it, but like it doesn&#x27;t have conditioner either. Leaves my hair dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> what is wrong with the prices on Amazon? everything is a lot more expensive than everywhere else! this leave in conditioner costs around 4 dollars in Walmart, why would anybody want to pay 14????? I love this conditioner, but not going to get it from here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years.  I have naturally dry and curly hair, so leaving this in simply makes my hair  easier to manage.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and washes out with each shampoo.</li>
    <li> My five-year-old has very fine, wavy hair that is difficult to manage. Most days, no matter what we put in it or how we brush it in the morning, it is a tangled mass of knots by the end of the day.  Fixing it is a miserable experience for all involved.  I opted to try this on a bit of a whim (we use the 3-in-one for both kids and have been quite happy with it).  I am thrilled with the texture of my daughter&#x27;s hair at the end of the day.  It is soft and tangle free. Her hair is shiny.  We are both very happy.  She also loves the smell of this, which is just icing on the cake.  I have tried it in my own hair, and it has been very soft and smooth all day - and today was a very high humidity day.  I would say that qualifies this product as a \\&quot;winner.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is wonderful condition.  I love it because it is a great detangler and it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Since using this, I need nothing else for natural curls. I use a small plastic bottle (the .97 bottles that walmart sells in the &#x27;travel size&#x27; bins work for me.) to mix 1/3 water to 2/3 conditioner. This gives a good mix for morning for waking up dead head curls. The bottle I use gives more spray per squirt so I&#x27;m able to really wet my hair, as needed, and don&#x27;t get hand cramps from using the conditioner&#x27;s pump spray.&lt;br /&gt;I use the condition &#x27;straight&#x27; for rainy or damp days to battle frizz. Even if I get caught in  the rain, the conditioner will help hair dry without frizzing. The conditioner&#x27;s bottle pump is a little stiff and if you&#x27;ve got a lot of hair, you may want to get another plastic bottle to use it straight, to avoid hand cramps. I don&#x27;t; but, for arthritis sufferers, it may be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it &#x27;straight&#x27; as hair spray for &#x27;setting&#x27; a style. It doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff, but does hold the curls and hair will feel soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Also, getting this via Subscribe and Save saves money as well as assuring I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Great for my curly sometimes untamable hair! Came soon!</li>
    <li> I first bought this leave in conditioner for my hair. It has a very nice scent, and it doesn&#x27;t linger. I have a very sensitive sence of smell, and get migraines easily. I have a hard time going into the perfume or candle isle in the store. I&#x27;ve had to leave stores, Dr&#x27;s offices, movies, and even had to leave work early because of migraines from perfumes and such. I don&#x27;t have to worry about this product at all! I am also a smoker, and my sister is very allergic to smoke. I have to take a shower or completely change my clothes to go over her house. She is so sensitive to it, she can smell the smoke on me, if I wear the same bra I had on when smoking. I realized, about a year ago, that when I had sprayed my hair with this product, my sister could not smell the smoke, at all. I started slowly testing it, and it was magic! I can smoke right before I go to her house, not change my clothes, spray my clothes and hair with this, and she doesn&#x27;t smell a thing. Not even a little bit. I use it all of the time. I know how bad smokers smell, and with using this spray, noone has to smell my nasty smoke. I see my sister a lot more now, and that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> This works just as good as the more expensive brands. it doesnt make your hair greasy or stiff. I buy this all the time, great deal on the 4 pack.</li>
    <li> We use this as a daily detangler for fine hair. It works great and smells good, too!</li>
    <li> So cheap and smells great. Leaves my hair silky and soft :)</li>
    <li> This is a very good product to use during summer time. It leaves my hair smelling great without any sticky residue on my hair. Great product to use before going swimming.</li>
    <li> This Product smells like cat piss.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product offline after I bought their 3 min conditioner which I loved. It always left my hair incredibly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also made an excellent pre-shave)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have mixed feelings about this product. Iv tried 1-3 squirts. No matter how much I use it always ends up drying in my hair like I used a TON of jel..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it has an excellent smell I just don&#x27;t notice a difference for me. None the less it works well for many people and I do like the smell so I feel 3 stars is a fair rating for it. It might work excellent for you. Just wasn&#x27;t noticeable for me beyond the hair jel effect.</li>
    <li> I use this Aussie product in my daughters hair. It really has been working well. She has dry hair so I spray this in her hair daily.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The stores in my area stopped selling this product. So it was nice to get this item in bulk. This conditioner makes my hair so soft I just love it. I would def recommend this product</li>
    <li> My hair is long and naturally curly. This is the best leave in that I have ever used for my hair. It leaves my hair with a nice ringlet curl and very soft and manageable. I have used most every product out there for curly, dry and brittle hair and I have used other products which say they help people who have naturally curly hair to regain moisture and curl but nothing compares to this one. I used to clear the shelves off when I could find it in grocery stores but have not seen this product for several years. I am elated to have found it again at Amazon. I can&#x27;t wait to receive it. My hair is down to my waist and it&#x27;s been almost impossible to manage without this product - I have been contemplating a short hair cut cuz I could not find anything that works for my hair like this product does. If you have natural curl to your hair you have to at least give this a try.  For curly hair it is a must...  And the smell? Is UN-speak able, nothing compares to the smell of this product, it smells so good nothing can compare to it. THANK YOU AMAZON</li>
    <li> I love conditioner but I hate how long it takes to wash out of my hair. This leave in conditioner has been a godsend. I&#x27;m in the shower for less than 10 minutes now, another minute tops to spritz this on my hair and voila! If I want my hair to be curly the next day, I spray this in and tie my hair up in a bun. After a night of sleeping on it, I get nice, soft curls.</li>
    <li> I have used MANY leave-ins, but this one, by far, is the BEST.&lt;br /&gt;Works well for my naturally sandy brown hair (if you have this color hair, you know our hair is DRY).&lt;br /&gt;Gives moisture without any weighdown, and smells great!</li>
    <li> After moving to a new city I started having trouble with my regular conditioner washing out. I was finally fed up with greasy hair so I stopped conditioning altogether. After a couple months of no conditioner, I finally decided to try a leave-in. I found this well reviewed on amazon and decided to give it a shot. NO REGRETS, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I finally have my soft conditioned hair again, without the grease.</li>
    <li> I use this on my girls hair after their bath.  It does a great job detangling their hair and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> This stuff never really worked for me. I have dry, thick hair that&#x27;s damaged and comes with frizz and the like. This did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Good smell and very useful</li>
    <li> I use this to help with the tangles ....it smells like the beach ! Coconuts ! I thought the price was for 1 but was very happy to get 3 bottles of this !! SO a great value ! You spray in and leave it ...my hair is soft and shiny...it does not weigh it down at all. I put one bottle in my beach bag !</li>
    <li> Great smelling and works well for getting out tangles. I love using this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff. I bought a Redken item to detangle my hair for 20.00 and it doesn&#x27;t work half as well. I have long curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greasy and weighted down even if you use a ton too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a excellent product. I like the product anytime, I recomended this because is really what I was expecting to receive.</li>
    <li> Smells great. My wife loves the product. So do I.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy.  I have never really cared about my hair too much.  However, after a number of years of just getting a #2 all the way around, I decided to grow my hair out.  Crazy right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I ended up talking to a few of the ladies that have cut my hair at all the chain hair cut places, and the general consensus was that if I wanted to have softer hair, I&#x27;d need something like this.  Over the years, my hair has been described in various not good ways, usually by women attempting to run their fingers through it.  Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No longer do I have a brillo pad on top of my head.  My hair is soft, and I&#x27;m guessing ladies like that, cause well, they are ladies.  I&#x27;ll attempt to experiment with it, and see if they like my hair now, after I get done with this whole &amp;#34;work work gym moving work&amp;#34; thing I&#x27;ve got going on that is robbing me of all my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, it is nice to have softer hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon sales the 3 pack. I&#x27;ve been ordering this product for over a year and love it. The only other place I can find it is Walmart and I don&#x27;t shop there so I&#x27;m very happy I was able to find it here.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it keeps my hair full of moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, but seems a bit different than I remember when buying it at the store, but since I couldn&#x27;t find it elsewhere, got it here and for a decent price. Wish it were the same as the original.</li>
    <li> Good quality leave in conditioner spray.  Smells good too.</li>
    <li> great price, great value, the price on Amazon is for 3 bottles, so it&#x27;s a bargain. The Aussie product has no alcohol and it leaves my hair nice and soft.  great to used on dry hair in between shampoo days .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it right now. I have curlyish hair that is colored, somewhat layered and to my waist. I wash my hair every 4-5 days and rinse in between if I get sweaty. When my hair starts feeling dryish, I&#x27;ll put Aussie Hair Insurance on my hair, concentrating on my ends. Then I braid it and go to bed. It&#x27;s so soft in the morning!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this. Fast shipping and great product.</li>
    <li> I use it as a detangler and it is AMAZING. Perfect for early morning snarls. Smells delicious also :)&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery, much cheaper in packs of 3.</li>
    <li> Smells really good ! And keeps my hair tangle free.</li>
    <li> This product is a must for me.  It is perfect for me to use with my natural curly hair, which also tends to be naturally dry hair.  A leave in spray conditioner like this is perfect then.  Everyone also tells me how great my hair smells too.  I can&#x27;t always find this in the stores though, so I am so Happy that I can get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase and use this regularly until I couldn&#x27;t find it any longer in any store.  Stores told me it was discontinued.  I checked on Amazon, and there it was - a package of 3 at a great price.  This product is a leave-in conditioner, and works great to detangle hair.  Leaves hair soft.</li>
    <li> Works well as a detangler; makes my hair smoother. Smells great too. I&#x27;ve tried several leave-in conditioners and this is my favorite; especially for the value.</li>
    <li> It is a great leave in conditioner as well as de-tangle</li>
    <li> I have short hair that I am growing out and LOVE this product. I can use a 2-n-1 shampoo and spray this on and my hair stays soft, tangle fee and manageable. Since I work outside, I shower often and can just wet my hair and spray this in and it is great. Would recommend this product to anyone, I even use it on my 5 yr old as a de-tangler for when we are running late and her hair needs a spray down to brush it (hers is long).</li>
    <li> Use in my hair everyday!</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in conditioner and it&#x27;s so hard to find! Glad to get it in an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; deal. I&#x27;m a lap swimmer and have colored and highlighted hair but don&#x27;t like wearing swim caps. Instead, I wet my hair and spritz this into it, so my hair is saturated and the chlorinated water rolls off. At least, I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s what happens! My hair stylist suggested I do this and my color seems to last as long as it should.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
    <li> Originally I was going to buy it for my cosplay wigs to leave them smelling nice after dyeing and washing them, but I use it on my hair too. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as I thought, but I still really like this product! It also is great for detangling hair and reducing frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere I went, this item wasn&#x27;t available so I ordered it from here. Shipping was really, really quick! I ordered two days ago and received it today ( Sunday ).</li>
    <li> This is not the real product.  It&#x27;s watered down conditioner.  Terrible.  Do not purchase</li>
    <li> Totally recommend this product. I have wavy frizzy hair and it works like magic. I&#x27;ve been looking for it everywhere but finally I get it here. Shipping was good and the packaging was excellent! They come wrapped in plastic.</li>
    <li> I used to get this locally, but I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore. Amazon to the rescue! I have hair that tends to frizz, and this product is the only thing that seems to help a little. Also great as a conditioner/detangler for kids.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but you have to wash your hair a lot more often because the product gives your hair an oily look after about 36 hours. For those people that wash their hair everyday, then it should work just fine.</li>
    <li> This is my best kept secret for curly and straight hair! On days I leave it curly, I just spray this in and leave it. On days I straighten or curl my hair with heat, this offers awesome protection and helps keep hair smooth and styled. I have purchased again and again. I often can&#x27;t find it in stores, so I end up purchasing online.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner because my hair is really curly and I can&#x27;t wash it every day or it would get too dry.  So I just put this half and half with water in a spray bottle and use it every morning and then style my hair.  You cannot beat the price either!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite leave in conditioner because the smell is great, and I use it when I braid my hair to capture fly aways.  It&lt;br /&gt;s really fun.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice leave-in that won&#x27;t weight your hair down or leave it greasy--that said, I think for people with dry hair (myself included), I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s enough to totally moisturize our hair like it needs to be. But this is a very good, every day leave-in that smells soooo good! I use it on my ends when I&#x27;m putting up my hair at night, and it works great!</li>
    <li> Comb hair out after washing and spray in this conditioner, comb again - and style hair.  It leaves hair soft and helps prevent flyaway hair.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 20+ years and still swear by it for smoothing, detangling, and adding shine.  My kids have all grown up using it too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this leave in conditioner. It&#x27;s so well priced and leaves my hair feeling really soft and manageable. It&#x27;s not heavy on the hair like some leave in conditioners can be. Just a few sprays and comb through. Helps keep my natural waves in shape too!</li>
    <li> Our family has used this for years.  Then it just disappeared at stores.  This is wonderful leave in conditioner and smells great.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and can say with my dyed hair it really is the only thing to tame the beast, sometimes hard to find at my local stores, so getting here on a regular basis is great.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find this stuff.  I have fought bed head all of my life and foorced a comp through the tangles and couldn&#x27;t really get it to comb properly but this stuff changes that.  Spray some on my hair and the comb glides through and it stays where it is combed (some spots may need a little second spray) and my hair appears much healthier.  I am really sold on this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Overall good product.  It wasn&#x27;t the best at detangling my hair but worth the money paid.  I would use again.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is not sticky and I can still style my hair with no problems. Has really improved the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have long long hair that is also thick. This is a miracle spray. I usually skip sprays Ike this because they honestly never work for me. I used this for the first time when I visited my mom and she didn&#x27;t have any liquid conditioner, which would usually mean disaster. I sprayed my hair with this very generously and to my shock it detangled my hair and left it soft and nice smelling. Now I use this daily in addition to my shampoo and conditioner, or before I go to bed on my dry hair that was blown out. The price is outstanding for the 3-pack and this product is not always easy to find even in stores that carry Aussie products.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and it works great. Makes hair soft and shiny.  If you use too much it will make your hair look flat.</li>
    <li> Would prefer a non spray product.  Hard to get uniformity in distribution.  The spray seems to be inefficient and an extra step to apply the product.</li>
    <li> While I love this product, I just bought it today in a store for $3.89, so it&#x27;s much cheaper unless you can&#x27;t find it. Local Walmart seemed to have all Aussie products, except this one. Go figure, I found it at my grocery store which was a nice surprise. This product is nice and light in weight, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, and for someone like me who has wavy and sometimes frizz, this helps. I have this, the Aussie 3 minute moist, the split end one as well as it was on clearance, I switch between these and the detangler. Some have mentioned it smells like coconuts, maybe a very very faint hint of that, but I have smelled products that are heavy coconut scent and this isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a nice light scent, I cannot fully describe, but, my husband who is picky as heck about products and many are too sweet to him, he likes the scent and describes it as light, pleasant and clean, not heavy or sweet.</li>
    <li> Great on my biracial daughters hair</li>
    <li> very good conditioner to leave on......helps the hair stay smooth</li>
    <li> I bought the three-pack of this and ended up giving away 2.5 of them. It has a watery consistency and did nothing for my thick ginger hair.</li>
    <li> I like Aussie Hair Insurance, but when I use it, my hair feels dirty/greasy within a few hours. I don&#x27;t get that effect with other brands of leave-in conditioners or detanglers.</li>
    <li> Smells good, makes my hair soft, shiny and manageable. One of the more affordable hair treatment sprays by a product line brand that I trust. In use with other Aussie products or other brands altogether, this stuff is great after a shower. My husband has longer, thicker hair than mine and it makes his locks luster. His split ends are minimal and the overall health of his hair is high, during the summer he gets pretty bad frizz but this spray helps to combat that and keep his hair from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to have any cons about this stuff, it&#x27;s the fact it smells so good that bees seem to seek me out. But the buzzing terror is worth it for nice hair!!!</li>
    <li> All product arrived in a box with other stuff on time and undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aussie Hair Insurance works wonders and I absolutely love this product. I color treat my hair and after a drastic or repeated change, my hair&#x27;s always dried and fried. Aussie Hair Insurance with the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle has been the only product until the K Pak that legitimately worked to heal my damaged hair, make it smooth and shiny, and smell like summer. Usually takes a few uses to kick in but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray it in generously out of the shower and add a bit of Argon oil, let it air dry about half way and then style with the blowdryer to straighten if I&#x27;m going out and about. Otherwise I air dry, put it in a pony tail and leave the blow dryer put up. This goes a long way in repairing damaged hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave-in conditioner from the Aussie line. Classic Aussie scent (like green apples), and detangles as well as giving light extra conditioning. If you&#x27;re looking for a heavy conditioner, I&#x27;d suggest 3 Minute Miracle, but this is great for light conditioning without weighing the hair down. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores here, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it, even if it&#x27;s a little higher than store price.</li>
    <li> Nice value when unavailable in my stores</li>
    <li> I preferred the old formula. This seems to leave my hair slightly dried out.</li>
    <li> Made my hair greasy, but was a great product for my friend</li>
    <li> This product easily detangles my hair without making it greasy. I spray it on immediately after swimming and it helps keep my hair from getting crispy between the pool and the shower. It is great on dry or damp hair. It is also reasonably priced and smells great.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure stuff is the reason I still have hair. After a decade of competitive swimming and a near-lifetime of hair care ignorance, my hair slips into disrepair quickly. I use Aussie Hair Insurance before and after swimming, as well as right out of the shower. It stops most of my breakage and makes my frizzy, dry hair smooth, soft, and shiny. I love that it&#x27;s a spray because my hair is too fine for creams and gels. I swear by this stuff and used to give it as gifts to new swimmers on my team. Thank you Aussie for this incredible product!!! If it ever goes out of production, my hair is toast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, but this time around it seems to be different.  I&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;ve changed the formula.  :(</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and in good condition. Just what I was looking for, and smells pretty damn good. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good leave in and this had pretty good reviews however,&lt;br /&gt;I do not like it,  maybe if I was 13 actually I gave mine to my 13 year old niece.  The smell is too fruity childish I&#x27;m 36 I don&#x27;t want to smell that fruity.</li>
    <li> Amazed buy how low the three pack cost</li>
    <li> I use this product aafter washing my hair.  Its a great, quick way to get the snarls out without having to condition in the shower.  The scent is really nice too!</li>
    <li> Smells great! I use this once I get out of the shower to moisturize my damp hair and it leaves it soft and fresh! This is also perfect for whenever I&#x27;m in a rush and my hair looks like dying grass. This is a life saver :)</li>
    <li> Never tried this brand before, I have super damaged hair from recently going from red to pink to platinum to black, this helps as a detangler,  though I don&#x27;t think is actually doing anything to long term improve my damaged hair (I don&#x27;t think any product would though). What I like most is it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily or greasy and I can still go 2 days between washings without getting the greasy look a lot of leave in products have over time. I give 3 stars because I&#x27;m just not wowed, still looking for something that will actually help repair my hair. As just a detangler it would be a 5 though.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughters hair. Her hair is curly 3b. After washing her mid-back length hair she gets a lot of shrinkage and loss of curl after it dries. This doesn&#x27;t help with the shrinkage but it does help retain the curl. Her hair is soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> I looove this hair product and they came new exactly as I wanted. I have pretty curly hair and this keeps it conditioned, bouncy, and smelling awesome. Two thumbs up. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aussie hair products for years, including their leave in conditioner.  The stores I shop at stopped stocking it, so I immediately came to Amazon and was able to find it easily.  I have fine hair that ends up &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; around my head even using regular conditioner every day.  Using the leave in conditioner before styling leaves my hair shiny and silky.  It feels so much better using this spray as a styling base than mousse or gel, no stiffness or stickiness.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and the 3 pack is great!!!  So glad I could find this!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product for hair.  It brushes in and out easily.  The only down side is the application. I prefer applying by hand and not spray.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this leave in conditioner, it made my hair feel very heavy and weighed down, it might be my hair type. But I prefer a more lightweight and shiny leave in, this did nothing for me but leaving my hair heavy, weighed down and not shiny. I will not be purchasing this again. However I do love the aussie line, my go to conditioner that I just love is the aussie moist conditioner, that stuff rocks, I won&#x27;t be without it! but for me this leave in is not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner..bar none.</li>
    <li> Not as describable. The leave-in condition doesn&#x27;t help your hair to look better or soft. Also it is hard to push down. Do NOT buy it.</li>
    <li> I love using this stuff in my hair. This is hard to find in the stores where I live. My daughter even loves it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for longer than I care to remember. I have short hair and Aussie leave-in conditioner leaves it shiny and healthy looking. I have gone from dark brown to grey over those years, and this product still works for me. When the product became hard to find in local pharmacy and grocery stores, I started ordering it online. Thanks, Amazon, I hope you continue to carry it for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> I use this in the winter after I wash and condition my hair.  I spray it on my ends only to use it as a &amp;#34;de-tangler&amp;#34; to get a wide toothed comb through the ends of my hair.  It works great and conditions my ends, can stay in my hair once it is dry and it smells great.  I like that it is in a spray bottle, though sometimes I will spray it on my hands and apply it to my hair that way.</li>
    <li> I use the leave in to comb through my hair and it is excellent. &lt;br /&gt;It is not heavy on the hair.  After finishing my hair with  &lt;br /&gt;Aussie Sprunch Hairspray I then use the leave in conditioner &lt;br /&gt;to finish my hairstyle.  I have frizzy, dry, fine hair.  I now &lt;br /&gt;have smooth ,soft , shiny hair with no flyaways.  My hair is &lt;br /&gt;full of body.  It is amazing.  It is a miracle.  I use the &lt;br /&gt;volume shampoo and conditioner of Aussie&#x27;s too.  I finally  &lt;br /&gt;found a product that delivers.  LOVE IT.....</li>
    <li> This is a difficult product to find (leave in hair conditioner).  I found the Aussie version of it perfectly acceptable.</li>
    <li> Too strong smell,trash it!</li>
    <li> In my quest to find the best products for my hair, I purchased this leave-in on a whim, thinking the spray bottle would add convenience to my overall hair regimen. I was so wrong. This product left my hair extremely dry and difficult to manage. I expected it to work like other leave-ins and provide moisture, but all it did was suck the moisture out and leave behind something resembling a helmet. lol The bottle states that the product contains silk protein, but I think there is more protein than moisturizing ingredients, hence the hard hair. I will not be purchasing this again in the future and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> i love this product. it moisturizes, scents, conditions, and is cheap.  what more can you ask for!</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find this conditioner anywhere until I spotted it on Amazon. Because it&#x27;s a spray mist, it&#x27;s much easier to control where and how much I want to apply, which I like because my hair is fine and most bottled conditioners weigh it down, even after ample rinsing.  This spray also enhances the highlights in my hair - I don&#x27;t know why since it&#x27;s not meant to do that, but I don&#x27;t mind. The scent is wonderful and light. I purchased a 3/pk for about $11 with free Prime shipping so for now, I&#x27;m a happy camper!  Thanks again Amazon.....</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  Very good for wirey coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I like Aussie products and they smell great too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this in the mail, I was excited because I thought hey who doesn&#x27;t like softer hair? and so cheap too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for about 2 weeks and noticed that even though it smells like coconuts, it didn&#x27;t do very much for my hair like I expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of soft and sleek as I was expecting, it was more like salt water hair look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still use it, if I want to appear like me and my hair have been to the beach but for shine and sofy and sleek I like the Dove hair serum they best</li>
    <li> I have the older bottle, with the sheild on it. Not the new one with the green circle background thing. I don&#x27;t know if the new bottle has a new formula, I am still using the sheild one. This is the first leave in cond. I&#x27;ve owned since I was little. It smells really good, like the Aussie moist line. (Coconuts) I comb this through my hair after I get out of the shower and towel dry my hair a bit. I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working after the shower. I know it&#x27;s doing something though because I wet my hair and comb this through after I go swimming. It makes my knotty hair after swimming easy to comb through. If i want extra smoothness though, I will have to apply a cream leave in. I feel like this is a better detangler than a conditioner. Probably won&#x27;t repurchase, because I like to try new products.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing, and it&#x27;s worth using the rest of the bottle for that reason alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this, once my hair is dry, my hair is very soft.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve noticed any lasting results, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dislike the spray-pump applicator, as it gets tiring trying to get all your hair wet spraying it like that.  If it were a trigger sprayer I&#x27;d appreciate it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I probably won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This item was becoming impossible to find in the local stores. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  I use it on wet hair for detangling and it is great.</li>
    <li> I used it last Sunday after i washed my hair and putted rollers, blow dry, believe me after that my hair had a perfect look, nice volume, good smell and great style. I am satisfied with this product ;)</li>
    <li> This product smells good. It comes out in the hair a little sticky if you over use it. My hair is really dry &amp; fine. I found that it didn&#x27;t quite do anything special. I&#x27;m back to using Infusium 23.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I can use to comb out my curly/wavy waist length hair when wet. Love it!  :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 6-7 years. If they ever stop making it I will die. I have natural curly hair and I use this when I get out of the shower and it makes brushing my hair a breeze. The smell is incredible also. Honestly, I keep an extra bottle and mix it half and half with water,  it works just as well and still smells great.</li>
    <li> I live in dry desert climate and use this everyday on clean soaking wet hair. I scrunch out excess water and scrunch in Aussie volumizing mousse. This combo is better than any high end products I&#x27;ve tried and I try everything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aussie Hair Insurance for several years and won&#x27;t use anything else (because I&#x27;ve already tried everything else). It keeps my hair from getting frizzy and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all. There&#x27;s nothing like it anywhere. Also, the fragrance is an added bonus. Great coconut fragrance! Please don&#x27;t change a thing, Aussie, and don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> The purchase came on time and was just what we had expected it would be thanx. I would order it again</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is great.  It smells good and can be used to control frizzy hair during the day if the humidity gets to it (even though the directions say to apply to wet hair only).</li>
    <li> Horrible smell. I wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great.  I have damaged hair and this product really works to smooth out the damaged parts of my hair.  I also like the face that you can leave it in.  Really helps my thin damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner, for a bit more detailed review check the below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://allstuffreviewed.blogspot.com/2014/10/review-aussie-hair-insurance.html</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years.  I have long hair and it is so nice as it detangles my hair when I get out of the shower and smells nice as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and there is nothing like it. You don&#x27;t have to use any other conditioner. About a month ago I was having a hard time finding it in the stores so when I found it on Amazon.com I was thrilled and ordered it immediately. Having it delivered directly to my house was a lot better than driving all over town looking for it.  If you want a great product give it a try and don&#x27;t worry about it coming in packages of 3 you will love it enough to use that much.</li>
    <li> LOVE  IT  CAME ENOUGH FOR THE REST  OF YEAR, AS  I  BUY FOR THE WHOLE YEAR AND CAME BEFORE EXPECTED  ARRIVAL TIME</li>
    <li> I use the Aussie Leave-In Conditioner daily. It makes my hair feel so good. For some reason, after I wash my hair and style it, it feels awful. I started using the leave-in conditioner and my hair feels better. This conditioner doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy or stiff. My hairstylist suggested the Aussie leave-in conditioner and I&#x27;m glad. It has helped.</li>
    <li> This product has made brushing my hair much easier. My hair is looking healthier, not as dry.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  We keep a bottle in every floor and it really untangles my daughter&#x27;s hair and does a much better work than water to tame my son&#x27;s crazy morning hair.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for my hair! it makes my hair smooth and i have very thick and tangley hair! so i would have to cindition and put in so much more product for it just to comb with still some tangles! this was my savor this produt is the one and only product i use and will ever go to again! and it is perfect fot my budget!</li>
    <li> Just reordered and upgraded to 5 stars.  Love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used this for over a year and it&#x27;s great for my hair in dry climate that is so  harsh.  Having tried all kinds of shampoos and conditioners - both cheap and expensive - I find the Aussie line to work best for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and it&#x27;s a must-have for helping to keep my heap of curls controlled and conditioned. I use a little every night after I shower and occasionally in the morning, and it really helps to keep my curly hair from tangling and the ends from splitting/frizzing. It also has a pleasant, light scent, and it&#x27;s a good deal price-wise compared to other leave-in conditioners (many of which I&#x27;ve tried and not been nearly as impressed with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that I have very thick hair and thus go through a bottle of this in a month -- I wish it went a little further. Still, for the price it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
    <li> This is a good leave-in conditioner.  The scent is great.  I just wish it was a tad bit thicker because it&#x27;s very watery and runny and I prefer leave-ins that have a silkier, thicker feel.  But I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and love the ease of ordering-- by subscription. The product itself is an essential in my daily life and getting it automatically is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner ever. Cant ever find it in any of my local stores but its plentiful here. Cant go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> BEEN Using this product for at least 10 years. Wonderful smell and light application. Gets the frizzies out. Got a coupon&lt;br /&gt;On Amazon so great buy.</li>
    <li> Really takes the frizz out of my hair without weighing down or making it greasy.  I have some what thin to fine hair and this stuff is great if you straighten all the time.  The only brand I will use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this at stores since I realized I was running low and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! This stuff is great. I live in Phoenix. My hair tends to get a bit dry and frizzy/staticy. This spray does a great job of hydrating the frizzes. It also smells great. I run a comb dipped in hot water through my hair and then spray this on my comb before running it through again. I only spray it on my whole head when I&#x27;m having a major frizz day or my hair just feels dry coming out of the shower. Your hair can get that &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feel at first but combing it again once it&#x27;s dried cures that. I always pour it into a small spray bottle with the full hand type sprayer. It&#x27;s easier to aim and more comfortable to use that way. I find these small finger tip sprayers annoying.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 13 yrs. and it really helps my fine dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love this leave in condition I can honestly say this product helped grow my hair and the three pack is an added bonus I still have two left great steal I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Has a slightly coconut-like scent. I&#x27;ve realized that sprays don&#x27;t cover as much hair as the rub-in conditioners do, so if you have a lot of hair or long hair, you may end up using a lot at once. So far it has been working well!</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is actually the best. Whether for my extensions or my kinky 4C type hair, it does the job! Would buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this conditioner!  Just spritz it on wet hair and style as usual.  Ends the frizzies and leaves your hair extra soft and smooth.  I have super curly hair and this controls it nicely.</li>
    <li> The smell is too potent. It&#x27;s overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This product smells great. It has a coconut/beachy/light smell that fades so it is not overpowering at all. I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner, then spray it on my dry hair and comb thru. It leaves my hair super soft and smooth. I even used it a day after washing my hair when I woke in the morning to smooth out bed head. It does not leave your hair greasy or weighed down at all. Not sure how that is possible but I love it. I have atomic pink hair and it does not fade my color.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair thats tends to frizz. I use this every day. Now I get it sent to the house in a 3 pack, whats not to love!!</li>
    <li> I have semi-unruly curly hair and have tried several leave in conditioners.  This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried where I observe a marked improvement in my hair.  I spray it throughout my hair and also target the ends, and have noticed that I&#x27;m not getting split ends nearly as quickly as I have in the past.  In my book, that&#x27;s worth the minimal investment.</li>
    <li> It was okay but not that great. You could definitely find higher quality products for the same price. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My great grandson has long, curly red hair.  It&#x27;s hard to brush and comb without this conditioner.  No more hissy fits.</li>
    <li> Does everything it promises, smells great, and a smoking deal for 3.  I use this stuff right out of the shower as directed, but also on dry hair if I notice its a bit frizzy during the day.  It leaves hair feeling product-free, but looking great.  I am really glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I buy Aussie products on a regular basis, so I&#x27;m glad I just bought off of Amazon to save a little bit of money. I love the leave in conditioner since it&#x27;s perfect for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Its ok but not as good as other leave in conditioners like Tea Tree. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Been using Aussie hair insurance for a number of years. Am happy with this product. For some reason, is scarce in all the stores I shop in Western North Carolina. I do like the 3 pack from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Three bottles will definitely last a very long time. I use this a little after I get out of the shower from a towel dry and spray it all over my hair, then comb it through with my fingers. The smell matches the bottle, a sort of artificial grape. It&#x27;s not bad, just surprising. It makes my hair soft, smooth, and extremely easy to detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frizziness started to become less of a problem throughout my day the more I apply it at night. Sometimes if my hair is a bit wild in the morning I won&#x27;t hesitate to spray some more on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is straight, black, and moderately thick.</li>
    <li> I love this. Smells great and I like using it on the beach to keep my hair from getting knotty. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere so I&#x27;m afraid I think they stopped making it - So I bought the 3 bottles even though 1 will probably last me a year.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere but here. Lovely</li>
    <li> Aussie products are amazing anc affordable! I love the hair insurance. I have fine long hair and with this I can easily work through the knots after a wash. And it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I am working in Extreme conditions in the desert, My hair tends to be dry anyway, So I do condition to keep a shine and healthy hair. May as well use water</li>
    <li> *UPDATE* I have been using this product for almost 2.5 years now and it really works great in my hair. My hair type is extremely thick and curly and can only be styled when wet. I spritz this on before applying gel, mousse, and hair spray and it really helps to keep my hair soft and healthy. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily at all, I feel like it all absorbs very well too even when my hair is wet. Over all I would recommend this product no matter what hair type you have, it&#x27;s good quality.  Inexpensive and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. I also have a much more expensive leave-in by it&#x27;s a 10 and it&#x27;s not a huge difference between the two. This stuff works great for the price :)</li>
    <li> It smells great, but I&#x27;m afraid I found very little help as a detangler.</li>
    <li> it does make your hair feel silky soft but it has a very strong aroma and stays with you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;initially i really really hated it so i sparingly use it but you do get used to the smell... but it is very overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish they would make unscented ones next time</li>
    <li> My favorite leave in conditioner/detangling spray. Works well at detangling and smells so good. I feel like my hair is healthier because of it.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff as a leave in conditioner...  It holds well enough that nothing else like hairspray is needed..  I used to use the detangler from Pantene, but it is no longer available that I can find.  This is almost as good and does the job..</li>
    <li> This works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this leave-in conditioner and it does a really nice job of keeping my hair untangled! I would recommend this! It is also a really good buy and a good price for three of them! I was able to buy one at Walmart first and once I saw I liked the product, I was so excited to see this deal online!</li>
    <li> I have used this Aussie product for years. I have dry hair that tends to get frizzy, especially in the humid weather of the South. This product keeps your hair soft and smooth. I love the smell of all the Aussie products and buying this through Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program, you get this at a great savings. I would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff every time I was my hair and set it.  It&#x27;s a conditioner and setting lotion in one.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner arrived in a pack of three in one loosely molded piece of plastic. Sadly, they had leaked everywhere! Not impressed. I was able to wash the bottles off and salvage them. Three stars for the product, two stars taken away for the sticky state they arrived in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it is not great for thick hair in my opinion, but works well on finer hair. There is a slight coconut-like scent, almost tropical. I wouldn&#x27;t use too much or it can make the hair oily. It&#x27;s hard to find this Aussie product in stores anymore, and I love these for traveling. It&#x27;s easy to pop one of these in a bag with this kind of a cap. I love that it comes in a pack of three!</li>
    <li> My go to for a leave in conditioner. Not too heavy so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. And the smell is delicious!!</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair that needs a lot of moisture. This product doesn&#x27;t even come close. I think I&#x27;ll stay away from spray conditioners.</li>
    <li> This would be good for someone who has healthy hair and wants it to help keep it that way. It doesn&#x27;t have any scent to worry about. It helps with miner tangles. It leaves hair easy to style. Would be great to have on hand because of price, if you have healthy hair or for kids. It doesn&#x27;t help with hair that&#x27;s already damaged besides making wet hair easier to comb thru. It doesn&#x27;t repair damaged hair or prevent tangles thru out the day. I bought a 3 pack and each bottle had to be transferred into a different spray bottle. The nozzle on each didn&#x27;t work. So make sure you have a bottle on hand to transfer this into if you buy it. If you have healthy hair &amp; want to keep it that way, this is an affordable way to achieve that. If you have damaged hair, buy a better conditioner. This doesn&#x27;t work well enough to waste money on. There is many other conditioners that will work much better for damaged hair. I don&#x27;t see myself buying it again. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to others who have hair damage and want a good leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair product for six years now. It&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find in stores, so I was really happy to see that Amazon had it for a good price. I constantly get complements on how good my hair smells simply because of this leave in conditioner!</li>
    <li> I ADORE this leave-in conditioner! It smells nice, it works great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty feeling residue in my hair! I have very curly hair, and live in a humid climate. This stuff was GREAT for humid days. I use it EVERY day after showering, before I put in any other products, and it helps keep my hair from damage due to styling products. If I use just the conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and less frizzy. It&#x27;s WONDERFUL stuff, and Amazon has a GREAT price!</li>
    <li> Works wonders on your hair, use it after your shower and do not rinse.</li>
    <li> I love ALLLLLLL of Aussie&#x27;s hair products. but this has to be my favorite by far. it leaves your hair smelling amazing and helps keep it manageable.</li>
    <li> i thought it was going  to be more of a detangling conditioner sort of spray product&lt;br /&gt;this just leaves my hair smelling really good..oh well i still like it</li>
    <li> This product smells good but does absolutely nothing for my hair. I bought this after running out of my Matrix Biolage leave in conditioner thinking it&#x27;d be a good cheap alternative. My hair is long thick curly and dyed so I need a good leave conditioner but this is not it. I order more of the Matrix it&#x27;s well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I cant really find this in the stores anymore...but this product smells great and makes my hair sooooo soft.</li>
    <li> Love this product, and can&#x27;t find it in most stores these days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aussie Hair Insurance Leave-In Conditioner for quite some time and I can&#x27;t live without it. Once or twice I went without it and my hair turned out frizzy. Using it...no frizzies! It helps define my curls and tame my hair. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell though it&#x27;s hard to say exactly what the smell is... I&#x27;m leaning towards some kind of coconut drink. It seems to keep tangles out of my hair better than conditioner alone which is a relief, my hair tangles if you so much as look at it. My hair feels softer and might make it behave better than it usually does, I&#x27;ll have to keep trying to see if it&#x27;s just in my head or a real effect. This is the first leave in conditioner that I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to any others.&lt;br /&gt;I deducted a star because the scent is a bit strong for me. Then again, I can&#x27;t stand to have perfume sprayed directly on me because the smell is far too strong for me, so take it with a grain of salt.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years &amp; as with everything else it is getting hard to find replaced by &amp;#34;new yet not improved&amp;#34; items.</li>
    <li> I have found Aussie Hair Insurance to be a big help in saving time in the shower.  Why not spray on conditioner?!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and my local store stopped selling it. thanks for providing for me!</li>
    <li> this review does not address how well the product works or not because I only tried this out one day as a stand alone for the follwoing reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this is reminds me of the beach, sunscreen, or a tanning bed.  Since I don&#x27;t live/work near a beach or have a need to wear sunscreen all day or smell like coconut I choose not to use this daily by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to condition weight:  it&#x27;s a light condition the doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it appear oily in any way. On the negative I have very prone to frizzy hair and this doesn&#x27;t help with that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I can&#x27;t just use this product by itself due to the reason above, I will not review this any further.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner</li>
    <li> Even if this product changed a little bit, it still works great!  Untangles my hair like no other!  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great product, love it, please don&#x27;t discontinue it or try to improve.  does the job for me now, very convenient to use and pack for travel</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it does seem to help detangling my hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that it makes my hair soft.  I might buy again because of the price and detangling capabilities, but won&#x27;t count on it as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my curly hair so soft and bouncy...I love it!!!</li>
    <li> No matter how many other leave-in conditioner products I try, this one CONTINUES to be my absolute favorite.  When I don&#x27;t use it, my  hair is &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; for it.  When I do use it, my hair is more manageable, less frizzy and more healthy looking AND feeling.  Aussie makes a quality product, and Amazon offers it at a very fair price.</li>
    <li> It is the only thing that works on my hair. It stops the static and keeps it calm and wavy. Love it1</li>
    <li> smell good and light weighted leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used Aussie Hair Insurance Leave-In Conditioner for more than 20 years and love this product.</li>
    <li> Wrote a review for another aussie product.  We&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years now and my wife is very pleased with how it makes her hair feel and how well it takes tangles out.  It is hard to find this consistently so we&#x27;re pleased to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Just what I was looking for! Smells amazing! Conditions without making hair greasy. Can&#x27;t find this in stores where I live.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for a pack of three. My main selling point was that I can put a cap on it and throw it in an overnight bag; not all leave-in conditioners have this function and I&#x27;ve found the majority of them to have a pump-cap top (not really an on-the-go feature). Before this purchase, I&#x27;ve used Milkshake leave-in conditioner (ordered here on Amazon), which also works well (same type of cap that&#x27;s good for traveling) but is more expensive-around $20.    This product seems geared for fine hair, in my experience. It smells good, but it does take quite a bit of it in my hair to get tangles out. I can&#x27;t imagine it would work well for extremely thick hair. For the price though, you can&#x27;t beat this. It&#x27;s also hard to find in stores.    One big complaint-this arrived with the bottles having leaked. The bottles were all in one piece of linked plastic, and while the caps weren&#x27;t totally off any of them, they were all sticky. I cleaned them off, but it&#x27;s not a nice way to receive a product.</li>
    <li> excellent detangler.  I always spray before combing out knots in my long hair</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner!</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff. Just don&#x27;t go overboard..will make hair feel oily.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Keeps my curls curly and flyaways at bay. Cheaper than at the drugstore. Smells delicious.  Pleased.</li>
    <li> A really good, inexpensive spray on, leave in conditioner.  Comb, spray and you&#x27;re on your way.  Has a very mild coconut sent that reminds me of the water/ocean..</li>
    <li> The best leave in hair conditioner out there!!  Spray into your wet or dry hair and it leaves your hair super soft.  Gets rid of static and the appearance of dry split ends. Whether you blow dry your hair or let it dry naturally, this non-greasy spray on conditioner is the one I use every single day.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that is easily weighed down by standard wash and rinse conditioners. That&#x27;s why I LOVE this product. Just a little spritz or two gives my hair the conditioning and moisture it needs without weighing it down. I have been using this product for more than six months now and I really love it! I would highly recommend it for anyone who has fine hair or hair that is easily weighed down by product build-up.</li>
    <li> makes my frizzy kinky hair so soft.  It keeps its curl but is very soft and manageable now.  Great Price!</li>
    <li> As described, fast shipping. Arrived in shrink wrap with no leaks. I use this when I brush my hair out after the shower, a few spritzes of this and no tangles! Leaves hair soft afterward, too, without being heavy.</li>
    <li> Smell is good and works well</li>
    <li> Works best in my daughter hair</li>
    <li> I have very dry, thick, coarse, curly hair. Was skeptical about this product because of the cheap price, but I had used Aussie products years ago, and thought I&#x27;d try it. LOVED IT!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice Scent. Light, and fresh&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair shiny and soft&lt;br /&gt;De-tangles&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Prevents the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Not heavy, greasy, or waxy&lt;br /&gt;Refreshes my curls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I use this product first, after towel drying. I then also use a conditioning balm, and sometimes a bit of gel. I find that I can \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; my curls the second day after shampooing with this product and it looks great. No bed head!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products but this is the best by far. It leaves my hair soft &amp; manageable. It takes moments to spray it on like mist all over your hair. When it dries it&#x27;s beautiful! I would recommend this product to every one!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my two girls&#x27; hair. They both have curly hair. I&#x27;ve tried other products and finally found this one. I started using amazon because my local Wal-Mart never kept enough in stock.</li>
    <li> Love this for my daughter who does not like to brush her knotty hair. Can spray this on dry hair and brush through like magic. Seems to leave a bit of residue at scalp but won&#x27;t stop me from using every last drop. Smells lovely.</li>
    <li> works pretty good for my beautiful hair, and the price is good. smells like coconuts, so its not for everybody.</li>
    <li> I love it and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> always use aussie, awesome product i use the conditioner and shampoo as well.  h h h h h h h</li>
    <li> Has always worked best for me</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. I have very long hair, and this product greatly helps to keep it tangle-free after I get out of the shower. It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and makes it feel nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff is especially great for permed or curly hair.  It also keeps straight hair nice and soft and has a pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> Actually helps with frizz.</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t do much for my type 4 afro even when I used a sealant with it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for coarser hair types at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes your hair soft not greasy. A true weightless product. It also arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but helps keep it soft and protects it from the blow dryer. I will make sure I always have some on hand so  don&#x27;t run out!!</li>
    <li> This used to smell like coconut, doesn&#x27;t anymore. It used to get tangles out much easier than it does now. I wonder if the product has been changed? It&#x27;s ok, but I am going to look around for something that works a little better.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair conditioner off and on for about four years now and I like it best. It works to help untangle my ruthless wavy/curly/spirally mess of hair after I shower, and leaves a pleasant smell :)</li>
    <li> I love  this stuff, I invested stock in this I put it in my hair and little girls hair when it dry before I Put in a ponytail and it makes the hair feel soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use the 2in1 shampoo and my hair has a tendency to tangle easily but when using this it doesn&#x27;t tangle and hair is nice and soft plus I love the little smell it has. Will be my go to from here on out.</li>
    <li> its like i say that about any aussie product.&lt;br /&gt;They do amazing stuff...&lt;br /&gt;The feel of my hair when i put this on is simple awesome.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Aussie Leave In Conditioner for many years. It leaves my hair soft and easy to manage without  feeling the conditioner residue like other products.</li>
    <li> Not only does&#x27;t it work on frizzy hair, but it has a horrible, sweet scent!  I should have returned these immediately, but ended up having to throw these out!  What a waste of $$</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...i couldnt find it where i usually purchase it so i bought some on line&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is great for naturally curly hair or anywhere with high humidity!!!</li>
    <li> I use this at the beach to and on the boat to help prevent snarls.  A quick squirt and comb through are all I need. Spraying before I go into the water helps prevent snarls from happening.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it after I throw velcro rollers in my hair.  A squirt and then let my hair dry or a blast with a drier.</li>
    <li> this product smells really good and seems to detangle my hair well.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product for the money.. like having it delivered instead of running to the store..</li>
