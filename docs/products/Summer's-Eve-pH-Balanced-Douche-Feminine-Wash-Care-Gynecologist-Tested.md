    <li> I love this wash and it keeps me clean with NO irritation.  I am happy about that.  However, when I opened my box of three, one was completely opened and spilled out everywhere.  What a mess!</li>
    <li> I had never used Summer&#x27;s Eve before but I would see it in the stores (and I liked the new packaging) so I decided to try it out since regular soap had started causing me problems in that area. This (the wash for sensitive skin) smells like a wet dog. I&#x27;m not gonna lie. The smell isn&#x27;t good buuut it does work. I feel fresher and cleaner when I get out of the shower and it doesn&#x27;t burn, unless I am freshly shaven. I would definitely buy again but probably in a scented one that smells better.</li>
    <li> i use this wash everyday to keep me feeling fresh. i have very sensitive skin and cant use a lot of products but ive never had any problems with this one.</li>
    <li> So I suffer from problems down there, this really helps keep the ph balance under control. I have been feeling a lot cleaner and it has no smell!</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle wash, not scented wish is preferable for this type of product. It works really well with their Powder.</li>
    <li> In the beginning. I was in love with this product it felt so good after I showered it was amazing until a few days ago that my area began too feel different it would hurt when I would use the bathroom I started discharging and my vagina got swollen to make long story short I got a yeast infection because of it and I don&#x27;t want to bash this product because I really did like it I just liked it too much and was using it everyday so my lovely ladies beware it is not ok to use this everyday even though its says you can. Use it if you dare just use it in moderation good luck!</li>
    <li> Gave me a horrible itchy rash with buttons that took 7days to develop and after a month i still have it. Didnt buy it on Amazon  but dont trust this product for sensitive skin!!</li>
    <li> great, I really like it just the opening is a little big so it took some time to get used to and not dispense 3x more than wished,....&lt;br /&gt;I already reordered,....</li>
    <li> This is a good soap. I have been using it for a year and wouldn&#x27;t change it. Good price too</li>
    <li> wish it wasn&#x27;t an add on item</li>
    <li> I should have read everything closely. I am used to getting a fair price for products from Amazon Prime and thought this was going to be a multi-pack for the price I paid. Not the case, this was more than double what I would have paid locally. I hope Amazon pays attention to their vendors to be sure pricing and product are not so far out of line. I know I will have to scrutinize what I purchase to a much greater extent.  Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for any woman looking to stay fresh all day! The product doesnt irritate me and Im left with the cleanest feeling when Im done</li>
    <li> I bough Summers Eve for my Dog... I am a freak about clean dogs,  so i have to bath my Dog every night before he gets into bed with me....  Everyone tells me... it is no good for the Dog... his skin is going to dry out... Blah Blah Blah.... Well I wash him every Night with a little summers Eve and he does not have dry skin.  He is 7 months old and I have been washing him every night since 7 weeks</li>
    <li> Hygiene is very important to me. This product has always worked well. Leaves you feeling fresh and smells great. here powder works great too!</li>
    <li> Best feminine wash I have used so far since the brand that I&#x27;m used to is not available in local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Everything about me seems fresh and clean. Ladies purchase they item, it is a must have for any and all women</li>
    <li> Great product, gets the job done</li>
    <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get you 100% clean unless you wash twice and the freshness wears off sooner than with other brands</li>
    <li> I love summer&#x27;s eve products! They are great for travel, hot summer days, for after you do the &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; and every thing else inbetween &#x3D;) #jussayin</li>
    <li> Love using this cleanser; the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  I really like using it from time to time.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I guess it does its job. it doesnt have too great of a smell though. it smells like windex or kaboom bathroom cleaner. but its not a really strong smell it just doesnt smell that good. but i have sensitive skin and so far i think it works nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I used this last night and a little while later i had a horrible rash all over my body and it was terribly itchy and uncomfortable. even though this says sensitive skin, its not sensitive at all. do not use this.</li>
    <li> Well I used it one morning while I was taking a shower, two hours later it caused me to start a period. I wouldn&#x27;t be concerned other than the fact that my birth control (which is an IUD) prevents monthly periods.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been working, definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive and using regular soap is not an option for me unless I want to itch like crazy!  I have tried other washes, but this works very well for me.  I love the sensitive skin line and I had tried all of the scents, I love them all.  It smells great, is an awesome cleaner, is very affordable and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff, Keeps You fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that I am too smelly down there. This is just an amazing feminine wash that smells good, and make me feel super clean.</li>
