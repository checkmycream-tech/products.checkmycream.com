<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> OMG! OMG! OMG! I&#x27;m shockeed ! I didn&#x27;t expect this will be sooo hugeee, I thought it&#x27;s something really small ! I&#x27;m so so so happy ! It&#x27;s big, it has a loot of space, it&#x27;s amazing ! I&#x27;m just so happy cause I get something I didn&#x27;t expect ! Thank u so so so much !!</li>
    <li> l use this on my dresser and I really like it. The dimensions are correct on the website and it really holds a lot. The only think I am not so keen on is the raised sections in the back. It is more for lipstick but that was not what I wanted it for. I put my barrettes and clips in them so it works well enough for that. Overall, the quality is great for the price if your are looking for some organization.</li>
    <li> large compartments, love it</li>
    <li> Nice organizer, good quality and thick acrylic.</li>
    <li> very good product, as described</li>
    <li> well, it is smaller than the pic</li>
    <li> This is the best make up organizer I have ever used. It looks classy and clean and holds a large amount of product. It is extremely sturdy and well made. Every girl should have this in their vanity.</li>
    <li> Its perfect for lipstick and makeup! However you cannot fit Essie, or OPI nail polish in the slots (back left or right) of the organizer. I ended up putting my nail polishes in the front part of the acrylic.  The slots in the back are perfect for lipstick, mascara, lip gloss etc. Other than my nail polishes not fitting this is such a cute organizer and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> great little thing that has managed to make my bathroom not look like disaster area! all my makeup fits on it amazingly</li>
    <li> Great organizer! It holds TONS of different products and tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simply and stylish and will go with any styled decor you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the top container areas are pre-formed for lipstick or fingernail polish. If the tray had optional separators it would be a 5 star item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my makeup it looks very nice</li>
    <li> Came in super fast and well constructed. Love it! It doesn&#x27;t take up the whole top and keeps it all organized nicely.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this. It is generously size enough to be useful without being so large it becomes decor.</li>
    <li> I really likes this one it&#x27;s so big and for a great price other stores charge way to much and their so tiny, this was perfect for my hair products and lotions.</li>
    <li> it is true to its size meaning what you see on other reviewers&#x27; images is what you will get. it is stury and well i love it! i dont owe a lot lot of makeup but i did fill this baby up. i simply loved it!</li>
    <li> Love this!  It was a gift! It fits all my make-up that I use on a daily basis. Its now easily organized on my vanity.</li>
    <li> it is the perfect size, it fits on may vanity. I never have to dig thru a drawer or a one of the those old fashion &amp;#34;tackle&amp;#34; boxes I used to keep my makeup in. It is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic organizer to keep your makeup and brushes organized.</li>
    <li> Consistent with picture.</li>
    <li> Perfect for makeup storage!</li>
    <li> In my dreams I&#x27;m an organized person, but in real life, I&#x27;m definitely not. This organizer has helped me come closer to realizing those dreams and I was very pleased and surprised by the quality. It has some great weight to it and lets me see everything I use on a daily basis. If you&#x27;re a make up hoarder like me, you&#x27;ll be pumped. Get it.</li>
    <li> Very nice sturdy organizer!!</li>
    <li> This product made my makeup easy to find and it takes less time for me to find my things every time I go to do my makeup. If you are having makeup organizational issues this product is defiantly a must have. :)</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! It holds my makeup brushes, perfumes, lotions, nail files etc. Looks great on my dresser, too!</li>
    <li> This is the organizer I have been looking for. I have large bathroom vanity and it fits perfectly.  It holds all my essentials and then some. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The only reason why it got four stars was because it had a slight crack in it when it came. It wasn&#x27;t packaged to well on the inside of the box, but over all I love it. It was an over all great buy.</li>
    <li> Love my vanity with all the acrylic organizers. I bought two of these. They let you see everything and are so easy to clean.  I LOVE AMAZON!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Cosmetic Organizer- The acrylic organizer is larger than expected and the price was unbelievable- nicely packaged.  Very satisfied customer-Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> A little pricey for the item that it is; some of the holes are a little shallow. Overall it&#x27;s good for makeup brushes and some small items.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I thought it was going to be! A large amount of makeup can fit in it and the slots are a good size. A great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> It is working fine for me. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> It came to use with a crack in it, yet it had to suffice as it was a birthday gift I needed right away.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer. I have a closet in my bathroom, and it fits beautifully on one of the shelves. It is very attractive and well constructed. In the two taller compartments in back, I put things like scissors, nail file, electric toothbrush, mascara and comb. It makes it really easy to grab those things. The smaller compartments are great for things like nail polish, lipstick and foundation. The only limitation I can think of is that the smaller compartments on the sides are not tall enough to keep lipsticks from tipping over. That is not a big issue though. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good price! sturdy! it completely did the job it was supposed to.. I love it , keep my make up in order  and easy to find</li>
    <li> OMG for any one that loves to be organized this will be your baby!!</li>
    <li> Got this makeup organizer for my vanity table and it&#x27;s perfect. It keeps all my daily use makeup right there in front of me and easy to put things back once I&#x27;m down with them. It&#x27;s very helpful and the material feels sturdy. I&#x27;ve already gotten a couple for friends and family as gifts.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of cosmetics, and this keeps everything neat and easy to find. Has lots of room, holds a ton of stuff.</li>
    <li> My pride and joy. I love it</li>
    <li> Sturdy and we&#x27;ll put together.  It exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Came in very good shape.   It is as advertised Makes My dresser more organized.  Would use in bathroom or other places.</li>
    <li> Should have thought it over before purchasing. Gets dirty quickly.</li>
    <li> Really awesome. Has plenty of storage compartments and organizes products well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a no-frills organizer that works well for me!  Plenty of space to put my cosmetic items.</li>
    <li> Excellent! She uses it every day at her vanity.</li>
    <li> It came fast and looks great I wish it was a little bigger but its worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product is very strong thick plastic and looks fabulous! It looks so great on my dresser! Way better than some mirrored vanity tray! I do agree with many reviews that the side holes in the back need to go all the way to the bottom, as of right now they are like a steps up to the top and do not allow you to put anything longer than a tube of lipstick (of which I only have three shades) If these holes were deeper there would be more places to put my brushes. I have many brushes that are the same but used for different purposes and I do not wish to accidentally pull out my eye shadow brush when I am wanting my concealer brush... that would be a disaster! I do like all the short compartments in the front. It allows me to lay out my powders and gives me a place to put things like perfumes and nail polishes. I am a Mary Kay consultant so I have a TON of cosmetics! (I like to try and use all the products that I sell) and so this tray gives me a place to put out all my cosmetics so I don&#x27;t have to search for them in a drawer! I am in love with this thing!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this along with 2 other acrylic drawers to store my makeup. This organizes my brushes and lipsticks perfectly!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her new cosmetic organizer.  It has lots of sections, the back is elevated for easy access, and it isn&#x27;t too deep so fits into a narrow cupboard.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Good size. Very hard to clean; I have to wash it in the bath tub every time.</li>
    <li> It was cracked. I had to send back</li>
    <li> Perfect for the cause....</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife.  Her make up and cosmetic stuff was everywhere.  She loved it and I love it too.  We have a clean counter top again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Excellent organizational tool.  It fit perfectly in my drawer.  The largest holes are great for brushes or tall items such as lipgloss and eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Amazing product very durable and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I was hoping to maybe exchange it for something smaller- it actually doesn&#x27;t fit on my vanity. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Being a messy person and having all of my makeup and brushes all over my counter top and bathroom drawers, this organizer was a godsend.  I was worried all of my makeup wouldn&#x27;t fit, but for the most part everything fits, if you have a lot of lipsticks I would recommend just buying an extra lipstick holder. Otherwise this is a great size, price, and quality.</li>
    <li> The reason I dislike this product was because when it came it had not one, but two cracks in it. I think that the damages could have been prevented if the packaging was properly prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product it very spacious and has a lot of compartments for all your cosmetic appliances and it quite longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first ordered the item it was the wrong item shipped to me and than I ordered it again and it was sent to me with 2 cracks in the item in two different locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very frustrating ordering an item you for and the wrong one comes and than they send you another item and it comes damaged.</li>
    <li> I ordered a make up organizer and paid $20 for it. I was extremely disappointed when I opened the box and realized they sent the wrong thing. I received small spice containers instead. I won&#x27;t trust amazon with anything else.</li>
    <li> Awesome Sauce, spanks so much</li>
    <li> This cosmetic organizer is totally useless for it&#x27;s intended purpose.      It has a variety of compartment sizes and several small ones which would be ideal for storing things like mascara, eye liner, lipstick, etc. if the dividers between the compartments weren&#x27;t so short.  The items you place in the small compartments tip over immediately and cannot stay in place.  Furthermore, the smaller compartments are so tiny, they cannot be utilized for any other products - nothing else will fit.      I was so disappointed by this purchase ESPECIALLY because it is advertised as an organizer for cosmetics.  Why make a product that cannot perform the function you dedicate it to?!?!?!  I sent it back, but of course I had to pay the shipping so this purchase ended up being a waste of time and money.  I do not recommend this organizer for cosmetics  nor for organizing anything else.  Totally useless!!!!</li>
    <li> Strong, sturdy and very clear.  Lots of spaces for make-up items.  I like this and highly recommend this product.  I think it could also be used for holding craft-type items.</li>
    <li> Broken and badly packaged. Will not be ordering another.</li>
    <li> Whether it is under the cabinet or in a closet, this is a great organizer for most of your basic essentials to pull out every morning and go and tuck away.   No more looking for items and stressing to find cosmetic items.   I like that it has individual compartments and neat clear appearance.   Would probably love to have a tower built in the middle to stack more stuff, but hey, it is a good product otherwise.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my daughter. In her words: Very satisfied. Product very versatile and holds everything I&#x27;ve got, with room to spare for future purchases.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and best of all made in the USA</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this. It&#x27;s plastic but doesn&#x27;t look cheap. It has plenty of room for all of my makeup. I&#x27;ve had everything in bags for years and it was just driving me nuts having to dig through everything in order to find what I needed. I have an eye shadow pallet with several different colors that I use a lot and that one doesn&#x27;t fit in any of the compartments, so I keep it in another place. Other than that, I&#x27;m very content.</li>
    <li> Very well constructed. Excellent price. Def would buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfect organizer for my cluttered desk. Now my makeup is neat and I have more room on my desk. I wish there was a section for my Q Tips. In the photo, it seemed like the little sections on the side (ascending up) were much taller than they actually were. However, I cannot complain because this organizer is such a good deal.</li>
    <li> The compartments are too small for eyeliner pencils or brushes. I tried to use it for a couple weeks, but it just ended up frustrating me when things fell over all the time. Takes up a lot of space and not very useful.</li>
    <li> My husband got me this after I saw it online. It works great for my cosmetics especially the smaller items. I would have loved it if there was a covered section for my brushes. Overall it&#x27;s a neat organizer.</li>
    <li> Awesome make up organizer love it super convinient!</li>
    <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic organizer, much better than you can tell in the picture. Although it is made out of plastic, it is a heavy duty very thick plastic so hard that it looks almost like glass. I also have this company&#x27;s vanity  organizer for large items and it&#x27;s the same great quality, so I think you&#x27;d be safe in ordering any type of vanity organizer from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compartments are all pretty short, even the ones all the way in the back, but because of this I think it will fit in many drawers. I wear very little makeup but I use it for the bit I do use and all those other things that clutter up my vanity, like my hormone creams (that come in small syringes), perfumes, tiny bottles of essential oils, etc. It is very pretty and I set it out on my bureau, where it really looks as lovely as(and is way more useful than) those expensive mirror trays. I think it&#x27;s beautiful and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem expensive just for plastic, but for not what you&#x27;re getting because it is so well made. I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this one. The real thing to remember is---SHORT---it&#x27;s great for short items. Order the company&#x27;s other larger vanity organizer for bottles of hairspray and other products like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> I got this for my roommate as a present. I was looking for something tangible that she could use for a long time and finally found what I was looking for! The cosmetic organizer came with the original packaging inside of the Amazon shipping box and was in perfect condition. This organizer fits perfectly on a dorm desk or shelf and holds all of your essential makeup items. It is simply perfect and a great deal for the price as well!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s perfect. came when it was supposed to and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted it to be. I love it so much</li>
    <li> given as a gift and my neighbor loved it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS, IT HOLDS UP SO MUCH MAKEUP, AND IT LOOKS SOOOO GORGEOUS ON MY VANITY, SUPER SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE :) I 100000% RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT (:</li>
    <li> Love it! I can organize all of my makeup now</li>
    <li> after have bought so many things on amazon, this is really my 1st time writing a review. b/c this is just 1 of the rightest stuff i v ever bought..! &lt;3    OMG i have to say that this is the best cosmetic organizer i have EVER used!!!!  it just holds every single thing that i need in the morning, or before a party!    i know all we girls have just toooo many make - ups or beauty products and we just cant stop buying more and more of them    to be honest, i still have like 3 bags of cosmetics having nowhere to put. BUTTT, this organizer is definitely enough for my daily use (unless i am going to a halloween party!)     pls dont expect it to hold all of your cosmetics---- there are always too many of them!    just put your everyday use make ups in it and i garenteee it is way enough ..!    PLUS! i HEART the brush compartment.! it holds my mirror so its like 2 birds 1 stone!    and to me this is the best looking cosmetic organizer on amazon... i love the decent curve shape !    PLS also check my uploaded pics of it in the \\&quot;gallary\\&quot; &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> The tray us wide enough that it can fit most of my creams which tend to come in short, wide jars. The tray is also pretty and elegant.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my daughter in-law as a  gift.  It a good product, not to fancy but does the job.</li>
    <li> Perfect for organizing the things you keep on your night tables and also looks great!</li>
    <li> Is not very functional for me. A personal problem for my collection of makeup</li>
    <li> This is the second that I have purchased - worth every little penny. think retail price is accurate. May purchase yet another as a desk organizer. Delivered very quickly in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Love it! It fits almost all of my make-up perfectly! Only doesn&#x27;t fit eyeshadow palettes, which is ok!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what i would be with out this!  Oh yeah very unorganized. Lol. It&#x27;s great. I keep all my make up and brushes aswell as Bobby pins  in the front. Let&#x27;s me access everything. I do have a lot of make up but have been able to be more organized with this.</li>
    <li> Its very sturdy, and big enough for most of my makeup, perfume, and hair products. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Where has this been my whole life?! I feel bad that I have spent my life without this organizer. My makeup and hair products were formerly stored in plastic containers. This has eliminated that need, and I get to see all my makeup on display so I don&#x27;t miss out on using products that were formerly lost in the chaos of the makeup tub. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful organizer I absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this organizer before purchasing, and all the GREAT things that were written was completely true.  It&#x27;s a great place to put all the little cosmetic samples you get at the department store. I did buy another organizer for my tall bottles. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Overall a nice organization tray for my makeup drawer. However there&#x27;re a couple of design flaws:  1&gt; I can do without the rounded corners. The rounded corners make the smaller sub-spaces in the tray almost un-usable.  2&gt; It&#x27;d have been nice to have two levels (stacking) on the front so you can fit more products in it. The back section for the brushes are too short to really fit any big brushes.</li>
    <li> I use this to hold my everyday makeup. I love it</li>
    <li> This is the handiest container I have ever used for my makeup.  There are deep spaces for long brushes, eye and lip liners, etc. and shallower spaces for lipsticks, short brushes and make up bottles.  This will hold all of your makeup products as I have all my eyshadows, blushes, lip glosses and makeup and face creams in one place.  It is easy to cart around from one bathroom to another and keeps the makeup all in one place so you are not always looking around for something.  For me it has solved my storage problem nicely.</li>
    <li> This actually holds a lot more than I expected. All the beauty storage item&#x27;s look tiny and seem to have steep prices! I spent a long time procrastinating on choosing one and finally purchased this. I use it to store brushes, powders, lipsticks, lotions, perfumes, nail polish, lots of Luminess Air make-up (stack up nicely in back deep spaces) , liners, mascara, etc. I have to admit that it was worth the price because my husband is happier with the added space and clean look it provides, plus it makes me faster because everything is easier for me to find. :)</li>
    <li> This is a perfect organizer and container for all cosmetics and accessories.  Everything fits well and is easy to see.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> Very good quality! Received as promised.</li>
    <li> VERY Nice but a little large for most vanities or dressers.  I would have liked it to be (perhaps) 4&amp;#34; less wide.  The organizer is great tho.  Very durable and nice looking</li>
    <li> This item is well-made, sturdy, and holds up well.  It has some important flaws which led to my eventually selling it in my garage sale and getting something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not well-designed:  Except for the middle two, the back compartments are too short to hold anything well.  I don&#x27;t need that many lipstick compartments, and anything taller (including manuy lipsticks) are too tall and end up falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that does fit back there fits better somewhere else, these compartments end up being of little use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two back middle compartments are long enough, but onw has a choice of either putting in a whole bunch of things which, to me, is messy and not well-organized, or puttin in a few and having them inadequately use the space and fall to the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no flat compartments, either, of a size and form to hold makeup brushes and the like. There is some space in the middle front-most compartment for things like mascara, but I tended to need morespace like this, for mascara, tall lipsticks, etc.  There is simply nowhere else to put them and this is inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted space for both powder and blusher.  There was space only for one, which was a major problem. The middle, middle compartment has some space, but it is not ideal, or sized, for my own compact, especially with its curved shape, and there is size for only one compact on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be perfect for you, but didn&#x27;t work for me due to the above issues. I recommend that you think carefully about what, specifically, you have to put in the organizer, and which compartment, specifically, you expect to put in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it fits your specific needs, I haven&#x27;t seen one that is better-priced or better-made at this price.</li>
    <li> What an awesome way to have your make-up right there at your fingertips. It looks pretty too. Nice and sturdy...i may buy as gifts for next Christmas.</li>
    <li> I bought this organizer in 2009 and am still using it today. In fact I just threw it in the dishwasher to clean it up.  That shows it is long lasting, high quality and a great asset to my vanity table.</li>
    <li> Finally, an organizer that fits all my cosmetics. I&#x27;ve tried so many configurations and this one seems to work best. Great price and looks pretty good too. Most of the divided places are large enough to fit a few items and the back can fit all my brushes. I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> I cannot wait to get up in the morning and sit at my vanity desk. Everything is so well organized now. This is worth every cent.</li>
    <li> You can store so much, great for everyday makeup. Also love the versatility. I would definitely recommend buying one !</li>
    <li> It looks exactly like the picture. Now the things I use every day that I had to keep in my make up and toiletry bags are easy to access. Love this.</li>
    <li> Arrrived in acceptable time.  Organizer compartments are great; exactly what I was looking for. I would purchase from this sell again.  Highly suggest looking at what they have to offer!</li>
    <li> Love it!...my makeup is now organzised.  Perfect...way better than using a makeup bag unless I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with the product. I wish it could be slightly taller and much less deep.and makes it less likely that the makeup will get splashed due to proximity to the sink.</li>
    <li> Great it fits great on my bathroom counter. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean. I can fit a lot of my makeup in the organizer.</li>
    <li> How did I ever live this long without it?!?!?!?!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and I am very pleased with it.  It meets my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> Now everything is at my fingertips instead of being in different bags &amp; drawers. The only improvement might be to make the 16 lipstick compartments deeper to accomodate products besides the lipsticks. I, personally, don&#x27;t have that many lipsticks &amp; nothing else really fits those spaces. They don&#x27;t go all the way to the bottom of the organizer so that is some wasted space.</li>
    <li> This product showed up exactly as I was expecting. It has plenty of room for my makeup accessories and fits nicely on my bathroom counter. It is a bit large so if you are tight on space, I do not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This organizer is just the right size for all of my beauty items! I am so glad that I found this one. It works so much better than jumbling everything into a basket!</li>
    <li> I have grown to like this item but I expected the side compartments along the slope to have higher walls to separate sections. I wanted to put makeup brushes on the side but they tend to fall over since it&#x27;s shallow and don&#x27;t have individual sections. It&#x27;s more meant for standing up lipsticks . I just put the thinner brushes in the big middle sections.</li>
    <li> I really love this cosmetic organizer.  I bought it to go on my vanity and keep all my makeup and makeup brushes organized, and it&#x27;s perfect for that - it has compartments of all different sizes that are ideal for different uses, and I appreciated that it had so many lipstick compartments because I have a ton of lipstick.  Great for the price, and it looks nice too!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great experience</li>
    <li> This is very good quality.  The sections are several different sizes which come in very handy when organizing.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the height of the dividers in sections in the back (I call them the lipstick sections) are only 1/8&amp;#34; tall.  So it is more like having 4 sections in the back rather than having 16 brush or lipstick sized compartments.</li>
    <li> Holds almost all my cosmetics&lt;br /&gt;Very very sturdy love it&lt;br /&gt;Everything at my finger tips!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy for granddaughters.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughter!</li>
    <li> Love this organizer. I do makeup so its so convenient when im getting myself ready in the morning and its spacious and too cute on your dresser.</li>
    <li> LOVE this organizer! My bathroom counter has been a mess for months with my continuously expanding makeup collection. It fits everything I use on a daily base, plus evenings out. I haven&#x27;t found an issue with the \\&quot;lipstick\\&quot; compartments-- although I don&#x27;t wear lipstick, I put my shorter brushes, pencil sharpener, lip polish, stick blush, and brow gel in them. It keeps me perfectly organized so I can get ready faster in the morning! Also, as others have said, the plastic is pretty heavy-- very durable and well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something to keep your makeup out on your counter without looking messy, this is an awesome buy!</li>
    <li> I was very impress when I saw it!! It was worth reading the reviws and buying this product I would recomemded</li>
    <li> I ordered this Cosmetic Organizer in Acrylic and it is perfect!  It arrived in a very timely manner, and I can organize all of the makeup (finally) in it, and it looks good on my dresser too!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any fellow makeup junky who has more accessories than they have room for.  Also, if you are like me, and need things to be organized and efficient, this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very satisfied customer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sara Jane :)</li>
    <li> Durable and holds everything.... looks so nice and tiday !!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s broken just after using 2 months</li>
    <li> Great real well , I love it very well put together package came out great all of it is wonderful</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife because she didn&#x27;t have anything with which to organize her makeup. This organizer was affordable and feels like it has good quality. It has compartments of different sizes to hold brushes, lipstick, and all that other girl stuff.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I expected but that ended up being necessary when I started filling it with all the stuff on my vanity. Simple and very useful</li>
    <li> This product arrived to me on time, and it was very well packaged. I love this product. It is great for keeping all of my makeup organized and easy to find.</li>
    <li> This is a great organizer for makeup and brushes. It without question helps organize my space. Very durable. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Item was sent in a timely manner without any scratches or marks and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent prduct. The quality is very good and it is big enough to hold cosmetics I use daily. I am happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was just what I needed.</li>
    <li> My teenagers are thrilled!</li>
    <li> I got this to use to store pens and other office items.  If you look closely at the picture there are horizontal platforms to the left and right of the two tall middle compartments.  The compartments with horizontal platforms don&#x27;t hold tall stuff because the horizontal platforms go across the entire interior of the compartment.  Mine arrived broken---I&#x27;m sending it back since it won&#x27;t work for office application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff: the unit is crystal clear, sturdy enough that it won&#x27;t get broken in normal use, and very smooth almost everywhere except very minor, small dimples that were needed (guessing here) for the manufacturing process.</li>
    <li> Great, fast delivery and cute item!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a wicker storage container that I had used for my cosmetics, on my sink.  I am lucky enough to have a big vanity area on either side of my sink, so I keep my cosmetics out all the time.  I was tired of the heavy look of the wicker.  This clear organzier is great.  The area looks bigger around the sink, even though I have the same amount of stuff.  I am able to put mascara, eyeliner, lipsticks in their own spot, and blush, powder etc in their own as well.  I like the look, and the acrylic is heavy duty, not lightweight, so I anticipate it will last, and not break easily.  Plus, once its placed, I don&#x27;t see that I will be moving it around all the time, although it is easy to lift and clean the area.</li>
    <li> I bought this organizer to hold all of my everyday makeup on top of my vanity table, instead of keeping it in the drawer.  For me, it holds a foundation, set powder, bronzer, blush, highlighter, two 4-shadow palettes, several lipsticks and glosses, mascara, primers, pencils and everyday brushes with room to spare.  Most of my makeup is MAC. I love that my makeup is organized, clutter-free and easily accessible for every day use.  It seems to be well made and isn&#x27;t cheap looking, like a plastic organizer would be.  Worth twice the price.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My wife love this organizer...she has been looking for something like this&lt;br /&gt;for a long time that didn&#x27;t cost a ton of money...Nice and solid item with&lt;br /&gt;plenty of storage for all her makeup....Great product for a great price !</li>
    <li> Can fit so much stuff and helps me keep my makeup organized. Love!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this organizer!!!!! It holds all of my makeup and makes it so much easier to do my makeup now where everything is in one place. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this! It fits perfectly into my closet where I used to have 3 or 4 different makeup bags. I can see all of my makeup and tools, getting ready is so much fun and more enjoyable now that everything has its own place. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It looks great on my vanity in my bathroom.  It fits enough make up on it for me.  It looks like glass but its plastic</li>
    <li> So glad I got this. It really helps me to reach for what I need quicker and to get my face on quicker lol! It is lightweight and holds quite a bit and I love that I can just pick up a tray full of everything I need and bring it to my mirror and everything is in reach and stays organized. Very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Okay, I have to acknowledge that I&#x27;m not as thrilled w/ this organizer as I thought I&#x27;d be. My disclaimer- I am only advising what works &amp; what doesn&#x27;t for me, personally. I realize that for some purchasers, this organizer would be absolutely ideal. So I&#x27;m not attacking the product. It does fit beautifully in my vanity shelf- the dimensions given are spot on. It is strong &amp; well-made, not too heavy, but is clearly not going to warp or bend like a cheap plastic piece would. Before owning this, I used a Bare Escentuals expandable bag. It was okay- it has nice stretchy rings for holding lipsticks, glosses, mascaras, and two fairly big expandable zippered sections. But it was in a dark color, and sometimes my professional makeup brushes were too long for the case. With using different color schemes all the time, having everything all jumbled together in two big zippered pockets to sort through was a real headache. If I was less of a makeup junkie &amp; only wore one set of the same products day in &amp; day out, it would be easier. But...I am who I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It depends on the type of makeup brushes, compacts (or containers), size of lip products (especially lipsticks &amp; glosses), and the size of liners used that will determine how happy one would be w/ purchasing this, IMHO. For my purposes, this organizer has some limitations. It holds everything that I have- but not in an ideal fashion. My makeup is mostly Estee Lauder &amp; Lancome, to give you an idea of what sizes of products I&#x27;m trying to fit into this piece. I own a moderate amount of brushes, around ten or so. I have full makeup for the eyes (which includes an eyeshadow quad for each tone, a matching darker liner for top lashline &amp; a lighter shade of the same color scheme for lower lashline) in plum/purple, grey/black &amp; brown/beige/taupe. I have lip liner, lipstick &amp; lip gloss in three separate color groups, too- plum/berry, deep peach/coral &amp; cool pink. This is to give you an idea of what I have to store- a packet of pocket tissues (to wipe off brushes after use), cosmetic wedge sponges, one bottle of liquid foundation, one stick concealer w/ a brush to apply it, a pressed powder compact, a large contouring compact (a matte, taupe-y bronzer) &amp; angled brush to apply it, one blush &amp; a blush brush, one Smashbox highlighter compact &amp; a big powder brush to apply that, the aforementioned eye &amp; lip products, two brow brushes, a small pot of eyebrow color, an eyelash curler &amp; two shades of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick/gloss slots are large, but are VERY shallow. If they come up half an inch, I&#x27;d be surprised. This causes my lipsticks to wobble &amp; fall over easily- I really assumed, especially given the cost of this organizer, that the slots would be higher &amp; hold my products more securely. It&#x27;s hard to see in pictures what I was really getting (even though people have put photos on here full of what they own, which I greatly appreciate &amp; used to decide on buying this). I realize that some people buy products that are oversized. But the lipstick slots could&#x27;ve still been just as big in circumference as they are right now, and yet be high enough to prevent spillovers. I&#x27;m not pleased when things are falling over &amp; out of an organizer, obviously. There are enough slots for what I own- but, surprisingly, not much more. My brushes all have to be put together in the left-side largest/highest slot (in the back of the organizer). I&#x27;d really prefer an organizer where I could still have that same TYPE of storage, but that separated my face &amp; eye brushes from each other. Unfortunately, there simply isn&#x27;t room here to do that, so they&#x27;re jumbled together. There are no long horizontal slots where you can lay a pencil or brush flat, either- my mascara &amp; all my liners (lip &amp; eye) are in the right-side largest/highest slot, by default. I have to lay my eyeshadow compacts, blush &amp; highlighter against each other on their side, vertically held up. There isn&#x27;t room to store them all flat. I&#x27;d honestly prefer to be able to lay them flat, instead of storing them like books on a library shelf, because then I can identify in a flash which product/color scheme it is. My blush &amp; eyeshadow compacts are indistinguishable when on their side, because they&#x27;re exactly the same compact style. They are identical, except for the description on the back &amp; product within. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to all of this eventually, but again, I&#x27;d really prefer to be able to categorize my products by type for ease &amp; speed in my morning makeup routine. Having to search through my entire collection adds time to my routine (which was what caused me to look beyond my BE makeup bag!), and that&#x27;s exactly what I was trying to minimize. There are also no closed slots within the organizer (possessing a lid, I mean) or drawers. So if you don&#x27;t use a product often, it&#x27;ll obviously gather dust, since it&#x27;s out in the open. However, I knew that when I bought it. I just wish I could&#x27;ve found an organizer of the same size, but w/ a little more thought &amp; care put into the design. I highly doubt that it&#x27;d please a professional makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had my act together as a minimalist &amp; only used one color scheme of products, I&#x27;d probably like this a lot more. I honestly think it might be better suited for storing toiletries like toothpaste, deodorant &amp; body cream for me personally, not makeup. Time will tell.

    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, easy to clean, and stays put.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is laid out in front of you, makes getting ready so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for the essential products of a makeup junkie :)</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for myself and two for my best friend across the street.  Now I don&#x27;t have an unorganized junk drawer full of makeup and I can actually FIND what I&#x27;m looking for now!  yay!  I&#x27;m about to buy a 3rd one to keep all my newly purchased nail art supplies in. :)</li>
    <li> I love this organizer.  Wish I had purchased it years ago.  No more fumbling around searching for my daily cosmetics.  A place for everything, and everything in its place.  Cuts the time it takes me to apply makeup in half.  Love it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This organizer could actually be bigger, with taller compartments in the back row for brushes, but I am nonetheless very pleased with it.  I need to start throwing out expired cosmetics anyway and get down to basics.</li>
    <li> Great organization!  I love all of the different sections in it.  Heavy Duty as well.  This is not made out of cheap plastic</li>
    <li> Worked out really well for me, I love it.  It is, however, a bit large.  If you have a small bathroom chances are it will take up all your counter space, but it does keep everything neat , organized, and accessible.</li>
    <li> its really great for organizing all my make up instead of it being all over my desk. Very convienient. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these so badly and FINALLY treated myself.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great starter organizer, but I know I&#x27;ll need more for lippies.</li>
    <li> Love It! It&#x27;s my second one and I have used my old one for years! Decided to get a sparkly new one!</li>
    <li> Fits just enough of my everyday make up &amp; plus some. Its perfect. Going to buy some for my friends. If you are looking for an acrylic organizer, this is it.</li>
    <li> I Love This Product! It has really cleaned up my bathroom counter and kept everything easily accessible! which makes my husband love it too!</li>
    <li> Having read some mixed reviews I took a gamble on this organizer; I am really glad that I did! It is made very well; no cracks or scratches (and this was after the delivery person dropped the box on my front porch). Amazon even packaged this so well; I was quite impressed. It houses A LOT of makeup! I&#x27;ve posted some pictures for reference. The drawers slide really well, they don&#x27;t stick (even with all of the products inside). Well worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my makeup and skincare items fit perfectly. The upright storage on the top is great for easy access to brushes, lipsticks, and I even use one cubby for my palettes. I find that it&#x27;s way bigger than it looks in the picture. Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a while!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Please click &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; if you agree. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Used it to organize jewelry, love it!</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom for xmas and she loved it.  It was a perfect gift for someone who already has everything.</li>
    <li> I have my organizational sanity back and my sink is free and clear except for the essentials - toothpaste, toothbrush, soap.  Everything else had a place previously with the daily stuff slowly encroaching on the sink bowl. Now I have no worries when I wake up I see nice clean sink top with all of the lipsticks and q-tips and eyeshadow, eyeliner, dear god does the list go on.  Love the person who made this.  Its very solid plastic, lots of space for random sized makeup stuff and large enough compartments to make it fairly easy to clean out from time to time.  For the price, its a great buy.  Very happy boyfriend b/c of this product.  Thank you.  Also, the shipping protection was fantastic.  Love to see companies package their product expecting the worse,  I&#x27;ve had much much more delicate electronics shipped to me with a heck of a lot less buffer materials in general not paying attention to stress points.  All which this came with.  Good stuff right here - good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer it holds all my makeup and easy for me to get to it no need to go threw my makeup bag just to look for something. Its a really good size got it fast too it took maybe about 4 days for me to get it. So recommend this well money spent.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I expected and great for keeping some of my makeup collection more organized. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This organizer is exactly what I was looking for. Spacious, sturdy, and stylish. It lets me keep all my favorite products right on my dresser, including all my mascaras, makeup remover, lotions, perfume, etc. 100% recommended, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who need to see my makeup or I wont use it, however I don&#x27;t want a mess all over my vanity. This was the perfect solution! It keeps me organized while looking beautiful and keeps the clutter at bay. I will probably by another as my collection has grown.</li>
    <li> A must have for any make up lover&#x27;s vanity or bathroom shelf!! Keeps everything neat and organized, taller spaces are great for brushes and pencils, smaller ones are great for lipstick!! Would also probably be useful as an organizer on a desk!</li>
    <li> I really like this as a way to organize my makeup and nail supplies, although I don&#x27;t have that many lipsticks, so it would have been nice to have another \\&quot;high\\&quot; section to hold brushes and liners and such</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! it fits my dresser perfectly and is great quality! would def buy again! also got the acrylic cotton ball and swab holder!</li>
    <li> It was nice..but hought it was bigger</li>
    <li> It was lot bigger than I thought it would be. It holds all my makeup, but isnt too bulky. My only complaint would be that the lipatick compartments are too shallow, but they are definitely still usable. Very helpful in organizing my makeup!</li>
    <li> this is THE organizer . It shld be made the new def of organizing. I dont ramp thru my make up bag anymore cos it is there staring at me at once.</li>
    <li> I like this. However I would venture to say that this would be better suited for makeup. I dont wear make up so therefore this is useless to me.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cosmetics organizer.  It&#x27;s just the right size to sit on the bathroom vanity and it has a place for all my cosmetics.  It keeps everything neat and organized and I can remove all my stuff at once when I clean the vanity.  I seriously don&#x27;t know how I got along without it.</li>
    <li> The acrylic organizer is very nice and it fits my porpouse I&#x27;m a make up artist &amp; skin care therapist so for make up this is not enough space I use acrylic drawers for that, but if you don&#x27;t own too much make up it might work for you keep in mind though that the spaces meant for lipsticks are just too shallow they could have make them deeper to hold the stuff you put in there better, avoid using acetone or any other strong quimical near to it because it would ruin it all you need to keep it clean is a moistened wipe, I added a pic for more clear understanding of my point.</li>
    <li> ..This cosmetic organizer is pretty cool. It&#x27;s perfect, you won&#x27;t believe how many items it can hold. Beats the cluttered make-up bag in my drawer.. lol..</li>
    <li> You know when every once in a while you buy something that turns out to be better than expected? Something that puts a smile on your face because you know you didn&#x27;t get ripped off. A product that didn&#x27;t cost a lot and does exactly what it says it does and you don&#x27;t have to put anything together. Something that makes you think \\&quot;why didn&#x27;t I buy this sooner\\&quot;? Well, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the dimensions. It&#x27;s large which is why it holds a lot of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;. The arch design in the back holds your taller items: brushes, mascara, pencils, liners, etc. without them falling over. It&#x27;s divided into two compartments for better organizing. Compartments next to these are slightly elevated for easy viewing.&lt;br /&gt;There are great pictures posted of how much it can hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really cleaned out my makeup drawer. I turned my organizer sideways against the wall so it&#x27;s longer rather than wide. Made of thick plastic. Easy to clean with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a great gift too. Very affordable and something anyone who wears makeup would love to receive.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected, but is okay.</li>
    <li> The dividers for the lipsticks are too shallow to really hold anything.  Other than that, it is a very sturdy plastic and much cheaper than buying something of this size in a store.  Lots of compartments for everything.</li>
    <li> perfect for organizing cosmetics on vanity top.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase, the product came in perfect condition and is the perfect make-up organizer for me!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cosmetic organizer.</li>
    <li> Awesome so far. Larger than I expected which is a bonus. I&#x27;ll be able to put my foundation powders on the large area in front, brushes in little holders where they won&#x27;t fall over, there&#x27;s a place for everything!</li>
    <li> First off, let me start by saying that I was BLOWN away by the size of this thing...it&#x27;s huge! I got it thinking I would be able to fill it up...man I was soooo wrong. I&#x27;ve put every stitch of makes in this thing and I STILL have lots of space left. I&#x27;m a very happy girl!</li>
    <li> Really big an can contain all my makeup. That&#x27;s what I wanted. Furthermore, we can see it all at the same time because of the good disposition of the separations.</li>
    <li> I looked a long time before I bought this organizer.  It is large, but I have the space.  Actually, it goes sizeways on my makeup table.&lt;br /&gt;I would measure carefully as it is very wide.  It holds all the things I formerly had in a big basket on my table. Now I can see what I have and I feel much more organized.  I am very glad I found this organizer.</li>
    <li> great, not too small, not too big.</li>
    <li> I received this and I love it. It&#x27;s very heavy and sturdy. The only thing was that when shown in direct lighting there was weird streaks. Thinking it was dust I washed it but it didn&#x27;t go away. It&#x27;s not noticeable when filled with all my make up so I&#x27;m not too concerned about it. Also for all of you asking if real techniques brushes fit in it, they do! :)</li>
    <li> I use thus daily and it works perfectly! I wish there were more compartments but I make it all fit :)</li>
    <li> Thick, clear and so far zero complaints from the wife. Organizer is heavy but durable. Some of the areas dont have deep pockets for lipsticks,brushes etc but overall great product. It was either this organizer or the one from The container store which was 17 dollars more.</li>
    <li> This product came very quickly and is perfect for organizing my beauty products.</li>
    <li> This cosmetic organizer is fantastic! It has enough compartments to store lipsticks, lip glosses, brushes, bronzers, eye shadows, etc.  I was able to put my Q-tips and cotton swabs in 2 of the compartments (not something I was originally planning).  The organizer itself is a great size (not too big, not too small) and sits neatly on my counter.</li>
    <li> Love it !! Before purchasing i was scared it would be too small , but is perfect ! I love it !</li>
    <li> I really love this organizer that helps me to get and keep all the cosmetic stuff in one place! It&#x27;s very convenient and keeps all the things at hands...</li>
    <li> I love this organizer for my makeup,i put my essential makeup that i use everyday on top of my vanity so it&#x27;s in reach and i don&#x27;t  have to go through my makeup case to find my go-to makeup and brushes. Very sturdy and well made.i bought this 3 years ago and it still going strong</li>
    <li> It is A bit bigger than I expected (so it takes a bit of space, which Is not good but not bad either), but overall it is a good item. It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I really like this container. It keeps all of my cosmetics nicely organized and in view for easy selection. I sat it on the shelf of my white metal stand over the toilet. Looks good there and is so convenient.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure of the size when I ordered it, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the organizer was even roomier than it seems in the product picture. It currently sits at the top of my bathroom counter (I plan to move it to its own space with the rest of my beauty supplies), but it doesn&#x27;t even take up a lot of counter space which is useful. I don&#x27;t have a huge make-up collection, but a little more than the average person, so this was a great investment. I was able to fit everything important in the container.</li>
    <li> Nice clear, hard acrylic organizer.  Actually seems a little bigger than in the picture.  Attractive &amp; orderly.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The item had a scratch on it, not too big but still pretty obvious, had to return it</li>
    <li> This organizer is very sturdy! I really was expecting something of mediocre quality, but this is great! It is nice, thick acrylic. I wish the lipstick holders had a higher dividing wall between them because those that are side-by-side are easy to knock over, but it hasn&#x27;t been an issue so far. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so wide (from front to back) but that&#x27;s not an issue either. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who&#x27;s got a lot of makeup they like to use or switch between on a regular basis... It keeps everyone out and easy to see/find without it being all over the counter. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> product arrive nicely packed so as no damage could occur. some parts could be deeper but its a nice product to spread out all your cosmetics in to organize.</li>
    <li> Organizer is great for my 15 year old to store her makeup, personally I prefer to store mine inside drawers and would not work for me, but she loves it.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this was it was a lot larger than I expected it to be but I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the measurements given. That wouldn&#x27;t be so bad but my makeup doesn&#x27;t fit into it nicely. I wanted something to buy to organize makeup but unless you have exactly the right product nothing stands nicely. The lipstick spots in the back aren&#x27;t deep enough and whatever I place there ends up falling over. The front middle section would be better if it wasn&#x27;t divided in two. You&#x27;d have a lot more options on what can be placed there. Maybe this would work for some people (which is why I gave it 2 stars) but for me it just doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I needed a place to get ready in the morning, due to a small bathroom in current apartment. This works very well and keeps everything organized and easy to get to. I was very suprised about how big this actually was. I thought it was going to be smaller. I got it based on the price and other reviews. It&#x27;s very heavy and sturdy too. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs one.</li>
    <li> I give it five stars because it worked so well for my wife and because the price for what you get is amazing. One thing my wife wanted was an extra taller space for her brushes so she didnt mix them with her lip glosses. Easy, any small plastic bottle cut or a very small box with the top cut off fit into one of the lower smaller squares works perfect. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Loved it. My makeup is organized and displayed perfectly.</li>
    <li> This product has helped my organize my makeup drawer greatly. I didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars because the lipstick holder divider is a bit shorter than I had hoped. My lippys sorta topple over because there isn&#x27;t really a divider that separates the 4 (see photo). It looks great, its lightweight and makes finding my stuff much easier. BUT!!! Customer service is great! The company really cares about what their customers think, so I had to give them an extra star for that! I&#x27;m glad I purchased this and its a good value.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cosmetic organizer! I use it all the time and it has so much room for all of my makeup supplies. It&#x27;s definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> So sturdy!  It&#x27;s made of a thick acrylic--not like those cheap, flimsy ones.  This is the best investment I have made for organizing my makeup.  I see everything which helps me to make sure I am not wasting anything.  Shipping came within the time frame, and no damage upon arrival.</li>
    <li> I chose four stars because I like it but I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great way to organize my make-up and free up some counter space. I like that it is clear and has lots of compartments. However, I would have liked it more if it had fewer lipstick compartments in the back and instead had a couple of small deeper compartments like the two in the back center. I tend to use more lip gloss than lipstick. Also, the lipstick compartments are exactly the size of a square tube of lipstick so too small for even a bottle of nail polish to fit in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front compartments are shallow and various sizes. They have worked really well for my powders, moisturizers, mascaras, and smaller items like tweezers or hair ties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the whole thing is nice if you want to be able to see your inventory or get to items more easily than tossing in a drawer or make-up bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if you have more than a few make-up tools or items and need some counter space.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I was able to fit more makeup on this than I thought. Great buy.</li>
    <li> This cosmetic organizer is not very big, but it fits great on my bathroom counter. Although it doesn&#x27;t hold a lot, it keeps what I use the most organized. One thing that I really dislike about this organizer was that there are too many lipstick slots. I do not use lipstick, and I doubt many women have 8 lipsticks they want in the tray. I wish the space was made differently on the tray so that I could better utilize the space.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> This holds a ton of makeup. It is nice and sturdy too. There is a section in the back that is perfect for lipsticks and publishers. It holds them straight up without them falling down</li>
    <li> I love this! I used to have my makeup either scattered all over the counter or in a makeup case where I could never find anything! This is perfect, and my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind it!</li>
    <li> This organizer is so beautiful. It holds all of my current makeup products and perfumes. This is such a great way to display all of your beauty items.</li>
    <li> While the quality of the product is good. I received my package cracked and a chip in the back of the product. The product was poorly packaged. Why in the world you place an acrylic product that would easily break in a plastic bag and a regular box. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Perfect for arranging your makeup !</li>
    <li> GREAT SIZE AND STRONG MATERIAL ! bigger than I thought and fits all my stuff pretty good!!!! Love it</li>
    <li> this is an amazing makeup organizer! this holds all my supplies I need for getting ready for the day and for bed! this has a lot of compartments that are big and hold all your products! it&#x27;s very strong and sturdy that can hold a lot!  The only thing is that I wish the makeup compartment holders were a little deeper So they didn&#x27;t fall over easy, but other than that, it&#x27;s great! 5 stars! I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Great make-up storage option.  If you have an average make-up supply, this is a great storage option to keep your make-up organized and accessible.  If you&#x27;re a make-up addict, this may be too small for you, but for the everyday girl that has a basic supply, this is a great storage option to organize your make-up.</li>
    <li> Perfect for organization in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I love my organizer! It holds everything plus room for more! I would highly recommend it for a girl who has a lot of makeup</li>
    <li> Fits a good amount of products. Nice quality.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s perfect for organizing all of my make-up. I only wish it was even bigger than it already is, just because I have so much make up. Still, I managed to fit everything in nicely. I would totally recommend this!</li>
    <li> Only thing I&#x27;d change is to have a few deeper slots for tall eyeliners....otherwise this is great - well-made, sturdy, and classy-looking....and very well-priced!</li>
    <li> I would of liked if the part that holds makeup brushes would of been deeper. It doesn&#x27;t really hold all the makeup that I wish it would. It&#x27;s nice though.</li>
    <li> Organizer is made of sturdy acrylic. I liked it for what it is. Takes up a lot of room on my vanity/desk, but I like that it holds a variety of things. As others have noted, the back &amp;#34;lipstick slots&amp;#34; are too shallow to hold anything well. I&#x27;ve tried putting mascaras, lipsticks, and primers in there, but they all fall over.</li>
    <li> I was looking for organizers to store my Alcohol Ink Art supplies in. I already found the storage containers for the inks (see my review of Clear Organizer with 2 Removable Drawers ) but none of the storage options in the craft supplies area seemed to work for my other supplies. I came across this Acrylic Cosmetic Organizer and decided to give it a try. It is perfect. The area to the back has 8 sections (where you would normally keep lipsticks, eye liners, mascaras and the like.)  I keep my straws, coffee stirrers, tooth brushes, droppers, palette knives, sponges, stamper with felt stamp pads in this area. There is one large section that holds my misters, sharpies and marking pens. The other side has 4 sections that hold my alcohol bottles, extenders, spritzers and any other small bottles. The middle section holds cotton balls and the front section is perfect for holding Q-tips. All of these things are needed when working on my Alcohol Ink paintings and it is so nice to have a place to keep them organized. My studio also serves as a bedroom so when company comes, it is so nice to be able to pick up the whole tray and store it away quickly and neatly. The clear tray measures 15&amp;#34; W x 9&amp;#34; D x 4 1/4&amp;#34; H (at it&#x27;s highest point in the back) It could use rubber discs on the bottom to keep it from slipping but this is something I can add to it. I am happy with this solution to my Art supply organization problem.</li>
    <li> This was everything I needed. It came so quickly, now I can finally organize all my cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Before this lucite holder I stored my makeup in a few small makeup bags, then I transferred everything to one large bag. Either way I found myself continently looking for what I needed and quite frankly it was annoying. This case is amazing, it&#x27;s not too bulky but has enough compartments to hold all my daily makeup, along with multiple lip sticks, nail polishes and glosses. Extremely fast shipment and delivery. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good condition. Fits on top of my vanity perfectly with room to spare. Now all my makeup is out of my bags and is easier to see and access--love it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my niece and she says she likes it.  She has sooooo much make-up I figured she needed something this size. I don&#x27;t have anymore info on it from my own experience.</li>
    <li> It came promptly in the mail, packaged very securely and in perfect condition. It&#x27;s a great addition to the bathroom shelf, and much better than my wicker basket!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great organizer. The only criticism I have is that some of the sections are awkwardly sized for eyeshadow/foundation palettes, so they don&#x27;t fit right. Overall it was what I was looking for, so I would recommend it to someone who needs a make up organizer</li>
    <li> Wonderful large cosmetic organizer. Looks exactly like the picture. Feels really durable. It fits two of my lotion bottles, makeup, makeup brushes, and small tools like tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is there are only two deep back slots.... The ones trailing down are shallow meant for lipstick. They&#x27;re too small for nail polish... Not deep enough to hold a small eyeliner... And I don&#x27;t have more than one shade of lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this item again regardless. It&#x27;s very cute to sit on a vanity to display my makeup.</li>
    <li> This makeup holder is too shallow to really hold anything.  If you try and move it the items fall out of it.  The back section is made for lipsticks and can&#x27;t really be used for much else.  I hate it and had to buy something different.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Best purchase hands down! Finally a way to organize all my makeup . The plastic is very durable also and if dropped prob won&#x27;t brake</li>
    <li> Good quality and lots of space. All of my makeup products fit nicely and are easily accessible. The product is well made and durable.</li>
    <li> I got this to reduce clutter around my sink but when I put everything in it still looked all cluttered.  Gave it to my daughter though &amp; she&#x27;s happy using it in her vanity.</li>
    <li> This organizer was just what I needed. Rather than having makeup and brushes strewn across my dresser there is now a place for everything. I could&#x27;ve used a larger one, but this actually meets my need and I&#x27;m qutie satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really love this organizer! I am very impressed. I got my package on time and was so excited to get it. I have a lot of make up and have a hard time organizing it the way I want to. This is the best organizer I have seen for such a great price :))</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and looks gorgeous on my dresser. Lots of room for all my makeup and beauty items. Great way to keep your makeup organized.</li>
    <li> So when I was buying this online I didn&#x27;t really think it was going to be this huge thing. It was very nice it held all my makeup. It almost didn&#x27;t fit on my bathroom table where my makeup is. LOL</li>
    <li> Loved it, the plastic is not cheap at all and very durable! It looks great on my dresser.</li>
    <li> Beautiful strong acrylic organizer bigger than I thought super happy with this purchase strongly recommend if your hesitant go for it</li>
    <li> just the right size I needed!&lt;br /&gt;Very practical and good looking. Keeps all my stuff clean, &amp;#34;organized and dont have to look for my stuff all over the house!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my teenage daughter who was constantly cluttering up the bathroom counter with her make up and stuff. This fits perfectly off to the side of the counter and keeps the clutter contained. I wanted acrylic because I figured she&#x27;d get make up on it and at some point it would need to be washed off. I wanted something that I could put in the sink or the dishwasher and clean. I haven&#x27;t had to do that yet but at least I know it&#x27;s an option instead of getting a wood one. The acrylic is a good thick weight. It&#x27;s not cheap thin stuff. It&#x27;s made really well and has a perfect assortment of spaces. I looked at drug stores, Target, and Walmart before buying this one. I really like this one the best out of all of the ones I saw.</li>
    <li> This has really come in handy.</li>
    <li> I love it. It helps keep my cosmetics organised and it fits neatly in a drawer so I just open and all my cosmetics are in one place.</li>
    <li> I wish the lipstick holders on the side were just a bit deeper for those of us who don&#x27;t wear lipstick, but all in all, this was the best makeup organizer I found.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Prompt delivery. I was able to end the clutter of my makeup in a drawer. This organizer allows all my make-up of various sizes to be neatly store and readily visible.  So happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I could fit lots if my make up, every thing is nice and organized, I could see all my staff! Love it!</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for an organizer that was big enough to hold all of my go-to makeup products.  I found it in this one.  For the prices it has plenty of room for all of my stuff.  My only compliment is that I wish the side lipstick holders were a little deeper (because I keep knocking them out) and the front side holders are not quite big enough.  But besides that--it works for me.</li>
    <li> I sit on my floor in front of a full length mirror to put my makeup on. I needed something to store all my makeup that didn&#x27;t look like a Caboodle, but still looked organized. This fit all my make up that I use daily and all my make up brushes.  It&#x27;s sturdy and looks much nicer than I was expecting. I paired it with the Acrylic Lipstick Organizer and it looks great!</li>
    <li> The quality of the plastic is very good.  It doesn&#x27;t feel thin and cheap at all.  This thing was just what I needed for my bathroom counter.  Now my makeup isnt all over the place but kept neatly organized.</li>
    <li> My 17 year old daughter filled this up in no time and loves it.  It has many varying sized compartments making it easy to grab what you need.</li>
    <li> It looks so clean and allows me to organize all my cosmetics,make up, brushes , quips etc. It&#x27;s so nice!</li>
    <li> Nice product for the price.  Good value.  Ready to use and in good condition.  Well like by recipient.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> I like my organizer! It&#x27;s a nice size for smaller counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just have so much makeup that it doesn&#x27;t all fit. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great thing to pick up to help make your counter space not look so cluttered! It looks really nice. Sturdy, too.</li>
    <li> Wish I had purchased this product sooner !! I had some initial reservations .....was concerned the product wouldn&#x27;t really hold that many products but I was worrying for nothing. I have a fair amount of makeup and while truth be told it doesn&#x27;t hold all my arsenal ..it is able to hold my most frequently used products. This organizer holds my  multiple lipsticks, makeup brushes, eye liners, eye&lt;br /&gt;shadows, foundations , lip glosses and more. If u are worried about size no need to be. Another concern of mine is that the clear plastic would clash with my wooden baskets and other makeup containers but it didn&#x27;t. The plastic does not look to be cheaply made of an inferior material.&lt;br /&gt;If u purchase I&#x27;m sure u will b pleased.</li>
    <li> Plenty of space to store makeup, brushes, lipstick, lip gloss, pencils, mascaras and even jewelry you wear everyday. You will be pleased with the ample space it saves your bathroom countertop or or makeup drawer.  Everything is easy to see and reach. Clutter will be minimized, if not eliminated.  I like it and my daughter who is a professional makeup artist approves. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this because it looks great in my vanity area. It has a sturdy build, and plenty of space. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying my cosmetic organizer. It looks amazing on my dresser. Now I can finally keep all my tons of makeup from cluttering on my dresser! And as a added bonus- I get compliments every time a female steps into my room.;)</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and usefull for my make-up. Thanks</li>
    <li> Purchased the product and gotta say so far so good! I&#x27;m a moderate make up gal I probably have more tubular or eyeliner type make up containers so this fit well for my needs. I was able to fit at least 10 eye shadow compacts in a compartment. Has plenty of spots for lipsticks. Displays everything quite easily. No complaints perfect for my needs!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful asset, table accessory and ally for any woman. Get it now!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best organizer tray that I have found so far for my items. Just the right size with just enough spaces for everything. Not only do I keep my makeup and makeup brushes in order, I also keep my face serums and lotions on it as well and everything fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much I really needed one of these makeup organizers until I had one. everything is in reach and insight so now I always get to use the makeup that I want. this was the perfect size to fit on my vanity.  I will definitely be purchasing one of these</li>
    <li> Kind of bigger then I thought it would be still works good.</li>
    <li> This organizer is terrific and is made of high quality acrylic. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this. It holds a lot of my make up and is the best organizer I ever had.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, seems to be made very well.  I would have liked the lipstick holders to go all the way to the bottom.  If compartments were deeper they could have been used for many other items.  I just dont have many lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t have time to write more about the product. But it really help me a lot organizing my stuff. Less cluttered since I got too many cosmetics. Just exactly what I needed! specially I am always in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to organise. I highly recommend this product...</li>
    <li> Perfect size and lots of places to put all your make up and easy acess to everything  Very pleased with it</li>
    <li> Looks great on my vanity. Can fit a great variety of products in this organizer. Very easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> Great Organizer for the price, fast delivery, stores everything nicely. Would recommend this product to friends and family. Very good</li>
    <li> I am so glad I decided to get this.  The organizer has a spot for everything.  It is also easy to clean.  Before getting this I would put all of my makeup in a basket.  The problem with this was that my powder eyeshadow would leak out and make a mess.  Now i have a big area to put my power eye shadow in addition to a spot to put my face powder.  This product is perfect, especially is you use the mineral powder makeup!</li>
    <li> I bought this to organize my vaping gear.  It can hold several personal vaporizers, bottles of e-juice, tanks, batteries, etc.  Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Purrrrrrrrrrrfect</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for over a year and although I do still use it every day, I&#x27;m not in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Well-constructed, solid piece of acrylic&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;* Is a good choice for someone with a small amount of makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Only certain lipsticks stay put in the lipstick compartments. Short tubes like MAC and fat tubes like Kat Von D are just fine, but longer or skinnier tubes fall over or out of the organize&lt;br /&gt;* Curved front sections are not very functional for flat products like shadow palettes.</li>
    <li> works so well...... it was one of those purchases that i am glad i made. you should buy it !</li>
    <li> I was expecting this item to be made out of thin plastic, based off of the price. I was wrong. It is very sturdy and has large compartments. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I really really loved it. There&#x27;s storage for lipstick and also plenty of storage to out your makeups. worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I needed an organizer for my bathroom since I have an over-the-toilet shelving unit but the surface is full of round slats rather than a flat surface. But there&#x27;s only 2 people in the house so we don&#x27;t have three shelves worth of towels so I wanted to use the two other shelves for cosmetics. I needed something solid to put down. I tried little cute boxes - which got knocked over repeatedly and I had to throw out a ton of makeup that landed in the toilet, bath, or sometimes just smashed on the floor. Besides that it was like clutter heaven - if I needed to put something somewhere, I just put it in with the mess and then it became a problem of finding anything. The breaking point came after the beating my stuff took - when all the pawing through cosmetics, tangled jewelry and whatnots, my expensive brushes started to shed badly after being mistreated in those disorganized wooden boxes. I freaked and realized I needed to organize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this organizer on amazon and ordered it out of mild bathroom/vanity desperation. What entered was simple perfection. I have enough space to put everything and make it neat! Verses my past representation of how I think WW III would have altered my washroom. Additionally, it&#x27;s not too high but not too low so it keeps things in place (and fits!) and has become my truly useful and organized collect all. I can&#x27;t knock it over or have yet to pull it off the shelf (like I did with the boxes). And I don&#x27;t have to worry about crap falling through the shelf and wonder if my expensive cosmetics will ever recover or how much it&#x27;ll cost to replace the powder I just relocated in the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about getting it, go for it. The price is right, the item works and it looks good.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer.  Displays beautifully on your bathroom counter and makes it so easy to have your makeup at your fingertips.</li>
    <li> I just got this and organized all my makeup, I didn&#x27;t realize how much I had until I bought this organizer. It&#x27;s awesome especially for the price! No reason for anyone not to like this unless you have a TON of makeup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a space saver, it keeps everything organized. The only problem with it is that I don&#x27;t like the back side organizers, they&#x27;re so small and things fall out of it so easily.. pretty useless for me.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect item for all of my makeup. It matches my bathroom decor and it&#x27;s a space saver. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is really awesome, exactly what I expected after reading all the other reviews. I can fit most of my cosmetics in this other than a few palletes i have and a few of the lip products i feel like i hoard inside of my purse. It came within the time frame I expected, although it was on a Sunday, which is pretty impressive. The only problem i had was there was a gash in the cardboard box it came In? Pretty sure that is the mail man&#x27;s fault though so its fine. The organizer wasn&#x27;t damaged at all. If you have a decent amount of makeup this will be perfect for you especially if you&#x27;re not looking to spend over 100 dollars on one of the many beauty boxes out there. i have been expanding my collection though so I am sure i will be ordering  another product of theirs shortly. THIS THING IS TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
    <li> very very beautiful and fits well in my clset so everything stays organized</li>
    <li> This product fits my makeup well.  I wish it were a little bigger and offered more deep pockets for my brushes, but for the price, it works!</li>
    <li> perfect for my dorm room</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for. is as said</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working for my girlfriend, but some of the slots are a little too small for her stuff. I can&#x27;t take away stars for that though. It&#x27;s clearly made for lipstick. She uses it for her jewelry and make up.</li>
    <li> It is just fine. Side pockets are not deep enough. Can use only for short lipsticks.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE! PERFECT SIZE AND SPACE ! love it ! :) fast shipping as well !</li>
    <li> It holds my lipsticks, brushes and nail polishes, I love how it looks on my makeup table and its good quality too :)</li>
    <li> My make-up drawer, counter, and bags were a mess. I needed something where I could put all of my lipsticks in one place so when I need them, I can find them. I order this along with a lipstick organizer and it did the trick…now everything is in one place.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as planned. Ideal for soring various products, accommodates many various assortments of sizes and shapes and colors. Get one too!</li>
    <li> I like it! The quality is beyond my expectation! The price is very reasonable.i will buy another one in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer, fits everything so nicely, only a few complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. As other people have said, the slots on the side don&#x27;t fit anything. Anything you fit there will just fall over because there&#x27;s nothing to hold them up. I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t make the divider go higher.&lt;br /&gt;2. The side of mine actually broke off. I&#x27;m not docking a star off for it though because I am not sure how it happened. May have been my fault, not too sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price, it helped my organization a LOT and I love it. It&#x27;s a staple in my room now.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s super cute and handy to keep makeup from being all over the place. Way bigger than I expected! I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy organizer with a fair amount of room.  While a good value for the price, it could have additional deeper slots to accommodate pencils, brushes, and other taller items.  But they also make an item specifically for brushes which I will probably buy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really meet my needs.  the compartments were either too shallow, or too small.  I&#x27;m sure that for many people, it will be fine, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Well made and brilliantly designed for ease of use in a compact space.  Perfect for a vintage vanity/makeup table (you know, those little kidney-shaped jobbies everyone wants a fortune for now!) or the bathroom vanity.  The design really does make it easy to organise your cosmetics intuitively and keep them organised without fuss or muss.</li>
    <li> I needed an organizer for my new vanity and this is excellent. I store some daily wear makeup, facial and body products, even my contact lenses case on this organizer. This is also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It is made of a very resistant material and it is just soo roomy that you can&#x27;t help but love it. it holds in my everyday essentials, and more!</li>
    <li> is nice, but not as great as it looks.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it.  Quick shipping and good price.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Plastic is sturdy and design is pretty. This is the ideal size for my make-up items. Love it! n</li>
    <li> Really lovely. It is much bigger than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> After searching for weeks in town to find a nice, larger acrylic makeup holder, I finally turned to Amazon and ordered this organizer. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition and is absolutely amazing. It is a stronger, nicer organizer than I&#x27;ve ever seen or owned, for my cosmetics. So thrilled with it and highly recommend US Acrylic and this design.</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift for the girls.</li>
    <li> This cosmetic organizer is just perfect to store all your make up.  It&#x27;s easy to grab items from it because it is wide open and clear so you can easily find things.  It is good quality and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is an Amazing product, everything fits perfect. This is my second one I love it</li>
    <li> great product for this price- very comfortable , very light and doesn&#x27;t take too much space, came very fast- no delay, great package</li>
    <li> I love this organizer, this in combination with another has completely changed my master bath counter. I don&#x27;t use a ton of makeup, but the compartments are still useful for jewelry, hair stuff, lotion, etc.  It&#x27;s pretty heavy acrylic, and the arc makes it look a little more refined than a lot of other organizers.</li>
    <li> I love this cosmetic organizer! I can see everything in front of me instead of searching through the drawers. Enough for good amount of products. Satisfied with the quality; would recommend to others!</li>
    <li> i loveeeeee this product, it makes my makeup stuff look organize but i wish it was bigger so i can put more stuff in it. but very nice product and it came on time.</li>
    <li> Awesome orgainzer, can fit kaat of my makeup stuff easily</li>
    <li> Works fantastically i bought this with the &amp;#34;Lipper international Bamboo-The Sink Shelf&amp;#34; To go over my bathroom sink, as out apartment bathroom and ZERO counter space, and it hangs over a little but works fantastic as a organizer! LOVE it. It does show everything though, if your like me and use a lot of hairspray it will show up...</li>
    <li> I love it so much. My counter space now looks a lot more organized and it really looks pretty. Honestly, why I didn&#x27;t get something like this earlier is beyond me. I used to keep all my makeup in makeup bags which isn&#x27;t nice after a while. It makes them dirty from all the powder and other makeups. This is something you can clean and put out all the things you use on a daily basis. I am really happy with it. Oh and it came timely and without damage. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This organizer makes using makeup easier. The brushes are easier to distinguish and you can easily place eyeshadows and others on the middle. Hard to clear though so I would use clorox wipes and let it dry after using water to rinse off the solution off the wipes.</li>
    <li> This makeup organizer is classy, roomy, and really keeps my vanity much more organized.  I love all the different sizes of compartments it fits my makeup great!  There is plenty of room for all the makeup I wear daily plus some extra room for fun colors and such for special occasions.  I&#x27;m really impressed!</li>
    <li> This tray really fits nicely on my counter, with lots of compartments. very well built and easy to clean, with clear view of all your products.</li>
    <li> Excellent way to organize makeup; everything is easier to pick up because it&#x27;s so open and not all crammed in a small, box-like space.  This organizer is even better combined with the large acrylic 2-drawer unit sitting under it to store miscellaneous jewelry items like watchs and rings. My dressing table looks so much cleaner and less cluttered now.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a really nice organizer.  Fits nicely on wife&#x27;s vanity and holds a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the side back compartments are shallow.  Anything taller than a standard lipstick doesn&#x27;t fit very well.  It would be nice to have more deep compartments.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cosmetics storage!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I could&#x27;ve bought this nicer organizer. It holds everything and still has room left. It has both flat and vertical spaces to fit what you need to store. If your space is small you might want to check the measurements.  I would recommend to anyone who uses makeup daily.</li>
    <li> Love this, looks nice and holds plenty of makeup.  It has way too many lipstick spots.  Wish there were more spaces for tall items.</li>
    <li> Help me to organize my make up stuffs efficiently!</li>
    <li> I bought an expensive make up organizer with drawers and I bought this Cosmetic organizer to place on the side for my everyday makeup. I didn&#x27;t want to have to open my drawers everyday and get fingerprints or wear and tear on them. So this was perfect for that reason. It is very affordable and is a great quality product. It is actually nicer than I expected. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I love this! :D I don&#x27;t have a huge makeup collection but this holds a good amount! It&#x27;s perfect for my collection. :) I also have space to keep my perfumes on it which I really like since I like displaying the bottles. :) I really love how nice this looks. People who have been to my house have said that it looks really nice too. :D</li>
    <li> My vanity was a mess, I had to dig into a drawer or messy bag to find my makeup,perfumes, etc.  I have a lot of makeup items, brushes etc, this held almost all.  The middle brush, tube holders are great for pencils, mascara, etc.  I even had room on the tray for my favorite nail polish.  I wish I bought this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> This item stores all of my makeup and other beauty accessories. Instead of having all my makeup stored in a bag, I like how everything is displayed and available for immediate use rather than digging around for a makeup product. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was please with the sturdiness of the organizer and overall size.  However, the back line of storage slots were not as I had needed and expected.  The 2 midldle slots in this line are the only ones that are as deep as they are tall the other side slots on this row are too short and narrow to store much in them. I had rather had taller and wider slots than the arch shape.</li>
    <li> This is great for helping me get ready in the morning.  No more shuffling through bags or drawers.  I can see everything at once.  Only wish if were a little larger.</li>
    <li> It does the job and is as pictured.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received the items I ordered. When I opened this particular item from the box, its really nice BUT i noticed it has a CRACK on the left bottom side. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not from the shipping or handling, because it was well padded. So yeah, two thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I really like my organizer. It&#x27;s perfect and was so much more than I expected and the price was rite ..very happy with this</li>
    <li> Nice configuration and holds my cosmetics well.  I would&#x27;ve liked more of the tall sections for brushes, eyeliners, etc.  but overall a good fit for my supplies.</li>
    <li> This item is great for organizing my cosmetics on my vanity. It is high quality acrylic and hasn&#x27;t scratched or cracked since purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice, sturdy, and just as it appears in the picture.</li>
    <li> Holds a lot, doesn&#x27;t take up a huge amt of room.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> all my makeup that i would route through drawers for is now on display.  So nice to be able to see everything on display and holds alot of stuff.  NIce and sturdy too and looks really nice</li>
    <li> Omg I&#x27;m in love with this I keep some of my makeup organize. . I really recommend to buy this product</li>
    <li> Loved it exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I love this because its open (no drawers to shut or lids to close) and its easy to keep makeup organized. It was the biggest one I could find on Amazon and has several little compartments for everything.</li>
    <li> Great organizer . I&#x27;m able to organize my makeup and brushes and like the different size compartments to fit my makeup. Also,  that it fits most anywhere.</li>
    <li> Good for organizing teen makeup collection.  This is a good medium size, and is a good quality.  Not a tiny thing like some of the misleading photos of organizers can be.  Holds a good amount of different types of makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a great organizer for your cosmetics.  It has many different sizes of compartments and something for everything.  The clear plastic keeps it from looking bulky.</li>
    <li> Separates the stuff well</li>
    <li> wish it was bigger, the compartments are awkward but does hold 2 Urban decay NAKED palettes and a lot of other stuff so It works</li>
    <li> The most useful compartments in this organizer are the two large makeup brush holders; the rest of the slots are semi-useful; if you have a lot of nail polish or lipsticks, as others have mentioned, this could be ideal for you. If you have a lot of bottles - foundations, perfume, moisturizers, etc., - there aren&#x27;t very many compartments deep enough to hold them.    Overall, I&#x27;ve been happy with the product over the last year or so; but the main problem is just how HUGE it is; I wish it could be slightly taller and much less deep, maybe incorporate some horizontal and vertical shelving rather than all top-loading. I have a small bathroom in a 1-BR apartment, and I had to wall mount this thing (using corner brackets); it&#x27;s sturdy but by no means the most attractive setup, plus it juts about a foot out of the wall. Still, it at least frees up some counter space, and makes it less likely that the makeup will get splashed due to proximity to the sink.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I bought this. After seeing acrylic makeup organizers all over stylish blogs and the internet I decided to do a little research. I went to The Container Store and found a few organizers like this , but smaller and more expensive. So, I decided that I could live without it until I found a cheaper version. I just happened to stumble across this organizer while shopping on Amazon and wow, I have to say I am impressed and more importantly, ORGANIZED! I am a makeup junkie who loves to scour Sephora on a daily basis but unfortunately before, my makeup purchased would end up forgotten in a bathroom drawer. Not anymore!!!!! I LOVE this. Everything about it. I feel organized and happy when I see my little collection of Nars blushes, Mac lipsticks, and all of my soft makeup brushes right there. It doesn&#x27;t look messy either, which is what I was concerned with since my husband and I live in a one bedroom &amp; bathroom apartment. In fact, I&#x27;m sure my friends will love this when they see it ! I&#x27;m happy :) Buy it!!! You won&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the makeup organizer for my sisters Xmas present.  It arrived on time and She loved it.  I WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE!! :)</li>
    <li> I already bought one of these; but it wasn&#x27;t quite big enough. So I bought another! The price is great, and the quality is outstanding.</li>
    <li> Great organizer. Some of the compartments aren&#x27;t deep enough and things fall over, but overall a nice product.</li>
    <li> Much larger than I thought it would be. Which is perfect! :)</li>
    <li> Looks nice and has convenient sections to hold almost anything</li>
    <li> Perfect for organizing your makeup! I love makeup and this is a way to organize what I use the most!</li>
    <li> My mornings are so smooth now that I can see all my makeup clearly. The organizer is good quality and very large. It holds all my makeup products (which isn&#x27;t much) plus contacts, hairbands, etc.  I agree with other reviews that wish the brush compartment was deeper.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described,worked well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as an organizer for my makeup in my dorm room (I have a really big makeup collection) and it has worked really well. I was (pleasantly) surprised by the size when it arrived- it&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected! It&#x27;s also made of a really thick plastic that held up really well in an 11 hour drive to school! It is also super easy to clean and has nice compartments for everything I have. It doesn&#x27;t fit all of my makeup, but I can fit most of my frequently used products in it.</li>
    <li> Perfect item to hold brushes, lipsticks, glosses, shadows, etc.  Fits very nicely on bathroom counter.  Keeps items organized and easily viewable. Love it!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife for her cluttered vanity area. She loves it! Lots of compartments for everything a woman needs. The acrylic is high-quality and doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The quality is great, but I found better ones for much better prices in stores.</li>
    <li> Great organizer!  Much larger than I expected.  Plenty of room for all types of cosmetics.  Arrived quickly, too.</li>
    <li> Works for what I need. I agree with others who said the lipstick compartments are too short. Makes it easier to get to what I need when I&#x27;m doing makeup.</li>
    <li> light sturdy and perfect for additional organizing help on the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean any botches or make up left overs.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife, now most of her make up fits in one display.  Some of the design features could use some improvement though</li>
    <li> This cosmetic organizer helps me find what I need quickly,  when applying make up.</li>
    <li> Great product with reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a make-up junkie. IT&#x27;s a fact; and all my life I&#x27;ve just been sitting my makeup on a dresser or dresser; somewhat organized. But it really takes up room. I came to the conclusion that I needed more space for school work and papers...etc on my desk. So I went ahead and bought this. I questioned whether it could hold ALL of my stuff. It did. I have my brushes, eyeliners, mascaras, powders, blushes, eyeshadows..etc perfectly separated now. It kinda makes me even more excited to do my makeup int eh morning. If you&#x27;re questioning getting this- do it.</li>
    <li> Ok, so Im new to the makeup world at 30. But I love to shop so, I had more than enough stuff to organize. I love the material, quality, and overall value. My only complaint would be, the staggering buckets along the back edge should be a bit deeper. They are very shallow so my longer lipstick and lip gloss will topple over pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Great quality! I loved how ALL of my makeup fit in it!!!</li>
    <li> Useful for keeping my teenage daughter&#x27;s makeup organized.</li>
    <li> Very nice and perfect for organizing my cosmetics, big enough to hold quite a few items.</li>
    <li> This organizer looks great in the photo, but it really doesn&#x27;t hold as much as the one I currently use.  It has too many unusable slots on the very back that I suppose are for lipstick because nothing else will fit there.  Who has that many tubes of lipstick?</li>
    <li> It serves the purpose to have my makeup visible but I thought I could fit all of my makeup and I misjudged that. It got all my brushes fine but my eyeshadow beiber, and powder are too big for the slots. Also, when it came in one little side of the plastic broke off, but it didn&#x27;t really make much difference so I didn&#x27;t bother telling the company. But my makeup area does look nicer now even if all doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> Fits in the drawer perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great organization for my wifes makeup. And she has a LOT</li>
    <li> Good to keep make-up organized!</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetic junkie and use to store my products in baskets and makeup bags. I wanted better organization and to actually see my cosmetics in front of me, not look for it or try to remember what other lipsticks I have. So I ordered this, and I love it. Without it, I would not be able to remember everything I have. Highly recopmmend it!</li>
    <li> This organizer is big enough for all my cosmetics, and I have plenty of it. Very satisfied with the buy, would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I always had problems getting the right make up case for all my makeup and it never turned out well cause I either had too much makeup to fit the case or too little to put in.  This makeup organizer is perfect for all the makeup that I have.  I was able to use every section of the organizer and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about digging through my makeup to find what I needed :)</li>
    <li> I love this and so does my husband.  I used to have my make up set up on the counter top and it looked messy.  Now with this organizer the counter top is organized and looks cleaner and less cluttered. Very functional and keeps my stuff organized.</li>
    <li> I thought it looked really cool for our teenage daughter but it came broke so no use for a broken cosmetic holder.</li>
    <li> I doubted this but still purchased it.. As soon as I received it and opened it I fell in love.. I totally recommend it..</li>
    <li> This is a very nice organizer. I have a decent amount of makeup, and it fits nicely in here.&lt;br /&gt;After buying it I realized that it&#x27;s a little larger than I anticipated, but that&#x27;s a fault of mine for not looking at the dimensions. I don&#x27;t have the largest counter space, and I think stacking drawers with a smaller organizer on top might have worked better for me, but the value of this organizer was more tempting. It&#x27;s a great organizer for the price.</li>
    <li> I was so excited after ordering this and when I got it it did not disappoint. I am a serious makeup addict and have lots of it. This is great to bring some order to my frequently used cosmetics. I could use 10 more but one will have to do for now. Lol</li>
    <li> My makeup products all in one place.  Finally!</li>
    <li> Great for organizing my cosmetics!! Does not take up too much space and looks pretty on my bathroom vanity dresser. I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This organizer takes up lots of makeup junk off your counter, and my bathroom counter top looks neat.  It is also very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom and she loves it! I see she&#x27;s put very good use to it as well, its full of make up!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. The quality is EXCELLENT for the price. There have been other cosmetic acrylic organizers that have been more expensive but worse quality. This one is great! It&#x27;s larger than what I thought it was going to be, which is a plus because I have a ton of makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping! Arrived without a scratch.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good size with a pretty okay price. I wish it has some drawers for my hair pins, but for makeup tools, it&#x27;s pretty good enough.</li>
    <li> This organizer is cute, roomy, and has many compartments for lipsticks, eye and lip pencils, blushes, foundation, glosses, and eye shadows. Some of the lower compartments could be a little bigger however, its an overall good product if you are looking to store multiple pieces of makeup.</li>
    <li> I love love love this! I was so tired of all my cosmetics being thrown into a bag and having to dig through it all! I out this in my bathroom drawer and have all my makeup organized! Great product!</li>
    <li> Extremely well made very sturdy and holds every normal amount of makeup and brushes and then some. Great product for the price and would work great for someone with limited space or someone who doesn&#x27;t like bulky makeup boxes cluttering up their bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Works well. I&#x27;ve had mine for years!</li>
    <li> !!!I Love this organizer!!! Now it makes me buy more make up!!! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> Product was as described. Seems pretty sturdy and lots of room for cosmetics. Plus shipping was quick!</li>
    <li> This helped me organize a lot of my make-up, I really like it but it does require a certain amount of spot cleaning especially if you store it on a sink near water.  I wish I had purchased too, it is really great in that you can see all of your supplies and have a better chance of actually using them.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful unit. It holds more than I ever expected. I love it. Finally something to organize my makeup in. It doesn&#x27;t hold all my makeup, but I was able to organize a lot of things that were scattered all over the place. I would highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> SO excited when this finally came in the mail.  I ran home, ripped the box open and started organizing my makeup.  Anyone who knows me knows how organized I am, and since makeup is my new obsession, I shall organize that too!!  I usually keep my makeup in a bag, inside my purse, but my collection has grown far greater than that.  So now, I can see whatever I might want to use during the day, and I can grab it and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lot of different compartments that you can fill with anything you wish.  However, my only gripe is: some of the compartments aren&#x27;t thought out.  Squeeze-tube lipglosses don&#x27;t work well in here (believe you me, I shoved mine in there).  And the curved compartment at the front that other reviewers seem to hate so much, is for bobby pins!! I don&#x27;t use it for that, but it&#x27;s kind of clever isn&#x27;t it?  I love the two big compartments in the back for brushes and longer tubes of lipgloss or eye/lip pencils.  Some of the lil spaces for lipsticks are too short (or not deep enough), and the tubes might get knocked over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing, and keep looking over at it!  Downside: makes me want to buy more makeup to fill this with.</li>
    <li> Great for organizing small bottles and makeup and brushes easily cleaned just soak or use shower head to clean</li>
    <li> This is an excellent buy. It hold a lot of make up. Keeps everything in it&#x27;s place. The clear acrylic makes it easy to see your products.</li>
    <li> Very useful make up organization. Helps reduce clutter in the restroom and also ensures everything is organized in one place rather than in multiple shelves.&lt;br /&gt;- Lots of room for brushes, lip gloss and eyeliner (these are long and lean objects)&lt;br /&gt;- Lots of room for lipsticks (these are short and lean objects)&lt;br /&gt;- Decent room for compacts, eye shadow and bronzers (these are short and wide). You can stack these items one on top of the other&lt;br /&gt;- Not enough room for the medium height  but large width items like creams and serums.  The problem here is that these objects cannot be stacked on top of each other due to their height.  (Example-if your moisturizer and serums are sold in containers / jars (and not tubes))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - love it, I love that my sink is not cluttered anymore and I don&#x27;t have to search for a particular brush or eye shadow especially when I am in a hurry in the morning.</li>
    <li> This helps my daughter with displaying and organizing her makeup and other items from her dresser. I am very happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> This works for my needs, the part in the middle of the tray is even lifted so that I can slide something (usually my comb) underneath and out of the way. However, the two sections next to the center brush sections in the back are meant for lipsticks, or other similar products and are VERY shallow. I can&#x27;t put anything in them because they will just get knocked off and end up in my sink or on the floor. So, for me, tons of wasted space unfortunately. If you like to have a ton of lipstick on your counter, this may be a great option for you, unfortunately it&#x27;s just no good for me.</li>
    <li> Cheap thin material. Front slots too short and pencils fell over, back ones where too deep. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be a quality product or not, but the acrylic material in heavy and sturdy, very good!</li>
    <li> Очень нравится! Органайзер стоит у меня в ванной комнате, удобен: много различных отсеков для хранения косметики. Рекомендую всем покупателям, попробуйте!</li>
    <li> There is nothing bad I can say about this organizer. It&#x27;s sturdy, aesthetically appealing, spacious without being bulky and has lots of little compartments for everything. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> love it because it saves me a lot of space and I have watered things out there, I recommend it and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This organizer is big enough that it can hold all of my various types of makeup products and brushes but it is small enough to fit on my vanity without taking up a huge amount of space! The perfect size and extremely helpful.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean and holds a lot of products. I use it for all of my makeup, moisturizers and face wash.</li>
    <li> very fast ups i love love love u must have this product  . i live hawaii and really love this</li>
    <li> Perfect organizer for my wife&#x27;s cosmetics and keeps her vanity neat. She had tried others but the layout of this one is ideal.</li>
    <li> It was a little bigger than I expected and takes up half of my counter space, but overall I am enjoying the product!</li>
    <li> this is a great Cosmetic Organizer by Acrylic. but I worry about keeping it clean, from dust. so I put it in the dish washer (NO HEAT SETTING) and it came very clean. also it is a bit big for the dresser but is stores a lot of things though. also DO NOT LEAVE IN THE DISH WASHER VERY LONG ONLY ABOUT 5 MINNUTS!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Keeps my makeup organized and my counter so neat.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I love it! Fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> Holds a lot. Easy to organize make up and lotions and creams.</li>
    <li> This is such a multi functioning organizer. It holds so many items and it is made of a durable material.</li>
    <li> Looks nice on my bedroom dresser. It holds a lot of cosmetics, and perfums</li>
    <li> Very size and very well made . Item met all my expectations, and i would purchase from this vendor again</li>
    <li> I got this gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it! So many compartments to put makeup. Very useful and sturdy.</li>
    <li> After I bought it, I saw the same one in a Wal-Mart for much less. Plus I paid as much to ship as the price of the item.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for organizing your make-up.  The compartments are varied in size and will accomodate anything you have in the makeup line.  I actually have 2 and thinking of getting another one to leave in my suitcase for travelling - I think it would be so much better to organize my makeup in the hotel instead of having to leave it in a cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer! I have loads of brushes and I use allot of bare minerals make up the organizer helped organized my make up and keep from getting powder mixed up and it OBVIOUSLY organized everything.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is just like the picture. It&#x27;s well made of thick plastic. It&#x27;s great for organizing make-up! I use it on my vanity counter to keep everything looking neat. The two larger openings in the back are great for brushes, eye liners, and mascara. I have a lot of loose powder eye shadows, too, so I put them in the shallow portions in the front. There room for everything! I even have a couple of palettes in the large shallow opening on the right. Makes cleaning easier, too, because I just move the whole thing to clean the counter underneath! Great product!</li>
    <li> love this item, just what i expected. holds item at your fingertips , no more digging in a make up bag</li>
    <li> Beautiful organizer for my makeup.  Looks classy on my dresser.  It&#x27;s sturdy, too. Great customer service, received my organizer in a weeK!</li>
    <li> This cosmetic organizer is fantastic. The acrylic material it is made of is durable and provides a clean-looking finish. I was able to fit SO many cosmetics in it and the top of my bureau looks much better as a result. Definitely recommend this for anybody with a surplus of products!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look too impressive in the picture, but i tell you what!  This thing holds so much stuff.  My bathroom counter was an endless sea of bottles, brushes, compacts, etc. and it all fit into the organizer.  The plastic is not cheap or flimsy.  This is a fantastic buy.</li>
    <li> It keeps all my makeup organized so nicely, and it looks nice. My hubby doesn&#x27;t mind me cluttering up the sink with this organizer.</li>
    <li> I love all the slots. It really made my&lt;br /&gt;Bathroom look cute and fancy. It is durable and has not broke on me. I love the compartments.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the organizer. I was very nice looking on my shelf</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to organize my vanity area and shopped around but, to no avail. Could not find anything to meet my needs and then....I remembered the place to go to that carries awesome variety! AMAZON! I LOVE MY NEW ACRYLIC MAKEUP ORGANIZER! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Love the organizer! It wasn&#x27;t too big nor small. It fits my brushes, mascara and several lippies! I would buy another one if I had more room on my vanity!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Keeps my vanity nice and organized.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Made organizing my makeup so much simpler. Fits on any counter and matches with any room. Had to buy another cause my sister loved it as well.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer!!!! Sturdy, great quality, awesome deal!!! Would def order again!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with makeup organizer.</li>
    <li> It really  is a great organizer, but I have a TON of makeup, and not all of it fits. So, I suggest looking for something else if you have quite a bit of makeup, but if you just want to tidy up your bathroom counter or vanity, I recommend this organizer!!!</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this item because we have a decent size bathroom and most of it is my cosmetics and polishes, I am all into organization. Well i received this item broken as I pulled it out of the box the next morning, only because I received this late at night. It had a huge crack! Ugh I was so upset. Oh well.....</li>
    <li> I love to keep my things organized in acrylic, very nice material and easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I like it but it came cracked a little. It wasnt a problem for me though !</li>
    <li> Arrived in one day, wich was amazingly fast.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job, everything stays on place! Also, the plastic is very solid. My face make up is in one side and my eyes makeup in the other. I like it</li>
    <li> Cosmetic Organizer by Acrylic&lt;br /&gt;US Acrylic...well made works great using for make up keeps thing in their place. I like that it is clear</li>
    <li> Helps organize my makeup.. but kinda small for my collection...</li>
    <li> I was really happy with it until it cracked into two pieces by itself. I did not even fill it up with stuff so I am very disappointed in the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Such a waste of my money and time.</li>
    <li> This product is made of high quality plastic and it really looks nice in my bathroom. The curved back is appealing to the eye, as well as practical for different sized cosmetics. Looks and works great.</li>
    <li> I have so many different cosmetics items, but i use a few items on regular basis. This is okay for me.</li>
    <li> it really organize my cosmatic....i could get rid of my clutter ...m happy and ll recommend this to all who are looking for cosmatic organizer..</li>
    <li> small and cracked but they took it back, no problem.</li>
    <li> Finally a place for everything keeps me organized and ready to go in half the time not searching for make- up</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty big container that I think would do well for most people. I have a LOT of brushes, and it&#x27;s not quite enough for them all, but it does a pretty decent job of fitting my most commonly work makeup. I use the lipstick slots for shorter brushes. I wish some of the lipstick dividers were gone or that the taller sections had more dividers, but can&#x27;t win them all. It&#x27;s pretty sturdy though, the plastic is rather thick. I don&#x27;t fear breaking it, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have scratches despite my constant picking up/putting back down of things daily. Overall, a great value and a good organizer.</li>
    <li> I love this cosmetic organizer. It&#x27;s perfect to store the products I use on a daily basis. I have been using this everyday since I bought it, about 3 years I believe. It fits perfect on a vanity or table and makes everything so much more organized. Before, all my makeup would be scattered on my table and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to quickly reach for items because they would be somewhere different everyday. Now this organizer has helped me to get a organized and clutter free setup.</li>
    <li> Very nice organizer.  Definitely helped clean up the mess of my cosmetics drawer and was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love that I can fit so much makeup on here! I also really like that it has different size sections that are great for certain products. Another great thing is that it is clear so it makes it really easy to locate the product you are looking for!</li>
    <li> this is even nicer in person.  I&#x27;m turning because it doesn&#x27;t fit my shelve.  I wish I can find the space for it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A BIT REASONABLE FOR MY COSMETICS AND THIS IS JUST PERFECT.  I DON&#x27;T HAVE A LOT OF PRODUCTS SO THIS WORKS GREAT.  FEELS FIRM, AND MY STUFF LOOK GOOD IN IT.  MIGHT BE TOO SMALL FOR ANYONE WITH A LOT OF STUFF BUT LIKE I SAID, DON&#x27;T HAVE A LOT OF COSMETICS SO THIS WORKS GREAT.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> i love this for the top of my vanity.  i was just keeping all of my compacts, moisturizers, lipsticks, whatever kind of piled there but i wasn&#x27;t able to easily access everything so i ended up wearing the same thing all the time.  this makes all of my makeup look nice and organized and i&#x27;m able to see all the labels and choose the right brushes quickly rather than just taking whats on top.  this is total saver for me, like the perfect tool box for all my tools :-)</li>
    <li> I really like this is nice and big it fits alot of things i still have room for more i thought it was going to be small but really nice size i had ordered this and another one but i think i just need one. it has room for lip sticks this is one that i dont regrat geting</li>
    <li> great product made of heavy weight plastic. it looks almost like glass. it&#x27;s durable, holds lots of stuff and looks/is well made</li>
    <li> I am so happy about this organizer. I like it&#x27;s clear and looks nice, I receiver it in few days. Wow jut very excited!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect item, even fits my Naked palettes on the back. The front part can be used for everyday jewellery.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this would be large enough for those who have a comprehensive makeup collection, but for my fairly small one (a few mascaras, three powder brushes, a couple of face powders and blusher, and a few eyeshadows and lipsticks), it&#x27;s great, and it&#x27;s very attractive. (I store my nail polishes in a separate container.) The acrylic appears to be high-quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter because I was tired of seeing her makeup covering her bathroom counter top. It is absolutely beautiful and very very well made. Its of very thick plastic and I love the compartments it has. Its not very large so it doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room. It fits all of her makeup with a lot of room to spare. I am so happy and pleased with this product that I am going to buy one for myself and a best friend which wears makeup on a daily basis, I know she will also love this product.</li>
    <li> This will be a gift for my grand-daughter and I will be very proud to give it to her. It is very nice and looks very expensive. I love it when I get a good deal on something that really stands up to the quality that it claims to be.</li>
    <li> Great product, very well made, so nice to have a clutter-free counter. My only complaint is the compartments on the side are shallow and difficult to find items to fit</li>
    <li> I love this organizer. It holds everything I need and I can find everything quickly. This organizer is ood quality as well.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer, and the longer I have it, the more I love it!  I am finding more and more ways to use it.  Yes, as other folks have said, the lipstick holders aren&#x27;t deep enough.  That&#x27;s the only reason I am giving the organizer four stars instead of five.  Plan on having your lipsticks fall over.  With the exception of that, this is very handy, and stores almost all of my cosmetics.  I have mine on my sink counter, and it looks fine.  It&#x27;s plastic, but not tacky looking.  Give it a try, I don&#x27;t think you will be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as pictured, came in a short amount if time, perfect to organize my nail polish and makeup</li>
    <li> Loved this! I don&#x27;t have a ton of makeup and brushes so this was perfect. I found it on my doorsteps faster then I expected! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  really nice organizer.</li>
    <li> This product fit what I was looking for not only in size and number of compartments but also the price. It&#x27;s made of durable plastic and the price is better than the same item elsewhere. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It was perfect for my oldest grand daughter to put her make up in.  She is thrilled that she can keep everything in one place instead of bathroom, bedroom and purse.</li>
    <li> Best gift ever for my wife. Now all her cosmetics are in one place and not all over the counter :)</li>
    <li> I love it!! it makes my  dresser look so pretty and girly and it shipped fast... . . . .</li>
    <li> I could suggest changes to this organizer, but nothing that I suggest would improve it by much.  Fully functional, very well  designed.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who uwears makeup.  It has helped speed up my morning routine.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this would solve all my issues with my make up being disorganized but it didn&#x27;t at all. When I first received it I was impressed with how heavy duty the plastic was but as soon as I started to look at it I was dissappointed with the depth and size of each &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34;. They are not very useable. Only the back two &amp;#34;holders&amp;#34; are deep enough to hold make up brushes or eyelines, everything else really is like just having a piece a plastic underneath my make up. I thought I could make it work and now I am outside the return window with a piece of heavy duty plastic in my closet. Then the front &amp;#34;holders&amp;#34; have curved inside corners which even limit how many eye shadows it could hold. Very upset I didn&#x27;t go with my gut and send it back the day I got it.</li>
    <li> Love my organizer, I put a lot of my makeup, good quality !!!</li>
    <li> As promised and on time</li>
    <li> Solid product. Is exactly as described &amp; perfect for what I needed it for. My daughter will be in make-up heaven.</li>
    <li> Great organizer but you have to empty it often to clean off the dust which can be a pain.</li>
    <li> Absolutely  perfect....delivery was better than on time and product was everything it was suppose to be....I will be ordering more for sure</li>
    <li> Perfectly held all my makeup</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product!  It fits perfectly on my small vanity and holds so much! Arrived quickly in perfect condition and is exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> I was able to organize so much make up with this. Just wish there were more space for my lipsticks....or maybe I just shouldn&#x27;t buy so much makeup!</li>
    <li> High quality acrylic, the perfect size, low price. No more bags of makeup, no more searching for what I need... I wish we had met sooner.</li>
    <li> Perfect for anyone who has tons of makeup and no space to store it. Great solution, and actually makes for a nice vanity display.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my vanity table,  holds my lipsticks and small makeup collection and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my pre-teen daughter to help her organize her growing make-up collection. It has lots of slots for different kinds/sizes of make-up. My daughter did say that some slots are too small to be usable, but I think those would be good for brushes and eye liner.</li>
    <li> This is made very well. Its strong.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love it. I had it for about 4 months, used lightly - no heavy stuff placed on it. Just a couple brushes and sticks. And it just had a large crack over night itself which is absolutely absurd. For this quality it&#x27;s only worthy of a $5 eBay listing. Disappointed. But thankful for Amazon issuing a refund.</li>
    <li> It holds all my cosmetics and it looks really neatly on my dressing table.</li>
    <li> I recently with crazy with nail polishes and the top of my dresser was a mess!  This little organizer was a great find.  Depending on what brand you buy sort of determines how much it holds.  Some slots are a little small for square bottles.  I have no complaints with this item at all.  It is generously sized and crystal clear.  Holds many items in its slots and even has a flat surface that I use to put change and rings in.  Received it in a timely manner and it was packaged well.  Thanks US Acrylic!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for, good quality, and looks great on my vanity table! I ordered it on Wednesday, received it on Monday. All in all, very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price! Shipped very quickly and safely. Highly recommended purchase!!</li>
    <li> I love this organizer. Keeps my everyday makeup and brushes in place and I don&#x27;t have to look into my makeup bag every morning to do my makeup! This is a great innovative organizer! Thank you also for the fast delivery!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Fits all my make up!  I love it and it is perfect for my collection.  Definitely worth the wait and purchase</li>
    <li> I love this organizer, this is just what I needed!  This organizer holds alot and keeps everything all in one place.  I just pick it up and carry it to the bathroom; no more searching through my makeup bag to find what I need .  I ordered 2, one for me and my daughter and she is equally pleased. Its sturdy and all the compartments are just the right size.  Delivery was fast and packaged well. I was going to order a cosmetic train case, but thought it would be to bulky and inconvenient for my simple needs. I would recommend this to any women or girl who loves makeup and needs to keep it in one place.  Also would make a great gift addition.</li>
    <li> The best cosmetics organizer ever. It&#x27;s bigger than I thought and pretty as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this obviously to store my make up in and it is better than I expected. It&#x27;s made of durable material and the compartments are perfectly placed and sized.</li>
    <li> With all the great reviews, I thought I was going to love this organizer.  Unforturately it was not anything like I expected.  The lipstick section is extremely shallow and can&#x27;t really be used for much besides lipstick.  I own no lipstick and my lipglosses and lip balms don&#x27;t fit it that section.  The front is very shallow (1 inch-ish) so don&#x27;t expect to be able to stack much in there.  The middle section has rounded corners so it limits what fits.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this item.  I purchased a medium Caboodles acrylic organizer as a replacement.  While the Caboodles organizer is smaller, it better fits my needs.</li>
    <li> I have never had my make up so organized in my life, I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and this is just great.  Once you pack your favorite stuff in, you can move it anywhere.  Love it!</li>
    <li> i have a lot of loose makeup and thought this would have space for all of it. It kind of does, however, nothing fits quite right. The two center boxes in the back are nice and large, and are perfect for my eyeliner pencils and shadow brushes. The center squares are okay for my compacts, foundation, and blushes (although again, it doesn&#x27;t seem that those spaces were designed for those things as the width/size is just off). But the three holders on each side (that descend in height) are kind of useless. I&#x27;ve managed to set my concealer in one, my mascara in another, and my lipgloss in another, but they&#x27;re always falling out because they are longer than the holders are tall. Same goes for tweezers, eyelash curler, etc. Still better than nothing - it would just be nice if ALL the back holders were the same height.</li>
    <li> So I sent it back and reordered.  It&#x27;s kind of wide, so make sure you read the dimensions!  If you&#x27;re planning to use the lipstick slots for anything other than lipstick, then you&#x27;re better off ordering something else - like many of the reviews state, it&#x27;s too shallow for anything really besides lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helped me organize my vintage vanity that my great grandmom brought over from Ireland... there&#x27;s no drawers on it and an oddly shaped surface, so I I have a random assortment of acrylic and other material organizers.... I don&#x27;t like lot&#x27;s of drawers or makeup bags because I need to SEE my spread of makeup... my vanity is not home decorator worthy IMO, but everything has it&#x27;s place and I have a pretty streamlined system by sorting makeup by type, function (work vs play) etc... helps me spend less time in the morning searching for stuff, so it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my messy girl&#x27;s bathroom counter. Her makeup is neatly organized &amp; looks 10 times better. Well constructed. Not too heavy. Just the right size. Great price.</li>
    <li> I have looked high and low for an organizer!!!  Like this one one. Not only did it help me throw out some cosmetics that were long over due but it actually helped me organize too.</li>
    <li> I love this tray, has a place for everything. All my make is now organized thanks to this product. More impressive than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Great makeup organizer, this was a good purchase! It is good quality and I&#x27;m able to display my makeup neatly on the vanity.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the size of this organizer so I was pleasantly surprised at the size. To big to use in the medicine cabinet as I intended, but holds a lot more than expected. That works out well for me since I don&#x27;t have any drawers in my vanity.</li>
    <li> I am more than happy the way how this cosmetic organizer looks!! It definitely looks crystal and not acrylic. The cosmetic organizer looks very nice in my room.</li>
    <li> Too many shallow lipstick nooks.  Need more areas for round compacts.  Use it for both cosmetics and cleansing/moisturizing products too.</li>
    <li> A lot of my makeup and brushes etc fit into the compartments of this organizer. Helps me see everything and get easy access. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love this item. It fit&#x27;s perfectly on my daughter&#x27;s vanity table and has plenty of space to seperate the item&#x27;s you want and still have room for other item&#x27;s. I would buy this again. Perfect for teenager&#x27;s to organize their item&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Bought for the wife, it was shipped quickly and seems to be good quality... she has not asked to replace it yet so I guess its good.</li>
    <li> I have a teenager in the house and makeup all over the bathroom counters.  This product is just the right size and has a bunch of spaces to put a variey of makeup products in.  The openings are deep so things don&#x27;t keep spilling out!  I am thinking of ordering one more for the other side of the sink!</li>
    <li> I like it! It is made with a very good hard plastic. My concern is the organizer is too big.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It actually looks better than I expected, quality seems really good. My make up is mostly drugstore and most of items fit perfectly. I don&#x27;t have so many lipsticks, but some of my bb cremes fit really well in those small compartments. Very good organizer, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> for a product lover this is a must! helps keep everything organized and keeps my vanity looking much nicer and makes it easier for me to get ready because I can actually find what I need :)</li>
    <li> My makeup is organized! This product isn&#x27;t anything fancy but it works like it&#x27;s supposed and looks like the picture.</li>
    <li> wife uses it and enjoys the product... was to be a filler gift for X-mas but it turn out to be a good filler gift.</li>
    <li> This organizer is pretty good for keeping my bathroom vanity nice and tidy.</li>
    <li> This is perfect has plenty of room and made of tuff material.  Holds alot of items on my mothers dresser.</li>
    <li> This works really well to organize my smallish makeup collection. Don&#x27;t expect to fit a Naked pallet or something similar in it though. Great for brushes, and your everyday pieces.</li>
    <li> This organizer holds alot of my makeup stuff. it is a bit long but it holds EVERYTHING! im definitely taking this to my dorm!</li>
    <li> This product has really helped me get organized.  It is well-designed and well-made. It is a very durable product that will last a lifetime or longer. Love it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my daughter needed. She will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Top of the line.  Looks like crystal.  Edges sparkle.  Nice and heavy.  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> This organizer is perfect for my needs.  Has ample space and enough divisions to organize my makeup effectively.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> This unit is a multi-use product that is really convenient for my makeup and utensils.  It looks nice on the counter and keeps things organized.</li>
    <li> Arrived on the early morning of the \\&quot;promised\\&quot; day :) Looks just like en the pic. Thanks guys, my gf really loves it.</li>
    <li> Purchase this for my wife. She likes but it is too big for the area she wants to use it in. She is going to keep it because it is durable.</li>
    <li> I must Say I was Hesitate about the product,  unsure of the way it&#x27;s made, structure, flimsy construction but it was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for and extremely Happy!</li>
    <li> Does what it should do and looks good.</li>
    <li> This is perfect. It fits everything that I regularly use and looks great on my bathroom counter. I was nervous when I received it because there was no special packaging whatsoever, it was just in a thin plastic bag inside the box it came in (which was smashed from the USPS) but to my surprise it was completely unscathed! I love it.</li>
    <li> This is super sturdy, durable, easy to clean, and has different-sized compartments. I just wish there weren&#x27;t tiny dividers/lips in the compartments in back. Over all, it sure keeps things organized and more presentable. Before, I just kept things in plastic drawers and makeup dump bags. Anyway, I really like this and suggest it if you&#x27;re looking for something to hold your brushes and makeup in one big tray of compartments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I agree with others that the back compartments are shorter than desired, I haven&#x27;t had an issue of it not doing it&#x27;s job and holding lipsticks, etc. Take a look at the photo I uploaded to get an understanding of where I placed my cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this would be suitable for organizing office supplies even: paper/binder clips, rubber bands, sticky notes, pens/pencils, white out bottles, thumb tacks, etc. Granted, that wasn&#x27;t what this \\&quot;cosmetic organizer\\&quot; was intended for.</li>
    <li> I received my cosmetic organizer today it is just the right size to fit on top of my vanity set. I do wish the slots along the back side were deeper. Not a bad buy to hold hair brushes, perfume and makeup. It was priced just right.</li>
    <li> There was a small, small crack in the organizer when it was received---small enough that I decided it was not worth the hassle of returning it. The unit is now literally falling apart. Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> Great for all of my makeup stuff so it&#x27;s not just thrown in a drawer!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I was scared it wasnt going to be a good size but it was perfect. Only thing is where the lipsticks are suppose to go i wish they were a bit deeper. Besides that good size, enough space. Nomore going crazy thru my bag of make up!</li>
    <li> I like how it looks on my vanity.  I am not as happy with the size of the sections or how deep they go.  Containers like mascara or brushes are too tall and I have to be careful they don&#x27;t fall out, while items that are wider (such as make-up bottles) are too big and don&#x27;t fit at all.  I guess I would have liked to see the organizer filled up rather than just a few items cause then I would have known if it would have worked for my purpose.  I will try to use it for a while but not sure how well it will work in the long term.  I would not order this again.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I used it for my make up brushes, lipstick and nail polish. I have way more room on my dresser now!!</li>
    <li> Love the organizer. I put there all my make up tools as well as my cosmetic oils. Good quality</li>
    <li> I ordered this to organize my 8 billion different products. While it takes some unique arranging in some places due to the narrowness and raised parts in the back left and right sections, everything fits!</li>
    <li> So I just received this organizer and I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the longest time I had been putting my makeup in a shoebox (sad, pathetic, I know) and leaving it on the sink counter. I kept telling myself \\&quot;I really need to get an organizer for all of my stuff\\&quot; and I kept putting it off. Finally, when my makeup collection was about to explode, I took the plunge and ordered this due, in part, to all the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing! It&#x27;s big enough to hold the majority of my makeup but small enough to fit on my toilet tank (I have a pretty tiny bathroom). It holds all of my brushes, mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow - everything. The only downside, if any, is I wish it had more larger compartments along the back, or maybe on the left and right sides, for bigger items like my hairbrush, etc. Very minor issue, however. It was well worth the reasonable price and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This item is nice, but the compartments are more shallow and maller than I expected.  The look is great, even sparkly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and has has lots of compartments.  Holds all of the make-up I&#x27;ve been storing in drawers and bags for easy access.  And it fits inside my dresser so it doesn&#x27;t need to stay on top for everyone to see and collect dust. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It arrived on time and intact. Keeps everything on my dresser organized and central. It was a little larger than I thought, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem. I would recommend it if you have a fair  amount of make up.</li>
    <li> I love all the dividers and is heavier than I thought.  It will be durable for use.  What a nice piece.</li>
    <li> Slots are a little to small for lots of my makeup containers.</li>
    <li> this was for my 15 year old daughter.  she has so much make-up and nail polish. it was hard to keep desk looking neat!  now she is organized and takes less time to get ready.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It has a thick acrylic and fits all my essentials and just the right size to fit in the space on my counter.</li>
    <li> This thing is way bigger than it looks, and it is so much better than I thought it would be. It holds a lot, and it looks great, too.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly in my vanity along with my 24 lipstick acrylic organizer. i can easily organize everything i use on an everyday bases.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I expected when it came and it holds MORE stuff than I thought after I saw it! Even my boyfriend suggested me to buy another one! Haha...He thinks it&#x27;s a great product to keep my MESS within my territory. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Came on time... In perfect condition.  Really works great for organizing my cosmetics!  Looks great in my bathroom and makes it easy to get ready in the morning!</li>
    <li> Bigger than it looks but it&#x27;s the perfect size...like the sections...</li>
    <li> I like it - it&#x27;s handy, but takes up too much space on my bathroom counter top.  But, I like it.</li>
    <li> i just got it in the mail today. it was in the original package and unopened. i like the weight of it, like if i were to drop it i doubt it would shatter so easily. it is nice and thick plastic, looks easy to clean. only thing is that is pretty big. make sure you have space for it!</li>
    <li> This is very helpful for organizing my make up in my bathroom. I get up super early for work. I have to get up at 2:45 am and do not want to waste time looking through unorganized piles of make up. This helps and works great!</li>
    <li> Very cool and bigger then what i thought i was going to be it came fast ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> great organizer for make up, everything is in view, highly recommend. fits all of my make up and more if i add on</li>
    <li> I love this organizer! It was really cheap and came in excellent condition! It was shipped and delivered really quickly which was a plus! OH! and it holds ALL of my makeup...which was kind of the reason I went with this option!</li>
    <li> This organizer holds a good amount of products and helps to clear up a lot of space on my bureau. Four stars because the sections themselves are a bit weirdly sized/shaped, which makes it hard to determine how to best use the space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like it and would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This organizer is well designed overall. I use it to keep my skincare and personal care products neat and tidy on my vanity, so I appreciate the larger trays to store/display tubes and bottles. I use the middle tray to store my glasses (I wear contacts during the day) No more clutter :)&lt;br /&gt;As for cosmetics storage I would agree with the other reviewers that the trays and dividers are too shallow, but for personal care stuff it works great.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this from what I saw in the picture, I figured it would be a good place to store my makeup and accessories so they wouldn&#x27;t be all over the place, however this is amazing! the shape and sizes are perfect, the material seems very durable, and I know it will be very helpful to keep my stuff together. I&#x27;ll upload a picture when i&#x27;m done setting it up.</li>
    <li> pretty big so you can fit in it a lot of your cosmetics, looks good too, how could i live without it before!?:)</li>
    <li> Looks better in real life.....classy!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Just what my daughter needed.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED 3 OF THESE, FOR ME AND MY SISTERS. I just wanted to say its way more then what i expected, everything was great, good conditions, the shipping was amazing. ill put up a picture later. i loved it and i might order more just for a backup. i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it. i looved everywhere from winners to marshals, to wal mart to everything. could not find anything similar to this.</li>
    <li> Great!  bigger than I expected!</li>
    <li> My bathroom looked like crap before. .makeup everywhere, messy drawers, losing track of my stuff. I buy this thing and BAM! Everything is organized and elegant looking. Looks like a damn professional makeup studio on there now! The containers are the perfect height for my makeup -- I have a lot of \\&quot;short\\&quot; makeup I guess. The tallest thing I have is a blush brush that fits easily in the middle with the rest of the brushes.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy acrylic organizer. The Depth of some of the wells could have been better but overall it is meeting my needs.</li>
    <li> Love it! The sides and edges just need to be a bit higher so things don&#x27;t tip over</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and exactly as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife so that hopefully the bathroom sink can be usable again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She now uses it with acrylic drawers (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KKXA58/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15). And both of us are really pleased!</li>
    <li> This thing is great. I love all the different sized compartments and how they&#x27;re different heights as well. The trays are great for elastics or bobbi pins... or small eyeshadows or powders. Everything is easy to grab and organized! Love it. Just know that it IS pretty big and will take up a large space on a surface...</li>
    <li> Keep the vanity organized</li>
    <li> This is going to be a most welcome item on my vanity.  I can&#x27;t think of any thing it will&lt;br /&gt;not have a place for. Am going to order another for 2nd bath. Thanks for whoever thought of this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter (23 y.o.) for all of her makeup brushes, supplies, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised with how sturdy and thick this is.  I was afraid it would some flimsy plastic but not so.  She is able to put a lot of her supplies in it which keeps her makeup area more organized and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I loved this! it fit perfectly on my vanity that i also bought from Amazon! def. recommend this for anyone that needs an organizer!</li>
    <li> It is spacious, everything fits and looks clean and polished in my bath counter. Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. Inexpensive, makes my dresser look much more organized. I used to have make up all over the dresser. Now know where everything is.</li>
    <li> I wish the pockets were deeper o hold my make up a little better but it gets the job done for now.</li>
    <li> I can see all my make up at once and it stays separate din the compartments.  Then I can pick the whole thing up and move it around easily.  My friends see it and say, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s so cool!  Where did you find that!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> However, it arrived in a damaged box...actually it arrived in the box that you&#x27;d expect to see in a store. Not a brown packaging box. But it was open when I found it on my doorstep. Luckily the organizer was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> This has saved my makeup collection. It&#x27;s pretty amazing how much it holds and how well the various compartments fit different items like brushes, shadows, and lipsticks. I like that the plastic is clear so it&#x27;s even easier to see at a glance where everything is. Makeup looks better when it&#x27;s all organized and it&#x27;s easier for me to remember what I have!</li>
    <li> A bit longer than I anticipated but that was my fault. I was able to fit just about all of my cosmetics on this thing. I&#x27;m happy with that, All of my eye shadow, blush, foundation compacts, my brushes, pencils, lipstick &amp; gloss, a few bottles of nail polish too. Even my day &amp; night cream (jarred) fits. No more digging in bags looking for my stuff! It got the job done of organizing my stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this! It looks great on my vanity table, and gives me nice storage options. I kind of wish it had more than two tall container spots, because I have more tall things, ex. lipgloss, mascara, than I do little ones like standard lipstick. But great buy, I love it.</li>
    <li> love how solid this organizer is and now my makeup counter looks so much more organized.... deff a good buy</li>
    <li> I love it aswell as everything else. Amazon is the absolute best. Im new to this amd felt right at home to purchase without actually seeing. You will be extremelly suprised on how great the quality of this product is. I thought it would be way smaller but it is huge. And great i really dont nees another one. But would buy another from AMAZON!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was divided between this product and the [[ASIN:B00DUJEWDE NILECORP Acrylic Jewelry &amp; Cosmetic Storage Display Boxes Two Pieces Set.]]. The main difference is that this is larger in length and width; the other is taller and has drawers to store your things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up choosing this because I wanted it for a vanity and like all my products to be at my fingertips. This is seriously perfect -- it is good quality, looks good, and keeps all my makeup in place without hiding it in drawers. This stores enough for all the products I use day-to-day. I use a separate storage for a few additional brushes, several palettes, and a few lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would have liked is if the containers for the brushes/eyeliners/lipsticks were a little taller. Some of my things lean too much, almost falling out. I love it otherwise though!</li>
    <li> This organizer has been so helpful keeping loose earrings, make-up, q-tips, etc.  from being all over my countertops.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> Great unit.. It arrived quickly and is a prefect fit for my vanity</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! It has so many little spots to hold all of your makeup separately. I keep lipsticks, eyeliners, mascaras, brushes, and all of my bobbypins/hair ties on this organizer. It&#x27;s wonderful with all the little compartments It&#x27;s great quality as it&#x27;s thick and sturdy. I would 100% recommend this organizer.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect for me.  It organizes my make-up and keeps everything neat and easy to find.</li>
    <li> Neat, clean, high-quality, product. This organizer is good for the cosmetic products I use every day. It is easy for me to find them and keep them in an organized manner which saves me time and frustration when I am getting ready. I still have additional items scattered about my counter in other little decorative organizer cups that I add into my every day collection now and then and it is easy to find a place for them. It has nice levels of space and I like that I can see where things are without having to dig around. The only critique I have is the shallowness of the holes in the back spaces. I could put a lot more things back there if there was a little more depth to those spaces. Overall great product and happy I ordered. Very useful.</li>
    <li> it was good but it had a lot less room for my fiances items than originally thought. Overall she was happy.</li>
    <li> Lipsticks &amp; glosses-check! eye-shadows &amp; liners-check! mascara &amp; curler-check! foundation, primer &amp; blush-check! brushes, tweezers, q-tips- check..check..check...it&#x27;s all there &amp; more! From one makeup junkie to another...this is a must have!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy amd holds lots of makeup for me.  Larger than I thought it would be.  Good quality and cme quickly,</li>
    <li> No more clutter!  My make up is organized and looks glamorous on my vanity. I feel like a star while getting all &amp;#34;dolled&amp;#34; up. This little tray is the beginning of what is going to be many other acrylic purchases.</li>
    <li> This thing arrived in the actual box its sold in (no padding or additional box). I&#x27;m surprised no one stole it because it had a huge picture of the thing on the side. When I opened it, the back had a big piece cracked off. Since it&#x27;s going on a counter and I needed it now, I figured the hassle of trying to send it back wasn&#x27;t worth it. It serves its purpose, but I will not be purchasing anything from this place again.</li>
    <li> Looks nice and is heavy enough to stay put. The sections along the back of this organizer are OK for small things that stand up by themselves, like tube lipsticks. There are only two sections with sides that are tall enough to hold things like make up brushes, pencils or mascaras. Not very useful for me. Most of the sections in the front are very small as well, and only about 1/2\\&quot; deep - so again, no side support. Overall it&#x27;s OK, but it&#x27;s usefulness depends upon what you want to store.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this organizer.</li>
    <li> It fits everything. Very convenient to have to organize cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Looks very profession. A great organizer</li>
    <li> Loved it and now my daughter&#x27;s dresser is no longer cluttered!  It&#x27;s perfect!  She started using it right away.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Very nice size with plenty of room  for a lot of cosmetics</li>
    <li> I really like how organized this keeps all my makeup, its easy to see and cleans up my counter, drawers and mirror cabinet. the only thing I would change is the smaller compartments in the back, I wish they were deeper.</li>
    <li> excelente producto ya ahora si tengo todo en orden, rapido despacho buen vendedor lo recomiendo. es amplio y comodo gracias</li>
    <li> Great quality! GOOD FIT for all my make up and solved the messy sink area issue.  it WAS PURCHASED AS  A GIFT AND IT ARRIVED EARLY!  was pacakged really well. Seller even made contact to make sure we were happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Love this product, it keeps all my makeup organized and it is good quality. Very satisfied with this purchase. has places for all kinds of makeup.</li>
    <li> This is very generous in size so may not be useful for a small vanity but great for large vanities.  I keep my lipsticks, my mascara, and moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This is a great piece. Well constructed with plenty of compartments.</li>
    <li> works well for it&#x27;s purpose. Fast shipper.</li>
    <li> I had considered trying to design one myself, while this one is not perfect, it is the best&lt;br /&gt;I have seen so far, the price is definitely a plus.  My vanity definitely looks better &amp; if I want&lt;br /&gt;to clean entirely, I only have to pick this up &amp; that is really neat.  I would definitely recommend&lt;br /&gt;giving it a try!!</li>
    <li> The acrylic is nice and thick doesnt feel flimsy at all, has tons of places to put things. Was a little larger than I was expecting but I am not complaining! Good quality!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this organizer.  It is a great price, the acrylic that is used to make it is such a nice quality that it looks like glass, and it is just big enough to fit all of my stuff without looking like a monster on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  This is definitely the best $19.99 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, super product and made in USA too.  Thanks, Shirley</li>
    <li> But of course! This organizer is awesome!  &amp;#34;A place for everything and everything in it&#x27;s place&amp;#34;, as Mom used to say. At first I thought that it was a little pricey but now that I actually have it I have changed my mind. I was in Walmart and saw a&amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; organizer that looked very similar for $9.99 and groaned, but  there was absolutely no weight to it and it was NOT acrylic....there was no comparison. Mom also used to say, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34; Very happy with my purchase. I will have this forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I took a chance with this organizer. It&#x27;s very versatile, an area for my brushes, foundations, lipsticks etc.</li>
    <li> Bigger than what I expected, but there are lots of compartments to fit random accessories and make up items. It&#x27;ll definitely help me organize my counter top better!</li>
    <li> This organizer holds many items and really helps keep my shelf in order!  The \\&quot;wells\\&quot; at the back accomodate make-up brushes, which is a real plus. Packaged well and arrived timely.</li>
    <li> Yay! Finally I have some organization with all of this makeup I have! I wish I had enough counter space for 2! This definitely does the job so get it</li>
    <li> HI, YES I DID RECEIVE IT, A FEW DAYS AGO. IT;S VERY VERY NICE, JUST WHAT I WANTED. NICE AND STURDY, GOOD QUALITY, HOLDS A LOT OF THINGS. I PUT LIPSTICKS, POWDER PUFFS, BOBBY PINS, Q-TIPS, AND OTHER THINGS IN IT. AM REALLY PLEASED WITH THE AMOUNT IT HOLDS. THANKS DOLORES</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, this is her opinion about it: &amp;#34;Not deep enough for makeup brushes and lipsticks, it would be nice to have more sections instead of the trays.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This holder is fantastic -- you can organize all your makeup or hair products and everything gets its own little spot. Lots of options and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> Better than expected. All the compartments are great!</li>
    <li> Love this organizer! Was a lot larger than expected but it will work out!</li>
    <li> I only wish it were a double-decker.</li>
    <li> I love this!  simple, classy, holds all my stuff low so it doesnt cover up my mirror.  perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice and big. Fits everything</li>
    <li> i rate this 5 starts because i got my moneys worth it is bigger than it looks and i love it&lt;br /&gt;organized a whole lot</li>
    <li> I love this organizer. It holds all of my makeup and brushes.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Perhaps separating walls could be 1/4&amp;#34; higher.  However this product works well for me.  I use it inside a deep drawer in my bathroom vanity. Holds all I need.</li>
    <li> Great organizer just what I expected.  I especially like the section for lipstick and the way it raises up in the back so you can see everything clearly..</li>
    <li> Totally love this organizer, it fits perfectly in  my make up drawer,  everything fits well and still have room for more. . Finally I can find everything,  quickly. ..totally would recommend this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great organizer for make-up from foundation to make-wipes. My only concern is that it has several lipstick compartments (about 16), and I don&#x27;t use that many. So, I wish I could use that space for something else.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer! It has cut back on so much clutter in my bathroom. It makes Now my makeup won&#x27;t get lost as much as it used too. This is an essential for anyone who loves makeup and needs a way to organize it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product ! Very good for organizing all my makeup and a good size . Product was exactly as described and very fast shipping :)</li>
    <li> Hold all my make up perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Wonderful price.</li>
    <li> My sister in law wanted this for Christmas. So I ordered it. It arrived quickly and was very nice. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get their cosmetics organized.</li>
    <li> Gave 2 of these as Christmas gifts this year.  My Wife and Daughter have make up all over the place and this will help.</li>
    <li> Great storage for some of my everyday makeup!  Makes my morning routine easier and everything is neat and orderly.  I fits perfectly in the area on my bathroom vanity  between my  two sinks.</li>
    <li> I needed something that had my products out in the open, instead of in draws, and that gave me some roginization. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Now all the tools and makeup can be found in one central station.  Great quality for the price.  Hopefully they all stay in it and not in my car.</li>
    <li> This organizer is actually bigger than I thought it was. It fits everything and I can find everything so easily. This has made my mornings so much more relaxing. I am not scrambling trying to find anything anymore and my dresser looks so much neater than it did before. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This organizer works perfectly and holds many items.  I looked and looked, and this one was perfect.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  The price was great as well.</li>
    <li> This really cuts down on my make up time. Instead of digging through little make up bags, everything is in its place. It is nice quality and just what I was looking for. Plenty of room for all my cosmetics!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my vanity set it doesnt take up too much space and I&#x27;m now able to do my makeup without shuffling through makeup bags. Very organized the lipstick holds are a little big however they stand in place so that&#x27;s all that matters</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that almost all of my cosmetics can be easily arranged by this amazing product! It looks just fabulous and great below the bathroom light.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the wife and she has it set up on our bathroom counter with more items than you can imagine so I&#x27;m guessing she loves this storage container.</li>
    <li> The gift went over well with the receiver so this gets 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> got it in mail yesterday i love it.</li>
    <li> If you have lots of products cluttering up your counter or vanity this is for you. The compartments are generously sized and are deep enough to keep your brushes and mascaras upright. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much this organizer holds! Now all my products are at my fingertips and I hardly ever have to go on a hunt for that eyeliner that just rolled off the table!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a new glass vanity and I needed to organize ALL my make-up and lots of face and hair products. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much this thing holds and it is made of high quality acrylic. It was very important to me that the organizer did not look cheap since the vanity is next to the door and you can see it from the other rooms. I am very picky about the quality of the products I put in my home. This one is definately a winner!</li>
    <li> Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;This acrylic cosmetic organizer is a product of great quality as well as functional and lovely looking! I purchased one a while back and it looks like new with almost no care! I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing a second one. Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> So pissed.  Purchased this product and when it arrived it looked like it was the perfect size.  Unfortunately whoever packed it did a horrible job.  As soon as a lifted the box out the amazon shipping box the entire thing slipped out and hit the floor.  A huge chunk chipped off and now its ruined.  Returning to Amazon before ever having a chance to try it out.</li>
    <li> This makeup organizer is exactly what I was hoping for. I was kind of scared to get it because I thought plastic might look weird/break easily. Definitely not the case! It&#x27;s extremely sturdy and kind of looks like glass and not cheap or anything! Great for my makeup! :)</li>
    <li> I love this makeup organizer so much! It is beautiful and looks great on my vanity. Removed clutter and now I can find all my makeup and it doesn&#x27;t roll off the counter... I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> Just too big for me, holds alot, but if you have a small vanity do not buy. Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It holds so much! My bathroom counter used to be a mess, even with other baskets but this organizer is amazing bc of all the small compartments. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> This is so great! I put all of my daily items in here on my vanity and it looks so pretty and it even has lipstick holders WHICH I DIDNT KNOW when i purchased it so thats a plus!!! Love it</li>
    <li> got it for my mother for her birthdat i opened it to make sure it wasnt broken or anything and its great and id love one for myelf looks justlike it does in the picture too</li>
    <li> Its good size &amp; made of good, thick quality plastic. It holds quite a bit of products. No gimics here, u get exactly what it says it is. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try and organize my makeup -- they are well made and I like them.  They look nice and seem durable -- something that seems like they will work well for many years...</li>
    <li> It is great for makeup, make up brushes,  face creams, lipsticks and all kinds of little things. I have Ikea bathroom sink cabinet with wide drawers and so i put it inside. Now it looks more organized and clean.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star rating because it came super fast and the organizer is very efficient. The acrylic is more durable than I anticipated. I will definitely recommend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This make up organizer is ok. I wish the cups (I guess that&#x27;s what you would call them) were deeper bc small tubes like lipsticks lean over too much!</li>
    <li> Great delivery. I love it</li>
    <li> This organizer is amazing. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! It&#x27;s pretty big; it holds all of my makeup with room to spare. It looks beautiful on my sink and I smile every time I look at it. I love being able to see all the makeup I have, instead of poking through a messy drawer. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this, do it!</li>
    <li> I have another one that is similar and I will take this to our FL home to use there.  I love the organization at my fingertips and this provides that.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter to store her make-up.  She loves it because it can hold a lot of items and they are handy to use from the organizer.</li>
    <li> Should have purchased one of these decades ago - keeps my cosmetics organized &amp; has lots of room for everything!</li>
    <li> It is simply designed but good looking. It saved me a lot of space. Great product! I recommend it to everyone who is bothered with messy skin care bottles</li>
    <li> Very functional! I am able to store and organize a wide range of my make up products with this.</li>
    <li> This cosmetic organizer arrived as scheduled.  It is very sturdy and bigger than the picture on the website. It holds the majority of my makeup, brushes, and lip sticks.  I really like that it is clear so it blends in with other color containers on my dresser.  Overrall, I am very happy with this purchase.  I will be purchasing one for my sister-in-law&#x27;s birthday coming up soon.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. In good condition.  Big enough to put all my cosmetics and brushes. Love this product. Helps me organize my stuff and no more clutter.</li>
    <li> love to have my make up in one place, is a very good organizator for lipsticks and a very good size.&lt;br /&gt;reccomend this</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell looking at a picture online, but this is a very good quality acrylic. Not a flimsy acrylic.  Nice size and shape. Holds a lot of products.  If you need to corral your cosmetics this can help.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big and nice. It fits all my make-up stuff.</li>
    <li> Are you tired of seeing makeup all over the countertop? I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for Mrs Tex, and she just loves it. It doesn&#x27;t look at all cheap. Initially it sat in its box unopened, I put it on the vanity. The first time she saw it she said how much she really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, it looks better in real life!</li>
    <li> I like the organizer but find there are openings on both sides that nothing i own fits into, otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Product has helped organize my cosmetics, things are not all over. Great product. Delivered quickly and product is exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> This is much nicer than picture. Lots of various size compartments with a space for everything. I can find exactly what I&#x27;m looking for and it looks great on my dressing table. No more fumbling around looking for things. Special place for brushes, eyeshadow, primers and foundations, nail polish.My &amp;#34;getting ready to face the world&amp;#34; time is so much easier and time saving. So glad I bought this slick little organizer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected, but it looks great on my vanity and everything is well organized. I wish there wasn&#x27;t as many lipstick holder spots, but I still find uses for those.</li>
    <li> great organizer! Good quality and large space for items!</li>
    <li> is super big!! i love it and I recomend it for put stand up make ups and brushes!! great product</li>
    <li> Sturdier and higher quality than I expected- it&#x27;s definitely not a flimsy piece of plastic.  It works great for me.  However, if you have a lot of make up, it&#x27;s probably too small.  I&#x27;m pretty basic with make up.  I only have one foundation, one mascara, couple of blushes, highlighter, and a few different eye shadows and eyeliners.  I think for many people this would be too small.</li>
    <li> Great little addition to the bathroom. Stores all my makeup for easy viewing and reach.</li>
    <li> Just what my girls needed</li>
    <li> Thanks for the awesome organizer! Shipped quickly. Definitely satisfied.</li>
    <li> worked very well..... it was a gift for my mom</li>
    <li> So so useful,  definitely get it!</li>
    <li> Wish I had bought one of these sooner. It allows me to keep my makeup on the top of my dresser in an organized fashion. I used to use a makeup box, but it was annoying because I  often could not find things quickly. This organizer allows me to see all my makeup at once. It has a lot of sections, which is nice. It&#x27;s cute and made of a nice sturdy material.  I recommend this for anyone who has a tendency to leave their makeup laying around on the top of their dresser.</li>
    <li> I use this to organize my manicure supplies and nail polish.  It has lots of room, looks very nice, and is very smooth on the bottom so it does not scratch my dresser.</li>
    <li> When I first seen this organizer, I knew I had to have it. My friend actually emailed me this. I&#x27;m so happy she did, she saved my makeup. I had my makeup in small bags and always had to dump onto my bed, search for brushes or applicators and put it back in and if I forgot something else. It was dumping out again. I ordered it as soon as I seen the other viewer photos. It arrived early, and package well. I dumped out for the last final time! Everything fit, my brushes stand tall and all accesible. I love this!! I don&#x27;t see or can say anything negative about this organizer. So useful, creative and pretty. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep in my half bathroom in my dorm--and I love it! It fits perfectly on the back of a toilet and it&#x27;s very convenient. At first, I didn&#x27;t like the smaller sections on the left of the organizer and just wished it was one big section (as on the right) but I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to it and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Clear organizer for cosmetics very comfortable. I placed it in the brush, lip balms and lipsticks, concealers, hair brushes, hair pins, powder, blush, base face and shadows, some pallets and pencils, mascara .. Lots of sections of different sizes, so I quickly find what I need. The only thing that is not very convenient, is not enough to compartment the medium brush (in the usual pocket they are lost, and for lipsticks - fall). but overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase! Looks wonderful filled.</li>
    <li> Just bought this, great for the price except only the two middle holders to the back are actually deep enough for my makeup brushes and pencils. The two holders on each side are more shallow than I expected. For the most part it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help organize my ridiculous amount of makeup; it is perfect. I wish it had a drawer in the bottom but for $20 or less, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Far cheaper than any other organizers I had found like this and the quality is wonderful. I will definitely be looking for more products from US Acrylic.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 14 year old and she absolutely loves it!  Extremely well made. Very hard plastic.  Thick and durable. I&#x27;m going to buy one for myself!  Can&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> Great organizer, would like to see a bigger version to fit on entire vanity, but for the price, the size fits</li>
    <li> Arrived right on time, wife loves it.... mission accomplished!</li>
    <li> Bought this item  for my mom, she loves it. good quality and size is perfect fit on her bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> This organizer is the perfect size for all of my make-up.</li>
    <li> awesome!! Shipped fast! its HUGE</li>
    <li> I love this so much! The raised compartments are heaven sent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this.  I set up a &#x27;makeup&#x27; table and needed something to keep my stuff in.  I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup but I do have the basics.  this organizer has the perfect spot for all my items and is easy to access.  I haven&#x27;t had to clean it yet, so I can&#x27;t speak to how easy that is.</li>
    <li> I feel so much more organized now that I have this! I just wish some of the little holes where deeper. But overall pretty happy with it, makes the bathroom look more organized and I can get to my makeup quickly.</li>
    <li> This really is a great organizer for the top of your vanity or bathroom countertop. You can believe the reviews that it a good value for the price-made of very durable plastic. It will hold a BUNCH of your make up-lots of room for lipsticks and powders and powders. You will like it, trust me.</li>
    <li> Great Lil organizer. Is a bit small. But if youre like me and and don&#x27;t have that much makeup. Its perfect.</li>
    <li> Sturdy. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because some of the compartments are a little awkward. I don&#x27;t have anything to put in those specific spots... Other than that very durable very cool product.</li>
    <li> Good design and excellent quality. It&#x27;s sturdy and well made. Good value for the price. My makeup is now organized.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it. Another purchase bought for her for the bathroom remodel. She now has place to sit and do her mak-up and keep it tidy.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to hold A LOT of makeup for my daughter&#x27;s new dresser.  This is a large organizer, great quality at a great price.  Very pleased &amp; will be purchasing another for myself in the near future.  Definitely recommend this item after looking at so many.</li>
    <li> Great quality and saves a lot of space in my bathroom, and makes it look less messy than when I have makeup scattered across the counter.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to control the clutter on my vanity.  I do wish that the lipstick/nail polish holders were a little deeper to hold mascara wands, but overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Great organizer that allows me to see all of my cosmetics.  I may buy another one because I still have a lot of stuff (it&#x27;s big enough, I just have too much!).</li>
    <li> I love that how my make up is now organized, I just hate how the lipstick or lipgloss won&#x27;t stay in their cubby. It&#x27;s still a good purchase though!</li>
