      <li>The razor works great.  </li>
      <li>the design is good, but the blades don&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, a really nice detail razor</li>
      <li>In addition to doing a nice job under the lip, I have also found that this razor does a nice job creating a cleaner edge around the perimeter of my goatee.  </li>
      <li>Works nice</li>
      <li>Looks nice.</li>
      <li>In addition to doing a nice job under the lip, I have also found that this razor does a nice job creating a cleaner edge around the perimeter of my goatee.  </li>
      <li>Since I already own and love a merkur safety razor, finding this tool just made sense.</li>
      <li>Cheap disposable razors are better!</li>
      <li>but the blades tend to pull hairs often and the angle to catch the hair is not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;Can trim bridge of your nose between eyebrows ok.</li>
      <li>Built to last, excellent product!</li>
      <li>It works ok</li>
      <li>I hope that they are better than the one that came with the Razor.</li>
      <li>Just looks like a toy.allows me to shave just the area I want...bordered by lip on the top, mustache on the side,</li>
      <li>Love the razor.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>

      <li>This Merkur gives you better visibility to what you&#x27;re doing.    </li>
      <li>it looks nice on the shelf... and would be great if it actually did something.</li>
      <li>there were better blades available</li>
      <li>The blade can move around and the blade rust easily .</li>
      <li>I think the electrics are better suited to maintaining hair length than providing a clean shave/edge.  </li>
      <li>But even cheap 10 to the pack disposable razors from the dollar store can handle it and are sharper than these blades.  </li>
      <li>I tried it once and found it was not up to the task of creating a clean edge.  </li>
      <li>I have worn a mustache and goatee for a while, but never bothered to clean up the area under my lip.  </li>
      <li>I typically use the large edge, which is perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>If the blades were as good as most other double edge razor blades this would sell a lot more.</li>
      <li>I gave it one extra star because the razor itself is nice.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;That was a while ago -- surely they have fixed the problem,&amp;#34</li>
      <li>This razor is a great idea, and it really does get into places (like the corner between the moustache and beard) that other razors don&#x27;t go.</li>
      <li>The Gillette was for shaving the bulk of my face, the Wahl was for maintaining the right length on my goatee, and you can figure out what the scissors were for.  </li>
      <li>I hesitated ordering the razor and the blades, but decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the razor to be perfect for my use and the blades to be sharp and have had absolutely no problems using them at all.</li>
      <li>The latter work fine if you&#x27;re not trying to trim around a beard, but the straight open comb is the most accurate, since it can come right up to the edge of the beard.</li>
      <li>What a great idea for those of us that find it hard to reach under the nose to shave (even if we don&#x27;t have a moustache).</li>
      <li>it does exactly what he needs it to do.</li>
      <li>but he said because it is a smaller razor you have to put more pressure on it.  </li>
      <li>I spent about $25, so kind of medium priced for these things.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Skipping over the details of my research, my first attempt for a solution was an electric trimmer that was sized for mustache and goatee trimming.  </li>
      <li>This trimmer might be a nice if one could find sharp blades for it.</li>
      <li>It is easy to handle and very solid.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t spend all that much time looking on-line (maybe 30 minutes??), and this Merkur razor was the only one I found that seemed like it might fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>This is a great idea for the beard and moustache guy, but the quality is poor.</li>
      <li>really* wanted this to work</li>
      <li>straight razor.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I guess that&#x27;s at least good customer service.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wet shaving to great success with straight razors and double-edges for eight years, and this is extremely likely to pull your whiskers and leave nicks rather than actually shave.  </li>
      <li>Work on a better ,SHARP blade .</li>
      <li>For someone with very large hands or fat fingers, this could be an issue...but for me, with average hands and fingers, its fine.  </li>

      <li>My Gillette is probably sharper, but due to its size and multiple blades, it&#x27;s not all that easy to get a clean edge with it.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s main use is to display it on your razor stand and have people ask you what it is.&lt;br /&gt;Update: They are allowing me to return the product after 30 days</li>
      <li>I love this little razor.</li>
      <li>Actually, it seems well made, but it wasn&#x27;t very effective -- it cuts hair eventually, but not nearly as well as any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>It looked normal in the picture</li>
      <li>It looked normal in the picture</li>
      <li>OK, I&#x27;m exaggerating, but I&#x27;d rather go back to carefully using the side of a normal razor than ravage my chin with this thing.  </li>
      <li>Neither the razor nor the trimmer could handle the clean up under my lip, simply due to their size.  </li>
      <li>Item arrived quickly &amp; was what I expected.  </li>
      <li>If you are thinking of buying this...unless you are quite young with light down on your face...forget it.  </li>

      <li>In spite of a negative review about the blades not being all that sharp, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I love Murker over products overall, but this SUCKS!</li>
      <li>The standard double edged Merkur blade glides smoothly as it shaves, the trimmer blade on the other hand catches and hesitates on every single hair.     </li>
      <li>I ordered this Merkur Moustache/Eyebrow Razor particularly give myself a nice-clean military style shave above my ears.</li>
      <li>use this almost every time I shave to get the hard to reach spot under my nose, which my Gillette Super Speed is to big</li>
      <li>It is fine, it allows for trimming of facial hair not easily done by the typical razor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought one of these Razors, I had one before a few years ago. But I don&#x27;t remember the blade that came with the Razor being so bad, I got one shave with it, and it is so dull that I couldn&#x27;t get another shave with it. I also ordered the platinum blades I hope that they are better than the one that came with the Razor. If not I will be witting another review on those blades.  [[ASIN:B0012ZMAXC Merkur Chrome Moustache &amp; Eyebrow Razor]]</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because it is the only one like it. I read the other reviews and was worried but i found out that if i use it everyday so the hair is not so long and I use oil on the area to shave instead of soap pr cream it works great.</li>
    <li> It works ok but the blades tend to pull hairs often and the angle to catch the hair is not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;Can trim bridge of your nose between eyebrows ok. This is very small.</li>
    <li> I have worn a mustache and goatee for a while, but never bothered to clean up the area under my lip.  I recently decided I wanted a cleaner look, and started searching for a \\&quot;tool\\&quot; to help.  My existing tools consisted of a Gillette Fusion razor, a full-sized Wahl electric trimmer, and a pair of mustache scissors.  The Gillette was for shaving the bulk of my face, the Wahl was for maintaining the right length on my goatee, and you can figure out what the scissors were for.  Neither the razor nor the trimmer could handle the clean up under my lip, simply due to their size.  Given the small size of the area I wanted hairless, they were just too big to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skipping over the details of my research, my first attempt for a solution was an electric trimmer that was sized for mustache and goatee trimming.  I spent about $25, so kind of medium priced for these things.  I tried it once and found it was not up to the task of creating a clean edge.  Not even close.  When I was done using it, things looked sloppier than when I started.  I think the electrics are better suited to maintaining hair length than providing a clean shave/edge.  I returned it (thank you, Target, for a generous return policy), realizing I probably needed a razor of some type, rather than a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t spend all that much time looking on-line (maybe 30 minutes??), and this Merkur razor was the only one I found that seemed like it might fit the bill.  In spite of a negative review about the blades not being all that sharp, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  It does seem that the blades could be sharper, but they do the job, and since I only use this for a small area (less than 2 square inches) and since I don&#x27;t use it every day (I typically shave every day, but I do the under-the-lip cleanup every other shave), the lack of sharpness has not been a problem for me.  The key is the width of the blade edges.  I typically use the large edge, which is perfect for me.  It allows me to shave just the area I want...bordered by lip on the top, mustache on the side, goatee on the bottom, and a narrow strip of hair in the middle.  In addition to doing a nice job under the lip, I have also found that this razor does a nice job creating a cleaner edge around the perimeter of my goatee.  My Gillette is probably sharper, but due to its size and multiple blades, it&#x27;s not all that easy to get a clean edge with it.  This Merkur gives you better visibility to what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is solidly made.  I expect it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one item final item I want to comment on is the size of this razor.  It&#x27;s downright miniature.  The product dimensions are probably stated in the product description, but I didn&#x27;t see it and/or it didn&#x27;t register.  It looked normal in the picture (there was nothing in the picture for size comparison), but everything about this thing is small.  For someone with very large hands or fat fingers, this could be an issue...but for me, with average hands and fingers, its fine.  Just looks like a toy.allows me to shave just the area I want...bordered by lip on the top, mustache on the side, goatee on the bottom, and a narrow strip of hair in the middle.

    <li> Good idea but the blades are terrible! I read negative reviews but I figure I give it a shot and was disappointed as soon as this product was put to use.</li>
    <li> This razor is a great idea, and it really does get into places (like the corner between the moustache and beard) that other razors don&#x27;t go. The (special-purpose nonstandard) blades are dull out of the box, however, and are worthless after one or two uses. The blades are also not stainless steel, so they rust unless you take them out of the razor after every use and dry them off.  I tossed my moustache razor after a couple months of struggle, because I got tired of the pulling and the stubble that results from a dull blade.    If you want accuracy with a razor that takes standard blades, consider a \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; open-comb razor like the [[ASIN:B0009IEAUY Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Open]] or [[ASIN:B00333GSLQ Merkur 25C Long Handle Double Edge Safety Razor, Open Tooth]]. You can pick up an old Gillette on ebay as well. Be sure to go with the \\&quot;old style\\&quot; razors (circa 1920), which have a straight comb (as compared to the \\&quot;new\\&quot; style, where the comb droops down if you look at it from the side, or the \\&quot;tech,\\&quot; which has a straight bar instead of comb. The latter work fine if you&#x27;re not trying to trim around a beard, but the straight open comb is the most accurate, since it can come right up to the edge of the beard. Note that a straight-comb razor requires a very delicate touch; you&#x27;ll cut yourself if you mash down on it.</li>
    <li> My brother in law recommended this product to me while I was on vacation in Florida, I bought it and I love it.</li>
    <li> Way over priced by MERKUR! This thing is a joke. I tried using it three times. The one blade it came with rips the hair out, it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair. I love Murker over products overall, but this SUCKS!</li>
    <li> Love the razor.  What a great idea for those of us that find it hard to reach under the nose to shave (even if we don&#x27;t have a moustache). The razor works great.  However for me it becomes useless due to the dull blades. Really dull blades.  I have a typical old geezer beard slightly on the tough side.  But even cheap 10 to the pack disposable razors from the dollar store can handle it and are sharper than these blades.  Shaving with it is quite painful.  The blade drags and pulls on each hair.  Tried using soap, cream, oil, nothing worked.  Fact is, the blades are just dull right out of the box. If you are thinking of buying this...unless you are quite young with light down on your face...forget it.  Save your money. I gave it one extra star because the razor itself is nice.</li>
    <li> I like this little shaver cause it&#x27;s small enough to shave between chin area when doing goatee or cleaning the mustache area..I read about the complaints of the merkur blades.. I didn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with the blade that came with it. Felt sharp that I nick my self a little bit. ill give an update later on since I bought more blades</li>
    <li> not sure what to say about this. it looks nice on the shelf... and would be great if it actually did something. wound up trashing it, and getting a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the truth is...the design is good, but the blades don&#x27;t do anything. so technically, it&#x27;s the blades that get one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i had a son, i could teach him to shave with this, since it doesn&#x27;t actually do anything.</li>
    <li> I like the Merkur brand and I have been shaving exclusively with a Merkur safety razor and Merkur blades for a few years. So, I was really disappointed by this beard trimmer.    The problem is that the Merkur blades for this trimmer are not in any way comparable to the standard Merkur double edged safety razor blades.  The blades for this trimmer are actually quite dull.     To verify this, I specifically compared the sharpness of the blades on properly prepped skin. The standard double edged Merkur blade glides smoothly as it shaves, the trimmer blade on the other hand catches and hesitates on every single hair.     This trimmer might be a nice if one could find sharp blades for it. But, unfortunately, there are no such blades.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Merkur Moustache/Eyebrow Razor particularly give myself a nice-clean military style shave above my ears. And it Works Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read all the reviews about the Merkur Platinum Moustache Blades from years ago in which many people stated that the blades were dull. I hesitated ordering the razor and the blades, but decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the razor to be perfect for my use and the blades to be sharp and have had absolutely no problems using them at all.</li>
    <li> It is fine, it allows for trimming of facial hair not easily done by the typical razor. Unfortunately it came without blade replacements. Having difficulty obtaining them.</li>
    <li> I *really* wanted this to work -- I have cutouts in my van dyke that this would have been perfect for -- so I convinced myself to discount the other bad reviews.  &amp;#34;That was a while ago -- surely they have fixed the problem,&amp;#34; I thought, or &amp;#34;some people are fussy.&amp;#34; So I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it sucks.  Actually, it seems well made, but it wasn&#x27;t very effective -- it cuts hair eventually, but not nearly as well as any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s a bit like scraping at your hairs with a small spoon.  OK, I&#x27;m exaggerating, but I&#x27;d rather go back to carefully using the side of a normal razor than ravage my chin with this thing.  I sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they made the handle tiny along with the blade -- the handle is thinner than a straw.  Why???  Just because I&#x27;m trying to cut a smaller swath out of my beard doesn&#x27;t mean my fingers shrank to the size of a 5-year-old&#x27;s!  WTF???</li>
    <li> my husband loves this razor.  I know the reviews have been bad but he said because it is a smaller razor you have to put more pressure on it.  it does exactly what he needs it to do.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly &amp; was what I expected.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> Looks nice. Works nice</li>
    <li> Handsome but virtually useless due to extreme dullness of blades. This product is worthless as a shaving device. It&#x27;s main use is to display it on your razor stand and have people ask you what it is.&lt;br /&gt;Update: They are allowing me to return the product after 30 days, I guess that&#x27;s at least good customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently sporting a handle bar moustache and goatee and I needed a tool to handle the close detail work. Since I already own and love a merkur safety razor, finding this tool just made sense. I love this little razor. Great merkur quality that I expect. This works well on eyebrows too. The blades are a bit pricey(10 packfor  $8.50) but I shouldn&#x27;t have to change it out too often. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Needs to come up with razors that are sharp. Otherwise, a really nice detail razor</li>
    <li> Dull blades make  a good product WORTHLESS !!!!!!!!!! Work on a better ,SHARP blade . Cheap disposable razors are better!</li>
    <li> Built to last, excellent product!</li>
    <li> Perfect niche tool for trimming, but they stopped there. If the blades were as good as most other double edge razor blades this would sell a lot more. It is a little disappointing that Merkur stopped quality control at the finish line for this product. But this is a review of the razor, not the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great size, perfect for its intended use. It is easy to handle and very solid. With so few parts, it is likely to last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this almost every time I shave to get the hard to reach spot under my nose, which my Gillette Super Speed is to big for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always make use of the wider side; the narrow side is a little too small to be of much use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there were better blades available, Id give this product five stars.</li>
    <li> This thing sucks. I&#x27;ve been wet shaving to great success with straight razors and double-edges for eight years, and this is extremely likely to pull your whiskers and leave nicks rather than actually shave.  Save your dough (and skin).</li>
    <li> This neat seeming device on paper turned out to be basically worthless in actual use for a number of reasons mentioned in other reviews (which I mistakenly didn&#x27;t read).  Back to the straight razor for trimming around the beard.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea for the beard and moustache guy, but the quality is poor. It The blade can move around and the blade rust easily .</li>
