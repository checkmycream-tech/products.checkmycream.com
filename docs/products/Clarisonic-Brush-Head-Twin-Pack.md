      <li>I guess that is the price you pay for good clean skin.</li>
      <li>It gives me a good clean and didn&#x27;t upset my face upon switching.</li>
      <li>I should have known the price was too good to be true.</li>

      <li>I love using my Clarisonic</li>
      <li>Love the Clarisonic</li>
      <li>I love the longer bristles on this brush.</li>
      <li>I bought these a couple months ago but am getting around to writing the review now - these are NOT the authentic Clarisonic Brush Heads.</li>
      <li>Works better than the original in my opinion!</li>
      <li>I believed the good reviews and bought the deep pore brush heads from Optimum Outlet.</li>
      <li>This is okay for a mild cleansing.  </li>
      <li>The bristles seem to be a finer gauge bristle but with many, many more bristles than in the Normal Cleansing heads.  </li>
      <li>They are still super soft, but do a great job of getting all the super-strong sunblock I use every day off my face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Clarisonic if the first system I&#x27;ve used that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for the amazing price!</li>
      <li>It has made a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>Huge difference.</li>
      <li>Have had my mia for a few years and am always on the lookout for the best prices.</li>
      <li>I was a bit hesitant after reading all the reviews about counterfeit product received; however, my shipment was fully genuine.  </li>
      <li>These are great replacement brushes and I&#x27;d definitely buy them again.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I enjoy (and love)</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m 100% sure these are not the real one!</li>
      <li>They leave my skin glowing and squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>Not totally wrinkle free but good.</li>
      <li>Right!  </li>
      <li>even though I felt like it did a great job on my skin, I wanted something a little more powerful.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not much to say about them, they work great</li>
      <li>Keeps face super clean.</li>
      <li>After reading the negative reviews I was hesitant but my order came from b-glowing and it came on time and works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Well, they are wonderful as they really do clean the skin deeply and leave it feeling smooth and clean (like the other brush heads do).</li>
      <li>This is better than the normal brush.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love my Clarisonic and buying new brush heads is a not unpleasant necessity.</li>
      <li>She said that she recommends the deep cleansing brush to all of her patients, and I am so glad she had my try it!</li>
      <li>in simple packaging and fit my clarisonic!!</li>
      <li>These deep pore brushes do exactly what they say, the give your pores a wonderful deep cleaning.</li>
      <li>These do the trick, but I honestly don&#x27;t notice a difference between these and the regular heads.</li>
      <li>the plastic cover the bristles look right.</li>
      <li>Sure, it might cost you $10 more if you buy from Amazon vs. some other seller, but you&#x27;ll still be saving a lot of money (plus, you&#x27;ll be getting the real deal).  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very soft and cheap.</li>
      <li>Upon opening they look very real</li>
      <li>I was also interested to find that this brush head feels much softer than the sensitive brush head, making my skin feel very clean but not irritated.</li>
      <li>Just received my twin pack of authentic deep pore brushes for under $30 - steal!  </li>
      <li>The product came exactly as advertised, two clarisonic acne heads.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying them again as they have become my favorite brush head.</li>
      <li>These work better than the generic versions.</li>
      <li>then it did at 40, really!</li>
      <li>These brush heads were genuine and new and shipped fast with</li>
      <li>I went from the sensitive head that was included with my original purchase to these with no issues.</li>
      <li>These arrived without the manufacturer&#x27;s packaging, and do not feel like the brush head I replaced - they are soft and don&#x27;t seem to clean my face.</li>
      <li>Purity Made Simple Cleanser and get a super clean face.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear makup and use very few beauty products I don&#x27;t really need to as clean skin and not being a person who tans my skin is pretty good for 58 yrs old.</li>
      <li>Anyone who&#x27;s used the real brush heads knows this doesn&#x27;t happen on the first use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am finding that this brush head is really great at rooting out tiny pimples that are located under the nose area or any other area for that matter</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the deep pore brushes, when they&#x27;re real, are fantastic.</li>
      <li>Really cleans them out.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>They are the real deal packed in Clarisonic</li>
      <li>I ordered them from the seller &#x27;fast vibes &#x27;</li>
      <li>These brush heads weren&#x27;t really &amp;#34;deep pore&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>and they seem to really help my skin.</li>
      <li>Use them instead of the acne brushes for my very acne-prone skin.  </li>
      <li>my wife really likes these brushes.</li>
      <li>this is not the real thing</li>
      <li>just go to dill lards and buy the real one.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and this brush head keeps my skin clear so much better than the basic brush head that comes with the Mia.</li>
      <li>Instead, I have to re-install my old brush to really feel like I&#x27;m getting the right level of scrub.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I believed the good reviews and bought the deep pore brush heads from Optimum Outlet. As it turns out, the brush heads are counterfeits that look very similar to the real ones. They came in real looking individual boxes with the Clarisonic logo on the cover, but they fit funny on my Clarisonic Mia, and make a strange noise when turned on. Most importantly, the bristles are very rough and stiff, making my face red and painful after one use. I was still unsure this was a counterfeit until I ordered some from an authorized dealer... Huge difference. The bristles for the deep pore cleaning brush heads should be soft to the touch, and are different in length. It scares me that there are counterfeits out there that look so similar to the real ones, but pay attention and you&#x27;ll spot the fakes!</li>
    <li> My brush heads were sold by Hunting SOHO. These are not Clarisonic brush heads. I compared it to the one I have at home that came with the brush from the manufacturer and it is not the same. I should have known the price was too good to be true. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> If I got this at sephora, it would have cost me $40... Instead it was half of that! And works great!</li>
    <li> I love the longer bristles on this brush. Works better than the original in my opinion! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I LOOOVE my clarisonic Pro and these twin pack brushes at 28.00 including shipping is a great deal! I normally get them from Ebay but this seller was a couple dollars cheaper. I feel that this brush is great at cleaning my face and I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic Pro for almost 2 years and it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these from Trendi USA, no it didn&#x27;t come in a box but it worked just as well as the other replacement brushes I&#x27;ve purchased before and it was cheaper and it lasts just as long as the ones sold by Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats my 2 cents :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic Mia for about two years and wanted to try the Deep Pore Cleansing heads.  I LOVE THEM!!  One would think that for deep cleansing the bristles would be stiff but that&#x27;s not the case. The bristles seem to be a finer gauge bristle but with many, many more bristles than in the Normal Cleansing heads.  I use my Clarisonic with Philosophy Purity Made Simple Cleanser and get a super clean face. These Deep Pore heads leave my face ready for the Dr Denese products I use.  Another thing, the price of the brush heads on Amazon beast any other price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> These arrived without the manufacturer&#x27;s packaging, and do not feel like the brush head I replaced - they are soft and don&#x27;t seem to clean my face. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love the Clarisonic but I sure wish the replacement brushes were not so expensive. I guess that is the price you pay for good clean skin. I don&#x27;t wear makup and use very few beauty products I don&#x27;t really need to as clean skin and not being a person who tans my skin is pretty good for 58 yrs old. Not totally wrinkle free but good. I highly recommed Clarisonic and yes, every 3 to 4 months max you need to replace the brushes.</li>
    <li> These are great replacement brushes and I&#x27;d definitely buy them again.  Use them instead of the acne brushes for my very acne-prone skin.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> my wife really likes these brushes. will definitely order more as soon as these ones are spent up. a a</li>
    <li> this is not the real thing and I would not recommend unless u don&#x27;t mind wasting $$. just go to dill lards and buy the real one. I didnt read the reviews till after an d its to late!!</li>
    <li> I love using my Clarisonic Plus. I bought the twin pack so that my son could have his own brush head. These came in a Clarisonic Box just as I expected. The last time I ordered one from a different seller, it was sent without a box and didn&#x27;t seem new. Great replacement brushes!</li>
    <li> First of all, I enjoy (and love) my Clarisonic Pro immensely, so, when they came out with these &#x27;Deep Pore Cleansing&#x27; brush heads I knew that I would need to try them out. Well, they are wonderful as they really do clean the skin deeply and leave it feeling smooth and clean (like the other brush heads do). I am finding that this brush head is really great at rooting out tiny pimples that are located under the nose area or any other area for that matter and it only takes a couple of tries (AM / PM) with the Clarisonic to rid your skin of them. I will definitely be buying them again as they have become my favorite brush head.</li>
    <li> Real.&lt;br /&gt;Authentic.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently I need more words to make this legit. So that&#x27;s what this is here. Smiles. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Love my Clairsonic.  I use it every nite and have a better complexion because of it.</li>
    <li> Product is as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve notice a noticeable difference sine I started using my Clarisonic .  Theses brushes have decrease my breakouts considerably.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic about 4 years now and I love it to death. I started using the Deep Pore brush heads right after they came out and they seem to really help my skin. I love that Amazon has them so cheap!</li>
    <li> I prefer the Normal Brush Heads that come with the Clarisonic Mia.  It seems to cleanse better and get deeper into the pores.  This is okay for a mild cleansing.  Prepare to hit the button twice (2 mins) on the Clarisonic to get the same cleaning as once (1 min) with the other heads.</li>
    <li> These brush heads weren&#x27;t really &amp;#34;deep pore&amp;#34; cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I imagine deep pore I imagine something rougher than just a washcloth, but these brush bristles were exceedingly soft and thus did not really exfoliate, thereby defeating the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t do NOTHING, if that makes sense, but don&#x27;t expect something amazing.</li>
    <li> These work on my old sonicare as usual.  They clean well and oscillate like the generic ones do not.  I am not saying that the generic ones will not work, they just didn&#x27;t work on the model of sonicare mia that I have.  It is probably 3-4 years old.  These are quite a bit more expensive than the generic ones so I hope the generic works for you.</li>
    <li> I usually use the sensitive brush head as I have oily, acne-prone skin. However I decided to buy the deep pore, and yes the sensitive brush head is a  bit softer, but I haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions with the deep pore, so I think I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Good price for replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Good product and service</li>
    <li> Great replacement at a great place. Works perfectly. I love the Mia for men. No outbreaks since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I bought these a couple months ago but am getting around to writing the review now - these are NOT the authentic Clarisonic Brush Heads. I even compared them to newly bought replacement heads at a Macy&#x27;s - the plastic from Amazon is cheaper and makes a funny noise when attached and turned on , the brush fibers are lower quality, longer, splayed out, and not as stiff as the real ones. Do NOT buy your replacement heads here !!</li>
    <li> I have had my Clarisonic brush for 3 years, and my current dermatologist recommended that I try the deep cleansing brush head. She said that she recommends the deep cleansing brush to all of her patients, and I am so glad she had my try it! The inner set of bristles rotates separately from the outer set of bristles, providing a deeper clean. I was also interested to find that this brush head feels much softer than the sensitive brush head, making my skin feel very clean but not irritated. I highly recommend that everyone with a Clarisonic Face Brush try the deep cleaning brush head!</li>
    <li> Have had my mia for a few years and am always on the lookout for the best prices. These brush heads were genuine and new and shipped fast with my prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that some people had problems getting generic brush heads through sellers, so i made sure my transaction (deep pore two pack) was distributed by amazon and had no prolems.</li>
    <li> My Clarisonic arrived with the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush and even though I felt like it did a great job on my skin, I wanted something a little more powerful. I was a little worried that these brushes (deep pore) might be *too* rough (abrasive, Buf-Puf esque) and not for regular, everyday cleaning, but they are perfect for my skin. They are still super soft, but do a great job of getting all the super-strong sunblock I use every day off my face. They leave my skin glowing and squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> Ok, I received this product as broken condition, is brush is very hard to install. And I&#x27;m 100% sure these are not the real one! And it feels terrible!</li>
    <li> Purchased and received these brushes in the mail yesterday. I opted for the deep pore brushes because the sensitive brush that came with my Mia was at the end of its life cycle. I clicked on one of the new brushes and used it this morning. It&#x27;s softer than my end-of-life sensitive brush!! What&#x27;s the deal with that? Someone posted about how it works on the skin in a different way. Maybe, but I was hoping for a skin-peeling experience. Instead, I have to re-install my old brush to really feel like I&#x27;m getting the right level of scrub. #fail</li>
    <li> This is better than the normal brush. I feel like my skin is cleaner using ht deep pore cleansing brush head.</li>
    <li> These brush heads arrived at the same time as my brush, timely and exactly as described.  They are great for clearing up blackheads.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> sensitive brushes are the way to go. not as harsh on my face!&lt;br /&gt;came in simple packaging and fit my clarisonic!!</li>
    <li> the clarisonic has been amazing for my skin and this brush is the best one I have gotten it is more abrasive than the rest of the line but great for me.</li>
    <li> The product came exactly as advertised, two clarisonic acne heads. I went from the sensitive head that was included with my original purchase to these with no issues. Still able to use every day. In fact, I am not very in tune to the differences in the heads.</li>
    <li> My skin looks younger after using this brush. It really cleans deeply and tenderly. I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> These Clarisonic heads are great!  I used the sensitive heads in the past and they were good too.  I&#x27;m 55 and these just seem to work a little better for me.</li>
    <li> I used this brush head for a week. It didn&#x27;t clean my skin and left residual makeup behind. I also got a bad acne reaction. The bristles are too soft to clean deeply and the brush never dries, causing bacteria to grow. I have a feeling they are used, off brand brushes. Gross.</li>
    <li> Could get these anywhere at the price offered which must be controlled by Clarisonic,but made good filler for free shipping.</li>
    <li> this brush head works well but i really cant tell that much of a difference from the standard brush that comes with the clarisonic.  it definitely wasnt too harsh for my skin which is what i was afraid of</li>
    <li> I use the acne heads for my 56 year old skin that still has lots of pores.  Really cleans them out.  Very few whiteheads or blackheads</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Clarisonic and buying new brush heads is a not unpleasant necessity. These deep pore brushes do exactly what they say, the give your pores a wonderful deep cleaning. If you try it you&#x27;ll never look back!</li>
    <li> After reading the negative reviews I was hesitant but my order came from b-glowing and it came on time and works perfectly. I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant after reading all the reviews about counterfeit product received; however, my shipment was fully genuine.  These do the trick, but I honestly don&#x27;t notice a difference between these and the regular heads.</li>
    <li> I switched from the generic head I had on my Clarisonic when I bought it and moved to this head. It gives me a good clean and didn&#x27;t upset my face upon switching. Some of the bristles have come loose (maybe 5 or so), and that is my only complaint. Loved that I could get the 2 pack - including shipping they came out to $17 each!</li>
    <li> Love my clarisonic!  Didn&#x27;t realize how bad my brush was until I got a new one!  3 months max on a new one.</li>
    <li> I felt the difference when I switched the brushes.  The only thing is when I searched for MIA2 brush it bought up a ton of brushes and it doesn&#x27;t really describe if the product is for the first generation or 2nd generation Clarisonic.  I&#x27;m not really sure if they are interchangeable; but it should say so in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one I purchased was for my Clarisonic MIA2</li>
    <li> These are not authentic brush heads. I ordered them from the seller &#x27;fast vibes &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived in a plastic sleeve not a clarisonic box. Upon opening they look very real the plastic cover the bristles look right. It is when you touch it that you realize something&#x27;s off. They&#x27;re very soft and cheap. After one use the bristles started to fray. Anyone who&#x27;s used the real brush heads knows this doesn&#x27;t happen on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;It does not clean your face like it should&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge waste of money. I had to file a claim and get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the deep pore brushes, when they&#x27;re real, are fantastic. Your skin might purge again because its cleaning deeper than the normal or sensitive bridge head but its totally worth it. I would recommend purchasing these from a well known retailer like Ulta</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Clarisonic! Does great thing for my face. I&#x27;m 54 and my skin looks better then it did at 40, really!</li>
    <li> I ordered this twin pack and received it to find that one of the head is broken and can&#x27;t be used. I only opened up this package recently and its already past the return window. Disappointing buy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be without this appliance. Keeps face super clean. I look years younger than my peers from only using this the last 4 years. Less wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Great! These work better than the generic versions. This two pack is the best deal I could find.</li>
    <li> I have been needing this replacement for months and just didn&#x27;t want to spend the money.  The price was great here and this is the perfect replacement for my Clarisonic mia.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews where people got inferior scrubs. I was worried.  When I checked out I saw it was fulfilled by Amazon.  Good thing too!  They are the real deal packed in Clarisonic packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic if the first system I&#x27;ve used that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for the amazing price!</li>
    <li> I use this every time I take a shower. It has made a huge improvement in my skin. I am 58, not a teen, so please know this is not just for the kids!</li>
    <li> After seeing all of the upset reviews about receiving \\&quot;fake\\&quot;/faulty products from third-party sellers, I was a little hesitant to buy brush heads off of Amazon.  However, I figured I&#x27;d take a risk and purchase from Amazon.com (not a 3rd party!) because I figured they wouldn&#x27;t sell a fake product, right?  Right!  Just received my twin pack of authentic deep pore brushes for under $30 - steal!  Sure, it might cost you $10 more if you buy from Amazon vs. some other seller, but you&#x27;ll still be saving a lot of money (plus, you&#x27;ll be getting the real deal).  Never again will I buy brush heads from anywhere else!</li>
    <li> Elsewhere you have to pay $40 - $50 for 2 replacement brush heads. They are Clarisonic brand and come in the packaging you would expect.</li>
    <li> These brush heads were the real ones, not the 3rd party ones some people get. There&#x27;s not much to say about them, they work great and if you want the real ones and not the generic ones get them here.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this brush head keeps my skin clear so much better than the basic brush head that comes with the Mia.</li>
