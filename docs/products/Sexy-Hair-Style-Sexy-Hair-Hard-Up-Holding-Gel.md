    <li> I have a lot of thick, wavy hair that grows forward.  My preferred hair style is straight back - see the problem?  This stuff holds it well; better, in fact, than any I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Several folks commented on how &#x27;crunchy&#x27; it is, but use a little blow-dryer action to get mine dry, which alleviates the &#x27;crunch&#x27; factor.  It still stays set all day long (even though I stick my glasses on top of my head; run my fingers through my hair, etc.)  I&#x27;ll keep using this.  I just wish I&#x27;d seen the pump dispenser before I bought the squeeze bottle, but no big deal.</li>
    <li> Better Than Hicks, Dr Miracles, Mizani and all those commercial brands. Sweat, Edges will still be sleek + Fleek. Need to brush or comb to un-flatten</li>
    <li> I have frizzy type of hair and this product helps it hold a shape.  You only need a little drop to be effective.</li>
    <li> Nothing like this for hold and the &amp;#34;no dandruff&amp;#34; look!</li>
    <li> Great product and really holds your hair in place.</li>
    <li> A salon item at a very good price. Quick delivery as well. Thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product, my hair never moved. Did what if was supposed to.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price</li>
    <li> Best hair products ever.</li>
    <li> It is unusual to find a product that really works as advertised. This one does!</li>
    <li> Love it it&#x27;s amazing gel ur hair shines</li>
    <li> Works well on my short fine hair. Make sure to distribute it or you will not be able to get a comb or brush through!</li>
    <li> I am using this product for a different kind of use......for my show dog&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s working just like I expected. Great!</li>
    <li> I WANT A REFUND NOW THIS STUFF SUCKS!!!</li>
    <li> Just buy the 16.9 oz pump action one.</li>
    <li> Used it on a cosplay wig and it came out great. Since I&#x27;m bald I can&#x27;t really test it on my head so take what I say with a grain of salt. I did notice it left blue streaks in the wig that were a pain to rub all the way in.</li>
    <li> Salons sell this for $14 or more, so this was an awesome find!</li>
    <li> Hair glue. the good news is that you can dilute with water easily if you desire something that wont freeze your hair in place. Great for kids but for short hair only. I get about 5 seconds to do my boys hair before he starts squirming around so this stuff is great. Make sure you wash it out thoroughly. It takes a little scrubbing to get it out if put on full strength.</li>
    <li> this is great, just do not use too. much or your hair gets real hard.</li>
    <li> Very good hold, no flakes</li>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled and is an awesome product...</li>
    <li> Leaves hair too gummy!</li>
    <li> It works and is not flakey but doesn&#x27;t get as hard as the bottle I bought at the salon.</li>
    <li> Great product.  A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use the product for years, its excellent.</li>
    <li> This stuff will keep your hair STIFF!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the non-wet look of cream, but this will keep your hair in place.  No matter what style.</li>
    <li> Great product and would order from here again!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this several times without having any problems. I like my hair short and spikey. Living on the Oregon coast it is always windy. With this holding gel my hair stays spiked until I wash it out. Great stuff. A little dab goes a really long way. A big tube like this lasts me for months using it everyday.</li>
    <li> Great for short hair, leaves hair a little crunchy but that&#x27;s to be expected from extra firm hold gel. I combine with a little &#x27;Frenzy&#x27; matte paste for a bit more flexibility.</li>
    <li> Holds spiked hair very well.</li>
