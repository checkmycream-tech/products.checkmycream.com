      <li>It is also the best design for a trimmer i have ever seen.</li>
      <li>If I could use the shaver with the cord it would be a priceless shaver, but I don&#x27;t suppose they would make a profit this way.  </li>

      <li>It trims his beard and mustache beautifully.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been great to have said good-bye to scissors.</li>
      <li>This beard and mustache trimmer works great for me</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, this product is fairly good for the price!  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>All in all a good buy.</li>
      <li>--that was not so good.</li>
      <li>Better than not but not that good either.  </li>
      <li>The adjustable length setting is a  nice feature.  </li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve loved to be able to put everything (i.e. beard trimmer, charging cord, cleaning brush) away neatly.  </li>
      <li>I honestly think the spring loaded thingie thats supposed to guide it to the shape of your face is in a word--worthless.    </li>
      <li>Nevermind the lack of any kind of edge</li>
      <li>It did a nice job.  </li>
      <li>Nice trimmer</li>
      <li>I really liked the functionality.  </li>
      <li>It would have been nice if there was a carrying case included, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
      <li>Great trimmer with a rather unique feel and design.</li>
      <li>any case, the Norelco T-770 will be most effective when you do these two things: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br</li>
      <li>A nice even shave, though I would prefer more settings in the shorter range.  </li>
      <li>In his review, Reuben gives good tips on the use of this trimmer: take your time when you use it and clean it out after every use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather have a corded version, more flexibility.  </li>
      <li>You get more bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>More problems</li>
      <li>So if like me, you&#x27;re considering this trimmer for more than your beard/mustache, BEWARE.</li>
      <li>The charging indicators help to prevent the NiCad from taking a &#x27;set&#x27; and to keep the unit running in top condition.  </li>
      <li>(surely a precise cut should be a priority for this kind of product).</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s current price, this is a great deal for a good trimmer.</li>
      <li>The more that&#x27;s in there,</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, what happened to being able to use it while plugged into the wall.  </li>
      <li>The Norelco is much better all around.</li>
      <li>It has much more precision than the T860.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many times i can charge the battery.</li>
      <li>With the T-860, i was able to use it even when i was charging.</li>
      <li>The Norelco works better for the most part.  </li>
      <li>For most people, though, I guess putting everything in a drawer will be just fine.  </li>
      <li>Makre sure to clean out the hair collection chamber after each use to achieve the beard trimmer&#x27;s maximum suction power.  </li>
      <li>The shaver works fine.  </li>
      <li>It still works just fine</li>
      <li>In addition to the trimmer, the mustache and sideburn clipper gives a precise and neat edge; to use it, just remove the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>More comfortable to use, better designed, quieter, and much neater.</li>
      <li>(I use one to regularly clean it, so I&#x27;d know).</li>
      <li>Always clean the hair deposit after each use if you want the accu vac to work.</li>
      <li>If you clean it, beware of the weeny spring.  </li>
      <li>It claims to suck up all the cut hairs, but my sink is always full of hair.</li>
      <li>Doing so will make the vacuum more effective &amp; powerful.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a hell of a lot more bigger &amp; get the job done more effetively</li>
      <li>When trimming your beard, make sure not to move the trimmer too fast &amp; to make smooth &amp; gentle movements.  </li>
      <li>new T770 looks much much better than the picture shown at amazon.</li>
      <li>The first results in even trimming; the second allows the vacuum to work best.</li>
      <li>from that, this is a great little trimmer.</li>
      <li>have the T770 model depicted above, so I&#x27;ve been a happy user for nearly two years.</li>
      <li>The vac is powerful, but it&#x27;s not THAT powerful.</li>
      <li>I think I got my money&#x27;s worth with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>I was OK with the amount of hair the vac collected, never expected it to get it all anyway.  </li>
      <li>I can get a very very close shave on \\&quot;level 1\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>Trimmer worked pretty well for quite a while.</li>
      <li>in the grand scheme of things, those two things aren&#x27;t that big of a deal.  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;Be sure to follow the simple instructions if you pop off the blades for cleaning.</li>
      <li>Plastic parts flew everywhere the first time I tried this.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Taking the T770 apart to clean the blades is easy; getting it back together properly requires careful assembly in good lighting and some patience.</li>
      <li>It worked pretty good except when cutting your hair, rather than trimming a beard/moustache, you have alot more hair to vac.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s going to be a mighty long time before I waste good money on a product by this company</li>
      <li>two simple steps will greatly reduce the mess you&#x27;ll have to deal with.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a great little shaver.</li>
      <li>But when you think about it, beard trimming is something that (unlike shaving) you&#x27;ll only do every couple of days, so I don&#x27;t really get why that&#x27;d be important.  </li>
      <li>Charges fast and you can use it while it is plugged in.</li>
      <li>However, this thing really disappoints in the vacuuming function.  </li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>expect much in the way of vacuuming from this product.</li>
      <li>in my case I had a much shorter buzz than I intended.  </li>
      <li>If this piece of plastic comes out of the track then it requires special tools and/or knowledge to get it back in.  </li>
      <li>and the unit began buzzing and vibrating too much and seemed more and more unwieldy and scary to use</li>
      <li>I bought it strictly for trimming my neck, of course without the comb, and for that, its barely passable in getting all of the hair, but it pretty much vacuums all of what it does get.  </li>
      <li>So if you want an AccuVac beard trimmer from Norelco without having to pay a high price, I&#x27;d get the Norelco T-770.  </li>
      <li>In order to clean under the blades you have to pull off the top blades, it pops off and slips out of your fingers and the way it&#x27;s on there, to take it off, you are squeezing on the part that holds it on, but once it&#x27;s off, there&#x27;s nothing behind those parts</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that loud, the blades cut very well, the locking comb settings stay in place, and the charge lasts forever.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t help but laugh when I remember all those reviews I saw here about the Norelco T-770 Accu-Vac Beard Trimmer from people that whined &amp; bitched about how the vacuum wouldn&#x27;t get it all.  </li>
      <li>Norelco obviously wants us to buy a new shaver and throw out the old one, even though it still works.</li>
      <li>I am 57, a red head gone white with lots of fine hair.</li>
      <li>The vacuum works well and the comb sets my beard at the right length.  </li>
      <li>I replace my old no frills Norelco with this new vacuum trimmer, and it works pretty much as advertised.  </li>
      <li>The model that&#x27;s above the one I purchased (the T-870) actually takes an extra hour more to charge up (11 hours).  </li>
      <li>I bought it yesterday at Wal*Mart, charged it last night, and today while trying to adjust the trimming height (before using it for the first time)</li>
      <li>Was able to keep it going by dumping oil intended for the blades down the shaft--that seemed to help but not enough  </li>
      <li>The cutting height adjustment mechanism on the T765 is more robustly designed and looks like it would not be susceptible to being easily removed or dislodged.</li>
      <li>A few stray whiskers may end up in the sink, but a good 90% of the mess is in the collection tray where they belong.  </li>
      <li>What happened to the old way of being hinged and just flipping up?   </li>
      <li>A bit noisier than my old Norelco trimmer.</li>
      <li>For facial hair, I imagine it would work very well.</li>
      <li>and  I wake up the whole entire neighborhood.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what kind of facial hair the men have who claim a 90% vacuum rate.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this to replace a Wahl vac trimmer.  The Norelco works better for the most part.  The vacuum works well and the comb sets my beard at the right length.  The charging indicators help to prevent the NiCad from taking a &#x27;set&#x27; and to keep the unit running in top condition.  All in all a very pleasant piece of work.</li>
    <li> ...doesn&#x27;t he? (How else does he maintain such an even, three-day growth for months at a time?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the T770 model depicted above, so I&#x27;ve been a happy user for nearly two years. In his review, Reuben gives good tips on the use of this trimmer: take your time when you use it and clean it out after every use. The first results in even trimming; the second allows the vacuum to work best. Yes, a few hairs will show up in the sink, but with one swipe with a damp tissue they&#x27;re gone. The adjustable comb trims beard, mustache, goatee, etc., to any length a user might want. In addition to the trimmer, the mustache and sideburn clipper gives a precise and neat edge; to use it, just remove the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the T770 apart to clean the blades is easy; getting it back together properly requires careful assembly in good lighting and some patience. I wish Norelco would simplify the re-assembly mechanisms and process. But even that, since I have now mastered it, does not truly lessen my liking of this product. Nor does its charging time; the T770 holds its charge for around two months (and I use the trimmer 2-3 times a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I drop and break this trimmer, as I did with a previously owned Remington, I will replace it with another Norelco. It&#x27;s been great to have said good-bye to scissors.</li>
    <li> Very little mess with the vacuum function. A bit noisier than my old Norelco trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for some time now.  The most disturbing thing about it was that you never know when the charge will die and then you are stuck because you CAN NOT use it while it is plugged in and charging.  Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the T980 with the turbo shave.  Charges fast and you can use it while it is plugged in. Plus with the 770 holding a charge has always been a problem.  Get the T980.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for over 5 years and the charges lasted for an extremely length of time until just this month.  Now the charge won&#x27;t last through 2 shaves, before charging is required.  If I could use the shaver with the cord it would be a priceless shaver, but I don&#x27;t suppose they would make a profit this way.  Overall it is a great little shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these to keep my hair trimmed to a buzz cut, thinking to eliminate those pesky trips to the barbershop.  It worked pretty good except when cutting your hair, rather than trimming a beard/moustache, you have alot more hair to vac.  And this trimmer actually handled that quite well the first couple of times, until I cleaned the unit and almost lost the little spring that allows the vac window to slide up and down for cleaning.  I did manage to bend the little spring which is very small and quite delicate and now the trimmer vac system works much less efficiently.  If you clean it, beware of the weeny spring.  Use tweezers when removing the spring and putting it back and too if you do take the spring out, place it someplace where it can&#x27;t fall or get knocked off.  The other item that proved to be a challenge on this trimmer is the adjustable head lock.  While cutting my hair the last 2 times the lock slips from a higher setting down to a lower setting and in my case I had a much shorter buzz than I intended.  I&#x27;m keeping this one for my mustache, but intend to purchase something else for my buzz cuts.  So if like me, you&#x27;re considering this trimmer for more than your beard/mustache, BEWARE.</li>
    <li> I really liked the functionality.  It did a nice job.  But the Accu-Vac came apart after a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t help but laugh when I remember all those reviews I saw here about the Norelco T-770 Accu-Vac Beard Trimmer from people that whined &amp; bitched about how the vacuum wouldn&#x27;t get it all.  Compared to the previous model I had from them (a Norelco T-860), the difference is extremely noticible.  Hell, it was like the difference between night &amp; day!!  There was barely ANY leftover hair at all after I was done!!  I seriously have to wonder if those people were even using this product the correct way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In any case, the Norelco T-770 will be most effective when you do these two things: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) When trimming your beard, make sure not to move the trimmer too fast &amp; to make smooth &amp; gentle movements.  Doing so will make the vacuum more effective &amp; powerful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) Makre sure to clean out the hair collection chamber after each use to achieve the beard trimmer&#x27;s maximum suction power.  The more that&#x27;s in there, the less suction power you&#x27;ll have, and the greater the mess you&#x27;ll have. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These two simple steps will greatly reduce the mess you&#x27;ll have to deal with. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The look and the color scheme of the Norelco T-770 has been upgraded. The hair collection chanber is totally clear now, and the color scheme is now totally black with white lettering.  It looks a hell of a lot cooler than the one depicted in the photo that Amazon.com displays.  Also, being that there&#x27;s a built-in vacuum, the plug has increased a little in weight.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like, though, how Norelco chose to not include a canvas traveling case with the T-770 model.  I would&#x27;ve loved to be able to put everything (i.e. beard trimmer, charging cord, cleaning brush) away neatly.  For most people, though, I guess putting everything in a drawer will be just fine.  I also didn&#x27;t like discovering that (like with my previous Norelco trimmer) that the same small &amp; puny-looking cleaning brush I had before ended up being included with this model.  In short, it&#x27;s too short to get the job done.  Norelco seriously needs to put out a cleaning brush that looks more like the ones that Braun puts out.  They&#x27;re a hell of a lot more bigger &amp; get the job done more effetively (I use one to regularly clean it, so I&#x27;d know). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But in the grand scheme of things, those two things aren&#x27;t that big of a deal.  I think I got my money&#x27;s worth with this purchase.  Including this model, Norelco puts out three different versions of their AccuVac beard trimmer.  The model that&#x27;s above the one I purchased (the T-870) actually takes an extra hour more to charge up (11 hours).  There is one model above that, though (the T-970) that charges up in less than an hour.  But when you think about it, beard trimming is something that (unlike shaving) you&#x27;ll only do every couple of days, so I don&#x27;t really get why that&#x27;d be important.  Especially since Norelco charges almost double the price for it.  So if you want an AccuVac beard trimmer from Norelco without having to pay a high price, I&#x27;d get the Norelco T-770.  You get more bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Not much more to say. Nice trimmer but. The battery loses it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge after a year or so. Norelco provides no solution. In case you&#x27;re saying to yourself \\&quot;I&#x27;ll use it plugged in.\\&quot; Think again. It does not work at all when it&#x27;s plugged into a outlet. That&#x27;s only for charging as long as the battery lasts.</li>
    <li> This beard and mustache trimmer works great for me, i have a mustache and goatie and trims perfectly. I even use it to trimm my hair chest and underarm. Always clean the hair deposit after each use if you want the accu vac to work. The only thing i dont like is the time that takes to recharge, but anyway is an A+ trimmer.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, this product is fairly good for the price!  I bought it strictly for trimming my neck, of course without the comb, and for that, its barely passable in getting all of the hair, but it pretty much vacuums all of what it does get.  For facial hair, I imagine it would work very well.</li>
    <li> My brief experience with the T770 was similar to Mr. Ginsberg&#x27;s. I bought it yesterday at Wal*Mart, charged it last night, and today while trying to adjust the trimming height (before using it for the first time) it came apart and I cannot get it back together. The problem is with the mechanism that raises and lowers the cutting head to adjust the cutting height. A small narrow strip of plastic slides up and down in a track to adjust the cutting height when the adjustment ring is turned. If this piece of plastic comes out of the track then it requires special tools and/or knowledge to get it back in.  &lt;br /&gt;I bought the T770 to replace a T765 for which I had lost the charger. The cutting height adjustment mechanism on the T765 is more robustly designed and looks like it would not be susceptible to being easily removed or dislodged. &lt;br /&gt;Norelco took a step backward when they replaced the T765 with the T770. &lt;br /&gt;It looks like ordering a replacement charger for my T765 will be worth the trouble after all.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product but they should improve the noise it makes. I have to use it every day morning and  I wake up the whole entire neighborhood.</li>
    <li> While this trimmer trims fine and collects most of the the hair, the design is bad.  In order to clean under the blades you have to pull off the top blades, it pops off and slips out of your fingers and the way it&#x27;s on there, to take it off, you are squeezing on the part that holds it on, but once it&#x27;s off, there&#x27;s nothing behind those parts and you are squeezing too hard and it...mine...has broken after only 2 months.  What happened to the old way of being hinged and just flipping up?   &lt;br /&gt;Additionally, what happened to being able to use it while plugged into the wall.  If the charge dies half way thru your trimming job....too bad.  You have to wait until it&#x27;s charge up to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have never in my life taken the time to write a review of anything, good or bad.  I hope that says something about how much I hate this item.  It is a total piece of [...]  To say that it is difficult to change the attachments is being kind.  The thing falls apart every time you try to change the trimmer head.  Plastic parts flew everywhere the first time I tried this.  I reassemmbled it the first few times but have since been unable to find some of the parts and now everytime I use it, the &#x27;vacuum&#x27; leaves a big hairy mess on the counter and it is nearly impossible to change the length settings.  Can&#x27;t tell you how much I hate this trimmer.</li>
    <li> If you have any type of facial hair, then this is the trimmer for you!</li>
    <li> This is probably the worst product I ever bought in my life, and I am 67 years old.  The apparatus for changing the comb extension broke before I got to use the shaver.  Save your money, this is truly garbage.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer with a rather unique feel and design. I am 57, a red head gone white with lots of fine hair. The vacuum is acceptable if you empty it frequently. The adjustable length setting is a  nice feature.  &lt;br /&gt;Now this thing needs to have some healthy battery power and life, come on now, pitifully weak batteries with a short charge, 14 hour charging time and won&#x27;t work while plugged in the wall. You best plan ahead for a trim. Not at all convenient. I&#x27;d rather have a corded version, more flexibility.  Pssst....Norelco...think Lithium Ion or Nickel Metal Hydride for pity&#x27;s sake.</li>
    <li> The shaver works fine.  A nice even shave, though I would prefer more settings in the shorter range.  However, this thing really disappoints in the vacuuming function.  It claims to suck up all the cut hairs, but my sink is always full of hair. As far as my unit goes, it catches about 1/2 of the hairs, creating a little mess every time I shave.</li>
    <li> First of all, to get the vac to work correctly you have to trim very slowly. The vac is powerful, but it&#x27;s not THAT powerful. If you trim like a speed demon, you&#x27;ll have hair clippings all over your counter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, this is a great little trimmer. It&#x27;s not that loud, the blades cut very well, the locking comb settings stay in place, and the charge lasts forever. I trimmed for 3 weeks on a single charge, and I trim about once every 3 days. It would have been nice if there was a carrying case included, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At Amazon&#x27;s current price, this is a great deal for a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> I replace my old no frills Norelco with this new vacuum trimmer, and it works pretty much as advertised.  Some hair invariably misses the suction and lands in the sink, but no more hair all over the counter.  The guide works preety well, although you do have to go over your beard a number of times to get everything (it could do a little better job combing the hair up for cutting).  All in all a good buy.</li>
    <li> I have had my Norelco T770 trimmer for a bit over three years, and now it will no longer hold a charge. Worse, the NiCad rechargeable battery pack CANNOT be replaced !!! Norelco obviously wants us to buy a new shaver and throw out the old one, even though it still works. This is \\&quot;eco-unfriendly\\&quot; and deliberate waste at it&#x27;s corporate WORST !!! Do yourself and the environment  favor, and buy from a company that has the decency to make a product with replaceable batteries. I will NEVER buy Norelco again !</li>
    <li> Nevermind the noise. Nevermind the lack of any kind of edge (surely a precise cut should be a priority for this kind of product). Never mind the less-than-impressive construction, where you are constantly worried about the thing coming apart in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying thing about this hugely overpriced product is the unreliable motor which cuts out at frequent intervals regardless of the battery charge. It&#x27;s just a cheap, old and tired product that needs bringing into the 21st century. It&#x27;s the sort of product you see advertised on TV with a \\&quot;but wait! There&#x27;s more!\\&quot; add on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe there&#x27;s a knack to getting performance and reliability from this shoddy plastic toy but it&#x27;s going to be a mighty long time before I waste good money on a product by this company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I have 2 other brands, the norelco is much quieter runs smoother and has a vacuum pickup for cuttings. &lt;br /&gt;Excellent &lt;br /&gt;Alden Huff</li>
    <li> Trimmer worked pretty well for quite a while. I was OK with the amount of hair the vac collected, never expected it to get it all anyway.  THe little spring that keeps the vac flap in place (I cant describe it better, sorry) escaped from the head --that was not so good. By some miracle I found it weeks later on the floor and figured out how to get it back in place. Better than not but not that good either.  All along there was never a way to trim up close under your nose with this thing because the head is so darn big. I honestly think the spring loaded thingie thats supposed to guide it to the shape of your face is in a word--worthless.    More problems: Worst was the motor seizing up, this began a few months ago and got worse. Was able to keep it going by dumping oil intended for the blades down the shaft--that seemed to help but not enough  and the unit began buzzing and vibrating too much and seemed more and more unwieldy and scary to use so I have replaced it with a Wahl trimmer. I&#x27;m not saying I would never buy another one of these but I would like to see some sign that they have addressed some of the problems and arent still making the same old thing.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco T860 for over three years. It&#x27;s a great Trimmer, in fact, it&#x27;s the best i have ever had. It still works just fine but i thought i would get a Norelco T770 becasue it was on sale and it has the built in \\&quot;Vaccum\\&quot;.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The new T770 looks much much better than the picture shown at amazon. The new T770 is black. It&#x27;s looks &amp; Works excellent. The Vaccum system is the best. It really works. It is also the best design for a trimmer i have ever seen. It has much more precision than the T860. I can get a very very close shave on \\&quot;level 1\\&quot;.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now the drawbacks.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It cannot be used while it is being charged. With the T-860, i was able to use it even when i was charging. The T-860 battery ran out while ago, it won&#x27;t hold the charge anymore but i can still plug it in and use it. Therefore, when the battery fo the T770 is dead, you can&#x27;t use it anymore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here is the very bad part: Once the battery is dead (won&#x27;t hold charge anymore), you WILL have to DISCARD the T770. The directions clealy says that you will have to dispose the battery and DISCARD the trimmer. I don&#x27;t know how many times i can charge the battery. It takes about ten hours to fully charge it and once charged it lasts over a month (i use it about three days a week). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It also has a two year warrenty. If i am not able to charge the battery in within this two years, i am calling Norelco &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my father, and he loves it.  It trims his beard and mustache beautifully.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these to replace a Remington vac-trimmer that did not work well at all. The Norelco is much better all around. More comfortable to use, better designed, quieter, and much neater. A few stray whiskers may end up in the sink, but a good 90% of the mess is in the collection tray where they belong.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Be sure to follow the simple instructions if you pop off the blades for cleaning. Otherwise you may accidentally disconnect the comb from the ratchet mechanism.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what kind of facial hair the men have who claim a 90% vacuum rate.  I&#x27;d guess about half of my hair makes it into the vacuum tray.  The only problem is that it&#x27;s no less annoying to clean 50% of my beard hair out of the sink and surrounding areas than it was to clean 100% of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect much in the way of vacuuming from this product.</li>
    <li> Do not buy, unless you want to use it for a very short time.  The battery is built in, cannot be changed, and is not warranteed.  Also, the unit will not run on the charger.  When the battery fails (which will be soon), the unit is worthless.</li>
