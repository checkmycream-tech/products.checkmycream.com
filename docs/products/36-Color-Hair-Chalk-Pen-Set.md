      <li>The colors are dazzling.  </li>
      <li>This is an awesome product that I am so glad I found..  </li>
      <li>we really liked that the color selection was so varied and that there were no colors we didn&#x27;t like!  </li>
      <li>Awesome love it</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did - these colors look AWESOME!</li>
      <li>The colors also weren&#x27;t as bright as they look online.  </li>
      <li>Took about 5 minutes for them to get 10 bright hair streaks.  </li>
      <li>A good conditioning treatment helps.</li>
      <li>Got this set because of the color selection, and good price.</li>
      <li>They used these on her hair for being so good.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a good compromise.  </li>
      <li>My hair dresser tried on me and I loved it, so I bought these.  </li>
      <li>I think they are good for what they are...a novelty.  </li>
      <li>Thought by reading the information that it would be a good choice because of the built in setter....</li>
      <li>My daughter even tried it and the kids at school loved it.</li>
      <li>Good color selection.</li>
      <li>so it colors good but on darker hair</li>
      <li>She loved them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got the goods and in good condition.</li>
      <li>I loved this a lot&lt;br /&gt;alot.</li>
      <li>but might be good for kids.</li>
      <li>But, for $15 I still think it&#x27;s a good value and will probably by another set when we&#x27;ve gone through this one.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>She feels like a lady and is very cute.</li>
      <li>I do feel as though the recipient will be very pleased regardless.</li>
      <li>These were great for my grand kids</li>
      <li>Use the pinks mostly they come out very nice.</li>
      <li>This was a great variety of colors... a good cheap alternative if you have kids wanting to draw on the sidewalk.</li>
      <li>Oh and my friends love these chalks too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this would work amazing!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the full palate, but hair chalks are hard to work with and make your hair stiff. This isn&#x27;t sustainable: good for parties, but no good if you want to be having color in you hair often. It also pulled the color out of my dyed hair (Brights&#x27; lavender at the time).</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous however the heat applied must require flat iron because blow dry heat would not set it on my curly hair</li>
    <li> NOTICE: You MUST go over dark hair with white chalk first! I have black hair and I was confused when it didn&#x27;t show up but then I did white first and it showed.</li>
    <li> These are TINY (barely an inch long, and pretty thin) and must be wetted pretty thoroughly and with hot water before they start marking on the hair.  It colors your hair forever (until you wash it out), which is GREAT, but I feel like I&#x27;m wasting most of the chalk on my wet fingers as I try to rub this tiny stick of stuff onto my hair...</li>
    <li> These do not wash out easily - three washes on my toddler was too many for her to enjoy her Halloween dress up adventure...</li>
    <li> I try to use this chalk an it does not color my hair. I went over my hair multiple times to get the color to adhere and it did not happen, I even try it on other people, no success!! this product does not work and I can&#x27;t get a refund.</li>
    <li> I love the hair chalk. My hair dresser tried on me and I loved it, so I bought these.  They work so well.  My daughter even tried it and the kids at school loved it. stayed in for 2-3 days...then washed right out...it was great!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my grand daughter.  We compared to other sets of colors and this one had the best review.  We did not feel it was hard to use or messy.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my niece who is 13, though it says it should set in 60 seconds, it still gets on everything it touches. And it makes your hair weird (only word that can describe it) and it&#x27;s hard to wash out.</li>
    <li> Messy!!!!!!  Be prepared.  They work, but they get everywhere with younger kids.</li>
    <li> Was not described as this small! Waste of my money! If I knew it was going to be this small I would have never bought it .</li>
    <li> While I am happy with the colors and how easy they are to apply, not all the colors are easily shampooed out. Even after 3 shampoo&#x27;s, the red is still a very noticeable pink. I tested a few colors on my hair and they all came out easily, so my 4 year old granddaughter wasvery excited when we colored her hair before going to a baseball game yesterday. I tried to wash out the color and even after 3 shampoo&#x27;s today, I sent her home with pink hair. (Sorry mom!)</li>
    <li> I ADORE Gypsy Sticks.  The colors are dazzling.  My Poodle Lewis went totally Red White and Blue for the 4th of July.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two little dark-haired friends of mine (ages 8 and 10)  looked rather fetching&lt;br /&gt;with dark royal blue streaks.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the Gypsy! Not only is it super messy and difficult to color hair with, it does NOT last 3 days. It bleeds everywhere. If you&#x27;re going to use it, make sure you put your hair into a french braid or something. You&#x27;re better off buying Hot Hues, which is what prompted me to look into hair chalk. We had to rub and rub and rub and rub our baby fine hair till the color went on. (Yes, we removed the outer coating first.) Pretty colors, pain in the keester.</li>
    <li> Item priced very well. Arrived as promises bought for a 14 year old for her birthday. Great alternative to actual hair dye. Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Well its my first time using chalk..it cam packaged great...clean and brand new, but the product itself sucks. Super messy and it def. doesn&#x27;t set in 90 seconds..it gets every where all day. on my face, clothes...hands Doesn&#x27;t last all day either, im super sad.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. These do not work on dark hair - or at least they did not work on mine.</li>
    <li> These worked well enough for us. Of course some colors worked out better then others and you&#x27;re unlikely to get the bright colors that are pictured on the box but they did work well enough to give my daughter some temporary colors for her WyldStyle hair do (a la the Lego Movie) for Halloween.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let your little sister use this on your white dog... it&#x27;s really hard to get out and rubs off everywhere...</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t apply on hair unless wet.</li>
    <li> Comes off on clothing and all over hands of course, niece has black hair and it worked great! Just don&#x27;t like the run off.</li>
    <li> Was harder to apply than I thought but was pretty.</li>
    <li> They work really well!  For those with dark hair, you have to wet your hair first or else it won&#x27;t stick.  The chalks are petty small, so it seems like I could streak my entire head of medium length hair with a single color about 3 times before it runs out.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> I wanted something that I could color the kids hair with that would not harm there hair. The kids loved it, I just wish the pieces were a little bigger.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like the way it flaked off all the time.</li>
    <li> Not great. Takes forever to build color enough that you can see it and my daughter has blond hair. Though once you get it on it does stay. It didn&#x27;t even come out when washed.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even get any of these to work on anyone&#x27;s hair. I had to use them on paper just to see if the color was actually able to be transferred to anything else. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my niece and nephew. My niece loved all the colors and my nephew is into black so he was all over the black chalk. I tried the product in my hair first because I have heard stories about other products not washing out especially in blonde hair. Within three days it was gone and if you washed your hair two times a day it would of been gone sooner. Awesome product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These work great on black hair.  So far, I have tried the dark blue and red colors without using white as a base color.  They work best when you dip the stick in water, then rub on.</li>
    <li> not good quality, and hardly shows up in the hair and does not stay in well. makes your hair feel horrible too</li>
    <li> The colors were nice but the chalk pieces are tiny they don&#x27;t work well on dark hair they make your hair dry and break off I use them to draw with now</li>
    <li> I received these all broken and the color was spread all over the other colors.I tried using them anyway and they don&#x27;t stick to hair at all!</li>
    <li> All these nice pretty colors and NONE of them work on your hair, truly disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that even with my dark hair, that I don&#x27;t need to use the white base to keep the colors bright.  If I put it on when the hair is wet the color will stay even if I brush it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it makes the hair hard to brush, and after you brush it it isn&#x27;t noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a huge mess, and can sometimes stain your skin if you don&#x27;t wear gloves.  It pulls at the hair when you put iton , but looks really cool when blended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Colors didn&#x27;t look as bold on my daughter&#x27;s blond highlights as I expected from the pictures shown. My daughters still love them though.</li>
    <li> This product barely shows on my hair, even when the directions are followed closely. I tried using extra coats, but barely any color was deposited on my hair. The colors are NOTHING like the vibrant colors on the box. I will be giving these to my kid to use for coloring, so not a total waste, but they don&#x27;t work on my straight, thin hair.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use, not a mess (I don&#x27;t know WHAT these people are talking about), and fun.  They don&#x27;t; however, seem to do it for me. I want something more vivid, but as accessible and user friendly. Maybe bigger sticks? I don&#x27;t know. It doesn&#x27;t stay like I need it to and seems to be faded away after just a little while, sometimes in under an hour. :( Thought I&#x27;d found &amp;#34;it,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> My daughter is loving these hair chalks!! Her and her friends have been having a blast with them since Christmas!  The best part is that they show up on her dark brown hair, most things we&#x27;ve tried have not.</li>
    <li> The seller is amazing shipped to me on time, quick fast. nothing broken and in excellent shape. But one problem the product is kind of dull on light brown hair. I tried all the colors and the only one (The Black) Showed up in my hair, so sadly its kind of useless. although if you have blond hair I&#x27;m sure this would work amazing!</li>
    <li> There was no packaging, or directions or any guidance about how to use.  It came in a plain white package, literally 4 weeks after I ordered it.  All in all, extremely disappointing.</li>
    <li> The chalk needs to be thicker, breaks easily, and hard to put in. Really not worth the money you pay for it,</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for these for her birthday. The work pretty good. Whatever you do dont put them on your hair and then wear light clothes they tend to run a bit.</li>
    <li> The chalks are super tiny! Picture looks deceiving. On the bright side, colors are pretty and show up well. Just wish I had more to work with.</li>
    <li> these are not as easy to use as I thought they work but are amore little difficult to use. I</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst product I&#x27;ve ever gotten through Amazon.com.  This came with no directions in a white cardboard box.  The box is nothing like that in the amazon ad for it.  The chalk looks like school board chalk.  Without the directions, how are you supposed to use these?  I originally bought these for my 16 year old niece.  Since it took approximately two months to get here, and did  not arrive in the predicted time, I had to get her another gift.  I&#x27;m glad now that I didn&#x27;t get them.  They are nothing but trash, and I&#x27;d be afraid to allow her to use them.</li>
    <li> Took this to an annual girls weekend and used it . Fun colors and washed out right away!!! Everyone had fun with them</li>
    <li> It works just as noted. I also used it on my puppy dog. She feels like a lady and is very cute.</li>
    <li> I have 14 year old twin girls.  They have really enjoyed playing around with these chalks.  They work well and are fun to experiment with,</li>
    <li> It shows up on my hair because it&#x27;s blonde, but it rubs off after a couple hours. I wish it would show up on darker hair.</li>
    <li> These were great for my grand kids oh and the dog!&lt;br /&gt;Grand kids chalk the yorkie she had pink hair and looked so cute.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry it wash right out.&lt;br /&gt;Before you us them you have to rub the chalk couple time back and fourth on something hard. ,I think it&#x27;s coated with something,but works great after you do this!&lt;br /&gt;Only 4stars instead of 5 only because had to rub them.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter and we are having fun using it at work!  Have to scrub it on a bit harder on hair than I imagined.</li>
    <li> My niece and I (Katie)  got these in hopes they would work better than the kids kit we had gotten locally. No such luck! The color stays in our hair MAYBE 2 hours and then disappears. We were very disappointed.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these chalks!</li>
    <li> When they say semi-permanent they mean it.  When they say lasts up to 3 days, it lasts much longer.  As a matter of fact it&#x27;s VERY difficult to wash out.  Don&#x27;t know what to do to get this green out of the hair.  Nothing seems to be working.  Stay away from this stuff unless you know the trick to getting it out of your hair.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to apply and the color did not last long. Would most likely not buy again - shipping process was excellent - just not thrilled with the product.</li>
    <li> not great for dark hair</li>
    <li> So when I got the colors right away I put them on (my hair was dry) the only color that came out was red my hair is dark at the roots and gets lighter towereds the end. Later that night after I took a shower I tried again it came out pretty good but it was really really messy all over my face and hands and bathroom.the next morning when I woke up I brushed my hair and a lot of chalk came out into my face. The color was not bright and it looked stiff.</li>
    <li> If going to an event and you need the right hair color/streaks, just do the temporary dye or buy a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chalk was smaller than I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Followed instructions, but the color did not pop in my dark hair, and&lt;br /&gt; The color easily washed/faded away upon my clothes...especially if the environment is hot and sweat....because it lasted only a few hours...not &amp;#34;lasts up to 3 days&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just what I expected...but might be good for kids.</li>
    <li> Seemed like a bit of rough rubbing to get any color to show on my dark hair, and then it didn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ll give away to a granddaughter with lighter hair. Otherwise, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> My nieces&#x27; were wanting to color their hair. This was a great way for them to express themselves and change their color any way they wanted. The colors really do work much better on wet hair as the other reviews have said. Its a lot of fun to mix the colors up and see how many fun ways you can play with them.</li>
    <li> We got these as a gift for our daughter and they are awesome.  Very simple to use and great, vibrant colors.  I love the variety of colors and they come in a nice little package.</li>
    <li> Books are well written full of gd info for teen girls.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this product. My niece had been wanting Hot Huez and i told her this product costed a little more but had more colors and was suppose to last longer. After breaking the chalk and trying to get it to even show up in her hair it did not last. The chalk was broken and the result was horrible.</li>
    <li> This arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it to put on my sister&#x27;s braids for my country&#x27;s Carnival in the Caribbean.&lt;br /&gt;Three things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - I received it without any damage&lt;br /&gt;2 - I wish the chalks were bigger it would be easier to hold&lt;br /&gt;3 - I have been trying it out on a synthetic wig that is about a color 2 with a little golden blonde highlights, at first I was not that impressed with the color payoff on the darker hair...but then I dampened the hair and used a HARD SURFACE as recommended  and MAJOR DIFFERENCE!!...this method worked much better on a darker hair...now,it&#x27;s vibrant enough and eye catching - beautiful...I will put up a photo of the wig results. But lighter hair colors as usual should have no problem!</li>
    <li> Great fun way to &#x27;dye&#x27; hair bits. Such a fun rage of colors, great for the price and 10xs cheaper than actually dying hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used hair chalk. I bought a package for my 13 year old niece and one for myself. I was really excited to try it out because the colors are so vibrant in the box.The instructions say that the color will not rub off onto your clothing etc. After trying it out, I must say that I am very disappointed. I tried putting it in both wet and dry. I then styled my hair with a flat iron followed by hair spray. I have very light blonde hair and the color is not at all vibrant. The chalk dried my hair out very badly and I ended up with a lot of tangles (I expected that with chalk). The color absolutely rubs off onto clothing, bedding, etc. If you plan to wear the chalk, be prepared for it to make a stain on something. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought these and I was seriously disappointed. They didn&#x27;t stay in very long and Heaven forbid if  you had to brush your hair after chalking it. It brushed right out! Hard Pastel Chalk sticks from the local Art store last much longer, are brighter, you can get more colours, and won&#x27;t brush out. Plus you can buy 32 stick that are 3 times the size of these for $5 while this cost three times that. I would NEVER recommend these to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Nature Witch &amp; am not at all impressed with chemicals.  Because of this product my girls no longer want to color their hair.  They (&amp; I) the the flexibility of it.  One day red and the next rainbow!  Awesome product and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Tried it several times but doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to people with dark hair</li>
    <li> Did not work like it said. My daughter tried everything to make these work. Was going to sed them back- but used them as art chalk instead.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter, 8, loves to wear a streak to match her clothes to school.  I think the product is a fun one.</li>
    <li> My daughter has blonde hair so it works great for her. Did not work at all in her friends dark hair though. She does get her hair wet to put it in.</li>
    <li> Have not tried it yet-will be a Christmas present for my granddaughter. It arrived fast and in good condition-can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
    <li> These arrived to me in a timely manner, and they were all intact. No broken pieces!  They are fun to play around with, the colors are pretty and turn out looking a lot they do on the stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars, but BEWARE BLONDES the Red will dye your hair and it won&#x27;t wash out! Luckily I had read this in another review and tested it only on a small area of my hair.</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied. It didn&#x27;t even work on my hair. I want my money back. ;( 😔😣😡😡😭😭😤😤 wish it did work guess I&#x27;m back where I started with perm hair color.</li>
    <li> Stained my daughters neck and pillows.  Does not &amp;#34;lock in the color in 60 seconds&amp;#34; AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter could not get a brush through her hair after her hair dried with the color (her hair was damp on application, which the directions said you could do).  The color was very nice though.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter who is 14. We tried them on our hair and they worked great. Use the side of them and not the end to color hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a redish blonde and it really showed up well on mine. My daughter has light brown hair and using the lighter colors worked best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We even put it on our standard poodles! My black poodle had to have the light colors on it but my white poodle could use any!</li>
    <li> I have never posted a negative review, in this case, I would have been better off burning a 20 dollar bill.  The product that arrived is not the described product, not the same packaging either. The chalk won&#x27;t even color on paper, completely useless, had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for any party your going to! Love all the color options, you can even mix it up and do multiple colors!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Received as gift by my 10yr old.  Messy, hard to apply.  Chalk gets all over everything - skin, clothes, etc.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I got the product a day earlier than it estimated which was awesome. It was packaged correctly and not damaged. It was a little smaller than expected, they&#x27;re like less than an inch big but there&#x27;s so many colors! I tried it out right when I opened it. Easy to apply (I watched a few videos on how to do it) and not that messy but I still used gloves. I have dark hair and its pretty noticeable. Great product. Will be purchasing again after this one runs out.(:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I used red in my hair first and it washed out with one wash like its supposed too. I used red again and it mostly washed out but there&#x27;s been a little bit in my hair for 3 weeks now and doesn&#x27;t seem to be going away.</li>
    <li> I was excited to have temporary color when the mood struck, and it did tonight! I read most of the reviews but should have paid attention the negatives more. It&#x27;s not really that hard to put on, just make sure you have a wet strand and a small tooth comb. I have very long hair and this became a nightmare after I finished. I used different colors doing thick strands on the bottom and multiple colors around the top and front of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I kept hearing and reading that heat, (hair dryer, iron etc.) would help to set it, I did not anticipate the tangled mess that ensued! I just gave my hair more damage in TWENTY minutes with a comb and brush trying to detangle than twenty years of color treatment. Please note, I did not tease or tousle my hair. I ran the chalk down each strand until I was satisfied with the amount of color. I used detangling spray, liberally which didn&#x27;t help. The only choice I had was to rewash, condition twice, and throw the chalk out. Save your money, unless you have a pixie cut. This was a great variety of colors... a good cheap alternative if you have kids wanting to draw on the sidewalk.</li>
    <li> I have black hair and read the review before purchasing to make sure it would be okay for dark hair....but I am disappointed. These did not come out too nicely and I am in cosmetology school so I have seen a few different kinds and can say this is definitely not my favorite and wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this unless you have light hair</li>
    <li> These hair sticks worked so well! They will stain your clothes if you are not careful though and you may need to spend some extra time looking up techniques to get the color to stick</li>
    <li> Incredibly messy and not that pigmented on golden brown hair. It takes a lot of strokes to achieve any kind of noticeable color. Blending was difficult, the mention to apply it barely worked. Rubbing the chalk stick back and forth works the best but probably damages the hair. So in addition, I&#x27;m not sure how this product is supposed to make a person&#x27;s hair feel, but mine felt dry, powdery, and easily tangled. The seal didn&#x27;t work at all, unfortunately. It mentioned a couple minutes, but no, never sealed or &amp;#34;dried&amp;#34; just made a huge mess of my hair, my hands, and my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Even with daily swimming and showers,the red color lasted about 5 days on my girl with medium-brown colored hair.  The other colors lasted about one day.  My other two girls have darker hair, and the colors were barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> birthday gift for my 12 year old granddaughter, who loved it!  Pretty sure her 9 year old sister was green with envy, so I&#x27;ll probably be buying quite a few of these for birthdays and Christmas.</li>
    <li> It came earlier than I thought and is easy to use. The only thing is that I thought it was going to be a little bigger and its kinda a pain to get the seal off. But I still love it :)</li>
    <li> I read the reviews but this was just too hard to make work on my Daughter&#x27;s dark hair.  Super messy and just not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Colors aren&#x27;t as vivid as picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked better when wet otherwise not the best thing out there</li>
    <li> Difficult to use. Doesn&#x27;t show up on dark hair very well</li>
    <li> Okay so i don&#x27;t know if this is just me but it is damaging my hair and drying out my hair. I cant even brush my hair out. Literary.This product is in my opinion is very bad!</li>
    <li> It wast truly not made for hair. It worked great on paper.  It was a complete disappointment. It did not work on hair!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is Fun and easy to use. My daughter loves it and it stays in her hair for days! Would buy again. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself, and they work well, the color they leave is clear, bright and stays for quite a while.... a little too long of a while actually! Lol, I used the fusia/ purple color and it never really came out, I have light brown/ashy blond hair and I still have light purple in the strands where i applied it....6 weeks after the fact. Other colors washed out right away so no problems there haha.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this if you want to put it in your when it&#x27;s in a pony tail or just up. This hair chalk comes off onto your hands if you touch it and it makes your hair feel very dry and stiff and I don&#x27;t recommend brushing your hair with the product in it. 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this, its great to experiment with and is very bright colored! Works best when wet, will wash out if scrubbed with shampoo very throughly for about three rinses, but if you avoid washing that area it can last easily a couple of days at least. Very easy to apply and comes in a lot of colors. I have a white dog and its fun to dipdye his ears/tail.&lt;br /&gt;It will not show up very well on the dark parts of my hair  (if at all and I have naturally dark brown) but I have bleached areas underneath that are yellowish that work fine. and because your hair is a little &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; (its bleached too so) it tangles easily.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, I wore a white shirt and had bright dark blue in my hair and it rubbed off a little bit onto the shirt by the end of the day. It was only a little noticable.  That&#x27;s pretty much the extent of the rubbing off bit, I&#x27;m sure I can wash the shirt to get it out no problem.</li>
    <li> Hello dear,&lt;br /&gt;I received my order, it is very good like what i want and i like it. I&#x27;ll buy more thing form you in the future.&lt;br /&gt;thank you for help my.&lt;br /&gt;Best regards</li>
    <li> exactly like the title states, no color - even on blonde hair, and it gets all over your clothes, face, hands, everything!</li>
    <li> We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 14 year old granddaughter.  She loves it.  It was a big hit at our Christmas gathering.  I personally didn&#x27;t use.  Was told it washed out easily and completely.</li>
    <li> These definitely are NOT what I expected. Chalks appear brighter and larger in picture. They are actually quite small and dull in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way one stick gets 100 uses. I used one stick on 3 small pieces of hair and about a third of the stick is gone already.&lt;br /&gt;They are VERY messy and stain everything (hands, face, etc..) They DO NOT seal...the color was coming out of my hair all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color does not last very long at all. Within one wash it was all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were a pain to use and VERY messy. Low quality. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Thank you for this product we had a sleep over for my niece and the girls couldn&#x27;t put these down.</li>
    <li> Fun product. Hard to see on darker hair, but had a lot of fun playing with it during summer vacation. Washes out with just plain water.</li>
    <li> Gypsy is a racial slur and I am disgusted to find it attached to a product here on this site.</li>
    <li> These were a lot of fun we had a great time with all the different colors and getting a little crazy with all the different colors and looks we could come up with. Had a blast these are great</li>
    <li> I have medium-to-dark brown hair. I love the idea of hair chalk and have been trying to find some that worked for my dark hair for ages, to no avail. I thought I&#x27;d give it one last try and I am so glad I did - these colors look AWESOME! If you have dark hair just do what everyone says to do: get the strand of hair damp, twist, and rub the chalk up and down along the strand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried their suggestion of using white first and then using a color, and it maybe made it a little brighter, but honestly the colors are great either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it gets on your hands, but it&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t wash it off. If you have it towards the ends, there&#x27;s probably a chance it could get a little on your clothes though sealing it with a flat iron helps prevent that. It&#x27;s chalk dye. Come on. Of course you run a small risk of getting it on your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, great product. I&#x27;d give it five stars but I hate the name of it too much. Come on, dudes. G*psy is a slur. Can we stop using it now?</li>
    <li> I was SO excited about getting gypsy stix but so disappointed. The chalk breaks after one use ad makes such a mess. It also pulled your hair and when you try to wet your hair and put the chalk in after it just tangles your hair and the tangles just won&#x27;t come out. the chalk got all over my pants and shirt and all over the house. I would not reccomend this to any one! Sorry...</li>
    <li> Chalk takes forever to actually get into hair. It seemed like there was more on my fingers than in my daughter s hair. Color only lasts a couple hours then its just gritty and tangled. Shame on me, I should have known.</li>
    <li> Would give 0 stars if I could&lt;br /&gt;What you receive is NOT what you think you ordered.  Bought this for my teenage daughter for a Xmas gift.  What was shipped was an ordinary box of child oil pastels.  The box was covered in cute cartoons and chinese writing.  Took me a second to even see the small english writing stating they were oil pastels.  Nothing like the product desrictoption in any way.  Obviously returning.  Sent a return request, but STILL waiting for reply.</li>
    <li> I just received my package, and we are super excited!! I have two daughters, nine and six years old with super long dark hair. We tried other chalks and it was so disappointing, they just didnt work. But THIS ONES are AMAZING! They are loving it!! Thank you so much, for a great product!  Correne u are the sweeetest! GREAT customer service.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on December 7th for my daughter&#x27;s christmas gift.  The product did not arrive until one month later, just several days ago.  Also, the chalk is in a plain white box with no instructions whatsoever.  Very disappointed.  Now I guess I will have to look up on line how to use the product.</li>
    <li> Love them! Plenty of options, great to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. It does not work at all. The color does not stick to the hair or show no matter how many times or hard you rub the chalk on the hair. Only leaves your hand dirty and clothes messy. I do not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly like the pictures and will show up pretty well on dark hair if wet but it makes your hair very knotty and I mean VERY knotty like You can&#x27;t even get a comb through it. If your looking for something temporary and easy to wash out but don&#x27;t mind the rough knots it leaves then go ahead. Unfortunately I will not be using this product again because of the tangled hair damage.</li>
    <li> These chalks do not work well on dark hair.  I have tried several ways of making it work based on advice on the internet but the color does not transfer to my hair!  I have given up and now feel that my money was wasted.</li>
    <li> made my hair very dry and brittle</li>
    <li> Some of the hair chalks don&#x27;t really work for brunettes like the yellow, light blue, pink, etc. . The colors that actually show up take A LOT of rubbing onto hair. Have to use, like, half of a stick of chalk just to make it look okay. Also smudges on pretty much anything.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter had been begging to get colored striped in her hair for over a year.  I thought this would be a good compromise.  She was very excited, but even in her blonde hair the color was not as vibrant as shown on the box and faded even more within hours not three days like it said, I am sure that different hair types take the color differently.  A stylist friend told us to put a drop of water on it first to get a little more color in the hair, that helped a little.</li>
    <li> The chalks aren&#x27;t nearly as vibrant as pictured. They also don&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s not user error either. I&#x27;ve used hair chalk before and I found these difficult to rub onto hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the chalks are small but work well.  bought them for my 10 year old and she is enjoying them...Shipping took forever..over a month.</li>
    <li> These were a reasonable price and arrived fast. It takes a looong time to transfer the color to your hair and it leaves the hair rather dry and frizzy looking. I&#x27;ll have to spend some more time with them but I give it a steady 3 stars for now. It does transfer and I can&#x27;t really complain for the price. If you want better color, go with a name brand, well known chalk.</li>
    <li> I got these to play with on my kids.  There was a great assortment of colors, although some of them I didn&#x27;t understand why they were included, but that didn&#x27;t bother me too much. They worked really great on my daughter that has very blonde hair, it didn&#x27;t take much to transfer the color, although she complained about it pulling her hair.  It must not have been too bad because she wanted me to do her whole head!  My other daughter has dark brown hair, and it really hardly worked with a lot of effort.  I read a review that said it works well on dark hair, and it really does not. I was sort of expecting that it wouldn&#x27;t, but hoping that it would. Bottom line, if you want to use these on blonde hair, it&#x27;s great and lots of fun, if you want to use on dark hair, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I like the product the colors are great. I have had trouble gettting the pink out of my hair though. I am light blonde and put purple and pink in my hair. The purple came out just fine but some of the pink stayed in my hair it has faded and some but is still not come completely out of my hair it has been about 6 or 7 days and traces of the pink are still in. This is very frustrating because I am in the military and would like to use this product for special events and weekends but if I cant trust it to come out in three days at most I will not be wanting to use it and feels like it is a waste of money. BLONDES BE CAREFUL!</li>
    <li> this stuff is real cool, but very messy and u need alot to make the color show. but it washes out with water just like i ha hoped! perfect for the kids.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about my purchase. I have been thinking of dying my hair blue and wanted to try it out before I took the big step. When I received the hair chalk I was very disappointed it did not work at all I tried many colors and nothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to dye my 3 year old&#x27;s Mohawk... He absolutely loves it!!! It goes in easy and comes out with soap and water!</li>
    <li> I love this chalk set...the color is strong and long lasting on my hair.  I would recommend this hair chalk  to anyone who wants to experiment with temporary color.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elementary age daughters and its been a big hit!  They both have very blonde hair so the bright colors work best for them.  I&#x27;ve found applying it on wet hair to be very messy so we stick to dry applications.  I have them lay their head down on the counter and apply the chalk on top of a piece of paper for easy clean up.  The product does feel like it has a bit of an oil base but we&#x27;ve not had the problems with it that other reviewers reported.  Without a bit of the oil I don&#x27;t think it would stay attached to the hair.  It went in pretty easy, stayed in (didn&#x27;t rub off much on clothes or pillowcases), and was totally gone from their hair by day 3.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the sticks are fairly small and of the 32 colors only about half of them are what my kids want.  Yellows, white, peaches, and browns could pretty much all go right into the trash.  We want more pink, blue, and purple!  But, for $15 I still think it&#x27;s a good value and will probably by another set when we&#x27;ve gone through this one.</li>
    <li> Messy of course but that was expected.  Lay a towel on the ground under you while applying and also wear a t-shirt over the shirt you are wearing.  The color can be brililant at first but honestly it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours.  I bought these for my 5 daughters and they were out of there hair before the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of fun with these.  Applied &#x27;em to damp bleached hair, and had a great time blending colors and fingerpainting with my hair and such.  However... if you&#x27;re going to put &#x27;em on chemically treated hair? watch out for the pinks (and maybe the reds, too).  All the other colors washed out (or faded out with brushing) with no fuss... but my hair was still showing traces of pink THREE WEEKS after I applied it.  If you&#x27;re in a situation where showing up to work or school or whatever with oddly-colored hair might be problematic?  Definitely think twice about this first.</li>
    <li> Couldv&#x27;e bought a box of sidewalk chalk. Not so easy to apply and very messy. Chalk on her fingers,neck,forehead etc. also color doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
    <li> I thought this hair chalk would be very useful rather than having a spray or brush because I wanted highlights in certain areas. I was trying to use the aqua colors for an 80&#x27;s party and since I do a lot of parties and halloween I thought having all the colors would be great. The problem is that this chalk doesn&#x27;t work on hair very well. The color comes off on everything but does not come off onto your hair I had to rub my hair with this chalk until it looked like I was starting a fire and even then the color was dull and not solid.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Makes your hair Hard and nasty!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. doesn&#x27;t stick  to the hair waste of money, don&#x27;t buy this item. I want my money back! S</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for a Christmas gift. The colours do not go onto her hair, which is a shame.</li>
    <li> super cool colors but messy on your hands and all over your shirt or bedding. be sure to wash before you sleep. also residue does tend to end up on your face or forehead, a little embarrassing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice colors and shows up good, but it really damages your hair after rubbing so hard to get it to work. My daughter&#x27;s hair ended up a ratted mess.</li>
    <li> Rubbed off on clothing and didn&#x27;t last as long as it said it would. It wore off in less than a day. Also, made hair very clumpy and if you tried to comb through it color came off.</li>
    <li> Just went to the hair dressers to get my hair dyed with purple streaks. my 5 year old went with me.  They used these on her hair for being so good. She loved them!!! Buying them for her birthday.  They used the lid of the box under her hair so that they could get the chalk on it, and used the chalk on the long side, not the end.  Took about 5 minutes for them to get 10 bright hair streaks.  Now I&#x27;m buying these for her so we can play with the other colors.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped it would. The colored stayed in my hair but really takes some effort to rub it in, tangling my hair in the process.Very hard to see in people with dark hair. I don&#x27;t think I would make a repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old grandaughter and she loved it.  Product was very easy to use, colors were true, a bit messy, but a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> its nice just smaller chalk peices then i exspected but does color well....do wear gloves so your fingers dont get colored</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m black haird so i had to color my hair white first anyway it&#x27;s really amazing the color was so brite but the problem is the color sticks to my Tshirt when i let my hair flow on it. Other wise it&#x27;s really awesome!!</li>
    <li> While the hair chalk does easily change the color of your hair, and this was great for use in both a school play and for Halloween, I’d be very careful using this as the chalk rubs off on everything: your clothes, neckline and other parts of your skin it comes in contact with, headrest of your car, you name it.  It’s a mess, and was hard to get out of clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re looking for something to fun to do and are wearing clothes you don’t mind ruining, go ahead and get this one – otherwise, I would give it a pass.</li>
    <li> The colors are not vibrant like the picture and the pieces are a lot smaller than they appear in the picture.</li>
    <li> It was a great and quick last minute touch up to our costumes, well for our hair! only problem, it gets everywhere when your putting it on,</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use. Only downer no instructions. The chalk easily washed off my hands and clothes.  Nice colors</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it didn&#x27;t show in my hair.  Not intended for hair use, evidently.  I have used hair chalk before and I know how to use it.  These didn&#x27;t work.  The pieces are also really tiny.  They don&#x27;t show up in your hair whatsoever, let alone as is shown on the box.</li>
    <li> Being in a rock band ,we like to color our hair for doing shows. We needed a hair chalk that would look good under the stage lights and would wash out easy. I found this chalk by doing a search on Amazon.  I got this one and gave it a try for one of our shows. and it worked out great. It was easy to put on,and it did look good under the lights. Washing it out was easy to do so we wouldn&#x27;t go to work the next day with our hair colored. Our band gives this 5 stars</li>
    <li> These are great. I have brown hair and was not sure they would show up but they work fantastic!!! Very fun to match what I&#x27;m wearing. I use these everyday. They wash out easy I just take a shower and its out. If I don&#x27;t wash my hair it will stay in for two days. I was concerned it might get on my clothes or pillow when I sleep but it does not. I like all the green shades. Good color selection. Almost every color goes with my clothes and accessories I wear.</li>
    <li> I joust this for myself but the stocks were soooo small. It&#x27;s hard to tell in a photo, or at least this one because there is no background to compare it to or model. But it has great colors. So I gave it to my cousin whose younger than me and she opened it at her birthday party (she&#x27;s around 13).  She loved it!! Her and her friends all made oohs and ahhs. Of course it is probably going to be messy. Don&#x27;t lay on your couch with them and I would recommend using a pillowcase you don&#x27;t mind getting chalk color on.</li>
    <li> Just got this and put it in my daughter hair. Went on easy and the colors are fairly bright on her light brown hair.  I bought this one as it claimed that it sets in 60sec (won&#x27;t rub off onto things). Well it did rub off. She had it in for about an hour before she decided to roll on my tan couch..... Now it has rainbow stripes on it! Very disappointed. Would not recommend for kids as it gets on stuff. The pic shows where it is rubbing of on her dress and her skin is red from the color.</li>
    <li> These were a complete disappoint me only worked on my sons hair not me or my blonde haired femal cousin.</li>
    <li> it is an okay item for this price. I have very fair hair so it colors good but on darker hair it&#x27;s almost invisible. the colors are also not nearly as vibrant as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I would honestly rather invest more money and get better colors.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Ok product</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery and exactly as described, but the colors just weren&#x27;t strong enough to work and last with darker hair.</li>
    <li> At the time of use, I had dirty blonde hair. I wet my hair and did the tips with hot pink. No number of washes would get the pink out of my hair. It was a pain, for something that was only supposed to last a week. Eventually had to cut it short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for just a strand or two, but definitely not for anything more than that. Do not do big chunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, whenever used, it would stain the shoulders/back of my shirts, as well as my pillowcases.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these chalk stricks. was a little disappointed they arent very big but you dint need a lot to go far. I have light blonde hair so the colors are awesome on my hair. For darker hair you wanna remember to use thr white first as a primer than the color will hold better.</li>
    <li> My grandchildren and I had a blast with this  we had a hair dye day mixed them all up, little kids love rainbows, lots of fun&lt;br /&gt;and a great way to pass away an afternoon.</li>
    <li> I got these for my 7 year old daughter and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Yeah, it&#x27;s messy on your hands, but it washes right off and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothing. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought for Halloween, worked well, not sure if I would wear it out on a regular night, it made my hair dry &amp; dull.</li>
    <li> chalk everywhere broken and powdered... complete waste of money... I love hair chalk... the few pieces that were still usable did not add any pigment to my white hair... white hair is easy to chalk with even the lightest of colors... my advice move away from this product  chalk is small and cheap and came destroyed horrible horrible horrible!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am NOT happy with this product at all!! I wasn&#x27;t in any hurry for the product, so the extremely long time it took for me to receive wasn&#x27;t the down side. Absolutely NONE of the colors showed up on my hair. (I have light and dark hair- tried different colors on different parts of my hair) I have a box of pastel chalks for sketching- these look exactly the same! Box packaging and all!! I was excited about the good reviews this product had been given, but I don&#x27;t know if maybe they received a different product, but this is junk!! If it didn&#x27;t cost me more to send it back, I would. I have used the &amp;#34;hot hues&amp;#34; colors from the &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; section at walgreens,  and even the &amp;#34;splat&amp;#34; chalk colors and they work fantastic,  but only offer a limited amount of colors, which is why I was excited for this one...all in all, I am highly dissatisfied and I DO NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my four-year-old and she loves having rainbow hair!  It&#x27;s messy and some colors are harder to use than others, but for the price, I can&#x27;t take a star off.  It&#x27;s a cheap way to get tons of color options.  They&#x27;re great for Halloween or for anytime you want to change up your look without worrying about damaging your hair.</li>
    <li> i dont like them they dont work that well any sugestions???</li>
    <li> Cute bright colors even on dark hair.</li>
    <li> As soon as I vertically rubbed it on my hair, it didn&#x27;t stay on. My hair was tangled right after and it was really messy on your hands or anything else you lay your hands on.</li>
    <li> I was not sure before buying this because of the average customer reviews. And I shouldn&#x27;t have. the chalk pieces were broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried on a color on my hair. and it instantly dried my hair stand like never before. and my hair started to break and fall. I applied all kinds of conditioners &amp; oils &amp; even water to smoothen it but it wont stop drying &amp; in the process I lost the color that I had applied to that particular strand. I had to re wash my hair to get rid of the dryness. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Colors are nice. Only the white one doesnt work. Overall great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m older, no longer hip, and beyond getting funky hair colors for everyday wear.  Sorry, we all have to grow up sometime..sigh.  SO, when a family wedding came up that was rainbow love themed - I knew I wanted rainbow hair.  I have very coarse, dark brown hair and trusted the reviews where they said use white to cover and then apply the color you want.  EXCELLENT idea and the pictures of me with my rainbow loxx were awesome.  Even husbands gray hair was colorful and didn&#x27;t smear after a night of hot weather, dancing and the like.  It does take a bit of shampooing to get the color 100% out with a few days of a bit of pink/blue faintly here or there but, these hair chalks do exactly what they say, are packaged well, and are recommended for the youngsters and us middle aged but still spunky guys/gals.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair that I go to the salon to get colored and I tried the darker pink and the blue, the colors were very vibrant. The only thing though is that the blue came out after one wash but the pink was still in for a couple of weeks. It faded after a couple of washed but I still noticed a hue of pink to where it was at,</li>
    <li> Way smaller then I expected and hard to get onto my daughter&#x27;s hair...took almost one whole color stick to do a few strands...wet worked best for us</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t personally get the chance to see how well they work, but the sticks are SO SO SO SMALL! Just 100 percent smaller than I ever thought. I don&#x27;t see 1 chalk lasting too long, good thing there is 36. I do feel as though the recipient will be very pleased regardless.</li>
    <li> I needed to dye my hair for my halloween costume and due to me only needing my hair to be dyed for one day hair chalk was my only option. I decided on this product and regret it wholly. The first time I applied it was a test run as I wanted to see if it actually worked on my dark brown hair. I followed the directions, wet my hair and first used the white chalk and placed my hair on a hardcover book as specified in the directions. My hair was completely tangled and felt abhorrently dry after using the chalk but after it dried i was able to untangle the small section of hair. I used a flat iron to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the chalk and that did nothing but rub the color off on my flat iron. I had mixed feelings after this trial but decided to try a different method for halloween. Instead of using a hardcover book I wore a latex glove and applied the chalk onto very wet hair using the palm of my hand. Although it was a better application process the chalk rubbed off on everything. I found not by any means comb or bush my hair. I wore it during the day starting at 8am and by 1pm the chalk was only on my shirt and you couldn&#x27;t even see it on my hair anymore. I CAN NOT express how much disdain I have for this product please do not WASTE YOUR MONEY on this horrendous product.</li>
    <li> I just got this and it works awesome. The pieces are pretty small but you don&#x27;t need that much. It says you can use dry but it didn&#x27;t work well for me and I have blond hair. Just dampen your hair and the colors really pop. Very impressed. Not one color broken also. Everything in the box was packaged securely. There weren&#x27;t any directions but all you do is dampen the hair and go down with your hair. Don&#x27;t go up and down because that&#x27;s how you damage your hair. Very happy :)</li>
    <li> It took me 3 washings and half a bottle of conditioner to get the horrible tangles out of my hair.  I don&#x27;t know what they put in it - wax? super glue? - but it immediately dries out your hair, clumps it together like glue and when dry its tangled, breaking if you breathe on it much less try to take a comb to it and I had to cut huge chunks out because I just couldn&#x27;t get the knots out.  So much for my 3 foot hair, it&#x27;s now 2 feet in places and looks so horrible I&#x27;d call and scream at them if I could.  If you love your hair - don&#x27;t use this product - it will RUIN it.  A refund and compensation for half a year&#x27;s worth of hair growth probably wouldn&#x27;t even make me change my review.</li>
    <li> After applying the chalk in your hair it makes it impossible to brush or style.  I tried so many things and even looked on Youtube for a solution to the stiffness.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> These worked great even on my dark brown hair. For darker hair, I recommend wetting the hair, then rubbing on the chalk, then drying with a blow dryer. I love all the different colors--this pack has every shade!</li>
    <li> a fantastic hair color product bought this for a friend of mine with dark hair and it makes highlights a breeze</li>
    <li> they are really tiny and don&#x27;t work that well they also stained my hair!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my niece.  She has been quite pleased with them and has any shared them with friends at a slumber party.  I think they are good for what they are...a novelty.  She enjoys them and so I gave them a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> The chalks were nicely packaged and looked exactly like I expected, they were just a little harder to use than I thought they would be.  I&#x27;m not sure if that was the chalk or the users fault.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed in marketing of item.  Package has no mention of use as a temporary hair color product.  It is nothing but a box of oil pastels that you can purchase at any craft or art center. It is probably why seller does not show box cover which shows as artist pastels. Therefore no instructions on how to use as a hair coloring technique.</li>
    <li> Got it for my Daughter... it doesn&#x27;t even last 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Worked well shipping was good nothing special</li>
    <li> Great price and my niece loved it!</li>
    <li> I loved this a lot&lt;br /&gt;alot. I would really recommend this product. The oh difficulty I had was that it got on your and was scalp and was hard to wash out but other than that it was a great product.</li>
    <li> Do not know how the Hair Chalk lasts. Gave it to my granddaughter for Christmas as she just got it today has not had time to use it. But was delight to get it and hopes to try it out soon.</li>
    <li> this hair chalk is by far the best I have used to date. it&#x27;s temporary, washes out with ease.</li>
    <li> I think a lot of people must have been shipped the wrong product, because I got exactly what was shown.  It&#x27;s a kit of 32 small chalk blocks of color.  I was nervous because of all the bad reviews, but I thought it was actually a pretty easy process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair and I wanted it green for St. Paddy&#x27;s and it worked quite well.  I scratched the side of the chalk and then rubbed it up and down lengths of my (dry) hair.  It goes on light and I kept rubbing it to add more depth to the color.  You can even run the chalk down your hair against your head and it works that way too.  Set the color with hair spray and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is messy, but it&#x27;s chalk powder.  Do it in your bathroom and wash up with soap and water after.  Simple and effective.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how the other colors work out!</li>
    <li> First time using hair chalk! Being a brunette i knew it would be a bit difficult showing up bright! But I was kinda disappointed that they were so small!! I have lots of hair and they didn&#x27;t go far! I guess for someone with light thin hair it would be better!!</li>
    <li> I was scared of getting this because my hair is so thick and dark but these chalks really work. The color stays for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would say is that you have to be careful because the color does get on your face and clothes even after it has dried. Other than that, I love these things :) Oh and my friends love these chalks too! They are so fun!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot because the temporary coloring technique allows me to switch up my color several times a week (if I want)&lt;br /&gt;Colors are very bright&lt;br /&gt;Chalks are soft and easy on my damaged, bleached hair</li>
    <li> Fun with the grand kids teenagers to 8 yrs olds have totally great time adding color to hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for good times</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product, It would not color my hair.. I tried it both dry and wet.. {Sigh} excited over nothing..</li>
    <li> Got this set because of the color selection, and good price. Thought by reading the information that it would be a good choice because of the built in setter.... nope this stuff doesn&#x27;t set. I&#x27;ve tried different methods that I have found online and nothing works. It just comes right off on hands, brush, clothes.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I use it all the time. It doesnt rub off on clothes or furniture. I rub one on paper and then color my hair. After that I flatten or curl my hair. It stays in all day, or it last about 3 days if I don&#x27;t wash it. I love them all. They are small but last a long time. It works as a more temporary color so you can decide which permanet color you want.</li>
    <li> Colors are vibrant but very hard to apply to hair.  Would not suggest this product</li>
    <li> Some colors work some dont. They break no matter how soft you are and they are so small. Like way too small. Not worth the price i paid.</li>
    <li> the chalk served its purpose but it was suppose to be new and one of the chalks were slightly used .</li>
    <li> Arrived a little slow, but not too bad. This was a gift for my niece and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Great assortment of colors. Works wonderfully. Exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> My daughter has med. brown hair and the only color that will show up is the dark blue and dark pink. They are still very muted even after using almost the entire stick. Be prepared for a mess when you use them. We had chalk all over!</li>
    <li> works GREAT!!! my daughter had so much fun with it... I do wish the pieces where bigger!!! The are hard to hold</li>
    <li> Great colors, large assortment.  Use these on my dogs hair (yorkie) they last about 2 days. Use the pinks mostly they come out very nice.</li>
    <li> Pictures online make chalk pieces look larger then they are. They are about 1&amp;#34; long if you are lucky. Also color does not go onto hair easy and it rubs off onto cloths. Does not show up on dark hair as photos on box shows. Only very blonde hair is what you can see it well on.&lt;br /&gt;This set is ok for 9 year olds but I would not buy for anyone that was older and serious about hair styling. Also took a very long time to get product compared to other things I have purchased from Amazon. I almost did not get it in time for Nieces birthday party&lt;br /&gt;(it took two week to get from time of order placed).&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend looking for a better temporary hair coloring set, for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s overpriced, but gets the job done if you have kids that want temporary hair color.  I would suggest trying a craft store and buying a pastel kit from there instead.</li>
    <li> color does not transfer to dark hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d never heard of hair chalk before.. when I found this I knew I had to try it out.  So much easier to apply and create your own unique look than with color sprays.  Awesome range of colors, something for every outfit and every occasion!  Every color so far has shown up perfectly on my brown hair.  It makes it much more pleasant that it sets in, meaning it won&#x27;t rub off on clothes, pillows, etc.. not messy at all.  It lasts up to about three days if you don&#x27;t wash it out..  If you wash your hair it comes out within about one to two shampoos.  Each chalk stick lasts pretty good, haven&#x27;t run out of any of the colors yet, even the ones that I use a lot.  I was a little worried about it coming in the mail, was expecting some of the chalks to be broken, but it was packaged very well and they were all perfectly intact.  This is an awesome product that I am so glad I found..  It is endless amounts of fun and I never run out of new styles to mess with!</li>
    <li> Colors did not show up on my hair.  I have tried other hair chalk products but was not successful with this one.</li>
    <li> This was actually a pretty good buy. Bought for my 10 year old&#x27;s birthday as a temporary hair dye method. It does break your hair if you use it too hard - but keeping the stick &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; helps. It lasted for two days with pretty bright color. My girl&#x27;s hair is dark blonde, so we had to use a little white chalk to help the pink show up, but the darker colors look great with no help. I was worried about the negative reviews when I bought it, but figured it wouldn&#x27;t be too costly a mistake. I was pleasantly surprised! It is messy on the fingers and floor if the powder falls but mostly easy to use. I will probably buy another if she finishes this one and wants more.</li>
    <li> I should have thought of what I was buying, before I purchased it. The chalk does not stay in your hair, no matter if you spray over it with hair spray or heat set it with a curling iron. It falls out in 30 minutes or so. On top of that, it really dries out my hair and makes it look brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are beautiful though.</li>
    <li> Bought this chalk for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Great for little girls.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 6 year old niece. She loved them. Color stuck well to hair once hair was wet. Lots of Fun!</li>
    <li> we really liked that the color selection was so varied and that there were no colors we didn&#x27;t like!  the actual chalks are a little small, but in use, not much is lots in the transfer, so they seem like they will last a long while.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a little change in my hair color..I used the deep pink on my auburn colored hair and it was very pretty..I also used a little bit of pink on my little Chinese Crested Powderpuff..she looks really cute..I found that the color lasts through 3 washes then just gently fades out...wear gloves.,it&#x27;s very messy</li>
    <li> HORRIABLE it is very small and only really works in one use barley lasts a day ,makes ur hair like hay gets it all notty&lt;br /&gt;DO NO BUY</li>
    <li> It has a nice choice of colors,they are bright bold and vibrant. Although sometimes it left my hair a tad on the dry side, it was nothing some good argan oil couldn&#x27;t fix. Don&#x27;t forget to also get some gloves on the side to avoid having stained hands, if not some makeup remover and some good old soap will help get it right off. Aside from that I very much enjoyed them. These are a good product to have if you constantly like to change your style or are trying out a color before fully deciding on a more permanent one.</li>
    <li> The chalks are small and there is a &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; on the outside of the chalk that you have to rub off, not as easy as it would seem. Makes the hair very tangled and doesn&#x27;t completely set even with heat or hairspray.Using it on wet hair  works much better than dry and more color comes out too.</li>
    <li> These are pretty cool! Some of the pieces were broken(I assume during its time with the mailman)but still work. I DO NOT recommend using them on wigs. I got these for my little sisters wig for her Halloween costume. They showed up wonderfully BUT it tangled and knotted the wig, to where it almost ruined the wig. But they do look great in real hair. My tip for people with darker colored hair: Use white over it first then the color you wish to use. The white helps bring out the colors. Light hair shows up no problem. So GREAT for REAL hair NOT wigs.</li>
    <li> Really shows up in my dark hair! Looks good for about two days, and washes out easily.</li>
    <li> This is crap.  I have brown hair and this hair chalk didn&#x27;t really show up well even when I went over the same areas a bunch on times.  It definitely does not stay in for up to three days.  As soon as I brushed it, all of the color disappeared.</li>
    <li> These worked pretty cool. You go through a stick pretty quickly though so try multiple colors to get the effect you need.</li>
    <li> I have used better ones, but if you are just starting out using them or are getting them for a kid these would be great.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions on these chalks, but they didn&#x27;t really work for some reason. The color didn&#x27;t really go onto my hair, and it kind of flaked instead of applying a powdery color to my hair. I have tried powder blush in the past to color my hair, when it was blonde, and that worked a lot better. Hair color in a spray can works really well, too. I ended up giving these chalks to my nieces to color with on paper :)</li>
    <li> This product was great! It does last up to 3 days in my one daughters hair, my other duaghters hair however had a harder time taking the color and keeping it but im sure it is just her hair type (some people take coloring better than others) i will say that using it on wet hair is essential for an easy application and bright vibrant color. All in all awesome product i will buy again!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.  Triple Flex 50+ not taken long enough to see a difference.</li>
    <li> Seriously do not recommend this to anyone, it severely dries up your hair so It feels burnt and rough. The color down even look att all great if you have brown hair like me.&lt;br /&gt;P.s if you do purchas, make sure you apply moisturizer to your hair before the chalk to protect your hair a little</li>
    <li> Easy to use and beautiful colors and looks great!!  Once you get the hang of using them, you easily work a party of girls.</li>
    <li> the colors are great and go onto the hair fairly easily.  They are a little messy, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> theses are fun to play with in my daughters hair, they are kinda messy and hard to use but still fun.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and gave great temporary color to my hair. It arrived exactly on time. It washed right out after my first shower and when you have left overs its great to draw with.</li>
    <li> It did not go on easily. Rubbed off and didn&#x27;t stay in. It did not show up on dark hair the way the description said either.</li>
    <li> the colors are so vibrant but there is no purple chalk so if you like purple I suggest you don&#x27;t buy this because there&#x27;s no purple</li>
    <li> many colors became broken</li>
    <li> The pieces were smaller then expected and it only works when wet. And then it pretty much matts my hair, so I was not able to style it the way I wanted. Like the colors, but was not impressed with the way it made my hair feel</li>
    <li> Works pretty well and I have dark hair. It does make your hair a little clumpy if you don&#x27;t comb it well but it wasn&#x27;t too bad and stayed for a few days.</li>
    <li> *Update on my review: I now have hazel brown hair and I can still get the colors to show! My sister, who has dark brown to black hair, it didnt seem like the color wanted to stick to her hair, but maybe it was the type of hair she has. She uses a lot of products in her hair all the time, where I do not or only use herbal remedies made strictly from organics. I dont know if those little facts have anythign to do with the color sticking to hair or not  but I personally still love this hair chalk and recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love these things! I havent gotten them to work on dark hair but maybe I am doing something wrong. But with my blonde hair these colors were beautiful! The color does tend to &amp;#34;rub off&amp;#34; on what you wear but I made sure to wipe what I colored down with a dry napkin and I didnt have that problem anymore :)</li>
    <li> I ordered a set of hair chalk and I recieved a set of hair chalk. My girls and I had a blast testing them out this evening!  I was very surprised how quickly they arrived, it ordered them only two nights ago. Lots of fun so far and completely matches product description.</li>
    <li> This did not work well in my daughters hair at all. It shredded her hair going into it, even after I made sure to get her curls as straight as I could. I was already angry that it was shredding the hair, but she wanted me to keep trying anyway. It took forever to get a decent amount of color in and most of it diminished after I flat ironed it.  After it was finally all done it looks just okay, and lasted maybe three hours until it was completely gone. My girls have black, curly bi-racial hair and this did not work well at all. But the most annoying running the chalk through the hair and watching it split.&lt;br /&gt;Use gel eye shadow if you have curly dark hair, works way batter and no flat ironing required.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product. It takes a lot of work to get it into the hair and after the constant rubbing it starts to break the hair. The color did not set like it was suppose to with the flat iron it just made the color look dull. The color only lasted about two hours</li>
    <li> This item I bought for my teen age daughter she loved using it. We recommend this product  cause it&#x27;s safe on your hair and it&#x27;s fun.</li>
    <li> Fun product if you want a fun change to your look without the commitment or damage of permanent hair coloring. Easy to use. Works well on light or darker hair.</li>
    <li> I got more chalk on myself than in my hair - I attempted to color my nieces hair and the only color that worked on her BLONDE hair was the red... Other than that - it was a waste and just taking up space.&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to chalk your hair - get the compact disc that you slide your hair through.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like product everything it says is a lie wish it would&#x27;ve worked Bcuz i paid and super excited to use when it got here wish I can get my money back :(</li>
    <li> Use plastic gloves, otherwise, easy to apply.  Color stays and doesn&#x27;t rub off which is a plus.  Yes. would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I have finally found a way to have fun with colored hair without freaking out Dad completely!</li>
    <li> These are standard oil pastels.  Even though your are suppose to be able to use pastels for hair chalk these are not the right kind and do not work.  They have to be returned. Hopefully it won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> Awesome love it Very good service!THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Doesn&#x27;t show up on hair. Rats your hair up when you slide chalk up and down strands. Worse product i ever bought. The only reason i kept it is because i used them in my art class.</li>
    <li> These are ordinary OIL PASTELS not hair chalk!  Do not order! If I could post a picture I would, goes without saying these are definitely going back!</li>
    <li> It is a complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very good.  Hardly showed up on my daughters hair.  Most didn&#x27;t work at all on her hair.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Hard to use, color doesn&#x27;t stay in hair long</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Even if they are small, they are great!! The colors show up really well, but even better when I use the white one as a base. I&#x27;m going to have hair to match the holidays!! :) I&#x27;m definitely going to buy again when I run out:)</li>
    <li> As a musican who performs live shows, this product is GREAT!!  It is easy to use and easy to remove.  It is great for those of us PERFORM ON STAGE it adds color and excitement to our live appearances.  It looks great and the supply of chalk is enough to last a long time which is important if you are playing on the road and playing show after show.  I would recommend this product for any group playing live gigs.  It really shows up on stage under lights and enchances stage presence to make an even BIGGER impression on the audience.  When the show is over it is easy to remove which is important if you want to lower profile.  IT IS GREAT--TRY IT AND YOU WILL NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For others it can MAKE A BIG FASHSION STATEMENT--FOR ME IT IS GREAT FOR LIVE PERFOMANCES.</li>
    <li> It rubbed off on my daughter&#x27;s clothes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Instead made hair frizz. Tried following instructions found online since it didn&#x27;t even come with an instruction sheet.</li>
    <li> made my haor feel like straw and had dull colors. returned!!</li>
    <li> All the bad reviews are bs i have dark hair and it works perfectly. I think this product is awesome. It doesnt stain it washes off its chalk lol.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift. I have Ombre hair with blonde on the bottom. The colors should show up well on the blonde color. Specially the pinks and blues. Well the chalk broke in half as soon as i went to use it, then got all my hand. Made my hair clump together, may be it has too much oil and when I went to wahs my hands, it was all over my sink and very hard to remove. Worse chalk ever.</li>
    <li> I have read that many people disliked this product because of the mess involved...&lt;br /&gt;I say, learn how to use it without making a mess, I mean come on... there are billions of YouTube videos out there, I&#x27;m sure there are some on how to use Hair Chalk properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend purchased this product to use at a Birthday party.  Yes it made a bit of a mess. I used the brightest Pink one, and my Daughter used the brightest Green one.&lt;br /&gt;I have Auburn hair, and was very skeptical that this wouldn&#x27;t work on it. Boy was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;It showed up nice and vibrant, my daughter has super Blonde hair, and her hair looks incredible! Mine washed out with the first shower, or so I thought!&lt;br /&gt;Upon drying my hair, it still showed up a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;The party was 4/13, here we are on 4/16 and my Daughter&#x27;s hair is still pretty bright!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product; it&#x27;s perfect for a Girl&#x27;s Night Out, if you just want a little extra spunk, being able to change up the color of my tips pretty often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Each piece of chalk is pretty small but the color pay-off is great. A really good value overall.</li>
    <li> Great set but I will warn that the chalk is very small.</li>
    <li> This product was supposed to last up to three days!! It didn&#x27;t last three hours. It also said it would not come off on clothes or anything. Not true!! The color came off on my daughter&#x27;s face and her clothes. The color is nice, and it goes on fairly well, but does not last at all. Not worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my hair but it didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped. I have very dark, very thick and very curly hair and to get the color to show up well, I had to really rub it in and almost start putting dreadlocks in my hair. My kids, who both have mostly straight ash blond hair love it and it works well in their hair. I watched a few videos to see if I could find a better way to apply it, but wet or dry gave me the same outcome. Not a waste though as the kids will definitely use it!</li>
    <li> I rated it 5 stars because it works awesome in my hair.  I think everyone should have it.  Thanks for the chalk</li>
    <li> Good value and easy to use. Lots of options and colors. Four year old can use under supervision. Many colors</li>
    <li> Did not work at all on my hair or my niece&#x27;s hair. Similar to other reviews, shredded my hair when I tried to apply it. We tried both wet and dry hair thinking maybe wet would work better (it didn&#x27;t).  I gave it two stars because my niece is quite artistic ans said the colors would work well as oils pastels for doing her artwork. So, not a total loss. The hair chalks that comes in little pots (like hot hues) work much better. Spend the extra money and get those instead.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get these to use on my 6 year-old daughter for a dress up day.  I definitely had to wet the chalk to get it to show up.  It made a huge mess on my floor so make sure you apply outside or over a towel.  Also use a rubber glove, b/c it stains your hand when you apply.  I used the hot pink and it did make a pink streak, but it wasn&#x27;t all that bright so I really had to keep running it through.  My daughter has dark blond hair.  By the end of use the chalk accidentally fell and immediately broke in 2, so that was the end of that piece.  The colors also weren&#x27;t as bright as they look online.  I was hoping for a neon color and none of them really worked well.  I would probably try again since I have a whole pack, but I don&#x27;t think I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter and she couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> These things are crap. You have wet them to use them and takes forever to get any color. Then only mins to no longer show in your hair</li>
    <li> I regret to buy this product.</li>
    <li> It was okay, it worked but my hair was painfully tangly and it got all over me and sort of lasted. Maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> it rubs of on my clothes and fingers and it takes a lot to even try to see the color on your hair</li>
    <li> gift for granddaughter she loves it, her mom didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> This color chalk does exactly what it says it does.  Others have rub off on clothes, sheets, etc., this stays on the hair and the kids love it.</li>
    <li> But my husband did not - leaves a mess</li>
    <li> Not very bright once applied to your hair, doesn&#x27;t last days and is super messy for the person putting it in. Not a clean or easy process.</li>
    <li> These work great! They get heavy use at our house by two little fashionistas. This is the second box I&#x27;ve bought for them and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> These are terrible.&lt;br /&gt;1. Each piece is only about an inch long&lt;br /&gt;2. Color simply does not transfer onto hair. I am brunette. (Like in the manufacturer pictures)&lt;br /&gt;3. Only after rubbing the chalk onto hair for several minutes do you get a very faint color. Then the section of hair is left really rough from the constant friction.&lt;br /&gt;Major disappointment as I bought another set as a Xmas gift.</li>
    <li> The color, although vibrant, didn&#x27;t look so pretty all over my neck, shirt collar, pillow...etc. lol&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly healthy hair, lots of moisture and texture. once i added some of this color, my hair became so dry and brittle! it tangled, it was too stiff to brush, and when i tried, i ruined y favorite brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the only time ill consider putting this in my hair again is if its in a up-do.  But i highly doubt i ever will..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont recommend this product for anyone. even kids. Especially kids! unless parents dont mind trying to get chalk off of everything...</li>
    <li> Little messy to work with but fun colors</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even last 3 hours, makes your hair super crunchy. Very dissapointing</li>
    <li> Was sent  a childs art supply chalk set ,  Not what I want to pull out to work on clients in the salon.</li>
    <li> I wanted to color my hair for a party and these worked great for the day. Easy to use. Washed out of my hair on the second day. I like blended the blue and green together. Pink also stands out well. Nice box of color choices.</li>
    <li> Not sure but I think some people received the incorrect product! Theses in this box are definitely chalk! No oil pastels and box is the same.  They are so fun and cool! Maybe order from a different vendor but the ACTUAL product is great!</li>
    <li> These color the hair very well but they do tend to leave things a little dry after you&#x27;ve washed it out.  A good conditioning treatment helps. As does applying it wet instead of dry.</li>
    <li> This product does NOT WORK! I had bought it for my neice as a present. We all tried to get it to work, but no sucess. Will not buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got the goods and in good condition. I was happy using hair colors thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my 5-year-old and her friend to dye their hair pink.  EVerybody got in on the action!  It was fun.  Only thing is, it dries the hair and makes it more tangled.  Washes out easily, gone in 1-2 days, perfect for little kids, events, halloween, just for fun.</li>
    <li> The chalks are ok, but they looked bigger in the photo. They work alright. Would probably not order them again.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter bought this.  many of the colors do not show well in dark hair but for a lighter brown hair works decent.</li>
