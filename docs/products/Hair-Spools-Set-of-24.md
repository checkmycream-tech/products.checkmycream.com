### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and they are great travel curlers.</li>
      <li>I was happy to once again find hair spools</li>
      <li>&quot; I remember from the 60&#x27;s - 70&#x27;s would work perfectly, but they certainly are not these.</li>
      <li>I liked the hair spools</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t unravel my 2 strand twist because I liked the spiral curls I had.</li>
      <li>Good product, comfortable to sleep in.</li>
      <li>when i get it right the wave is very nice.</li>
      <li>but OK.</li>
      <li>If you have more than 2 inches of hair these wont work.</li>
      <li>Kids love to use them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure once i unravel</li>
      <li>I had planned to order another package, I am now glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Both of my daughters have fine hair as do</li>
      <li>They are not as comfortable to sleep in as they say either</li>
      <li>I guess they work okay, but they&#x27;re not the original product which was much softer, and more comfortable.</li>
      <li>I wish they were larger but the make very nice curls</li>
      <li>They are not at all like the original spoolies.</li>
      <li>The pros: they do create nice cute LITTLE curls.</li>
      <li>These are so much fun to use and see the results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have big hair which will still look nice.</li>
      <li>Very retro and cool.</li>
      <li>These will give you tight springy curls and they are good to sleep on because they don&#x27;t hurt your head.</li>
      <li>I really regret buying them.</li>
      <li>Very disapointed with the results.  </li>
      <li>Also it was easy to get them in pink.</li>
      <li>They are of high quality</li>
      <li>Make sure to note that your hair must be wet enough to take shape of curls.</li>
      <li>I want to make my hair curl in the back, the the higher quality \\&quot;spoolies\\</li>
      <li>These spools are waaay to small to be practical, and there are no other sizes available.  </li>
      <li>but these are of no use to me, other than my cat being mildly entertained for  a short while.</li>
      <li>and then they&#x27;d slide right down and unroll, then fall on the floor.</li>
      <li>The ones I used as a kid were soft, non slippery rubber, similar to what baby bottle nipples were like.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These were purchase as sort of a joke and throw-back to when &amp;#34;Spoolies&amp;#34; were all the rage. I guess they work okay, but they&#x27;re not the original product which was much softer, and more comfortable. I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase these again because they&#x27;re just &amp;#34;cheaply made&amp;#34;. Too bad.</li>
    <li> not real sure about them staying in all night, i am having trouble having them stay in while sitting.but when i get it right the wave is very nice.</li>
    <li> Very disapointed with the results.  They don&#x27;t stay in even when just sitting around.  They had no instructions included with the rollers, it&#x27;s trial an error.  I have not figured out how to make them stay in my hair.  They are not at all like the original spoolies.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed as I used these rollers when I was young teen. These rollers kept falling out of my hair and it was hard to keep them on. I had planned to order another package, I am now glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Very very small rollers and they slip right out of your hair. I really regret buying them. Buyer Beware! They are too small to hold a regular head of hair.</li>
    <li> I was not given the option of ordering small, medium or large.  The hair spools I received are very small.  The plastic is cheap and inflexible.  Money wasted for this item.  I want to make my hair curl in the back, the the higher quality \\&quot;spoolies\\&quot; I remember from the 60&#x27;s - 70&#x27;s would work perfectly, but they certainly are not these.</li>
    <li> I liked the hair spools but I was disappointed because I thought they were different sizes and not all one size.  I bought these for my granddaughter&#x27;s hair and needed some larger ones.  They are of high quality so I cannot say that I am really disappointed in the hair spools.</li>
    <li> These are so much fun to use and see the results. Very retro and cool. Kids love to use them</li>
    <li> These spools are waaay to small to be practical, and there are no other sizes available.  They look much bigger on the cartoon than they actually are.  Sadly, I returned them.</li>
    <li> I purchased a couple sets of these elsewhere. I should have done my homework here at Amazon and saved my money! The pros: they do create nice cute LITTLE curls. The bad news: they don&#x27;t stay in my hair at all. The ones I used as a kid were soft, non slippery rubber, similar to what baby bottle nipples were like. These are very slick and slippery. If I  use tiny sections of my very long and very thick hair, they still don&#x27;t want to stay in. I&#x27;d get a couple in and then they&#x27;d slide right down and unroll, then fall on the floor. FRUSTRATING!</li>
    <li> I was happy to once again find hair spools but these do not function due to only one end folding over hair. I don&#x27;t know if it is an patent issue or an attempt to save money but these are of no use to me, other than my cat being mildly entertained for  a short while.</li>
    <li> My hair is short and thin and it won&#x27;t dry over night in these. They are not as comfortable to sleep in as they say either</li>
    <li> Size of Hair Spools-Small&lt;br /&gt;Hair Type-3c/3b/some 4a&lt;br /&gt;Porosity - Medium&lt;br /&gt;Width-Thin&lt;br /&gt;Style - I wash my hair and then moisturize then I do small-medium 2 strand twists then I take 2 or 3 at a time and I roll the ends. Make sure to note that your hair must be wet enough to take shape of curls. I let it air dry or sleep with it and the next day I unravel and my curls are tight. Mainly because the spool is small. That&#x27;s the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the size. I didn&#x27;t unravel my 2 strand twist because I liked the spiral curls I had. I&#x27;m sure once i unravel I&#x27;ll have big hair which will still look nice.</li>
    <li> After using these I was amazed at how curly my hair turned out.  I just could not get use to sleeping with them on.</li>
    <li> Used these as a child. Bought them for a friend&#x27;s girl. Hope she enjoys using these &amp;#34;old timmie&amp;#34; things.</li>
    <li> These will give you tight springy curls and they are good to sleep on because they don&#x27;t hurt your head.</li>
    <li> Too small,would not stay in hair</li>
    <li> These are too small for my hair.</li>
    <li> They slip off my hair</li>
    <li> I was unhappy with the material it is made from. Years ago it was made from a sturdy rubber and was not flimsy as it is now.  Also it was easy to get them in pink.</li>
    <li> Cannot use these.  They do not stay in wet or dry hair,  spools too loose.  Both of my daughters have fine hair as do I.  Perhaps they work in thicker hair but you would need several packages.</li>
    <li> I wish they were larger but the make very nice curls and they are great travel curlers.</li>
    <li> If you have more than 2 inches of hair these wont work. They unroll with the slightest touch. Very hard to get hair to Stay in them.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I were not happy with the \\&quot;Hair Spool\\&quot; rollers, in fact we were shockingly disappointed with how tiny they are, we cannot use them since our hair is thick therefore rendering the Hair Spools useless, we ended up tossing them in the drawer where they will be forgotten.</li>
    <li> Good product, comfortable to sleep in.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t hold as well as I had wish. but OK.</li>
