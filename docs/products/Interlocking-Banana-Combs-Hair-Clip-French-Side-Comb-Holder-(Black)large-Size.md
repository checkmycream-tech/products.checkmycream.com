      <li>AM happy with my clip, use it lots, and wish I would be able to find them in local stores, like Target, Wal-Mart, and K-Mart....</li>
      <li>(I cut my hair and slipped it into the goodwill donations thinking I could easily get another if I grew my hair out again--oops)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is cheap plastic that breaks easily.</li>
      <li>but what I received, the Animal Print Clips and Black Clip were perfect.  </li>
      <li>cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>CHEAP...</li>
      <li>Cheap breakable plastic</li>
      <li>Next day, three more teeth broke!!  </li>
      <li>very upsetting!!!</li>
      <li>Great clip for long hair....</li>
      <li>They are nothing like the original ones.</li>
      <li>I used to use some interlocking banana combs in the 90s that I LOVED, but I got rid of them when I cut my hair short.  </li>
      <li>In short - the results are good but the comfort is not there.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted but it is huge.</li>
      <li>I have two granddaughters with long hair and it works good with their hair.  </li>
      <li>I really like the hair combs, they are so easy to use</li>
      <li>They are exactly what I was looking for &amp; I am getting ready to order more.</li>
      <li>These are very shard and cheaply made.</li>
      <li>slide right out.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t the right plastic that they were in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>These are very large.</li>
      <li>The material is obviously not meant to be used more than once or twice.  </li>
      <li>2 of the comb teeth broke the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>It goes from the top back of my head to my neck.</li>
      <li>The first time I put these in the two of the combs broke.  </li>
      <li>They went straight in the trash because it would have been more of a pain to send them back.</li>
      <li>I am very dissatisfied and I should have read the reviews first before ordering.</li>
      <li>day, missing 2 teeth, I tried again and instantly 2 more teeth broke!</li>
      <li>These are so much easier to get your hair up into without the pulling that occurs with the ones locked on one end.  </li>
      <li>Next day, one of the teeth broke off when I tried to secure my hair.  </li>
      <li>so it is very flattering to my hair to wear this type of comb.  </li>
      <li>sort of a mohawk look, but much prettier.  </li>
      <li>I really like the way it look on my hair and the way it holds my hair in place.</li>
      <li>I have long hair and they hold my securely.</li>
      <li>they are hard plastic, wish I had more colors to suit my colorful wardrobe.  </li>
      <li>It might take a little practice to use them correctly but you will love them once you get the hang</li>
      <li>I have to repurchase new ones.</li>
      <li>The material is a harder, more brittle plastic than should be used for a product like this-- that needs to have such pressure applied when pushing the 2 pieces together to bring the hair into place.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised by their size.</li>
      <li>I am glad they were no more than $5.</li>
      <li>It absolutely will not last.</li>
      <li>This black comb, broke the very first time I put it in my hair ,four teeth came out in one shot, Then it was garbage.</li>
      <li>I have very thick hair and most of teh combs</li>
      <li>They pull your hair and it hurts, sharp edges and most of all, they do not interlock because they are so stiff.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t expect them to last too long.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering from them again in the near future!</li>
      <li>hard to get to hold the hair because it you press harder to hold the hair, you break more teeth.</li>

<li> hard to get to hold the hair because it you press harder to hold the hair, you break more teeth.</li>
<li> Good hair clip for thin or thick hair.  </li>
<li> It looked like a row of natural curls going down the back of my head.  </li>
<li> I  found these on amazon, first thing is the plastic is rock hard and not&lt;br</li>
<li> They are very thin and could break easily in thicker hair.</li>
<li> they are hard to find anywhere in the Real world.</li>
<li> Way too expensive for how cheaply they are made.</li>
<li> I have been looking for these for a long time.</li>
<li> keeps my hair pulled back off my face and puts it into a stream of curls down the back of my head.</li>
<li> I have black and white sets.</li>
<li> however the plastic is much harder and less pliable, My hair constantly is getting stuck in between the comb teeth and pulls little bits of hair constantly</li>
<li> this one is a little too big . . .</li>
<li> For a grown up with thin long hair will work but not thick hair or curly hair.</li>
<li> The only thing that I dislike is that the teeth of the comb do not fit together snugly.</li>
<li> and I am sad to say this brand started loosing the teeth in it right away...</li>
<li> Not a good product, if they fall out they crack, the teeth fall out..choose another more expensive comb.  </li>
<li> Have to keep readjusting them all day long &amp; they pull your hair not comfortable at all.</li>
<li> I use these type of combs everyday for work I have really long hair and curly</li>
<li> I only wore these for a few minutes and they were loosing the teeth!</li>
<li> and NEED the other one.  </li>
<li> I cannot get them to stay in due to the hard plastic  would send back but not worth the time to do so.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe how cheap the quality of the combs are. :(</li>

    <li> This black comb, broke the very first time I put it in my hair ,four teeth came out in one shot, Then it was garbage.</li>
    <li> Good hair clip for thin or thick hair.  Good transaction.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in my order. The combs are poorly made. They are nothing like the original ones. I can&#x27;t believe how cheap the quality of the combs are. :( I need to find originals!</li>
    <li> I was searching everywhere for these hair combs. Nobody had them. I went on line and there they were. They even arrived before I left town for Thanksgiving. I was absolutely thrilled to be able to put my hair up. They are exactly what I was looking for &amp; I am getting ready to order more.</li>
    <li> Bought to put my daughter&#x27;s hair up for halloween costume..did the trick!</li>
    <li> They are very thin and could break easily in thicker hair. I really don&#x27;t expect them to last too long.</li>
    <li> Break easy do not buy</li>
    <li> This company was prompt and accurat. My mother has been using these since the 80&#x27;s and can no longer find them anywhere, every place I ordered from were usually smaller ones or not even close to the description.  Will be ordering from them again in the near future!</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t the right plastic that they were in the 80&#x27;s.  Two have already broken.  They aren&#x27;t flexible at all.  I am very dissatisfied and I should have read the reviews first before ordering.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed.  Was hoping that these would work for my thick hair - but they didn&#x27;t.  Works good on kids hair.  I have two granddaughters with long hair and it works good with their hair.  For a grown up with thin long hair will work but not thick hair or curly hair. I am glad they were no more than $5.</li>
    <li> THE BEST! You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price! I ahve been looking for these clips everywhere, I will for sure buy more! great buy!</li>
    <li> love these use them all the time have  more then one set</li>
    <li> Not a good product, if they fall out they crack, the teeth fall out..choose another more expensive comb.  I only wore these for a few minutes and they were loosing the teeth!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find them now and I am sad to say this brand started loosing the teeth in it right away...i ended up throwing it away within 2 days.</li>
    <li> Years ago I bought these combs in a store and loved them.  My hair is curly/wavy and when I put my combs in it looked great. It looked like a row of natural curls going down the back of my head.  As years have come and gone I could not find these combs anywhere so I ordered them online.  The combs I received does give my hair the same look however the plastic is much harder and less pliable, My hair constantly is getting stuck in between the comb teeth and pulls little bits of hair constantly and it drives me crazy.  I am not really happy with this comb as it never is comfortable in my hair.If it were still made with the softer plastic it would be a winner, but this hard plastic ruins this comb.  In short - the results are good but the comfort is not there.</li>
    <li> These are very large. I love them I have very thick hair and most of teh combs slide right out. These stay put.</li>
    <li> These are so much easier to get your hair up into without the pulling that occurs with the ones locked on one end.  I wish they had more colors to offer but what I received, the Animal Print Clips and Black Clip were perfect.  Service was prompt and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order again.  Once hair is up off your neck in these combs, it falls so nicely to the sides of each one.  It might take a little practice to use them correctly but you will love them once you get the hang of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline&lt;br /&gt;Tampa, FL</li>
    <li> DISLIKE....the Hard plastic, they are not easy to use for that reason, Ilove the design, but the hard plastic makes it impossible for comfort and the chance for breakage makes them no value..</li>
    <li> What ever happened to the rubber banana combs that didn&#x27;t break the minute you put them in your hair? This is cheap plastic that breaks easily. Order at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I really liked the hair clip.  The only thing that I dislike is that the teeth of the comb do not fit together snugly.</li>
    <li> They are ok, wouldn&#x27;t order them again. They dont stay in the hair well. Have to keep readjusting them all day long &amp; they pull your hair not comfortable at all.</li>
    <li> I wanted the banana clip that only can get as an add on item . . . this one is a little too big . . . and NEED the other one.  It comes with the attachment on the bottom to help hold hair up but was told over and over could not buy as it is only a &#x27;add on&#x27; . . . very upsetting!!!</li>
    <li> i used these hairbows when i was in middle school i loved them and couldnt find them in stores but thank god you guys had them very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> brittle, break easily - wouldn&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> These are very shard and cheaply made.,No way i will buy these again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these for a long time. They keep my hair up neatly. Going to order more</li>
    <li> I use these type of combs everyday for work I have really long hair and curly so it is very flattering to my hair to wear this type of comb.  Keeps my hair out of my face.  The first time I put these in the two of the combs broke.  So hence the price I understand guess.  I have some combs I have used almost everyday for over 10 years.  So I see quality is not with these combs. Should have known with the price.  Just thought I would try them.</li>
    <li> I really like the hair combs, they are so easy to use and they make styling your hair very easy.</li>
    <li> I looked in the hair section of all the local drugstores and also Walmart and Kmart and couldn&#x27;t find this. I have one &amp; bought this for a friend that liked mine.</li>
    <li> I use to buy these in any store but haven&#x27;t seen them for years. I  found these on amazon, first thing is the plastic is rock hard and not&lt;br /&gt;pliable at all. They pull your hair and it hurts, sharp edges and most of all, they do not interlock because they are so stiff. Will not but again. They went straight in the trash because it would have been more of a pain to send them back. They are GARBAGE!</li>
    <li> I really like the way it look on my hair and the way it holds my hair in place. I had a hard time finding these hair interlocking banana comb</li>
    <li> I cannot get them to stay in due to the hard plastic  would send back but not worth the time to do so.</li>
    <li> Would not lock around my thick hair.  Way too expensive for how cheaply they are made.</li>
    <li> CHEAP... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.</li>
    <li> cheaply made.  Already broke.</li>
    <li> have purchased many banana clips and these were the worst.  hard plastic.  no give in them.  every time i put another one on, it broke one or more teeth.  digs in the head.....hard to get to hold the hair because it you press harder to hold the hair, you break more teeth.</li>
    <li> AM happy with my clip, use it lots, and wish I would be able to find them in local stores, like Target, Wal-Mart, and K-Mart....they are hard to find anywhere in the Real world.</li>
    <li> I searched for these all over on the internet.  I used to use some interlocking banana combs in the 90s that I LOVED, but I got rid of them when I cut my hair short.  Growing it out again, I decided I wanted some of those interlocking banana combs I used before.  This is the closest I have seen, but I am extremely disappointed.  The material is obviously not meant to be used more than once or twice.  I used the combs the day after I received them.  No problem.  Next day, one of the teeth broke off when I tried to secure my hair.  :(  Next day, three more teeth broke!!  It seems like the material is a fragile plastic unable to stand up to any stress whatsoever.  The combs I had years ago NEVER broke.  They were a durable hard plastic, not brittle at all.  And now I see that the same item is \\&quot;currently unavailable.\\&quot;  Figures.  At least I am not out a LOT of money for them.</li>
    <li> These combs were much larger than I envisioned them.  I was very surprised by their size. The picture and description was deceiving</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted but it is huge. It goes from the top back of my head to my neck.</li>
    <li> Cheap breakable plastic</li>
    <li> I have long hair and they hold my securely. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I will be trying to get more colors if available. I loved them in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this item what seems like forever..I ordered 2 and after using just once two teeth broke!!&lt;br /&gt;Next day, missing 2 teeth, I tried again and instantly 2 more teeth broke! Very cheap quality. Save your money.</li>
    <li> love these combs.  keeps my hair pulled back off my face and puts it into a stream of curls down the back of my head. sort of a mohawk look, but much prettier.  better than using rubber bands in pony tails.  they are hard plastic, wish I had more colors to suit my colorful wardrobe.  I have black and white sets.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get it to stay in my hair without pulling.</li>
    <li> The problem is the material this comb is made of. The material is a harder, more brittle plastic than should be used for a product like this-- that needs to have such pressure applied when pushing the 2 pieces together to bring the hair into place. 2 of the comb teeth broke the first time I used it. I had one years ago that was made of a more pliable plastic and withstood the pressure. It outlasted all the others. (I cut my hair and slipped it into the goodwill donations thinking I could easily get another if I grew my hair out again--oops)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I do not recommend this product. It absolutely will not last. Yay on product design. Boo on the choice of material used.</li>
    <li> Great clip for long hair....I have to repurchase new ones. My granddaughter borrowed it and broke it....she also loved it.</li>
    <li> Yo use esta peineta cuando ten&amp;iacute;a 15 a&amp;ntilde;os pero era suave esta es dura y hace doler al agarrar el cabello :-( no Good</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE, FAST SERVICE!!</li>
