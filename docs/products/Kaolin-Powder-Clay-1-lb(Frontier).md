      <li>Manufacturers put many cancer-causing ingredients no wonder we are suffering.</li>
      <li>It keeps my face blemish free!</li>
      <li>and I have used it many times.  </li>

      <li>I need more.</li>
      <li>want more of this stuff.</li>

      <li>Products are always fresh, thoughtfully packaged, and a good value.  </li>

      <li>After I rinse, my skin feels smooth, fresh, and clean.</li>
      <li>i hear its good for a facial mask also.</li>
      <li>This has really cleared up my face and made my skin look better.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, we used it, mixed with water to help repel cucumber beetles in the garden.</li>
      <li>Stopped the bleeding quickly.</li>
      <li>There are no ingredients other than clay, which means it is perfect for sensitive skin types as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Such a great natural alternative to baby powder!</li>
      <li>Mainly because it washes off in the sprinklers, but might work better in a higher concentration &amp; drip system.</li>
      <li>and I am hoping that I can stil get some use from this product with the more mature vines.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think that is right.</li>
      <li>Do great job in the damage, pores, acne, sensitive ando other problems skins.</li>
      <li>I use this powder as a baby powder and so far it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>I carry EDC tools, and I think I could fill a waterproof carry tube with some for quick use if I ever came across a decent gash or slice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sprayed it on the leaves of plants and sure enough they did not like walking on the powdery residue.</li>
      <li>I mix it with other ingredients and make my own body powder, deodorant, etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and soft and I also use it on their skin; no big dust clouds.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>If anybody can help it would really be appreciated.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Fast service</li>
      <li>It gently cleanses without any irritation.  </li>
      <li>I do understand that it can be difficult to clean out, but I feel like a doctor, nurse, or surgeon removing the clotted area under controlled circumstances, is probably more preferable to anyone, than massive loss of blood causing irreparable harm, amputation, or death, for most people anyway.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product is of high quality</li>
      <li>I would still highly recommend the product, just stay on top of the problem aggressively while the plants are small.</li>
      <li>This pound of clay is an inexpensive beauty treatment I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>The french green clay makes my face feel a little too dry, but this is perfect.</li>
      <li>It gives them a white coating that is safe to humans and helpful garden creatures, but prohibits pests from chowing down on leaves and fruit!</li>
      <li>the photo shows a foil package and this came in clear plastic.</li>
      <li>This bag lasts for months and is such a great alternative to those expensive, ready-made masks that are sold at beauty counters and drug stores.</li>
      <li>my skin feels soft the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>when you wake, your skin feels baby soft.</li>
      <li>I learned about it in an adult education course on organic gardening.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lovely with a little bee pollen, honey, oil, and vanilla essential oil mixed into it and slopped on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>Currently the active ingredient in, what is now the 3rd generation, quick clot bandages.</li>
      <li>It really helped knock down a garden pest without relying on a pesticide.</li>
      <li>Wrong stuff, very flaky and dries to quickly.  </li>
      <li>have other white clays that are double the quality of this, but this one is still decent considering you are not paying a premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has really cleared up my face and made my skin look better. The french green clay makes my face feel a little too dry, but this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several items from this vendor.  Products are always fresh, thoughtfully packaged, and a good value.  I repackaged the clay in small plastic containers for future use.  The powder is quite fine.</li>
    <li> I use this powder in a masque every Sunday. It&#x27;s lovely with a little bee pollen, honey, oil, and vanilla essential oil mixed into it and slopped on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also going to try it as a colorant in soap.</li>
    <li> my skin is usually quite dry. i take a teaspoon of this kaolin clay powder, mix it with a lotion i have at home in a small container, then use it for my body and hands. my skin feels soft the rest of the day. the hands i re-apply because of hand washing throughout the day. it&#x27;s even better if, after you shower, lotion immediately then to bed. when you wake, your skin feels baby soft. i hear its good for a facial mask also. i will try that next.</li>
    <li> i use this for weekly detox baths, mix it good into hot water and soak for 15 minutes, use as face mask too. i thought it would clog the drain but once its dissolved its just gray water. skin tingles after.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Nice packaging.  As expected delivery.  Great purchase.  I&#x27;ll be using it to make a variety of homemade make up items.  Feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> Good quality, I use it on cosmetics</li>
    <li> Used this to try and deter insects from eating my vegetable starts, as suggested by MotherEarthNews. Didn&#x27;t work. Mainly because it washes off in the sprinklers, but might work better in a higher concentration &amp; drip system. I found that earwigs just don&#x27;t care, even if I coat both sides of leaf, its still eaten. Product is nice though, very clean, uniform texture.</li>
    <li> I use this powder as a baby powder and so far it works just fine.  It is very fine and a little hard to funnel into a powder bottle, but I&#x27;ll take the trouble of doing that over spreading GMO powder on such a delicate area of a baby.  It&#x27;s nice and soft and I also use it on their skin; no big dust clouds.  Glad i found this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE using this clay powder as a masque!  It gently cleanses without any irritation.  I add a few essential oils for an added benefit.  I use it once a week.  It keeps my face blemish free!</li>
    <li> Wrong stuff, very flaky and dries to quickly.  It mixes with water poorly, perhaps deionized water, we&#x27;ll see or another use perhaps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving them one start not for the product itself. I just bought this kaolin clay thinking it was from frontier company. For my surprise when I opened the package, the product was indeed kaolin clay, but from Crafter&#x27;s Choice company. I thought I should let you all know before buying this product is not from frontier. Shame of this vendor for doing false advertisement.</li>
    <li> Kaolin clay is excellent as an ingredient in soap. It adds slip, and helps &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the scent in the soap. I use Kaolin in almost all my recipes. Frontier Kaolin is a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I was supposed to get Kaolin clay but I got Crafter&#x27;s Choice clay instead and I don&#x27;t think that is right.</li>
    <li> Perfect quality for supplement.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase from Griffin LLC - counterfeit product.  Their&#x27;s is on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in my garden for pest control.  I learned about it in an adult education course on organic gardening.  Just mix a little with H2o in a spray bottle and spray seedlings or mature plants.  It gives them a white coating that is safe to humans and helpful garden creatures, but prohibits pests from chowing down on leaves and fruit!</li>
    <li> I bought this to do my own facials at home.  It is a very nice product.</li>
    <li> Nice clay. Used it for soap making,  worked as expected.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast service</li>
    <li> This pound of clay is an inexpensive beauty treatment I can&#x27;t live without. Several times a week, I mix some of the clay with water and apply it to my face as a mask to purify my oily skin and keep breakouts to a minimum. After I rinse, my skin feels smooth, fresh, and clean. This bag lasts for months and is such a great alternative to those expensive, ready-made masks that are sold at beauty counters and drug stores. There are no ingredients other than clay, which means it is perfect for sensitive skin types as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> When I bought this I thought it would at least show me the correct mixture to use for a mask, heard it absorbes oil really well. Should the mixture be watery or a little thick how much time should I leave it on my face. If anybody can help it would really be appreciated. Oh and the 4 stars is for how the product looks.</li>
    <li> I used this in cold process soap making. It works great. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, we used it, mixed with water to help repel cucumber beetles in the garden. Sprayed it on the leaves of plants and sure enough they did not like walking on the powdery residue. It really helped knock down a garden pest without relying on a pesticide.</li>
    <li> Came within the expected time frame.  Arrived in great condition.  No complaints.  No issues with bringing it from the States to Canada.</li>
    <li> fair price, Frontier is a quality company so I trust their products.  I use this for making my own cosmetics and body powder.</li>
    <li> The white wonder. I had a plum tree that was being eaten alive and well on its way to dead. The kaolin applied as a spray saved its life and stopped further damage. I need more.</li>
    <li> I searched for pink clay and this came up in the results. the clay is actually white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other white clays that are double the quality of this, but this one is still decent considering you are not paying a premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but this should not come up under pink clay searches when it is actually white, and does not have a picture of the color of the clay either.</li>
    <li> Such a great natural alternative to baby powder! no horrible talc powder! Highly recommend! And this is a cost efficient way to buy</li>
    <li> Got this in the mail and I have used it many times.  Great quality and no complaints. With the money.</li>
    <li> I mix it with other ingredients and make my own body powder, deodorant, etc. Manufacturers put many cancer-causing ingredients no wonder we are suffering.</li>
    <li> i use this to make homemade skin products so the quality is very important. this product is of high quality</li>
    <li> I use this product for skin acne...it works WONDERFULLY...I havent spent money on expensive acne creams since I found this...</li>
    <li> Currently the active ingredient in, what is now the 3rd generation, quick clot bandages. This worked. Dumped it on a gash/wound. Stopped the bleeding quickly. I do understand that it can be difficult to clean out, but I feel like a doctor, nurse, or surgeon removing the clotted area under controlled circumstances, is probably more preferable to anyone, than massive loss of blood causing irreparable harm, amputation, or death, for most people anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bag in my trunk, with all other supplies, and a bag in my house. I carry EDC tools, and I think I could fill a waterproof carry tube with some for quick use if I ever came across a decent gash or slice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want more of this stuff.</li>
    <li> This powder is nice and although I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet, I&#x27;m sure it will be fine. One thing - the photo shows a foil package and this came in clear plastic.</li>
    <li> I read that if you mix this product with water and make a spray it will prevent cucumber beetles from ruining your gourd plants. So far it is the best thing that I have used. I make crafts from the gourds and have had a terrible time with these nasty striped pests. I have tried everything even resorting to chemical sprays but this stuff is doing the trick organically and my vines are beautiful, strong and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;After a week away the vines were attacked by the curb it beetles . I am trying to spray them again but iI got behind and I am hoping that I can stil get some use from this product with the more mature vines. If you have other questions you should refer them to the manufacturer. I would still highly recommend the product, just stay on top of the problem aggressively while the plants are small.</li>
    <li> bag dosnt like to re seal</li>
    <li> This mask it&#x27;s awesome and very effective. Do great job in the damage, pores, acne, sensitive ando other problems skins. I recomend 100%</li>
