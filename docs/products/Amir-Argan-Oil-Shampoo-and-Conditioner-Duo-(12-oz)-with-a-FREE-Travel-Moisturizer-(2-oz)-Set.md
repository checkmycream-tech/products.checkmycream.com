<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Amir Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner are the best that I&#x27;ve used thus far. I used Amir products for about a year and they really helped curb the breakage and damage. I then switched to DermOrganic because I found a deal on it and it absolutely destroyed my hair! I mean spots were breaking off like CRAZY after all of the progress I had made using Amir. I hadn&#x27;t even dyed my hair in months! I quickly switched back to Amir shampoo and conditioner and my hair is finally repairing itself. Amir is the only way to go for me. As I said, not all sulfate-free argan oil shampoos and conditioners are created equally.</li>
    <li> When I tried using the Shampoo, Conditioner, and Moisturizer the first time I was dissatisfied. I waited 2 weeks  and tried agin, the results were the same. They just don&#x27;t work. My hair was dry than it was before. I can&#x27;t recommend these products to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wow came so fast...like next day and I didnt ask for that but not complaining! lol&lt;br /&gt;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff a GUY friend actually gave me a travel sized lotion to try and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone compliments the smell which to me reminds me of coconut oil or a tropical beach ...very yummy and attractive.</li>
    <li> The set not as described. There is NO small bottle (Travel Moisturizer) in the set!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the packaging is awful, never buy it for somebody as a gift, it looks like from bazaar</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Nice subtle scent.  Not drying.  My definite favorite shampoo and conditioner and the lotion is a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells incredible! I don&#x27;t know what it is about this smell but it is heavenly. The shampoo cleans well and lathers up a lot which is surprising for being sulfate free. I have very thick long hair and I have to use less of this shampoo than my normal drugstore brands. The conditioner isn&#x27;t as thick as I&#x27;m use to but again the smell is amazing and it does leave my hair feeling very soft. It was easy to brush through after I showered. I love their leave in treatment too so I would definitely recommend that to go with the Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Worth trying for some people I&#x27;m sure. Shampoo works differently for everyone! Great to try it if you want a decent sulfate free shampoo. I like the lotion that comes with it too, it smells great.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser has this in her salon and they got me hooked. I buy on here cause it&#x27;s SOOOO much cheaper then in the salon. I was using pureology but it was even more pricy and my ahir didn&#x27;t agree with it and after several years of trying different shampoos I stubled accross this at my hair dressers and decided to give it a try. I have very curly hair and with the florida humidity it goes frizzy as well and Amir actually helps it. I also have an awesome shine to it now. When I straighten my hair I also don&#x27;t have to use as much products as I&#x27;d normally have to with other shampoos. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, but it is pricy so I couldn&#x27;t buy them again when my kids were using them a lot!</li>
    <li> I really, really like this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair was looking a little tired from the winter.  This is not heavy, smells good, cleans hair without drying.  Will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> It smells so good without being to strong and makes my hair feel great! The lotion makes my skin feel so soft I buy the big bottle of that as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent products! I&#x27;ll keep buying these.</li>
    <li> Great service - Great product</li>
    <li> I have always noticed that when it comes to cosmetics and shampoos price is not always a good indicator of the quality.  My experiences seem to indicate that the cheaper products are usually much better than their more expensive counterparts.  The Amir Argan Oil Shampoo is in my opinion just adequate.  If you are looking for a good sulfate free shampoo with natural ingredients than this one gets the job done.  But I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the price.  It didn&#x27;t do anything outstanding for my hair.  It got it clean and that&#x27;s about it.  However, the conditioner is absolutely lousy.  It&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t use any conditioner at all.  It left my hair a dry, unruly, frizzy mess! It is a real waste of money.  I had to use a great deal of the stuff and even then it did nothing.  The pumper also didn&#x27;t work.  For $13 bucks it should have. I get much better results from the my cheaper Herbal Essence and Pantene conditioners.  I will have to give the rest of the conditioner to my sister who doesn&#x27;t need it as much.  I would give the shampoo 3 stars and the conditioner 1 star -hence my 2 star rating for the two of them together.</li>
    <li> My hair is thriving with this set. I love it. I alternate using it with Acure Organics Mint Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. Both use Argan Oil. Both feel awesome. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> A nice alternative to the more expensive argan oil shampoos/conditioners.  For the price, and the quality, well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best Shampoo and Conditioner I have ever used. I take meds for hypothyroidism so my hair&lt;br /&gt;is always very dry. This stuff is great could actually comb my hair out and it&#x27;s shoulder length. The smell&lt;br /&gt;is awesome!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price, super fast delivery.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I think everyone needs to stop buying those cheapo store brand shampoos!  It&#x27;s killing our hair.  Get rid of the sulfates and other junk, add something good like keratin and argan oil and you will see results.  This shampoo and condition made my hair feel soft and healthy.  A true relief after years of fighting frizz, damage, and split ends.  Bonus:  The free travel size moisturizer included smells and feels heavenly on the skin! I will be buying more of all of it.</li>
    <li> This leaves my grey hair in wonderful condition and looking better than ever. It is shiny and smooth, without dangerous additives. I would say, however that the lotion, even though it is wonderful smelling and very moisturizing, contains aluminum starch, I assume it is small in quantity. But it would be better, imo, if it didn&#x27;t contain any aluminum.</li>
    <li> My mother has shingles on her scalp and forehead. I&#x27;m giving this a try in an effort to soothe the dryness that results from the break out and healing process of her shingles.</li>
    <li> My family has now gone through two sets of this shampoo and conditioner.  I purchased the set for $18.  If it was still $18 I would consider buying it again for my other family members who still like it.  For me, it&#x27;s a little too perfumed.  I smell the scent of coconut all day long and that&#x27;s not really what I want to be smelling.  I rarely wear perfume but when I do I want that to be the only scent I smell, not coconut from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the two sellers selling this have changed the MSRP repeatedly, raising it upward with the number of reviews.  At $9 per bottle it was okay.  At $13 per bottle I can find something much better at my grocery store in the health food aisle and it will be organic and perfume-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the $26 they&#x27;re asking I could buy 2- 2 ounce bottles of GloNaturals 100% organic argan oil (vitacost) and add that to my conditioner and shampoo when I want to with plenty left for other uses.</li>
    <li> Great product, great smell, great texture. I love the Amir products they are great. And the packaging is convenient for shower too.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Great to rotate in a couple of times a week but I have fine hair and it starts to get limp after a few days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the lotion before and always wanted to find more. I dont&#x27;t know how well the shampoo is working for me. Hasn&#x27;t really managed my hair with a few uses. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I have an oily scalp and wavy hair, and this product is effectively cleans my hair and scalp without drying it out or flattening my waves and curls. My hair always feels healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product !!!! I cannot say enough good things about this. I have had so many people ask me what I am using on my hair. Could see a difference after only a few days. I have long thick color treated hair and this works wonders on it !!!!</li>
    <li> This line is fantastic for my hair type. I have very fine hair which &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34; in humidity and &amp;#34;hangs&amp;#34; in dry weather. Not sure if this product is great for other hair types as well but I consider it to be an excellent value. Have used really expensive products (e.g. Kerastase) and, again - for me, this performs at that level for a fraction of the price. I just worry about it being discontinued - it is not easy to find. I also love their skin care products.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have frizzy hair..usually.  I had a Brazilian Blowout about 6 mos. ago, &amp; started using this when my BB was &#x27;gone,&#x27; and seriously love this more.  My hair is so soft, and frizz free. Smells wonderfull, too.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a little frizz taming. Seems great for the price, too.</li>
    <li> This purchase was a good experience for me.  My hair is soft and feels clean.  I also use Argan oil on my hair when it is still wet which really has helped soften my hair...I highly recommend it.  The shampoo lathered nicely.  The conditioner did not leave that \\&quot;too slippery to be good for you\\&quot; feel that cheaper ones do but that is to be expected as I understand.  But neither did it tangle or dry my hair out.  I like it a lot.  I do use twice as much conditioner than shampoo but I have longer hair and I have always used twice as much conditioner than shampoo with whatever hair products I have used.  The pump did not work on the conditioner when I received it and Big deal beauty replaced it for free with no questions asked...great customer service.  I plan to buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Works really well on my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Loved it after first use, soft, shiny hair. No frizz but let&#x27;s my natural curl softly do it&#x27;s thing. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot, a simple dab will do you.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it is sulfate free. With that said it still lathers up, less than sulfate type shampoo but cleans hair very well. It has a great scent that lasts all day. I have fine hair - lots of it, I had less tangled hair to comb out after my shower. I have blonde highlights that are really dry and lots of breakage. This shampoo, conditioner and oil spray really did leave my hair shiny and it smoothed my breakage mess.  I also used this on my niece who is mixed, African American &amp; Caucasian, with natural banana curls. It left her hair manageable to comb out and shiny without weighing it down. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product my hair is really soft and shine.</li>
    <li> I love the look and feel of my hair when using this product.  An added bonus is the Keratin which provides some straightening to my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil.  I LOVE ARGAN OIL!!! I have tried at least 6 different argan oil shampoo/conditioner combos and AMIR ARGAN OIL SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER IS THE BEST OF THEM ALL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my dry, frizzy hair glowing w/shine and feeling clean (not greasy) and the smell is heavenly, but not too strong.  The bonus travel moisturizer is ALWAYS kept in my purse for use 2-3 times daily, as I have dry skin to match my dry hair. This argan oil set is for anyone who loves argan oil and wants just the right amount in their hair and on their body - AWESOME PRODUCTS!!!</li>
    <li> My hair LOVES this stuff. I was looking for a sulfur free shampoo and conditioner and this crossed my path. I am African american and my hair can get pretty dry so I needed something that would give me some good moisture. When i washed and conditioned my hair with this my hair felt really moisturized. My hair really loves this.</li>
    <li> Really makes my hair shine and look healthy. Have had trouble for years with thinning hair and this product makes it fuller</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling dry and looking frizzy.  Not what I would expect of an Argan Oil product. Unfortunately, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to recommend it to anyone, especially if they have dry hair.</li>
    <li> DIDNT LIKE THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Product arrived early and well-packaged/cushioned/taped. I love this hair product. Makes your hair feel clean, moisturized, any no issues with build up or a heavy residue feeling.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent however the top of the shampoo bottle does not work. I have to twist cap off every time. Conditioner works fine.&lt;br /&gt;Speedy delivery which is great</li>
    <li> I am a older generation black woman who has been wearing my hair without chemicals for over 10 yrs. i have tried numerous products that work well with dry, brittle, graying hair. This product is like Eureka to my hair. My hair is ggot back some of it&#x27;s youthful spring after just one usuage. The price is well worth it. I will definately reorder and recommend this to all my friends. Keep up the good work!!!!!</li>
    <li> second time ive  bought this set.  i really only needed the conditioner again but couldnt find seperatly so i bought the whole thing.  i like it a lot and its great for my hair.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews, I decided to try this shampoo/conditioner set. The shampoo is ok. I have long, thick hair and the shampoo is highly concentrated so I didn&#x27;t need to use much. My only complaint is that the pumper on the bottle didn&#x27;t work. The conditioner was a total waste of money for me. Since my hair is dry, I need a good conditioner and this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me....unless I used 3 handfuls of the stuff. Would not purchase this set again.</li>
    <li> No suds so it&#x27;s weird at first but love it</li>
    <li> Would have been 5 stars had they remembered the free trial size moisturizer. I really like this shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ll order it again</li>
    <li> I Love this shampoo OMG, so moisturizing anf magnificent!  But a little too pricey for the size. Which forced me to buy another brand.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo. Argan oil works really well in my hair and this is a good brand. Makes it soft and no chemicals. I like this brand even better than the Maple Holistics. They also sent a new travel conditioner when the other one broke. Thank you! Good Customer Service!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful !!  I noticed after only 2 shampoos that my hair was softer, shiner and more manageable.  Amazon has the best price and super fast delivery. Several of my friends are using this now and love it also.  Never going back to regular shampoo ...</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago hoping that it would be perfect for my hair. I have hair that is over processed and has been chemically treated many times. This in mind, my hair is dry and brittle. I was hoping that this product would provide my hair with much needed moisture and protein.  this was not the case. The shampoo stripped my hair very badly. It dried out my hair more than any other shampoo I have ever tried. The conditioner was not much better than the conditioner I had already been buying at the local drugstore. The lotion that comes free with the set was amazing. Sadly this was my favorite part. Maybe this set would work better for somebody else&#x27;s hair, but all of mine definitely went to waste.</li>
    <li> Leave hair soft and shiny --- foams up very easily with a lovely earth aroma.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but this is the second time that I have received a bottle that the dispenser does not work.</li>
    <li> I love the Amir Argan products - have had great results with the shampoo and conditioner, along with the lotion. delivered as promised!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about this product. I have sensitive scalp, and this one tends to make my scalp itch and flake. It also doesn&#x27;t really make my hair that soft. I much prefer Renpure (http://www.amazon.com/Renpure-Originals-Argan-Shampoo-Ounce/dp/B005I0JWGK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_12?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1363906229&amp;sr&#x3D;8-12&amp;keywords&#x3D;argan+oil+shampoo).</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on me, and I fell in love at the time so I ordered this set. At first things seemed to work great. My hair smelled wonderful, it was lustrous, smooth, and a lot less frizzy, and even my dandruff seemed to be under control. For further info, I am mixed (half Asian, half Caucasian) and my hair is slightly wavy. When dried naturally, it tends to be a little puffy and frizzy, while the next day it lies flat and lifeless. This combo seemed to cure all that for a time, however, the scent at some point disappeared completely and started to smell like nothing. When dried naturally, there was no smell at all. My hair began to feel flat and lifeless once more, even more so than it had. It also felt as if I gathered a lot of scalp build up, for when I would scratch my head, even the slightest scratch, a lot of gunk would be caked under my finger nail. SO, this product is definitely not for me. It does work well, but it didn&#x27;t last in my case.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair feels so healthy. I thought I would use it up qickly for the size bottle you get but it has been about a month and still have a half a bottle of each. I recommend getting this.</li>
    <li> Loved the product, but did not like how fast it was gone. I have long hair and the required amount of pumps for my hair was not sufficient.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and live in Texas where it can be fairly humid.  I have always battled frizzy hair, and this shampoo &amp; conditioner are perfect for my hair!!  On very humid days when I know my hair will be extra frizzy, I condition my hair and only partially rinse it out.  The conditioner totally helps my frizz, and it&#x27;s not too heavy or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; when I do this.  Definitely recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice now; it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great set and excellent price.  I purchased this shampoo wanting to see what Aragan Oil is all about.  I am a definite fan.  I have dyed hair and the set contains no sulfate and doesn&#x27;t cause any fading.  The scent is soft and a little bit earthy. It is a very clean scent.  I must say the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather all that well.  The conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem like it works in the shower but when I comb my long hair out, there are hardly any tangles.  Because of my oily scalp, I wash my hair daily with this shampoo. I recommend everyone Amir Aragan Oil and I will continue to buy this as part of my shower regimen.</li>
    <li> Took my dry ends and over styled hair from drab to fab. So soft and shinny.  Not oily or weighed down at all.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> This duo was a huge disappointment. The shampoo seemed ok. Not good, but not terrible. The conditioner was not very thick and left my hair looking as though I hadn&#x27;t used conditioner at all. My hair had never been that dry before. Split ends were sticking up everywhere. I&#x27;m being kind by leaving 2 stars instead of 1 but the shampoo didn&#x27;t really bother me as much as the &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ll throw it a bone. I&#x27;m returning the set since there&#x27;s no way I want my hair looking this bad till the bottles are empty. Also, I&#x27;ve been noticing in reviews, as well as my experience, that many &#x27;salon-grade&#x27; shampoos and conditioners that are sold on Amazon aren&#x27;t legit and do not produce the salon-bought results. Perhaps this is the case here...</li>
    <li> Great smell and it lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> feels oily after washing, leaves a residue, smells good</li>
    <li> Has completed changed the character of my long hair for the better. No more frizzies, silken &amp; lustrous reminiscent  of my high school days. I would appreciate a leave in natural scent just for my feminine esthetics.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner!! Smells great, and leaves your hair super soft!! And the lotion smells great, want to purchase a large bottle.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, my highlights last so much longer and both of our hairs seems to be getting thicker! But it!</li>
    <li> I really like both shampoo and conditioner, smells very nice and seems gentle. The little lotion sample smells the same and feels good on your skin, not heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It has done wonders for my normally dry and frizzy hair.  I used to have such dry hair that it became so brittle and frizzy.  My hair also lacked any kind of healthy shine, instead it was a matte, monotone brown color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using this shampoo for about 6 months, and let me say it has changed my hair drastically, for the better.  My hair is healthy, soft, shiny and best of all, no more frizz.  This shampoo has many natural extracts other than the argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: -Moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;- Heals damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;-Smoothes hair&lt;br /&gt;-Has many natural oils/extracts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None!</li>
