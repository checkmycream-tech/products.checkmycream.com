### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They no longer bother me when I walk and they look and feel wonderful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The moisturizing gel that is on the inside of these heel socks smells wonderful!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They leave no marks or moisture rings on your shoe, but they give your feet a perfect moisturizing treatment while you wear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
      <li>these will be perfect for you.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These Gel socks have a very pleasant smell and they are machine washable, which is great.</li>
      <li>I have used them now for about a week,  and truly have seen a great difference in my heels.  </li>
      <li>They have a gel lining in the heel of the sock which is great for protecting and cushioning your heels.  </li>
      <li>I love these!!  </li>
      <li>These are below ankle socks for optimum comfort.  </li>
      <li>you have petite feet and cracked heels, then these are probably a good product for you.</li>
      <li>They help to soften your heels and good for callused feet.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice way to keep lotion on tour heels while you sleep.  </li>
      <li>These are nice heels socks to moisturize those cracking winter heels.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Optimally, size-wise these would be best for the small to medium foot up to 8.5 size shoe at best.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a great idea, and I assumed that one size would fit most foot sizes:  </li>
      <li>This is a more effective treatment than just putting a cream on my feet without the gel socks.  </li>
      <li>and I found these socks very comfortable.</li>
      <li>certainly are much more attractive than orthopedic socks, but take note that if you have psoriasis or eczema, you should run the idea by your physician.  </li>
      <li>but they do a fantastic job at softening up your feet!</li>
      <li>The color is something I&#x27;d pick for myself, and the scent is lovely.  </li>
      <li>I think come winter, many people suffer from them.  </li>
      <li>If you want to wear them every night, I suggest you buy more than one pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t tolerate them on my feet more than about 15 minutes.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve sampled this seller&#x27;s gel socks and much more luck with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying this seller&#x27;s Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks, and I thought these heel socks might be better for the hotter summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The BelleSha moisturizing heel socks are perfect, but not for the larger foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>OK, up front, we were given these products from the manufacturer asking us to try them out and post a review.  </li>
      <li>Perfect overnight therapy for dry, cracked heels.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re nice and stretchy with no binding elastic ribbing, and they work well to get feet quickly moisturized.</li>
      <li>I received this product complimentary to try and provide my honest and unbiased opinion in return.</li>
      <li>I am thankful that I received a complimentary pair of these socks for an honest review.</li>
      <li>But with my size 8 feet I couldn&#x27;t really give them a good test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great way to make your feet look better for the summer months and get rid of those gross calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are actually very comfortable, and since I have hot feet, I am glad to have my toes</li>
      <li>These  little socks are perfect to help fight that  problem.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my heels.</li>
      <li>She said that the size of the socks didn&#x27;t bother her but the lack of gel in them and the packaging not being what was advertised were a HUGE issue for her.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Granted, my wife has fat feet, but they aren&#x27;t huge.</li>
      <li>I could notice a huge difference in my feet after just wearing these gel heel socks for one day.</li>
      <li>She says she can tell a difference with the skin on her heels, and that these are comfortable to wear and work like they are supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Snug fit is helpful for keeping the keep the heat and moisture inside the socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My socks were snug but they fit well.</li>
      <li>BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Heel Socks are lined with a silicone polymer gel that is ultra-moisturizing and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>You know, like socks normally fit up to a size 9.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable fit.</li>
      <li>, they work great, but if you have big feet or ankles, prepare for some discomfort.</li>
      <li>lining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been treating my heels right after a hot bath while the feet are still warm.  </li>
      <li>I am loving my new moisturizing gel heel socks from BelleSha.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for moisturizing dry, cracked skin on heels of your feet.  </li>
      <li>The gel socks are a special critter and work quite well, but the spa-like treatment is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>second night I wore these, I added my favorite moisturizing lotion, and the results were even better.</li>
      <li>: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While she said she liked wearing the socks, and felt they did do a good job repairing some of the feelings sje had with cracking of the dry skin on her heels, she would like to have had the socks be a little more comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>She must have found them fun, since when I walked in, she had the gel part stuck to my wall.</li>
      <li>Still, I could feel distinct moisturizing effect by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The design of them is nice - silicone gel that holds cream on your feet for a deep treatment.  </li>
      <li>I guess we all have fun with these the way we can.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have a problem but enjoy soft and smooth heel</li>
      <li>If your heels have a tendency to crack these socks are worth a try.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample to test for a review, and my heels are grateful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary pair of Moisturizing Gel Heel Socks for testing and review purposes.</li>
      <li>really think that BelleSha should be straightforward and state size on the product</li>
      <li>Easy to use, not messy or stinky.</li>
      <li>However I don&#x27;t think I would buy these as using some good moisturizing cream with tight fitting regular socks works just as well.  </li>
      <li>I then pulled the wider band on first.  </li>
      <li>Take a hot bath or shower, or soak your feet for a bit, apply lotion to your heels and put these on.</li>
      <li>far as fit, I wear an 8 wide, and these stretch onto my feet easily.</li>
      <li>people have never used real gel socks.</li>
      <li>The BELLESHA MOISTURIZING GEL HEEL SOCKS really do help in moisturizing a person’s heels.</li>
      <li>Overall, although the BELLESHA MOISTURIZING GEL HEEL SOCKS work, but they are not one size fit all.</li>
      <li>They stretch very well as I demonstrate in the video.</li>
      <li>I have been hand washing them with gentle soap and air drying.</li>
      <li>She takes a size 9 women&#x27;s shoe and these things were a real struggle to get on.</li>
      <li>They are made of a high quality stretchy material and are well stitched.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these gel heel socks.  </li>
      <li>interesting little note</li>
      <li>you do want a real spa-like treatment to get your feet soft, you can put some of your favorite moisturizing cream on, slip on the BellaSha Moisturizing Gel Heel Socks, leave them on for a few hours (or overnight).  </li>
      <li>She found it difficult to sleep at first, and was glad she had tried them on at first some time before sleeping with them her first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I believe many people have trouble with the heels of their foot, keeping them soft and without cracks leading to a lot of pain.  </li>
      <li>My daughter tried these for a couple of nights and reported that, while she wasn’t the biggest fan of them the first night, she changed her mind by the second, and has been wearing them on and off – as it were – ever since then.</li>
      <li>The fit was a bit tight, but it did go on and felt snug.  </li>
      <li>She said that they were not much easier to get on the second time, but she has either gotten better at them or else they have indeed gotten easier to put on from the third try</li>
      <li>- my young granddaughter found these sitting in my bathroom.</li>
      <li>A larger size might be mKe comfortable for larger feet - but for 30 minutes they are relatively comfy.</li>
      <li>and you will be surprised at the results.</li>
      <li>in all a decent experience, and the product worked…she just wished there were different</li>
      <li>If they were a little more accommodating for larger feet, they&#x27;d be a four or maybe even a five star product; but since they seem to be designed for a select size feet and not marketed that way, I can only give them three stars.</li>
      <li>did not report that feeling the following morning, but instead felt that there had been some positive effect upon her cracked heels the next morning…and it was a feeling</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not going to last forever, but the material is thick enough so that your own moisturizer won&#x27;t soak through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wear a size nine shoe (not wide) and boy, these were a bit of a struggle to get one.</li>
      <li>You just slip these heel socks over your bare feet so that the gel covers your heels.</li>
      <li>but actually they fit my feet quite well at least before washing.  </li>
      <li>These do help those with badly calloused heels, but they work better if you hit your heels with a pumice stone first.</li>
      <li>But even after stretching them as much as I could, they were just too tight and left indentations on my skin from the border elastic.&lt;br</li>

<li> My heels felt like a soft little baby</li>

<li> Leave them on overnight if you can tolerate them that long</li>
<li> She said she could feel a rather thick layer of moisturizer inside them, so much so that when she took them off rather soon afterward her feet “felt slippery.</li>

    <li> These do help those with badly calloused heels, but they work better if you hit your heels with a pumice stone first.</li>
    <li> I have a small foot, and I even have difficulty finding shoes in my size. So I was surprised to discover that these heel socks were much to tight around the just-before-your-toes section of the sock.  Although the gel section around the heel was nice and comfortable, the elastic ribbing around the foot was so uncomfortable that I was unable to wear longer than a couple of minutes.  I suspect these heel socks are missized for just about everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than deal with these uncomfortable socks, try the BelleShas Gel Socks.  They&#x27;re nice and stretchy with no binding elastic ribbing, and they work well to get feet quickly moisturized.</li>
    <li> I believe many people have trouble with the heels of their foot, keeping them soft and without cracks leading to a lot of pain.  Unfortunately as we age the problem truly becomes a concern, even problems with walking at times.  These  little socks are perfect to help fight that  problem. They only go on half of your foot, mainly targeting your heal, as that is the problem that is being dealt with.  I did not have any problem with the size of them, however I wear a size 51/2 shoe.  I can see where if your foot size is larger than a 6 you may have a tight fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Gel socks have a very pleasant smell and they are machine washable, which is great. I have used them now for about a week,  and truly have seen a great difference in my heels.  They no longer bother me when I walk and they look and feel wonderful. I am thankful that I received a complimentary pair of these socks for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I wear a size 9 shoe and when I first received these heel socks I thought they would be very uncomfortable but actually they fit my feet quite well at least before washing.  They do provide moisturizing for dried, cracked heels and in my case even some degree of comfort from the pain of plantar fasciitus.  However I don&#x27;t think I would buy these as using some good moisturizing cream with tight fitting regular socks works just as well.  I was given this item as a sample to review from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I received these just as sandal season started ... So my heals were not as bad as they have been. Still, I could feel distinct moisturizing effect by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second night I wore these, I added my favorite moisturizing lotion, and the results were even better. My heels felt like a soft little baby bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as fit, I wear an 8 wide, and these stretch onto my feet easily. They cover the heel, arch, and low ankle of my foot with the gel covering the heels only. They are actually very comfortable, and since I have hot feet, I am glad to have my toes open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are washable, I am hand washing mine. If you want to wear them every night, I suggest you buy more than one pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting little note - my young granddaughter found these sitting in my bathroom. She must have found them fun, since when I walked in, she had the gel part stuck to my wall. I guess we all have fun with these the way we can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample to test for a review, and my heels are grateful.</li>
    <li> At first, my wife thought the BelleSha Moisturizing Gel Heel Socks were too tight, but now, she says they are tight, but not too tight. She likes how they have been working. She says she can tell a difference with the skin on her heels, and that these are comfortable to wear and work like they are supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she would recommend them to others with dry heels who wanted some extra moisturizing for this area.</li>
    <li> OK, up front, we were given these products from the manufacturer asking us to try them out and post a review.  My wife has been using them, she has very dried out heels.  The fit was a bit tight, but it did go on and felt snug.  They worked well, they are moisturizing her heels and helping them to not crack as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They leave no marks or moisture rings on your shoe, but they give your feet a perfect moisturizing treatment while you wear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to giving these heel socks a try, since my heels are the driest, crackiest things on my body and I use cream on them almost every night.  I&#x27;ve been enjoying this seller&#x27;s Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks, and I thought these heel socks might be better for the hotter summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t tolerate them on my feet more than about 15 minutes.  The design of them is nice - silicone gel that holds cream on your feet for a deep treatment.  The outer layer keeps your cream from getting all over the bed, too.  The color is something I&#x27;d pick for myself, and the scent is lovely.  But even after stretching them as much as I could, they were just too tight and left indentations on my skin from the border elastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have smaller feet (size 5 or 6 I&#x27;m guessing) these will be perfect for you.  But with my size 8 feet I couldn&#x27;t really give them a good test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary pair of Moisturizing Gel Heel Socks for testing and review purposes.</li>
    <li> My daughter tried these for a couple of nights and reported that, while she wasn’t the biggest fan of them the first night, she changed her mind by the second, and has been wearing them on and off – as it were – ever since then. But the size were a continual problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said the socks were very hard to put on…her feet are about average sized or maybe a little bigger than average. She said that they were not much easier to get on the second time, but she has either gotten better at them or else they have indeed gotten easier to put on from the third try on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she didn’t like walking in them, she wore them primarily to sit around in pjs at night and to go to  bed with them on, and she said that they “felt weird,” but she did not dislike them. She said she could feel a rather thick layer of moisturizer inside them, so much so that when she took them off rather soon afterward her feet “felt slippery.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did not report that feeling the following morning, but instead felt that there had been some positive effect upon her cracked heels the next morning…and it was a feeling she had on the subsequent days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she said she liked wearing the socks, and felt they did do a good job repairing some of the feelings sje had with cracking of the dry skin on her heels, she would like to have had the socks be a little more comfortable to wear. She found it difficult to sleep at first, and was glad she had tried them on at first some time before sleeping with them her first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a decent experience, and the product worked…she just wished there were different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1V2XI0AD8YTQI]]I get cracks in my heels if I don&#x27;t moisturize them, and those cracks can be quite painful and difficult to heal.  The idea behind the heel socks is to provide cracked heels an intense moisturizing.  The inside of the heel sock is covered with a silicone skin (see attached video) and it keeps moisturizer from evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a small foot (I wear size 6.5 to 7 shoes) and I found these socks very comfortable. They are snug without being tight.  They stretch very well as I demonstrate in the video. Snug fit is helpful for keeping the keep the heat and moisture inside the socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning instructions say machine wash or hand wash. I have been hand washing them with gentle soap and air drying. I think hand washing will prolong the life of the silicone lining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been treating my heels right after a hot bath while the feet are still warm.  This is a more effective treatment than just putting a cream on my feet without the gel socks.  If your heels have a tendency to crack these socks are worth a try.  Even if you don&#x27;t have a problem but enjoy soft and smooth heel these socks give you the \\&quot;spa\\&quot; treatment at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review&lt;br /&gt;[sample provided for review]</li>
    <li> I think this is a great idea, and I assumed that one size would fit most foot sizes:  You know, like socks normally fit up to a size 9.  But, no way!  Not even close!  So disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping moisturizer on my heels is always a dilemma, I&#x27;m envious of those with small feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizing gel that is on the inside of these heel socks smells wonderful!  It&#x27;s not going to last forever, but the material is thick enough so that your own moisturizer won&#x27;t soak through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think that BelleSha should be straightforward and state size on the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from BelleSha</li>
    <li> These socks feel a little weird at first but they do a fantastic job at softening up your feet! I play ice hockey so my feet get abused and look terrible. This is a great way to make your feet look better for the summer months and get rid of those gross calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend wearing them with shoes or the will slide around a lot. I just wear them sitting in bed or on the couch</li>
    <li> These are regular socks with not a drop of gel. I should have bought the other pair. Checking to see if I can return these as I purchased based on reviews but these reviews are either fake or people have never used real gel socks.</li>
    <li> These were purchased for my mom.  She said that the size of the socks didn&#x27;t bother her but the lack of gel in them and the packaging not being what was advertised were a HUGE issue for her.  She is very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these!!  After reading some of the reviews, I was afraid they would not fit because I wear a women&#x27;s size 11 shoe, but I&#x27;ve had no problem.  I like putting them on before I goto bed.  I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my heels.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife, who has dry, cracked heels. After wearing them 3x/week for a month, she has noticed that her heels are much softer (not perfect, but definitely an improvement). She still wears them once or twice a week. The main problem, though, is that they&#x27;re extremely difficult for her to put on. She has wears a size 10 1/2 shoe, and these just aren&#x27;t big enough. Plus, the texture of the gel makes it even harder to pull over the heel and into place. Once she gets them on, she can only wear them for 10-15 minutes because she&#x27;s afraid they are cutting off her circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, they work great, but if you have big feet or ankles, prepare for some discomfort.</li>
    <li> I am loving my new moisturizing gel heel socks from BelleSha.  These are the cutest two tone blue and white socks.  They are made of a high quality stretchy material and are well stitched.  They have a gel lining in the heel of the sock which is great for protecting and cushioning your heels.  This product is great for moisturizing dry, cracked skin on heels of your feet.  After your shower or bath, apply your moisturizing lotion, then wear the gel heel socks for 30-60 minutes.  They help to soften your heels and good for callused feet.  It is a nice way to keep lotion on tour heels while you sleep.  I highly recommend these gel heel socks.  I received this product complimentary to try and provide my honest and unbiased opinion in return.</li>
    <li> My feet callous often and sometimes the heels crack quite badly. Therefore, when I had the opportunity to try a pair of the BELLESHA MOISTURIZING GEL HEEL SOCKS I couldn’t pass it up. You just slip these heel socks over your bare feet so that the gel covers your heels. If you would like, you can wear other socks over the heel socks. The BELLESHA MOISTURIZING GEL HEEL SOCKS really do help in moisturizing a person’s heels. I could notice a huge difference in my feet after just wearing these gel heel socks for one day. With that said, the socks can be incredibly difficult to get on. I wear a size 9 ½ W shoe and these socks were very tight on my feet. They were so tight that despite the benefit and help it gave to my feet, I stopped wearing them after two days because they were so tight they started to cut the circulation in my feet. Overall, although the BELLESHA MOISTURIZING GEL HEEL SOCKS work, but they are not one size fit all. I’d only recommend them for people with smaller feet. I received a pair of these BELLESHA MOISTURIZING GEL HEEL SOCKS from the manufacturer to examine and possibly review.</li>
    <li> They are a little too small and cut off my circulation, but they work.  Wish they were made bigger.</li>
    <li> The BelleSha moisturizing socks were provided to me for review. I have extremely dry heels, but thank goodness for heeltastic! Still, I felt an extra boost could be helpful. The socks went on, but they are tight! I wear a size nine shoe (not wide) and boy, these were a bit of a struggle to get one. Once on though, they did boost the heelstastic and my heels were smoother than ever. I would use these, but If you were over an 8 or 9 they are going to be snug to say the least.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo138ZNFCM2IHSV]]The BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Heel Socks are lined with a silicone polymer gel that is ultra-moisturizing and comfortable.  These are nice heels socks to moisturize those cracking winter heels.  I think come winter, many people suffer from them.  A little prevention can go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice, is that the elasticized bands are slightly different widths.  In other words, before you even try to put them on, line them up to one another and you can see the difference.  I then pulled the wider band on first.  They went on with no difficulty and were quite comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optimally, size-wise these would be best for the small to medium foot up to 8.5 size shoe at best.  These are below ankle socks for optimum comfort.  They don&#x27;t slip down when worn and because of the gel lining and don&#x27;t slip around on the foot.  The BelleSha moisturizing heel socks are perfect, but not for the larger foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They certainly are much more attractive than orthopedic socks, but take note that if you have psoriasis or eczema, you should run the idea by your physician.  They do make my feet feel softer, but sweaty feeling after a while.  The gel socks are a special critter and work quite well, but the spa-like treatment is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do want a real spa-like treatment to get your feet soft, you can put some of your favorite moisturizing cream on, slip on the BellaSha Moisturizing Gel Heel Socks, leave them on for a few hours (or overnight).  They really are an effective way to soften up your heels and definitely help with that annoying and painful cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> These help keep lotion on the heels without having to kick your feet up and wait. A larger size might be mKe comfortable for larger feet - but for 30 minutes they are relatively comfy. I would not want to wear these overnight.</li>
    <li> These do what they are intended to do, if you can get them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, my wife has fat feet, but they aren&#x27;t huge. She takes a size 9 women&#x27;s shoe and these things were a real struggle to get on. Once they were on, they were uncomfortably tight and she ended up removing them eventually. We&#x27;ve sampled this seller&#x27;s gel socks and much more luck with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have petite feet and cracked heels, then these are probably a good product for you. Take a hot bath or shower, or soak your feet for a bit, apply lotion to your heels and put these on. Leave them on overnight if you can tolerate them that long and you will be surprised at the results. If they were a little more accommodating for larger feet, they&#x27;d be a four or maybe even a five star product; but since they seem to be designed for a select size feet and not marketed that way, I can only give them three stars. If BelleSha relists these and labels them as size small or medium, then they would merit a higher rating.</li>
    <li> Perfect overnight therapy for dry, cracked heels. Easy to use, not messy or stinky. Comfortable fit.</li>
    <li> My socks were snug but they fit well. I wear a size 6.5 but the two pairs I ordered had NO GEL LINING. They are just toe-less socks!</li>
