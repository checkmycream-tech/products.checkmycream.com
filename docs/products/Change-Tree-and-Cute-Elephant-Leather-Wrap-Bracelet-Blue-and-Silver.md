      <li>she loved it and for the price you can get many for your friends.</li>
      <li>Made a nice gift.  </li>
      <li>cute, nice design as pictured</li>
      <li>I am very happy there at multiple spots to clip on</li>
      <li>Its adorable.</li>
      <li>The picture makes it look way better.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered several of these, and the price is great too!</li>
      <li>When I received it, I was surprised by how good it was made!</li>
      <li>good deal for the money shipped fast too</li>
      <li>If the clasp breaks it&#x27;s an extremely easy fix with some patience, two minutes, and pliers</li>
      <li>My order came very quickly and I like this bracelet.</li>
      <li>My two daughters loved it and they are in high school there</li>
      <li>I like the charms but the strings don&#x27;t feel strong and many wear out quickly.  </li>
      <li>and you will be fine.  </li>
      <li>Will gladly buy more from them ;)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super cute</li>
      <li>This little bracelet is perfect for the summer</li>
      <li>but it was cheap</li>
      <li>It takes forever to get this bracelet, bu well worth the wait!</li>
      <li>My daughter gave this to her Mamaw as a something special gift.</li>
      <li>Her Mamaw loved it, not only because it was from her granddaughter, but also because she loves elephants.</li>
      <li>so it is NOT a one size fits all which I really love because the ones that stretch are more likely to break than these with clasps.</li>
      <li>Also the back has multiple loops in the chain so you can pick the size that fits best</li>
      <li>very cute recommend this to all who are spiritual.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>All findings are firmly attached, very nice quality.</li>
      <li>they are very cuite!</li>
      <li>was the chain that the clasp hooked onto broke the first time I wore it</li>
      <li>it came within the date it was supposed to and looks exactly how it is supposed to.</li>
      <li>After the first two days it falls apart.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It was exactly as described although a better quality than expected.  </li>
      <li>I think because some people just like to complain haha</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know why people are complaining.</li>
      <li>I love how they over lap each other with charms &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>Very cheap for a reason, but is is still not worth it.</li>
      <li>The metal does rust over time but what else can you expect when you are paying a few bucks for a cute bracelet?  </li>
      <li>I bought this as a present for my daughter and it arrived in a decent amount of time considering it was an over sea shipment.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be nice and tight and stay in place, but the last hook to latch it onto does not make it right enough, and my wrists are of average size so it is simply an issue with the way the bracelet was made.</li>
      <li>I love the way the bracelet looks, but my only complaint is that it is too big.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super stylish and the only bad think I have to say about it</li>

    <li> This little bracelet is perfect for the summer it looks kinda  beachie! you can also wear this as an anklet too. it has the tree of life and infinity and elephant w/trunk up which is considered good luck. very cute recommend this to all who are spiritual.</li>
    <li> I like the charms but the strings don&#x27;t feel strong and many wear out quickly.  It is a nice bracelet and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for a friend and she absolutely loved it! good deal for the money shipped fast too</li>
    <li> Beautiful, and very very cute piece! It was all I expected it, it is same as shown in the picture. Will gladly buy more from them ;)</li>
    <li> This bracelet is even more beautiful in person than in the photo.  Everyone comments on it.  All findings are firmly attached, very nice quality.</li>
    <li> After the first two days it falls apart. Very cheap for a reason, but is is still not worth it.</li>
    <li> Bracelet broke after 1 hour of wearing it.  Not impressed with how cheaply made it was. Don&#x27;t recommend it people.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this! I really don&#x27;t know why people are complaining. I think because some people just like to complain haha I recommend this to anyone who likes this sort of style. Also the back has multiple loops in the chain so you can pick the size that fits best so it is NOT a one size fits all which I really love because the ones that stretch are more likely to break than these with clasps. If the clasp breaks it&#x27;s an extremely easy fix with some patience, two minutes, and pliers (;</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. The picture makes it look way better.  The bracelet is too big for a petite hand and falls of. The pieces come out of the clips.</li>
    <li> My order came very quickly and I like this bracelet. I would have rated it a five, but it is hard to get on. I would have prefered it if it tied on but it is made of some sort of vinyl so that wouldn&#x27;t have worked. I thought it would be made with thread like the friendship bracelets. I do wear it a lot</li>
    <li> My daughter gave this to her Mamaw as a something special gift. Her Mamaw loved it, not only because it was from her granddaughter, but also because she loves elephants.</li>
    <li> It takes forever to get this bracelet, bu well worth the wait! I have ordered several of these, and the price is great too!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I loved the elephant on it. I am very happy there at multiple spots to clip on so i can adjust the size. Cant wait to go out and wear it.</li>
    <li> I love the way the bracelet looks, but my only complaint is that it is too big. I thought it would be nice and tight and stay in place, but the last hook to latch it onto does not make it right enough, and my wrists are of average size so it is simply an issue with the way the bracelet was made. That being said, I got used to it and I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth the wait.  The metal does rust over time but what else can you expect when you are paying a few bucks for a cute bracelet?  Order it way before you may need it and you will be fine.  Its adorable.</li>
    <li> I Love this bracelet! I constantly get compliments on it. When I received it, I was surprised by how good it was made!</li>
    <li> It busted within a few days. Very disappointed in the quality but then I only paid a few bucks for it. I got what I paid for,</li>
    <li> Great experience ordering this bracelet. It was exactly as described although a better quality than expected.  Made a nice gift.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My two daughters loved it and they are in high school there friends now want one so they can all match</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my daughter and it arrived in a decent amount of time considering it was an over sea shipment. Quality is great. Of course can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This bracelet it&#x27;s super cute it came within the date it was supposed to and looks exactly how it is supposed to. It&#x27;s super stylish and the only bad think I have to say about it was the chain that the clasp hooked onto broke the first time I wore it but I just hook it onto a farther down clasp.</li>
    <li> she loved it and for the price you can get many for your friends. they are very cuite! I love how they over lap each other with charms &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> cute, nice design as pictured, my son pulled on it and it broke... but it was cheap so I cannot complain. Get what you pay for...</li>
