      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Works great!  </li>
      <li>Not that impressive with looks, but works great.  </li>
      <li>Takes flossing from being a hassle to almost enjoyable!  </li>
      <li>really liked the Dolphin Flosser by GUM</li>
      <li>Pay attention to how to thread it and the floss stays nicely tight/taut.</li>
      <li>Of its kind, and at this price, the best I have tried so far.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love this flosser!  </li>
      <li>It holds the floss very securely and maintains the tension while you&#x27;re flossing.</li>
      <li>I like the storage aspect of this floss holder compared to most.</li>
      <li>box of Reach floss didn&#x27;t fit in it so it won&#x27;t take just any popular floss as a refill like they claim.</li>
      <li>Compared to &amp;#34;Dental Flosser 900 Uses,&amp;#34; this is the better choice.</li>
      <li>I wanted an all in one product, easy to load and easy to apply, and I think this has every thing I wanted.</li>
      <li>how easy it is to use and that I can use it anytime and anywhere.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t like the way it crimps the used side of the floss on top of the fresh floss feeding in.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t need to buy special spindle sizes.</li>
      <li>The only thing good about this is that it&#x27;s refillable, in theory anyway,</li>
      <li>i have MS and trouble using my hands, this is great.</li>
      <li>Also, because of its nice design, the product seems to last for years, without loosing its functionality.</li>
      <li>A great way to get back to regular flossing.</li>
      <li>Will save you a pretty penny to boot.  </li>
      <li>Works just exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s very convenient that way.</li>
      <li>I really like the fact that it has the floss already in it</li>
      <li>This can&#x27;t be very sanitary.</li>
      <li>I find this flosser the most convenient one I have ever used, and I use less floss with this applicator than ever before.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it for kids.  </li>
      <li>The benefit is that it holds the floss very tightly so normal use won&#x27;t loosen it.</li>
      <li>Keeps the floss neatly contained in the holder, you can advance new floss</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use as it has the teeth mechanism inside the holder to hold the floss tight.</li>
      <li>Better than flossing by hand but still clumsy compared to a flosser with a longer narrower handle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble remembering how to do it.</li>
      <li>This is the unit I&#x27;ve been looking for to replace an old one no longer in production.</li>
      <li>Use it every night with my 4 year old son.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;THERE IS NO OTHER PRODUCT LIKE IT.</li>
      <li>apparently - I haven&#x27;t tried to replace the spool yet).  </li>
      <li>This unit holds a whole spool of floss and presents a single strand gripped in prongs that are well spaced to allow reaching all the way to back teeth.</li>
      <li>I bought one and later I bought another because there is no other product like it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little bulky at first</li>

    <li> I find this flosser the most convenient one I have ever used, and I use less floss with this applicator than ever before.</li>
    <li> This floss holder is well made. I really like the fact that it has the floss already in it - it&#x27;s very convenient that way. It just a bit too big for my mouth.</li>
    <li> Works great! A little trouble threading floss .It keeps the floss real tight..And you use only one hand to floss.</li>
    <li> This unit holds a whole spool of floss and presents a single strand gripped in prongs that are well spaced to allow reaching all the way to back teeth. It holds the floss very securely and maintains the tension while you&#x27;re flossing. When you&#x27;re ready to advance to a new section of the floss, the procedure isn&#x27;t entirely obvious until you read the instructions, but there&#x27;s nothing difficult about it.

    <li> made of plastic , the hinge failed after 1 week of use.  The holder will not hold floss tightly if the hinge is not intact.  Poor materials, bad hinge design.  I would not buy another one made this same way.</li>
    <li> this was ordered with a handicap person in mind,  she was not able to use it and was very disapointed.</li>
    <li> Uses very little floss (does that make me a \\&quot;string saver\\&quot;?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way I can use this away from home, during the work day, and not have to get my hands in my mouth and deal with all that business.  Pay attention to how to thread it and the floss stays nicely tight/taut.</li>
    <li> I like the storage aspect of this floss holder compared to most. It was the ability to hold it that led me to purchase this one as opposed to the other styles that you just wrap the floss onto which seems like to me is a waste of floss to some degree. My only gripe is the lack of an option to select a color, I got pink which is pretty terrible as I had hoped for blue. Assuming this lasts long term I can&#x27;t see any reasons not to like it. The included floss is perhaps thin or of a slightly lower quality than I would prefer but it still does the job well enough no loss of a star from me over that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a replacement for the sadly discontinued Glide Floss stick and this comes close.  More complicated to thread, but it uses regular floss spools (apparently - I haven&#x27;t tried to replace the spool yet).  A great way to get back to regular flossing.</li>
    <li> It was always difficult for me to floss, and I do not like the products that are only a floss handle. I wanted an all in one product, easy to load and easy to apply, and I think this has every thing I wanted. Also, because of its nice design, the product seems to last for years, without loosing its functionality.</li>
    <li> Use it every night with my 4 year old son.  Works great!  Not that impressive with looks, but works great.  Highly recommend it for kids.  Plus, you can re-fill it with regular floss -- don&#x27;t need to buy special spindle sizes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product two years ago. I bought one and later I bought another because there is no other product like it. The advantage of this product is it holds your floss and dispenses floss as you need. It is not an floss HANDLE which requires you to store your additional floss somewhere else. This product lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use as it has the teeth mechanism inside the holder to hold the floss tight. It is an all in one flossing tool. You will get use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THERE IS NO OTHER PRODUCT LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> Better than flossing by hand but still clumsy compared to a flosser with a longer narrower handle. The floss it comes with was terrible. It splits and frays and actually broke once before I threw it out. I also don&#x27;t like the way it crimps the used side of the floss on top of the fresh floss feeding in. This can&#x27;t be very sanitary. The only thing good about this is that it&#x27;s refillable, in theory anyway, so you&#x27;re not throwing out a plastic clip everytime you use it. However, the ubiquitous flat 50 yd. box of Reach floss didn&#x27;t fit in it so it won&#x27;t take just any popular floss as a refill like they claim. I did manage to pry open one of those small, coin sized sample packs you get at the dentist to give me just enough floss until I replace the the Gripit with something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the Dolphin Flosser by GUM but for some unexplained reason they stopped making it. I&#x27;ll be tossing this one in the trash and trying something else.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this flosser!  Keeps the floss neatly contained in the holder, you can advance new floss so you don&#x27;t have to hold on to used floss with your hands and you don&#x27;t have to wrench your hands into your mouth. I have all of my wisdom teeth and reaching back there to floss around them can be a pain, but with this little gadget I can easliy reach back there without having to engluf my hands! I take this little baby and floss while watching tv or even while lying in bed. Takes flossing from being a hassle to almost enjoyable!  My dentist and hygenist are always complimenting me on my &amp;#34;healthy gum tissue&amp;#34; and I know it&#x27;s because of this little flosser and how easy it is to use and that I can use it anytime and anywhere. The only thing I would improve would be to make the product itself a bit slimmer and the floss prongs little longer.  It&#x27;s a little bulky at first but once you get used to manuvering it around your mouth this becomes less of an issue.</li>
