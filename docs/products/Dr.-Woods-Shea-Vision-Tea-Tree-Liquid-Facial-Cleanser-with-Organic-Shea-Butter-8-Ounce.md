      <li>Interesting scent too-</li>
      <li>I love all of Dr Wood&#x27;s products.  </li>
      <li>But, this being said this has to be one of the best facial cleansers I have ever used.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean and smells really good (like a clean earthy smell).</li>

      <li>I am so happy, I am ordering a second bottle so that I have one upstairs and downstairs.  </li>
      <li>very earthy and nice.</li>
      <li>since this is a natural occuring substance , people think its a good product for acne.</li>
      <li>Okay, not as good as other Dr Woods products.</li>
      <li>, if you&#x27;re looking for a nice, natural solution for acne and oil prone skin, check this stuff out.</li>
      <li>a couple days after I began using it, but this is a good thing, because it means that what was deep in my skin was coming to the surface and my pores were getting declogged/decongested.  </li>
      <li>makes my face so smooth, now i ordered the body wash as well, mentioned to my friend who bought for her son with acne problem and it cleared it right up</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I will try other Dr. Woods products too, because of the great experience and ingredients.</li>
      <li>I got it quickly.</li>
      <li>Great vegan product, makes my skin feel clean and firm.</li>
      <li>Let me first start by saying I have tried EVERYTHING!</li>
      <li>and I do love the effects of tea tree oil as an antibiotic that is from natural sources.</li>
      <li>I love this all natural cleanser.</li>
      <li>This stuff helps keep my face clear, keeps my face from getting more oily, and keeps my face feeling fresh longer.  </li>
      <li>But after use my skin definitely looks and feels clean, and the tea tree oil makes it a refreshing wash.  </li>
      <li>I noticed an improvement right away in the clarity of my skin</li>
      <li>I was nervous about it at first because o have oily skin and been avoiding using any oils on my skin, but I used it and fell in love this face wash has been keeping my face clear of acne.</li>
      <li>when I get my monthly hormonal acne it clears it up super fast</li>
      <li>I have really been getting into more natural skin care products, so when I saw this</li>
      <li>works well, leaves skin feeling clean but not dried out</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m back to having nice clear skin.</li>
      <li>at first it seems like this really works.</li>
      <li>Gentle enough yet leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>it may work on certain face types , but not all.</li>
      <li>Did not feel like it was cleaning my face and has a very slipper feel to it.</li>
      <li>I really like.this face wash</li>
      <li>and I REALLY LIKE the tea tree oil in</li>
      <li>and I have to buy it twice as fast.</li>
      <li>Works very well with my skin .</li>
      <li>It really helps keep oil in check</li>
      <li>Very deceiving</li>
      <li>I have combination skin and it has kind of dried out some of my skin</li>
      <li>Your face feels nice and clean after using it, but not too dry and tight.</li>
      <li>Not too sweet and definitely not flowery.</li>
      <li>I was a little worried when I first tried it out because it feels oily, but I assume that the oiliness of the product is fine for your skin, because I haven&#x27;t gotten pimples from using it.</li>
      <li>i kept going for a few more days</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s loaded with extra ingredients vs just the pure Castile soap with tea tree!</li>
      <li>it smells medicated, and the first thing you think is this will possibly work.</li>
      <li>It really cleans and helps regulate oil production, leaves skin soft, not dry.  </li>
      <li>It lasts a pretty long time, and I use it morning and night.</li>
      <li>While that helped, nothing has helped as much as this facial wash.</li>
      <li>, I use it on my 8 year old daughter as well.</li>
      <li>It foams nicely and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I love the product but the picture showed this green lable and a red labeled bottle appearing that you would get a set of bottles</li>
      <li>I have no breakouts of new acne since starting using this.</li>
      <li>Wow will by again in the near future</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any major difference using it in skin condition.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this cleanser. Gentle enough yet leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Okay, not as good as other Dr Woods products.</li>
    <li> Really nice face cleanser with Tea Tree to help fight bacteria, germs and pimples. My complexion has never been nicer!</li>
    <li> I love this all natural cleanser. You only need to use a dab of it so the bottle lasts forever!  The price is great! This product is definitely a MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and it has kind of dried out some of my skin but I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts in my prone zones either. I think with the addition of a moisturizer this would be fab.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this with the Zia Skin Basics Aloe Toner and I&#x27;ve been told my skin looks evener and clear.&lt;br /&gt;I guess its working!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. My only complain is that my wife keeps using it and I have to buy it twice as fast. Other than that it&#x27;s great. I was a little worried when I first tried it out because it feels oily, but I assume that the oiliness of the product is fine for your skin, because I haven&#x27;t gotten pimples from using it. I&#x27;ve grown to like the feeling of this on my skin. I wish the tea tree oil scent was stronger, but that&#x27;s only becuase I really love that smell. Try it out. You&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
    <li> I really like.this face wash a little goes a long way, I use it on my 8 year old daughter as well.</li>
    <li> I have really been getting into more natural skin care products, so when I saw this I had to have it I got it quickly. (2days prime) I was nervous about it at first because o have oily skin and been avoiding using any oils on my skin, but I used it and fell in love this face wash has been keeping my face clear of acne. Seriously is amazing when I get my monthly hormonal acne it clears it up super fast and I&#x27;m back to having nice clear skin. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better face wash. This is something that I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and feels good to wash with this.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any major difference using it in skin condition.  But after use my skin definitely looks and feels clean, and the tea tree oil makes it a refreshing wash.  I use this every morning and will keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying I have tried EVERYTHING! I have even had laser therapy done on my face 10 times. While that helped, nothing has helped as much as this facial wash. My face is flawless. I have people commenting on my skin telling me how beautiful it is daily. Any remaining acne scars are almost gone. I have no breakouts of new acne since starting using this. I don&#x27;t even need to use the medication prescribed by my dermatologist for acne anymore! What I love the most is that it is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed if you buy this and use it consistently :)</li>
    <li> Love this product! Plan on always using it. Takes off my make-up easily and it has cleared up my acne. My face is not oily nor does it leave it dry.</li>
    <li> Again, I do LOVE ALL of Dr. Woods products! But, this being said this has to be one of the best facial cleansers I have ever used. And I have tried many over the years. This doesn&#x27;t strip your skin and make it feel tight. It cleanses and helps keep oil and acne at bay while leaving your skin feeling taken care of.</li>
    <li> at first it seems like this really works. it smells medicated, and the first thing you think is this will possibly work. a couple days i broke out ridiculousy. my face does have minor blemishes, but it made those worse and made quite a few others. i got this really bad rash and blistering eruption of acne. i kept going for a few more days and i had to stop as i got more blemishes. i kept thinking to myself... hmm if this is suppose to work why dont doctors/derm recommend this ? it may work on certain face types , but not all. tea tree oil is actually only an average or below average product for acne. since this is a natural occuring substance , people think its a good product for acne. The last few statements are from a mix of dermatologists.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have bought this facial cleanser and I love the fact that IT DOES NOT LATHER!  It has tea tree oil to kill the bacteria in your face and shea butter to moisturize it while you cleanse. A perfect combination for my oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love the product but the picture showed this green lable and a red labeled bottle appearing that you would get a set of bottles so I bought 2 sets, so I thought.  When I received the shipment there were 2 green labled bottles and the shipment cost was almost $40.00.  Very deceiving I would have never paid $39.00 for 2 bottles, eventhough I love the product.  I will go back to vitacost to get my face wash from now on.</li>
    <li> I love all of Dr Wood&#x27;s products.  This seller is very good too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since puberty raised its ugly head in my life. Now, at 25, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there, including other tea tree products. I got the idea to try this stuff because I like Dr. Wood&#x27;s Peppermint Castille Soap, which I was using on my face before this. That seemed to help a lot, but this stuff helps even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally acne-prone, incredibly oily skin with huge pores. This stuff helps keep my face clear, keeps my face from getting more oily, and keeps my face feeling fresh longer.  All these things are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re looking for a nice, natural solution for acne and oil prone skin, check this stuff out. It lasts a pretty long time, and I use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the reviews, and it did not disappoint! I will try other Dr. Woods products too, because of the great experience and ingredients. I am so happy, I am ordering a second bottle so that I have one upstairs and downstairs.  It really cleans and helps regulate oil production, leaves skin soft, not dry.  Gentle and effective! I did get a few small whiteheads a couple days after I began using it, but this is a good thing, because it means that what was deep in my skin was coming to the surface and my pores were getting declogged/decongested.  Nothing since.  Please keep this in mind. I read lots of reviews for similar types of products that people claim made them break out, and they stopped using them.  Probably they were just experiencing this detox phase and weren&#x27;t patient enough.</li>
    <li> Most wonderful stuff on the market , After using clean, refreshed wonderful. Better than the expensive big  Department Name Brands A+</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser for oily skin. It foams nicely and a small amount goes a long way. I occasionally make an exfoliator with it by adding sea salt. Again, a very small amount goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean and smells really good (like a clean earthy smell). Definitely will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> makes my face so smooth, now i ordered the body wash as well, mentioned to my friend who bought for her son with acne problem and it cleared it right up, she loves it too, also use the shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> Great vegan product, makes my skin feel clean and firm.</li>
    <li> Works very well with my skin . Before using this product i had very bad breakouts on my face which were quite embrassing but when i started to use the tea tree face wash it clearned up in a week!! Wow will by again in the near future</li>
    <li> I use this regularly and I use it on my female patient because she breaks out sometimes around her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, leaves skin feeling clean but not dried out and I REALLY LIKE the tea tree oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Does what it claims to do. Clears blemishes and scarring with continuous use. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I loved the smell and the clean feeling it gave my face! My breakouts are less than they used to be!</li>
    <li> BEST STUFF EVER. It really helps keep oil in check and I do love the effects of tea tree oil as an antibiotic that is from natural sources. I noticed an improvement right away in the clarity of my skin and I notice if I run out, I will get a breakout. Hardly needed any other treatment cream or anything to keep breakouts in check when using this wash regularly. Interesting scent too- very earthy and nice. Not too sweet and definitely not flowery. Truly herby and lemon-y. Your face feels nice and clean after using it, but not too dry and tight.</li>
    <li> I prefer the regular Castile tea tree soap to this stuff! Did not feel like it was cleaning my face and has a very slipper feel to it. And it&#x27;s loaded with extra ingredients vs just the pure Castile soap with tea tree! Gave it a try but would no purchase again, especially for since you get an entire 32 oz bottle for the same price!</li>
