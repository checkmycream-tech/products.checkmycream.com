      <li>The hair is much longer than I&#x27;m used to working with, which is perfect.  </li>
      <li>though- for anyone like me that didn&#x27;t know- that it was kind of a pain to work with the head with out the stabilization of the stand.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to work with.</li>
      <li>The hair was very easy to manage and work with...</li>
      <li>This head fits PERFECTLY on the end of a standard diameter broom handle.</li>
      <li>make sure you get the stand with it</li>
      <li>AND I saved a bunch of money! :)</li>
      <li>but it feels more like synthetic.  </li>
      <li>This dollhead was okay.</li>
      <li>Water of my time, and I&#x27;m sincerely worried it dulled my shears.</li>
      <li>Yes it was cheapest one I could find, but cheap is obviously not always best, even if you are a student, living on student funding.   </li>
      <li>I got this dollhead to take my state board test and it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>I love them, I purchased 3 and they arrived on time, well wrapped &amp; very affordable.</li>

      <li>So shipping was fast.  </li>
      <li>My friend is teaching me how to do easy hair stuff for my family, so I am not a professional or even a student of a cosmetology/hair school.</li>
      <li>She wants to be a hair dresser when she graduates high school</li>
      <li>The mannequin does not have very long or luxurious hair and has a pretty strong hair direction ingrained in it&#x27;s roots, but overall it is a decent value for the money.  </li>
      <li>DO NOT waste your money.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on one because I was only using it to demonstrate hair extensions for my clients.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this for American Gladiator style pole configurations.</li>
      <li>This dollhead is exactly what I expected to get.  </li>
      <li>The quality of the hair is absolutely sub-par to what should be expected for a \\&quot;human hair\\&quot; doll head.  </li>

<li> The only complaint (and this could be a major complaint depending on what you want to create) is that the hair is in too many different lengths which could limit the styling and cuts.</li>
<li> The hair isn&#x27;t too long, but it&#x27;s long enough to do a basic layered cut on for a cosmetology state board test..</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend these to other people.</li>
<li> I have shown them to my instructors and other students and they just can&#x27;t believe I actually paid money for these things.  </li>
<li> I cannot believe I spent money on these things.  </li>
<li> I teach Cosmetology and barbering and I have to say, hands down</li>
<li> To even up the hair you have to cut it to about 5-6 \\&quot; out of the 12+\\&quot; start and as a student that is just not good enough.  </li>
<li> This little mannequin head was inexpensive compared to others I priced.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Only about a third will lighten and only to a nasty yellow color.</li>
<li> The people writing negative reviews don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.</li>
<li> This product sucks and is not as advertised.</li>
<li> and so it is sharp to the touch as well as it provides for very thin and stringy hair.  </li>
<li> It has all different lengths, looks like it was cut previously and has a terrible texture.  </li>
<li> , this is the absolute worst manikin I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
<li> A lot of the hair was broken towards the scalp</li>
<li> I am sad for the poor investment I made in this doll head.</li>
<li> Showed up with hair down to the base of its neck..</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I purchased 2 of these mannequin heads.  </li>
<li> Terrible manikin, with  wiry, coarse, awful hair and a creepy face.</li>
<li> I am very unhappy with this mannequin.</li>
<li> The hair on the mannequin is horrible.  </li>
<li> The hair is nasty.  </li>
<li> Worst mannequin head I&#x27;ve EVER purchased.</li>

    <li> Miss Lori-Kin is a good item for the prioe, her hair is nice and thick. The only complaint (and this could be a major complaint depending on what you want to create) is that the hair is in too many different lengths which could limit the styling and cuts.</li>
    <li> This dollhead is exactly what I expected to get.  It was affordable and arrived to me in about 3 days.  So shipping was fast.  The hair and doll head look exactly like the picture. I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I purchased 2 of these mannequin heads.  They have the coarses, fuzziest hair of any mannequin I have ever seen.  The ad says they are human hair but it feels more like synthetic.  They both have different lenghts hair from 5\\&quot; to 12\\&quot;.  To even up the hair you have to cut it to about 5-6 \\&quot; out of the 12+\\&quot; start and as a student that is just not good enough.  No practice there.  I cannot believe I spent money on these things.  I have shown them to my instructors and other students and they just can&#x27;t believe I actually paid money for these things.  The hair on the mannequin is horrible.  DO NOT waste your money.  Yes it was cheapest one I could find, but cheap is obviously not always best, even if you are a student, living on student funding.   YUK and then some!!!</li>
    <li> This product sucks and is not as advertised. The first time it was used the hair melted like plastic. I tried to get the company to resolve the issue, however they will not contact me by phone or email. Several days have passed getting to two weeks. I hope Amazon will step in and help. I will try to contact them this week and see if I can get some resolve. I want to restate BEWARE do not waste your money and time with this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> The hair was good quality. It didn&#x27;t do a lot of shedding, and it was a great teaching tool for my daughter. She has learned so much with working with the head.</li>

I am happy with what I purchased when I look at the price.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s advertised as being \\&quot;100% Human Hair\\&quot;, it&#x27;s anything but. The curling iron melted the hair right off. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Item is as described and manakin has nice short hair style.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not human hair. Worst mannequin head I&#x27;ve EVER purchased. Water of my time, and I&#x27;m sincerely worried it dulled my shears.</li>
    <li> The quality of the hair is absolutely sub-par to what should be expected for a \\&quot;human hair\\&quot; doll head.  The hair came pre-layered and so it was not all 19inches as it promises.  A lot of the hair was broken towards the scalp and so it is sharp to the touch as well as it provides for very thin and stringy hair.  Also, when using a curling iron the hair began to melt showing that it is not truly human hair. I absolutely would not recommend buying this doll head for any purpose at all!  I am sad for the poor investment I made in this doll head.</li>
    <li> This head fits PERFECTLY on the end of a standard diameter broom handle. I HIGHLY recommend this for American Gladiator style pole configurations. Bonus: the hair works perfectly as a replacement for the broom. #justheadstuff</li>
    <li> My friend is teaching me how to do easy hair stuff for my family, so I am not a professional or even a student of a cosmetology/hair school. This has met my needs- make sure you get the stand with it though- for anyone like me that didn&#x27;t know- that it was kind of a pain to work with the head with out the stabilization of the stand.</li>
    <li> I use the head to practice braiding. It is very easy to work with. The hair does not fall out.</li>
    <li> I love them, I purchased 3 and they arrived on time, well wrapped &amp; very affordable.The hair doesn&#x27;t shed to much. I would definitely recommend these to other people.</li>
    <li> great hair on this man again. Showed up with hair down to the base of its neck..but great to work on otherwise.</li>
    <li> Terrible manikin, with  wiry, coarse, awful hair and a creepy face. I teach Cosmetology and barbering and I have to say, hands down, this is the absolute worst manikin I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy with this mannequin. I was under the impression it was human hair. I wanted to lighten it to the lightest blonde and use it as a selling tool for Olaplex in my salon. But the hair WILL NOT lighten evenly. Only about a third will lighten and only to a nasty yellow color. I&#x27;ve been a cosmetologist for 23 years so I know how human hair should be. This is not.</li>
    <li> This mannequin head is much more than I expected.  I&#x27;m a Sisterlocks(TM) Consultant and I&#x27;m using this mannequin to help build my speed.  The hair is much longer than I&#x27;m used to working with, which is perfect.  I also see the potential in using this mannequin head again.  I will absolutely purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I loved this doll head because it helped to practice my hair styles.... The hair was very easy to manage and work with... I recommend this to everyone in practice.... Thank you...</li>
    <li> I bought this gift for my sister&#x27;s birthday. She wants to be a hair dresser when she graduates high school and she loves using this!</li>
    <li> This dollhead was okay. I got this dollhead to take my state board test and it worked just fine. The people writing negative reviews don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about. The hair isn&#x27;t too long, but it&#x27;s long enough to do a basic layered cut on for a cosmetology state board test..AND I saved a bunch of money! :)</li>
    <li> The hair is nasty.  It has all different lengths, looks like it was cut previously and has a terrible texture.  Very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
