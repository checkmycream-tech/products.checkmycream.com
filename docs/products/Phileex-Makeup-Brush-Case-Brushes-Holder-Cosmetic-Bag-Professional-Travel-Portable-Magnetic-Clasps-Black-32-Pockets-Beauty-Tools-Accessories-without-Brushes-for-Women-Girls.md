      <li>This is a great product!</li>

      <li>so glad I purchased this!!</li>
      <li>Totally glad I bought this :D</li>
      <li>Love and holds all my brushes perfectly!</li>
      <li>Material is good for the price.</li>
      <li>The material is fairly &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; feeling but there are plenty of places for plenty of brushes.</li>
      <li>a makeup roll that I love!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The leather isn&#x27;t of the best quality, in fact I would question whether it&#x27;s really leather at all.  </li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love this make-up pouch!!</li>
      <li>i love this brush roll and its at amazing price too..</li>
      <li>Great to find a large one without brushes, as I have plenty of brushes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased three already and will do so again as my brush &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; increases! :)</li>
      <li>and I finally found this perfect one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The leather is lovely and certainly better than most. :)</li>
      <li>Should be elastic for many sizes of brushes.</li>
      <li>I love my roll up pouch.</li>
      <li>The compartments are of various sizes which is perfect for most sets of brushes.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love love love this.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this makeup brush bag.</li>
      <li>And there&#x27;s still room for more.</li>
      <li>I love how soft it is, easy to wipe clean when need be... out of all the ones I&#x27;ve bought, this one really is my favorite!!!</li>
      <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
      <li>Once I just manually made sure the seams didn&#x27;t interfere as I pushed each brush in, it was fine.</li>
      <li>It really fit most of my makeup brushes in it.</li>
      <li>Totally a super bargain!  </li>
      <li>Has plenty of spaces for all my brushes, and ties up so nicely.. doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all.</li>
      <li>it holds all my makeup brushes comfortably however the material seems a bit cheap.</li>
      <li>The material is flexible and light weight.</li>
      <li>I actually bought two of them, one for my brushes and another to put my 40 eye and li liners in, and it works great for those as well.</li>
      <li>Nice soft leather-like texture.</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying this pouch, and would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It seems like a good product to use if you are traveling, but for daily use.....it was not as convenient.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several trips and have been very pleased.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t taken it on a trip, yet, but have loaded it up with brushes and am awaiting it&#x27;s first trip!  </li>
      <li>Good product, but not enough large pockets</li>
      <li>It is very well-constructed and has far more room than I have brushes.</li>
      <li>I needs to be aired out when you first open it because it does have that strong new material smell but other than that it is perfect.</li>
      <li>Too many holders only take 7-9 brushes.</li>
      <li>The only problem I had was that the inside seams on the top straps of the brush holders caught my brushes as I put them in each holder.  </li>
      <li>I have an array of makeup brushes both big and small and it holds all of them perfectly.</li>
      <li>I love this bag i!m actually about to buy Another</li>
      <li>I wish it had more of the larger sized pockets.</li>
      <li>This is super soft, super large, and is as advertised.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well made, looks very sleek, and is very roomy!</li>
      <li>This may work for someone who has a large collection of brushes.</li>
      <li>I was searching for a large brush roll for some time.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It also keeps them much neater</li>
      <li>Very supple, easy to strap closed.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it a four star is the material could have been made better havent had it for long</li>
      <li>Good quality not great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have brushes left out and makes it much easier on the go when I need to do makeup on a client, plus no dust particles get into it.</li>
      <li>Also, wish there were a few more loops for larger based brushes.</li>
      <li>I purchased this specific one because I thought it was real leather and thus would last a long time.  </li>

<li> Interior flap to keep brushes flat and from falling out of case.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little hard to get your brushes to fit if they have wider handles.  </li>
<li> There are not enough larger slots for bigger handled brushes, but it has quite a few smaller slots for smaller brushes.</li>
<li> I feel like such a professional unrolling my brushes everyday.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a professional make up artist, but I wanted to keep my brushes organized and neat.</li>
<li> Because small openings-limited use and still need one that is truly for professional brushes.&lt;br</li>
<li> For my oversized handle brushes, I carefully cut the stitching to make two pockets into one--worked perfectly--can&#x27;t even tell that I made alterations.</li>
<li> Only complaint is that the leather &amp;#34;loops&amp;#34; to hold the brushes have a seam at the bottom that the brushes catch on when you try to insert them.</li>
<li> Each brush slot is big enough to hold a brush with a very thick handle, but each slot can also handle 2-3 brushes if the handles are very thin (e.g. an eyeliner or eyeshadow brush).</li>
<li> so not sure how well it will hold up.</li>
<li> This item didn&#x27;t look bad but it was larger</li>
<li> just feel like it is false advertising.</li>
<li> It suits my needs, but I am disappointed as it is not genuine leather, but rather synthetic leather.  </li>
<li> Had a terrible plastic chemical smell.</li>

    <li> Excellent way to travel with all my makeup brushes. Lots of spots for various sizes. Nice soft leather-like texture. Interior flap to keep brushes flat and from falling out of case.</li>
    <li> i love this brush roll and its at amazing price too..</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have an array of makeup brushes both big and small and it holds all of them perfectly. I actually bought two of them, one for my brushes and another to put my 40 eye and li liners in, and it works great for those as well. The material is flexible and light weight. I needs to be aired out when you first open it because it does have that strong new material smell but other than that it is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several trips and have been very pleased. It holds all my brushes of varying sizes. I also put my mascara, lip primer, eye liner, etc in it. And there&#x27;s still room for more. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this make-up pouch!! It accommodates all of my brushes and make-up tools  from the smallest to the largest.  The pouch is well made, stain resistant and totally portable.  The best part is the time it saves me in the morning, having all my make-up tools in one place.  I am really enjoying this pouch, and would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Had a terrible plastic chemical smell. I sent it back immediately,</li>
    <li> Holds my brushes, keeps everything organized so glad I purchased this!! The only reason I gave it a four star is the material could have been made better havent had it for long so not sure how well it will hold up.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Great Quality, one of the best.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t look bad but it was larger then I thought.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description well.  This may work for someone who has a large collection of brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this bag i!m actually about to buy Another this is a great bag</li>
    <li> It suits my needs, but I am disappointed as it is not genuine leather, but rather synthetic leather.  I purchased this specific one because I thought it was real leather and thus would last a long time.  I will keep it, just feel like it is false advertising.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have quite a collection of brushes, and this roll has space for all of them. The quality is very good, and the roll travels well. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is super soft, super large, and is as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t taken it on a trip, yet, but have loaded it up with brushes and am awaiting it&#x27;s first trip!

    <li> Was looking for a way to store my hundreds of makeup brushes, and I&#x27;ve tried everything! This roll worked okay. There are not enough larger slots for bigger handled brushes, but it has quite a few smaller slots for smaller brushes. It seems like a good product to use if you are traveling, but for daily use.....it was not as convenient.</li>
    <li> Been searching for such a pouch for quite sometime and I finally found this perfect one. Material is good for the price. The compartments are of various sizes which is perfect for most sets of brushes. Totally glad I bought this :D</li>
    <li> This brush roll is perfect and just what i had been looking for! The description and picture do not do it justice. It&#x27;s well made, looks very sleek, and is very roomy! Each brush slot is big enough to hold a brush with a very thick handle, but each slot can also handle 2-3 brushes if the handles are very thin (e.g. an eyeliner or eyeshadow brush). I&#x27;ve purchased three already and will do so again as my brush &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; increases! :)</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. The material is fairly &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; feeling but there are plenty of places for plenty of brushes.</li>
    <li> Plenty of room for all your brushes.  It&#x27;s a little hard to get your brushes to fit if they have wider handles.  The leather isn&#x27;t of the best quality, in fact I would question whether it&#x27;s really leather at all.  But for the price, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> Love love love this. I feel like such a professional unrolling my brushes everyday.  It also keeps them much neater</li>
    <li> This brush pouch was just what I was looking for! I&#x27;m not a professional make up artist, but I wanted to keep my brushes organized and neat.</li>

    <li> I wish it had more of the larger sized pockets.</li>
    <li> Good product, but not enough large pockets</li>
    <li> Great to find a large one without brushes, as I have plenty of brushes. Only complaint is that the leather &amp;#34;loops&amp;#34; to hold the brushes have a seam at the bottom that the brushes catch on when you try to insert them. Also, wish there were a few more loops for larger based brushes. But very happy to find the size and in leather. Too many holders only take 7-9 brushes.</li>
    <li> I love my roll up pouch. it holds all my makeup brushes comfortably however the material seems a bit cheap. it does the job though.</li>
    <li> Finally!!! a makeup roll that I love! Has plenty of spaces for all my brushes, and ties up so nicely.. doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all. I love how soft it is, easy to wipe clean when need be... out of all the ones I&#x27;ve bought, this one really is my favorite!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality not great. Should be elastic for many sizes of brushes. Because small openings-limited use and still need one that is truly for professional brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The leather is lovely and certainly better than most. :)</li>
