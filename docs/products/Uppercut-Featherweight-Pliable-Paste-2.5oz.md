      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>The tropical scent is has is awesome.</li>
      <li>I am very impressed with Uppercut Featherweight.  </li>
      <li>But this one is perfect.</li>
      <li>This paste is perfect for it.  </li>
      <li>I really loved the scent, the hold was EXCELLENT, and I think the low/no shine finish is also awesome</li>
      <li>The smell of the wax is not that great either.</li>
      <li>holds all day, works great with my hair.</li>
      <li>Great product and great hold</li>
      <li>Great product for men&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>Really good hold</li>
      <li>A bit pricey but lasts a good while.</li>
      <li>It provides a good hold with a matte finish.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really, finding a good product for your hair takes a lot of experimentation.</li>
      <li>That said, it worked into my hair quite nicely.</li>
      <li>and I love using it.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Not a fan of this line, and have tried most of their products.</li>
      <li>Love it ...</li>
      <li>Way too strong.</li>
      <li>and I ended up applying quite a bit of water to smooth out the wax as I was applying on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But just be sure you put the cover back on or it won&#x27;t be good anymore...</li>
      <li>The Prejume is easier to work with, but didn&#x27;t really hold him in NYC summers when I tend to sweat a bit more.</li>
      <li>Stuff works fantastic and has real ingredients!</li>
      <li>well worth it IMHO.</li>
      <li>Nightrider offered a little more hold than Prejume, but now that I am doing a style that needs even more hold than that, Uppercut Featherweight is my go to.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t with the one I bought at the beauty shop where I first bought it and had to throw it away.</li>
      <li>Most thicker pomades and hair products I&#x27;ve used wind up tearing my hair out and are not malleable enough to style.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gives my hair a nice hold and looks sharp.  </li>
      <li>My hair is about 1-inch long, straight, and VERY FINE (finer than a baby&#x27;s).  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had this issue, but it is pretty much unusable.  </li>
      <li>Had it been a little less thick/sticky, it could very well have been the perfect product for me.</li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>Really work it around your hands before putting it into your hair.</li>
      <li>Dont use it as much as I was hoping I would</li>
      <li>but it is fun to occasionally put pomade in my hair.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not really something I can hold against the product though, I just think my hair is better suited for a different type of product.</li>
      <li>Not heavy, and holds all day (sometimes two)!</li>
      <li>Its clearly a knockoff.  </li>
      <li>The real featherweight is a white paste.  </li>
      <li>but if you put too much, leaves some white streaks.</li>
      <li>In my view, basically any hair product review needs to be taken with a grain of salt because there are probably precious few - if any - hair products that are a &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; option given the fact that everyone&#x27;s hair is quite different.</li>
      <li>That being said, the thing I didn&#x27;t like about Featherweight is how thick it was and the relatively short amount of time you have to style before it really started making my hair prickly and unmoveable without adding a lot more water.</li>
      <li>The product produces a dull shine and is easily removed with a normal shampoo.</li>
      <li>Just make sure your hands are dry and hair slightly damp.</li>
      <li>Other products that I&#x27;ve used and had success with are Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Nightrider and Prejume Wax #5.</li>
      <li>So, I want to start by saying that the main reason I can&#x27;t give featherweight a higher review is the fact that I have very fine/soft hair and it&#x27;s difficult to find a product that works well with the way my hair is.</li>
      <li>Works very well for short hair but a little too sticky for medium length hair, which is more difficult to work the product in due to its powerful hold.</li>
      <li>Some other reviewers noticed clumpiness and crunchy hair, but to me it sounds like they didn&#x27;t take enough time to really work it</li>

<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but</li>
<li> I just wipe a couple of my fingers across the paste -- picking up just a little bit, rub my hands together, and pat into my hair.  </li>
<li> An outstanding product that will hold your hair in place in the worst conditions.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t return because it&#x27;s past 30 days.</li>
<li> OK product, very difficult and painful to apply.</li>
<li> Sticky product, hard to apply and spread evenly, leaves hair crunchy, expensive for the amount.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, when I opened it, it looked like a caked bar.  </li>
<li> and I was afraid the tinted colors of the heavier weight options would stain my hair.</li>

    <li> Stuff works fantastic and has real ingredients!</li>
    <li> In my view, basically any hair product review needs to be taken with a grain of salt because there are probably precious few - if any - hair products that are a &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; option given the fact that everyone&#x27;s hair is quite different.

Most thicker pomades and hair products I&#x27;ve used wind up tearing my hair out and are not malleable enough to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featherweight is a very thick paste, and doesn&#x27;t give much. That said, it worked into my hair quite nicely. I really loved the scent, the hold was EXCELLENT, and I think the low/no shine finish is also awesome (if you&#x27;re looking for a product with no shine, I&#x27;d recommend this). That being said, the thing I didn&#x27;t like about Featherweight is how thick it was and the relatively short amount of time you have to style before it really started making my hair prickly and unmoveable without adding a lot more water. That&#x27;s not really something I can hold against the product though, I just think my hair is better suited for a different type of product. I&#x27;d definitely recommend Featherweight, though, depending on your hair type. Strengths: hold, scent, finish/look. Had it been a little less thick/sticky, it could very well have been the perfect product for me.</li>
    <li> My hair is about 1-inch long, straight, and VERY FINE (finer than a baby&#x27;s).  This paste is perfect for it.  I just wipe a couple of my fingers across the paste -- picking up just a little bit, rub my hands together, and pat into my hair.  A miracle!  My hair stays where I put it and withstands a hat without flattening.  It washes out with shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market.  This one is now my fave.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Dont use it as much as I was hoping I would but it is fun to occasionally put pomade in my hair. I bought the lighter weight one because I have white hair and I was afraid the tinted colors of the heavier weight options would stain my hair.</li>
    <li> Sticky product, hard to apply and spread evenly, leaves hair crunchy, expensive for the amount. Overall it is a complete waste on money.</li>
    <li> OK product, very difficult and painful to apply. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Not a fan of this line, and have tried most of their products.</li>
    <li> Love it ... But just be sure you put the cover back on or it won&#x27;t be good anymore... I didn&#x27;t with the one I bought at the beauty shop where I first bought it and had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> The tropical scent is has is awesome.</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule. Really good hold but if you put too much, leaves some white streaks. Also after a couple weeks dries your hair out. A bit pricey but lasts a good while. Overall would buy again.</li>
    <li> Way too strong. even the amount of a thumbtack is enough to ruin your hair</li>
    <li> Greasy. Stained my pillow covers. Can&#x27;t return because it&#x27;s past 30 days. Very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my usual uppercut featherweight from these guys. It&#x27;s not the same stuff. Its clearly a knockoff.  The real featherweight is a white paste.  The stuff I received was almost yellowish. It wasn&#x27;t even a paste.  Almost a greasy wax substance.  I even compared the container to my old uppercut and there were a few noticeable differences.</li>
    <li> holds all day, works great with my hair.</li>
    <li> This is not what i&#x27;ve expected in a wax, the paste is very rough even if you try to rub vigorously in your hands to even out the wax on your hand before you style you hair and I ended up applying quite a bit of water to smooth out the wax as I was applying on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this if you are looking for ease of use.  The smell of the wax is not that great either.</li>
    <li> Great product for men&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> But this one is perfect. Not heavy, and holds all day (sometimes two)!</li>
    <li> An outstanding product that will hold your hair in place in the worst conditions. A wet comb or even damp hands will allow you to reset your do after a dose of helmet head.It is a paste once rubbed it becomes clay like in consistency. The product produces a dull shine and is easily removed with a normal shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Gives my hair a nice hold and looks sharp.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth it IMHO.</li>
    <li> Works very well for short hair but a little too sticky for medium length hair, which is more difficult to work the product in due to its powerful hold.</li>
    <li> Great product and great hold but it&#x27;s makes hair very stiff and not natural looking</li>
    <li> The product itself is GREAT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from my local barber and I love using it.  I wanted to get an extra so I bought this off amazon.  Unfortunately, when I opened it, it looked like a caked bar.  I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had this issue, but it is pretty much unusable.  I will just continue buying from my barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, get product but be warned that it may not come in correctly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products over the years. After making a solid decision to move on from American Crew fiber I&#x27;ve started using this. It provides a good hold with a matte finish. It&#x27;s a little difficult to work with, especially if your hands are wet, but not nearly as difficult as American Crew fiber. Just make sure your hands are dry and hair slightly damp. Really work it around your hands before putting it into your hair. Some other reviewers noticed clumpiness and crunchy hair, but to me it sounds like they didn&#x27;t take enough time to really work it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, finding a good product for your hair takes a lot of experimentation. If it is of any help, I has straight, thick, black, Asian hair. Other products that I&#x27;ve used and had success with are Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Nightrider and Prejume Wax #5. The Prejume is easier to work with, but didn&#x27;t really hold him in NYC summers when I tend to sweat a bit more. Nightrider offered a little more hold than Prejume, but now that I am doing a style that needs even more hold than that, Uppercut Featherweight is my go to.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with Uppercut Featherweight.  It provides definition and texture to my styles.  I have already sent out a second order.  This stuff is great!</li>
