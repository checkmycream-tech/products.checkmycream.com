      <li>excellent price, prodict and service</li>
      <li>Just another nearly perfect fragrance from Royall.  </li>
      <li>If this scent works with your body chemistry --great!</li>
      <li>very good summer scent</li>
      <li>smells great.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>It is great if you like citrus.</li>
      <li>Great for titening the face up after a good shave.</li>
      <li>Royall Lyme, Spyce, Musk and Bay Rhum are all nice scents.  </li>
      <li>He has Royall Bahrum and Royall Lime as well, and this is a nice addition to his collection.</li>
      <li>Great Product with nice fresh, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Matt</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I also like and appreciate that Royall Mandarin doesn&#x27;t make an entrance before I do, something I think many aftershave wearers could stand to learn.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells.  </li>
      <li>My favorite scent in the collection is Royal Muske followed by Royal Spice.</li>
      <li>I have been using Royall Mandarin Orange for more than two years.</li>
      <li>Elegant.  </li>
      <li>It smells very clean and is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Light.</li>
      <li>Sweet and clean.</li>
      <li>Its not too sweet</li>
      <li>Smells like really, really powerful orange candy.  </li>
      <li>It is by far my favorite after shave.</li>
      <li>I thought that I might smell like an orchard on a hot day, but surprising enough, the fragrance balances out very well.  </li>
      <li>A little strong going on, but settles in nicely, and (for me) lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This is a warm weather favorite that can be gone back to daily.  </li>
      <li>Overall a winner :)</li>
      <li>In the meantime while waiting for the second shipment, I ordered directly from the company, and that shipment was perfect and they sent some samples of other products as well.</li>
      <li>I really like the fragrance and am waiting for the Royall Cherry.</li>
      <li>I really like this scent.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, but it&#x27;s harsh and irritates my skin.</li>
      <li>I personally find the Royal Mandarin rather sickeningly sweet smelling.</li>
      <li>It is so fresh and clean with a slight tingle when you put it on.</li>
      <li>Learned my lessson, I won&#x27;t order this particular product through Amazon again.</li>
      <li>It is my least favorite in the Royal Lime Collection.</li>
      <li>Not heavy.</li>

<li> (it wasn&#x27;t bad, actually was a nice smell, but I knew something was amiss)  </li>
<li> but only a little bit.</li>
<li> As the years passed it became harder and harder to find in my area.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a heavier scent than Royall Lyme, my everyday aftershave, but it&#x27;s not as heavy as Royall Rugby, which I will only wear in the winter.</li>
<li> The bottle that I had ordered from amazon had a faulty safety seal and smells  watered down.</li>
<li> I would use this only as an air freshener and maybe it can be added to bath water, but it&#x27;s definitely not good as a cologne or after shave.</li>
<li> It is not what I expected --at least on me.</li>
<li> Of all the Royall fragrances, this is the only bad one.  </li>
<li> They are not as sickening.</li>

    <li> smells great. very good summer scent</li>
    <li> I really like this scent. It reminds me of Hermes&#x27; Eau d&#x27; Orange Vert. It starts with a big blast of juicy orange smell that fades into orange and spice.  It&#x27;s a heavier scent than Royall Lyme, my everyday aftershave, but it&#x27;s not as heavy as Royall Rugby, which I will only wear in the winter. I also like and appreciate that Royall Mandarin doesn&#x27;t make an entrance before I do, something I think many aftershave wearers could stand to learn.</li>
    <li> I have been using Royal Lime Cologne products for 30 years. I have tried all of the scents except the Royal Lime Scent. My favorite scent in the collection is Royal Muske followed by Royal Spice. I personally find the Royal Mandarin rather sickeningly sweet smelling. It is not what I expected --at least on me. It is my least favorite in the Royal Lime Collection. If this scent works with your body chemistry --great! But, if not, try the Royal Muske or Royal Spice scent. They are not as sickening.</li>
    <li> I have been using Royall Mandarin Orange for more than two years. It is by far my favorite after shave. The bottle that I had ordered from amazon had a faulty safety seal and smells  watered down. I you find this after shave product in a store, try it out. It is great if you like citrus.</li>
    <li> This smells soooo refreshing--all the Royall frangrances can be worn by both men and women----great for summer frangrance. Not heavy.</li>
    <li> Just another nearly perfect fragrance from Royall.  This is a warm weather favorite that can be gone back to daily.  Well-balanced.  Elegant.  Light.</li>
    <li> Of all the Royall fragrances, this is the only bad one.  Smells like really, really powerful orange candy.  Royall Lyme, Spyce, Musk and Bay Rhum are all nice scents.  Don&#x27;t know how they came up with this one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product just in time for the spring season! It is so fresh and clean with a slight tingle when you put it on. Its not too sweet but it still has a slght fruity scent. Overall a winner :)</li>
    <li> Was introduced to this product in the mid 70s. As the years passed it became harder and harder to find in my area. Thank goodness I found Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Great Product with nice fresh, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Matt</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift.  When I received the items, the box had an odor to it. (it wasn&#x27;t bad, actually was a nice smell, but I knew something was amiss)  That was because the cologne had leaked out of the bottle all over the place!  I reordered and sent the smelly stuff back, received the next shipment and it had leaked as well, but only a little bit. I still have not been reimbursed for the return shipping.  In the meantime while waiting for the second shipment, I ordered directly from the company, and that shipment was perfect and they sent some samples of other products as well. Learned my lessson, I won&#x27;t order this particular product through Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I like it . My wife likes it. What else matters?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Royall Lyme for years, so I wanted to try the Mandarin Orange. I really like the fragrance and am waiting for the Royall Cherry.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I love the way it smells.  It&#x27;s not assaulting on the senses.  I thought that I might smell like an orchard on a hot day, but surprising enough, the fragrance balances out very well.  My wife loves when I wear this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great for titening the face up after a good shave.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but it&#x27;s harsh and irritates my skin. I believe this has orange oil in it, which also happens to be used in household cleaning chemicals. I would use this only as an air freshener and maybe it can be added to bath water, but it&#x27;s definitely not good as a cologne or after shave.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a gift.  It smells very clean and is not overpowering.  He has Royall Bahrum and Royall Lime as well, and this is a nice addition to his collection.</li>
    <li> excellent price, prodict and service</li>
    <li> A little strong going on, but settles in nicely, and (for me) lasts all day. In the two days I have worn it, I have had four people compliment me on the smell, and directed them to &amp;#34;The&amp;#34; Mandarin.</li>
    <li> I have used this scent for awhile now. I love it and my wife says &amp;#34;it&#x27;ll do&amp;#34;. I think it smells like citrus. Sweet and clean.</li>
