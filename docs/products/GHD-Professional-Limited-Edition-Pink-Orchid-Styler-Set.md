      <li>The case is super cute too!</li>
      <li>The best thing about this iron however is how hot it gets and how fast it gets to full temp.  </li>
      <li>I contacted GHD and was told to return the straightener, they would look at it and determine if it was authentic and replace if I had an original sales receipt with it being during the manufacturer warranty period.  </li>
      <li>This gets things taken care of very quickly.  </li>
      <li>i would recommend this hot styler to anyone who is in a rush and wants beautiful hair</li>
      <li>First, this thing is authentic (already registered on the ghd site) and worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>Great solid performance you would expect for the price tag</li>
      <li>I am really happy with this flat iron, I had another one before which I had for about 2 years my son dropped it and the plate cracked</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
      <li>It heats quickly and leaves your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>The iron is very handy and complains when you leave it on too long without continuous use.</li>
      <li>an iron that not only is a time saver and it does a great job of getting my hair smooth and straight.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to buy a flat iron every year then invest in one of these and you&#x27;ll be good for a while.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair this may be too hot for you.</li>
      <li>This is a great flat iron and for those that are concerned about it being a real GHD, you can verify it with the serial number on GHD&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>Haha!!</li>
      <li>I do own the red limited edition GHD and it&#x27;s the best flat iron out there.</li>
      <li>My hair stays healthy and split end free and with limited frizz.</li>
      <li>It also has an auto-off which is nice because she was known for leaving hers on all day long.  </li>
      <li>The case is pretty and the cord is really nice and long with a swivel</li>
      <li>but so far so good, hopefully it will last and if not, I should be covered since I registered it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this flat iron set as a Christmas gift and it is absolutely beautiful and it seems to be another high-quality, breath-taking flat iron from GHD. !</li>
      <li>Definitely a great flat iron and worth the money, as long as it holds up!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hot before I can get my mascara on.  </li>
      <li>I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my Chi</li>
      <li>It does not seem to get as hot as it should.</li>
      <li>and I actually am liking that better...</li>
      <li>After having two Infra Shine flat irons die within months, I&#x27;m glad I decided to invest in the GHD.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different flat irons trying to find the right one and so far this one has been the best.  </li>
      <li>and it heats up so fast.  </li>
      <li>but she wears it straight.  </li>
      <li>Genuine GHD flat iron!</li>
      <li>This flat iron just did not seem as great as others I have had in the past.</li>
      <li>After they received and examined my straightener - I was told a new replacement is on the way!  </li>
      <li>Decent quality.  </li>
      <li>the cheap machines are not worth messing with your hair as the plates touch your hair.</li>
      <li>I feel that it is much better for my hair, unlike my old flat iron which seemed to be rough &amp; rip my hair out.  </li>
      <li>Her first &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; flat iron was a Chi.  </li>
      <li>I went ahead and gave it to her early for all the holiday parties.</li>
      <li>I had to pull out my old Conair Infinity Pro</li>
      <li>i do get it il re-rate again later on thanks</li>
      <li>I own quite a lot of GHD Myself because in obsessed with them.</li>
      <li>Well after a little over a year one plate will not get hot.  </li>
      <li>but the new one didn&#x27;t last nearly as long.  </li>
      <li>I was a little bummed at first because the temperature isn&#x27;t adjustable, but it&#x27;s not like I ever used the low setting before anyway!</li>

<li> no more waiting...</li>
<li> Well I have been told to buy a GHD in the past but just couldn&#x27;t push myself to spend the $$ for one.  </li>
<li> read a lot of reviews that state you want to ensure you get a legit version since this brand is a target for fake flat irons.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m usually running late so</li>
<li> all one clamp was as old and worn that grief</li>
<li> It was very embarrassing and disappointing!!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if they have slipped on quality control or if I purchased a fake one</li>
<li> but I was way wrong.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I picked this up to replace the Chi I&#x27;d had and used for 5+ years that recently broke.  GHD was a recommendation from a friend and she was spot on.  I was really impressed that even at the discounted Amazon price I got an authentic GHD straightener.  It had the hologram and registered on their website without a problem.  I love that it beeps when it&#x27;s heated up and it heats up so fast.  I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my Chi but it seems to do just as good a job straightening as the Chi did so that&#x27;s not a big deal.  I&#x27;d definitely buy this straightener again!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron set as a Christmas gift and it is absolutely beautiful and it seems to be another high-quality, breath-taking flat iron from GHD. ! I do own the red limited edition GHD and it&#x27;s the best flat iron out there. It heats quickly and leaves your hair smooth and shiny. Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas present.  Her first &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; flat iron was a Chi.  That lasted for many years so when it was time to replace it we purchased another one.  I don&#x27;t know if they have slipped on quality control or if I purchased a fake one but the new one didn&#x27;t last nearly as long.  So we decided to look into other brands.  The GHD brand was recommended to us by our hair stylist so we decided to give this a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews that state you want to ensure you get a legit version since this brand is a target for fake flat irons.  I ordered it and when I got it I went to the manufactures website and was able to register it with no problems.  So I know this was a legit version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance this thing works great.  My wife&#x27;s hair has naturally tight curls but she wears it straight.  This gets things taken care of very quickly.  It also has an auto-off which is nice because she was known for leaving hers on all day long.  It came packaged very nicely so you definitely get what you pay for.  A lot of times the price will scare people away from something like this.  If you don&#x27;t want to buy a flat iron every year then invest in one of these and you&#x27;ll be good for a while.</li>
    <li> I havent got it yet to rate this so whe i do get it il re-rate again later on thanks</li>
    <li> Not my favorite I have ever used. I guess I just eexpected a lot more from this product. If you are stuck between choosing a Chi or this, I would go with the chi.</li>
    <li> Great product for the wife, this was bought as gift for my niece. all girls in the family love these .</li>
    <li> The iron is very handy and complains when you leave it on too long without continuous use. Great item at a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener. I already own one from another vendor and bought another one from Amazon for a family member. It always gives great results and heats up quickly. The only flaw is that it does not have any temperature controls. If you have fine hair this may be too hot for you.</li>
    <li> Genuine GHD flat iron! Heats up in seconds (literally)! The case is super cute too! After having two Infra Shine flat irons die within months, I&#x27;m glad I decided to invest in the GHD. I was a little bummed at first because the temperature isn&#x27;t adjustable, but it&#x27;s not like I ever used the low setting before anyway! Haha!! The little clips are a waste of time, but the heat sleeve is a life saver when you&#x27;re on the go! Overall, awesome product!</li>
    <li> I am convinced this company makes the best straighteners. My hair stays healthy and split end free and with limited frizz. It does not fry my hair. Needs to be used with a heat prtectant (like all straighteners).</li>
    <li> Decent quality.  Lack of heat control is a bummer.  My wife has thick hair and it takes her as long to straighten with this as it did with her walmart special because she has to service such small sections of hair at a time.</li>
    <li> First, this thing is authentic (already registered on the ghd site) and worth every penny!! I had held off for a few years thinking other straighteners should do the job but I was way wrong. This thing not only leaves your hair healthier, but it allows curls to last longer. The thing heats up in like 15 seconds it feels like. The case is pretty and the cord is really nice and long with a swivel so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way when straightening. I would encourage all females with long hair to get this because over the years I have found none that come close to its abilities.</li>
    <li> This flat iron just did not seem as great as others I have had in the past. It does not seem to get as hot as it should.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my niece.. She loves it! Would recommend it for this price! Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Great solid performance you would expect for the price tag</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron and for those that are concerned about it being a real GHD, you can verify it with the serial number on GHD&#x27;s website. Mine was!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend from the seller Amazon, knowing I could return it if the product didn&#x27;t verify on the GHD site. It did!!! I went ahead and gave it to her early for all the holiday parties. :) She loves it, and looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I upset a lot to the plate came with battered box as if it had been used and that&#x27;s not all one clamp was as old and worn that grief and that&#x27;s not all I sell at a price and immediately vaja terrible price I do not really buy again in this store and recommend you buy</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this flat iron, I had another one before which I had for about 2 years my son dropped it and the plate cracked this was a great replacement the cover is great because you put it on after you unplug it so it can cool.</li>
    <li> love it, heats up in seconds. no more waiting...also curls nicely and beautiful. i would recommend this hot styler to anyone who is in a rush and wants beautiful hair</li>
    <li> Well I have been told to buy a GHD in the past but just couldn&#x27;t push myself to spend the $$ for one.  After using my step-daughters recently I decided, JUST DO IT!!  I went on Amazon and found this one which is identical to what she has.  I was hesitant if it was \\&quot;real\\&quot; but after reading the previous reviews and knowing I could register it on the GHD website, I went ahead and purchased it!  I am very happy and glad that I did.  I have only had it less than a week but so far so good, hopefully it will last and if not, I should be covered since I registered it.  Definitely a great flat iron and worth the money, as long as it holds up!  I feel that it is much better for my hair, unlike my old flat iron which seemed to be rough &amp; rip my hair out.  This GHD slides so nice and may take more swipes but it is so gentle and works awesome! Glad I made the purchase!    Update 10/27/14    Well after a little over a year one plate will not get hot.  I am not sure if it is still covered unter the manufacturer warranty but for the price I assume it should last longer than that!  I had to pull out my old Conair Infinity Pro and I actually am liking that better...it has a wider plate and straightens better for my very fine hair.  I may contact GHD and see if there is anything that can be done or if the warranty was up after 12 months.    Update 11/7/14    I contacted GHD and was told to return the straightener, they would look at it and determine if it was authentic and replace if I had an original sales receipt with it being during the manufacturer warranty period.  After they received and examined my straightener - I was told a new replacement is on the way!  So happy to hear this because I couldn&#x27;t imagine spending $160+ every year to replace a straightener!</li>
    <li> this is a gift for someone. My wife already owns a GHD professional machine for the past 4 yrs. nothing beats it. the cheap machines are not worth messing with your hair as the plates touch your hair. the packaging in this thing is like a jewel case. Just amazing.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I own quite a lot of GHD Myself because in obsessed with them. Got this as a gift for my sister and it did not work! It was very embarrassing and disappointing!! Better to buy electronic from their original sites!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different flat irons trying to find the right one and so far this one has been the best.  I love the extras that come with this iron.  The heat resistant pad and the cover are great if you travel a lot or if you don&#x27;t have time for the iron to cool 100% before putting it away.  The best thing about this iron however is how hot it gets and how fast it gets to full temp.  I can finish drying my hair, plug in the iron and it&#x27;s hot before I can get my mascara on.  It&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;m usually running late so an iron that not only is a time saver and it does a great job of getting my hair smooth and straight.</li>
