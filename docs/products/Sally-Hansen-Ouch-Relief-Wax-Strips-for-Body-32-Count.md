### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving four stars because these aren&#x27;t really good if you just follow the instructions of rubbing between your palms—unless you&#x27;ve got really warm palms!</li>
      <li>I have to say that even tho they do not work as perfectly as the melted wax, they still work pretty good.</li>
      <li>You rub two strips between your hand to slightly warm and then peel them apart.</li>
      <li>This product is very easy to use and effective.</li>
      <li>Easy too, I&#x27;m a spa girl and spend too much money on stuff like this great to have this!</li>
      <li>it has a lil bit more than it should have.</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>Love the Sally Hansen wax, but not THIS one.</li>
      <li>No matter how many times I put a strip on it, it doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>
      <li>(But make sure not to burn your skin, either.)</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen has always been my favorite in wax strips.</li>
      <li>Strips)--the wax strips take off mostly all my hair.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find a wax that didn&#x27;t need to be microwaved.</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>These ones are particularly great because the strips are a soft and flexible material, not plastic, so you get better contouring to your skin.</li>
      <li>I used the pain free wipe, waited 10 mins and got started.</li>
      <li>Pain free waxing doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
      <li>Much better than using hot wax.  </li>
      <li>One thing I started doing a while ago which has been helped is that I warm up the strips with a hair dryer - it just takes a few seconds and the wax gets nice and warm.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just wanted efficient body-size waxing strips to quickly wax my legs.</li>
      <li>Instead, I put mine in top of something hot, like the radiator or the hot water urn, for five minutes until the wax has melted.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>The only hair I can imagine this would effectively remove would be hair that was going to fall out anyway.  </li>
      <li>- they just break them right at the surface.</li>
      <li>This happened the first time ive used these.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the original one that I usually get (Sally Hansen except not the ouch-relief.&lt;br /&gt;The wax wouldn&#x27;t warm up between my hands</li>
      <li>The directions say to do it a day before any &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; but you should really make it like 5 days because you&#x27;re gonna be going back for missed hairs more than once.</li>
      <li>Other than that, these strips and the rest of the instructions do a clean job of removing fine to average—not thick/stubborn—hair.</li>
      <li>The pain is the exact same as with the other wax strips but without the effective hair removal!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing for 30 years do there isn&#x27;t much to wax.</li>
      <li>Really suprised how they are saying #1selling product in USA?</li>
      <li>The product advertisement is very misleading.</li>
      <li>I have waxed with real melted wax and with both these wax strips and veet brand wax strips.</li>
      <li>im exploring which are the best cold wax strips.</li>
      <li>Worked very well for me</li>
      <li>Really wish I could return it.</li>
      <li>The wax actually has to melt and be warm to catch hair properly.</li>
      <li>Opt for Sally hansens other wax strips, they&#x27;re way better at removing the hair.</li>
      <li>My skin did not get bumpy and irritated as with real wax and they are not messy at all.</li>
      <li>You have to warm up the wax strips (by rubbing them between your hands as directed) a lot, and peel the strips apart painfully slowly.</li>
      <li>I spend a full minute rubbing these useless things between my hands and they apparently still don&#x27;t get warm enough to pull apart easily or cleanly.</li>
      <li>I used all of the precautions and heated up the wax to the right temperature and everything but EVERY time I would go to pull it away a ton of wax would be left on my skin.</li>
      <li>clear off this product.</li>
      <li>There is no messy wax application at all.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.</li>
      <li>I wish they manufactured this one I just mentioned in large wax strips, not 3 diff sizes, with only a few being large.</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of the Sally Hansen wax strips for face (the ones with the clear wax) and have been using them for years.</li>
      <li>I barely feel it anymore.</li>
      <li>These strips barely remove any hair.</li>
      <li>so I even tried putting it over some hot water and the wax melts a little but can barely get any hair off.</li>
      <li>I literally mean a couple, I was still super hairy after attempting to wax.  </li>

<li> so I even tried putting it over some hot water and the wax melts a little but can barely get any hair off.</li>
<li> I literally mean a couple, I was still super hairy after attempting to wax.  </li>
<li> I tried cutting some strips in half but it seemed like they worked better whole</li>
<li> I got it home, opened it, and was a little surprised to see how runny it was.</li>
<li> I had to nearly burn and rub my skin so hard to get the wax off that the area is still red and stinging a day later.</li>
<li> These are not completely painless, no wax will ever feel painless.</li>
<li> this coming from someone waxing for so long</li>
<li> Complete waste of money n time.</li>
<li> Literally not one single hair came off.</li>
<li> Simply rubbing these between you hands won&#x27;t work, the strips will rip half way through.</li>
<li> I followed the instructions carefully and only about half the hair was removed.</li>
<li> I have to wax an area 3-4 times before all the hair is gone which makes it even more painful.</li>
<li> Such a waste of money.</li>
<li> With my qualities of bravery/hard work ethic, I expected Sally Hansen to hold up her end of the deal:</li>
<li> product seems dried out, strips don&#x27;t peel apart properly even when fully warmed.</li>
<li> I tried the other side.</li>
<li> So I&#x27;m an african American woman with very thick hair</li>
<li> /&gt;It says it&#x27;s less painful, but actually, it irritated my skin much more than the hard wax.</li>
<li> , i feel like it hurt less than other wax ive used.</li>
<li> Once actually waxing, the strips hardly remove any hair at all.</li>
<li> I have given these new &amp;#34;ouch relief&amp;#34; strips three chances and am now certain I hate them.</li>
<li> Absolutely not worth the time, effort, and pain.</li>
<li> wax doesn&#x27;t come off with the strip, despite following instructions (I know how to wax) and obviously hardly any hair comes off; the strips rip half the time, too.</li>
<li> Seriously, I counted 7 hairs in the entire strip after I removed it.</li>
<li> Way less fuss and mess.</li>
<li> No matter how long I rubbed these things in my hands, when I pulled the paper apart the wax was still hard as  rock and would not stick to any hair.  </li>
<li> Not sure why the other reviewers didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
<li> you have a little patience these strips work quite well.</li>
<li> they lose a little moisture and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
<li> this product is a waste of money.</li>
<li> That might work for blond people but if you have dark hair it seems pointless</li>
<li> /&gt;It is messy and not effective.&lt;br</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on these strips.</li>
<li> WHAT I DO MIND: these strips are a waste of time</li>
<li> I am super disappointed in the product and do not recommend it at all.</li>
<li> Tip: if you do not rub them long enough the cold wax will not get any hairs and it will hut and hairs will not come off.</li>
<li> You have to keep going at it, and it&#x27;s painful from the first attempt -</li>
<li> not sure why others said they needed to apply wax.</li>
<li> So to recap: it is not effective, over-average painful rather than pain-free, and leaves damage - so much for what it promises!</li>
<li> Bad sticky mess only pulled out a couple hairs save your money !</li>
<li> Wow this was a seriously painful experience.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the product caused a lot of pain and had little gain.</li>
<li> Like someone else mentioned, these will probably work for someone with hardly any hair or thin hair.</li>
<li> Not only does this crap not remove the hair, but you can hardly even pull the strips apart without them breaking!</li>
<li> And it leaves a thin, shiny layer of wax behind.</li>
<li> I followed the directions and applied it thinly, placed the strip on, and pulled it off.</li>
<li> This product sucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it works for people with thin hair or something.</li>
<li> i think some people may have confused this product because these strips already come with the wax on.</li>
<li> Absolutely useless, worse waxing product I have ever bought (I bought the heat-in-a-pot</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This did not work out for me, unfortunately. I agree with all the bad reviews on this product. I ended up having to microwave the strips for 40 seconds. Simply rubbing these between you hands won&#x27;t work, the strips will rip half way through. Like someone else mentioned, these will probably work for someone with hardly any hair or thin hair. I used almost the entire box trying to remove the hair on my arms and I still had hair left over.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this product and let me say I am hurting. I used all of the precautions and heated up the wax to the right temperature and everything but EVERY time I would go to pull it away a ton of wax would be left on my skin. I had to nearly burn and rub my skin so hard to get the wax off that the area is still red and stinging a day later. This is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to find a wax that didn&#x27;t need to be microwaved. I got it home, opened it, and was a little surprised to see how runny it was. I followed the directions and applied it thinly, placed the strip on, and pulled it off. Literally not one single hair came off. I tried the other side. Same. Nothing. I am super disappointed in the product and do not recommend it at all. The only hair I can imagine this would effectively remove would be hair that was going to fall out anyway.  Save your $10.</li>
    <li> Not sure why the other reviewers didn&#x27;t like it. Worked very well for me and I have coarse hair. Easy too, I&#x27;m a spa girl and spend too much money on stuff like this great to have this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times and I think it&#x27;s pretty good. One thing I started doing a while ago which has been helped is that I warm up the strips with a hair dryer - it just takes a few seconds and the wax gets nice and warm.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using the Nad&#x27;s strips before but I don&#x27;t like them because they don&#x27;t pull the hairs out all the way - they just break them right at the surface. That might work for blond people but if you have dark hair it seems pointless - you might at well just shave.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a little patience these strips work quite well.</li>
    <li> I could not get these strips to remove any hair at all.  No matter how long I rubbed these things in my hands, when I pulled the paper apart the wax was still hard as  rock and would not stick to any hair.  I even tried putting one in the microwave and I removed a couple of hairs that way, and I literally mean a couple, I was still super hairy after attempting to wax.  I bought 2 boxes and feel like I just threw my money away.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m an african American woman with very thick hair so I decided to use this for my underarms. I used the pain free wipe, waited 10 mins and got started. 20 mins and 5 double sided waxing strips later I finished one armpit.... Barley. After I applied the azulene oil(the after oil) and it burned and irritated and made my underarms so sore I had to ice them.  It says to use one day before event I&#x27;d suggest 2. Pain free waxing doesn&#x27;t exist. This just made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for 20+ years now. Love the Sally Hansen wax, but not THIS one. You smear on the wax and pull the strip off--probably about 25% of the hair comes off. And it leaves a thin, shiny layer of wax behind. No matter how many times I put a strip on it, it doesn&#x27;t come off. Like I said, I&#x27;m a waxing pro now.. this product is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> You have to warm up the wax strips (by rubbing them between your hands as directed) a lot, and peel the strips apart painfully slowly. Once actually waxing, the strips hardly remove any hair at all. Absolutely not worth the time, effort, and pain. Definetly do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This semiliquid wax doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;It is messy and not effective.&lt;br /&gt;It says it&#x27;s less painful, but actually, it irritated my skin much more than the hard wax.</li>
    <li> Absolutely useless, worse waxing product I have ever bought (I bought the heat-in-a-pot version)&lt;br /&gt;The wax doesn&#x27;t come off with the strip, despite following instructions (I know how to wax) and obviously hardly any hair comes off; the strips rip half the time, too. You have to keep going at it, and it&#x27;s painful from the first attempt - this coming from someone waxing for so long I barely feel it anymore. Obviously develops irritation as a result. So to recap: it is not effective, over-average painful rather than pain-free, and leaves damage - so much for what it promises! The only saving grace being that it rinses off with water - thankfully, since the wax doesn&#x27;t come off.&lt;br /&gt;Stay clear off this product.</li>
    <li> Bad sticky mess only pulled out a couple hairs save your money !</li>
    <li> I highly recommend!!! This product is very easy to use and effective. It comes with wax already on the strips. You rub two strips between your hand to slightly warm and then peel them apart. There is no messy wax application at all. Use the included oil on a cotton pad or cotton ball and rub all over to soothe skin and remove excess wax. I tried cutting some strips in half but it seemed like they worked better whole so I do not recommend cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why others said they needed to apply wax. Maybe they are referring to a different product...?</li>
    <li> Wow this was a seriously painful experience. Unfortunately, the product caused a lot of pain and had little gain. I followed the instructions carefully and only about half the hair was removed. My skin is still tingling and stinging from the pain of an hour ago! Very painful process, I do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care about Ouch Relief. I just wanted efficient body-size waxing strips to quickly wax my legs. I chose these bc im exploring which are the best cold wax strips. Not these lol. I don&#x27;t mind putting in the effort of rubbing the strips btwn my hands. I dont mind any pain when I do rip off the strip. WHAT I DO MIND: these strips are a waste of time (and there&#x27;s a LOOOONG To-Do list!!)! With my qualities of bravery/hard work ethic, I expected Sally Hansen to hold up her end of the deal: what the hell...these strips leave stray hairs everywhere. I had to go over it with the remaining strips. Then, shave those rebel strays these low-quality wax refuses to remove a 2nd time around. I&#x27;ve waxed before, and I&#x27;m objective--in all fairness, I do like Sally Hansen Hair Remover Wax Strip Kit for Face, Brows &amp; Bikini, 34 Strips (17- Double Sided Strips)--the wax strips take off mostly all my hair. I wish they manufactured this one I just mentioned in large wax strips, not 3 diff sizes, with only a few being large.</li>
    <li> says not to use on face, but I cut them into 4&#x27;s and use them on my face no prob.  heat with blow dryer before use.</li>
    <li> This is terrible. I just bought it today from CVS cause I couldn&#x27;t find the original one that I usually get (Sally Hansen except not the ouch-relief.&lt;br /&gt;The wax wouldn&#x27;t warm up between my hands like I&#x27;m used to so I even tried putting it over some hot water and the wax melts a little but can barely get any hair off. Really wish I could return it. Such a waste of money. DONT USE THIS.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. This is a horrible product that dies not work, at all. I&#x27;ve been waxing for 30 years do there isn&#x27;t much to wax. Didn&#x27;t matter. The strips do not adhere to your skin so how can they remove anything. Amazon you should discontinue selling this garbage. It doesn&#x27;t serve you any purpose. If I&#x27;d bought from you I&#x27;d be returning for a refund.</li>
    <li> Love them. But put in a ziploc baggy and they last longer! Don&#x27;t ask me how or why, I&#x27;ve just noticed if I leave them in the box they lose a little moisture and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> These strips barely remove any hair. Seriously, I counted 7 hairs in the entire strip after I removed it. I am a big fan of the Sally Hansen wax strips for face (the ones with the clear wax) and have been using them for years. I wish they made that product in larger sheets for legs.</li>
    <li> I have waxed with real melted wax and with both these wax strips and veet brand wax strips. I have to say that even tho they do not work as perfectly as the melted wax, they still work pretty good. I feel like their pain relief towlettes that come in there did work, i feel like it hurt less than other wax ive used. My skin did not get bumpy and irritated as with real wax and they are not messy at all. i think some people may have confused this product because these strips already come with the wax on. Tip: if you do not rub them long enough the cold wax will not get any hairs and it will hut and hairs will not come off. This happened the first time ive used these. So rub 15-20 seconds. That worked for me. These are not completely painless, no wax will ever feel painless.</li>
    <li> This product sucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it works for people with thin hair or something. It just did not work for me I am very disappointed and I followed the directions to the T. The product advertisement is very misleading. This should have 0 stars but since it worked from minority and not majority it has a lil bit more than it should have.</li>
    <li> I would never recomend this to anyone. Complete waste of money n time. Really suprised how they are saying #1selling product in USA?</li>
    <li> I was allured to this product because it&#x27;s supposedly pain-free even though id been using the Sally Hansen hair removing wax strips for a couple years with contentment. I have given these new &amp;#34;ouch relief&amp;#34; strips three chances and am now certain I hate them. The pain is the exact same as with the other wax strips but without the effective hair removal! I have to wax an area 3-4 times before all the hair is gone which makes it even more painful. The directions say to do it a day before any &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; but you should really make it like 5 days because you&#x27;re gonna be going back for missed hairs more than once. Not only does this crap not remove the hair, but you can hardly even pull the strips apart without them breaking! I spend a full minute rubbing these useless things between my hands and they apparently still don&#x27;t get warm enough to pull apart easily or cleanly. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on these strips. Opt for Sally hansens other wax strips, they&#x27;re way better at removing the hair.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Much better than using hot wax.  Way less fuss and mess.</li>
    <li> product seems dried out, strips don&#x27;t peel apart properly even when fully warmed.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen has always been my favorite in wax strips. I never expect a salon-quality result from a box of wax strips used at home. These ones are particularly great because the strips are a soft and flexible material, not plastic, so you get better contouring to your skin. I&#x27;m giving four stars because these aren&#x27;t really good if you just follow the instructions of rubbing between your palms—unless you&#x27;ve got really warm palms! Instead, I put mine in top of something hot, like the radiator or the hot water urn, for five minutes until the wax has melted. The wax actually has to melt and be warm to catch hair properly. (But make sure not to burn your skin, either.) Other than that, these strips and the rest of the instructions do a clean job of removing fine to average—not thick/stubborn—hair.</li>
