      <li>Love the color on my dark skin.</li>
      <li>The picture on the website makes it seem more black, but in natural sunlight it looks like a really dark brown with a bit of sparkle to it.  </li>
      <li>The red shimmer only really shows up in well lighted areas.</li>

    <li> The picture on the website makes it seem more black, but in natural sunlight it looks like a really dark brown with a bit of sparkle to it.  In fluorescent light (i.e. bathroom, office) it looks more black.  I bought this along with Black Cherry Chutney and I Vant to Bite Your Neck.  This wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted, but it is still very nice and I will add it to my rotation.  It&#x27;s suitable for the office and out of office.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this color for YEARS and I just bought a bottle for my BFF and she loves it!  You have to apply two coats but it is a brownish/red color... Very pretty!</li>
    <li> This picture doesn&#x27;t show how red/burgundy this polish actually is. I thought I was receiving a black polish with reddish sparkles. the polish actually goes on and looks like a red wine color with sparkles.</li>
    <li> Love my opi love this color it&#x27;s like black red</li>
    <li> Oh a new favorite!  I like give me more but this one is so strange.  It changes under different lights</li>
    <li> Beautiful , have it on right now, it wears good doesn&#x27;t chip</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish... long lasting wear and great color..little on the high side but well worth it*</li>
    <li> Love the color, great site to stock up on hard to find colors. I would consider it a black red.</li>

    <li> Prompt delivery, excellent product</li>
    <li> Just the color I wanted! It goes with everything and is great on the toes too. Good color for winter too!</li>
    <li> I love this color.  Only wish it came in the OPI Axxium color line.  It is a deep crimson color w/black background.  Very pretty.  Sparkles in the sunlight too.  Very happy with this purchase and the seller.</li>
    <li> OPI has created another winner! This shade screams soirée!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rather dark for my personal taste. But it&#x27;s okay every now and then. The red shimmer only really shows up in well lighted areas.</li>
    <li> My trademark nail polish because it matches everything! This has easy applicant and long durability without chipping- it doesn&#x27;t look goth. buy from amazon it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> not the color I expected but still love it !</li>
    <li> Absolutely love, love, love this POLISH. 2 coats and good to go. ALOT OF depth to the shine.</li>
    <li> Love the color on my dark skin. Product was just as described. No complaints</li>
    <li> Great color. Looks a tad bit lighter than in the photo but it&#x27;s still a lovely color! I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite polish. I wear it year round.</li>

    <li> I Love this nail polish.  It never chips or cracks no matter what I put it through.  I&#x27;m very Happy</li>
    <li> Met my expectations. Love it!</li>
