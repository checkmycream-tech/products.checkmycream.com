<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, I bought these for my wedding guests as I had an outside wedding. They definitely kept the mosquitoes away, with a wonderful scent.......an extra bonus. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> HAVE USED SKIN SO SOFT FOR YEARS, THESE TOWELETTES WORK GREAT, VERY CONVIENT, KIDS CAN EASILY USE THEM, NICE NICE</li>
    <li> Easy to carry and kid friendly smells good and I have it anywhere anytime I need it. No evil chemicals</li>
    <li> I use these every summer.  They also keep away flies. One wipe is all you need to protect your body from head to toe; I even use it on my face. Non-greasy. Pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> And it smells good. Safer &amp; easier to carry than a can of Off. The size of the wipes is pretty decent.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve found to repel bugs. Easy to store and apply. One wipe is enough to apply one application on an adult and child. It&#x27;s not greasy and smells good.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to so many bug be gone products, but not Avon&#x27;s skin-so-soft, so I thought I would try this product.  It did not work for me.  I itched  to death.  Take stock in Allergy medicine.  I took enough of it, but the itch went away and I will continue to try Avon&#x27;s products.  Some of them really work.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing insect repellant. Non-toxic, good for your skin and smells nice. The packets are great to carry in your pocket or purse to use when needed. I live in the mid-Atlantic region and we&#x27;re swamped with mosquitos almost year round and they attack me constantly. I&#x27;ve used Skin So Soft years ago before they realized the amazing results for bug repellant and it&#x27;s still my only choice. These packets have saved my skin! Everything arrived on time and I&#x27;m very pleased with the service.</li>
    <li> Original purchase was to use in Costa Rica.  Have also used this product in our low country (coastal area) where mosquitoes are rumored to be kept as very large pets.  Worked well in both locations.  Very nice to be able to carry a packet around in your pocket, and apply the product in very specific locations rather than having to use a spray.  Also used on our grandchildren with good results.  Four stars for not working at 100%, but 95-99% is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Easy storage, easy carry and easy application as well as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very handy on the fly to carry in the pocket until you actually need the protection.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Handy to pack and take on vacation instead of the bulky bottles.  Shared some of them with friends.</li>
    <li> I was dreading the bugs that I would encounter in Costa Rica so I bought multiple forms and brands of bug spray. However, I ended up only using this product and it worked! At around 5:00 the bugs would get really bad so I would change into a long sleeve shirt and then I would apply the wipes to the rest of my body that was exposed.  I ended up only getting 1 bit on my leg and I was there for 14 days! Meanwhile, my fiance who didn&#x27;t use the bug spray got bit all over his legs! These wipes were super easy to put on and I could put them on anywhere! Plus, the smell is strong but it is more of a strong citrus smell than a chemical one. I didn&#x27;t mind it. I highly recommend these wipes!</li>
    <li> We took this on hiking trips/backpacking trips this summer so far so good. No bug bites on any of the trips however, we went later in the season without going through hordes of mosquitoes that might require deet.  However, I like using this instead when possible.</li>
    <li> This product works as an insect resistant as well as a skin softener.  These little containers enable you to put a little insect repellent in your bag and take it along in case of dry skin or insect attacks.</li>
    <li> I took these to Hawaii and they worked perfectly. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about taking them on the plane, it was easy to apply, smell is WAY better than most repellents, and they work great. I did not get bit once! There was a day when I had put it on in the morning and ended up hiking through a botanical garden late in the day. I had forgotten to put one in my bag to re-apply, and was super nervous I was going to get bit because there were mosquitoes everywhere. It still worked, I didn&#x27;t get one bite. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> These are great for travel!  I take them with me for trips to the southern climes, and my colleagues are delighted when they forget their spray and I can just offer them one of these from my purse!  The odor is not too strong.  Since these are applied with your hands, you probably want to wash your hands before eating.</li>
    <li> We are in the Kettle Moraine State Forest (Southern Unit), we get a lot of water and horrible mosquitos; Avon Skin SO Soft has done the trick for us...I was absolutely skeptical, but literally these wipes became like liquid gold in our house; being hidden in drawers for future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is a cancer survivor, so I was afraid to use anything with DEET or other harmful chemicals. These seemed far less scary to me than other sprays.</li>
    <li> Great- we used it for adults only because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was kid friendly like the other bug guests we purchased that&#x27;s meant for kids but overall I did not get a bite and so we were very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a Bug Guard that was not sticky, smelly or just plan awful to use. We go out to dinner and like to eat outside but I get eaten up by who-knows-what under the table all over my legs and ankles. It&#x27;s terrible. So a friend told me Avon now makes a specific bug guard and I checked them all out and all the reviews where extremely helpful in making my decision as to which one to pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had sprayed my legs with the SSSBG+ Spray(same as the Towelettes) one night before I went out and met friends for dinner. I popped a SSSBG+ Towelette in my purse in case I needed more.  Well my friends were getting eaten alive so I offered the SSSBG+ Towelette which they gladly took and where surprised how good it smelled and most importantly - the bitting stopped!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave one in my purse all the time now - so convenient and the fact they are quite large they go a long way.</li>
    <li> keeps away no-seeums and biting insects. I will buy more in the future. Worth every penny when the bugs are out.</li>
    <li> Went to the 10,000 lakes region, Mosquito&#x27;s are the State Bird there, had an outdoor BBQ did not get bit once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing ever, everyone wanted to know what I used.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective bug repellant and it is easy to store, carry, and use. if you are a backpacker, fisherman, or just an ordinary hiker you will like the towelettes.</li>
    <li> Great to pack away a few of these in your car or backpack. I have used these when at my sons soccer games when the Alabama gnats and mosquitoes come around. These keep them away!</li>
    <li> Disappointing does not work</li>
    <li> These wipes are great for families and for travel.  We&#x27;ve used them in Taiwan, Korea, and Indonesia and they keep the &amp;#34;mosquitos on steroids&amp;#34; at bay.  We&#x27;ve found that a single wipe will cover 1.5 - 2 average sized adults, wearing tanks and shorts.  We apply these wipes per the instructions, and also wear repelling stickers to keep everyone extra safe.</li>
    <li> I bought it based on availability of the product.  Exactly what I was looking for,. These are great for golf</li>
    <li> On the 4th of July, we used this and some people we were with used OFF, they were getting eaten alive and we did get one bite. The wipes are so convenient too. Years ago I used the original bottled formula for a trip to Costa Rica where the bugs are the size of small cars, with equal effectiveness. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff!</li>
    <li> Keeps mosquitoes from biting, however, does not last very long...no greasy feeling on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I suffer from mosquitoe bites, I develop large welts that itch horrible. This little towelette keeps the litte buggers away. I wipe any exposed skin with the towelette, then replace it in it&#x27;s little pouch. One towelette lasts me several days. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps the bugs off and away. Some sneak in but are taken care of in a few minutes. I would recommend to anyone. I used this when I was a youngster. Now 64.</li>
    <li> Bought before a trip to Cuba and the did a great job keeping the bugs away without smelling like bug spray.  In fact I had several people ask what scent I was wearing.  These are super moist and each wipe could easily cover 4+ people.</li>
    <li> Used these wipes in Panama and they kept the mosquitoes at bay for 3 out of 4 family members.  They don&#x27;t small bad and they don&#x27;t irritate the skin.  Easy to open pouch and easy to slip into a purse.  For three family members it was all we used to kepp all the bugs away. For one member nothing worked reallly well (including deet, b1 patches, sprays, repellent clothing etc.. so I don&#x27;t blame the avon product. Much gentler on the skin then other products like deet sprays. Would use again</li>
    <li> I bought these in combination with the Skin So Soft BUG GUARD in the pump spray, and the Skin So Soft BUG GUARD plus sunscreen.  I have heard of Skin So Soft being the best thing for bug repellant.  I always forget I should get bug spray when leaving for a trip, only remember AFTER I&#x27;ve gotten bitten up.  Because I can&#x27;t get it at a store, I forget about it.  I have been hearing about it for about 14 years (sell travel to tropical locales).  This time (Costa Rica bound for twice yearly trip) I planned ahead and bought it.  It came in handy to throw these in my bag.  We had ourselves plus 2 adult kids, so was great to have on hand for everybody when out and about.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not as good as DEET, but it doesn&#x27;t have DEET, either.  It works well enough and better than most repellents.</li>
    <li> So far have had limited experience with it, only the towelette. However, it has a lovely, light fragrance and my past experience with Avon&#x27;s repellents has been tops.</li>
    <li> So great for trips to mosquito infested areas of the world. The only thing greater is just not visiting those spots!</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for the mosquito&#x27;s in Asia.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with these wipes!  I am a &amp;#34;bug magnet&amp;#34; but am allergic to deet, so I needed to find something that was deet-free but still worked well, and this product was it.  Smells good, too!</li>
    <li> I take these to Jamaica every year to help keep mosquitoes and no see ums away.&lt;br /&gt;Convenient for packing if you only bring a carry on!&lt;br /&gt;One cloth is enough for your entire body and they seem to keep the bugs away!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for over ten years.  They keep mosquitoes and tiny flying insects away.  I also use the spray form on my pant legs, socks, and shoes to keep the ticks off.  Works as well as DEET, without the toxins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several repellents for mosquitoes, every one of them a disappointment.  I really need a good (natural) repellent, I don&#x27;t like all those chemical ones that just make me cough, cause they are toxic in of itself.  Its really hard to find a good one.  Avon Skin so Soft Bug Guard only worked to a degree.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I use this product when I travel and when I work in my garden.  I am very allergic to any number of bug bites and am often the only person at the picnic or cookout or beach party who gets bites.  I have found over the years that it&#x27;s best to take steps before and protect myself.  Avon Skin so Soft works fine and it smells nice, too.  Their most recent formula isn&#x27;t that deep blue-green color;  it looks like regular lotion, and I prefer it.</li>
    <li> These towelettes are perfect for hikes during mosquito season; they take up no room and protect you from bites beautifully.</li>
    <li> I bought these for travel to an island. It is practical since I can just bring one sachet if I go somewhere and leave the rest in my luggage. I can use it anytime I want and put it back in plastic bag. i have not use this kind before, but can imagine it makes sense.</li>
    <li> Love having these little packs with me wherever I go&#x3D;too expensive&#x3D;but very convenient.  I carry them in my poo-poo pick-up bag along with the paper towels &amp; &#x27;magic soap&#x27; while walking my dogs</li>
    <li> Used in Alaska in mosquito season.  Used on exposed areas and never got bit once.  They won&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I hear that this product works great and my cousin was so thankful to get it since going out in Florida was tough with all the mosquitoes.  Quick delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. It smells nice and it was easy to apply to the face (no sucking up spray). I did not get bit on any of the areas I used this product so I would recommend. It does what it says and makes you smell nice too!</li>
    <li> Product works very well against biting bugs here in the Florida Keys.  But, like most, it&#x27;s not 100% effective.  The bugs will find the spots you missed.</li>
    <li> Overall the product works got here fast and &amp;#34;if&amp;#34; I remember to put it on before taking the dog out for a walk keeps the no see um away</li>
    <li> I attract biting bugs like you would not believe.  I carry these towelettes in my purse because I never know when I am going to be walking around outside .... I always have them.  It has saved me many times.</li>
    <li> My daughter was going to Hati and came across these,she said they were very helpful but the bugs were terrible but she said she could not do without them,very nice,and fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> Smells really bad.  Helps keep the bugs away, but everyone stays away because it smells soooooo bad.  I wouldn&#x27;t special order this again because it didn&#x27;t work well enough to make the cost worth it.</li>
    <li> I swear by these when I&#x27;m traveling. My boyfriend sometimes gets his bug gunk taken at the airport then we never manage to get him another bottle when we get where we&#x27;re going, but these towelettes never get grabbed. Airports love them. They&#x27;re moist enough to get the whole body (and then pass on to the boy to fill in for his confiscated bug gunk). Also, I&#x27;m a mosquito magnet, I was in a really bad region for it eating outdoors during dusk every evening. An application before dinner and an application after and I&#x27;m good. A shower before bed is nice though, leaving this stuff on all night is questionable.</li>
    <li> I used these regularly throughout the mosquito season.  They are convenient, easy to apply, and they repel mosquitos as well as any Deet product I&#x27;ve used.  Plus, they don&#x27;t leave a chemical smell.  To maximize use, we cut smaller strips for use.  This way, I can use one towelette for me, my wife, and my two kids.  Excellent product that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I find that these do the job. An enjoyable night out with no bugs bothering us. The odor is a bit strong for my tastes. The cloths are very damp, making it easy to use on 1 adult and 1 child!</li>
    <li> These are great to keep in my purse for impromptu outdoor play. My 2 year old is a mosquito magnet, and this DEET free repellent actually works on him.</li>
    <li> Brought these on a trip to Mexico. Mosquito were literally swarming us and the 10 of us remained bite free except for the spots we missed. It is like sunscreen, miss a spot and they will find it. I get eaten alive regularly and this has been the best product I have found. Note one towelettes worked on multiple people.</li>
    <li> I was very hopeful these wipes would work on my 3-year-old mosquito magnet little boy, especially because I thought the scent was pleasant. One wipe was plenty to cover all his exposed skin, but he was bitten on the face and both legs anyway. Maybe these work on some types of mosquitoes, but they don&#x27;t deter the ones in our Mississippi yard. I will stick with Tender Ben&#x27;s wipes despite their deet smell.[[ASIN:B001GAOIME Tender Ben&#x27;s 30% Deet 12-count Travel Wipes]]</li>
    <li> Though a bit expensive, these absolutely work keeping the bugs away while hiking in the woods. Easy to put in pocket or bag you would take with you walking in case you forget to apply before your walk.</li>
    <li> Very good product; easily carried.</li>
    <li> The active ingredient for bug repellent is the only approved ingredient for babies... it&#x27;s nice having a safe option to keep bugs away for the little ones.  And it smells great too</li>
    <li> Works great and smells great (unlike most bug repellent)</li>
    <li> I use this on me and on my dog to prevent ticks and it works like a charm!!!! Will be buying more soon!!!</li>
    <li> Loved these. They work and the wipe is easier to use then the spray. Wish there were more in the bag.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it yet, but hoping it will work great</li>
    <li> Many other products are either too strong for my toddler or don&#x27;t work on her. This seems to be doing the job!</li>
    <li> Smell too strong for children.</li>
    <li> This is the best repellent!  If there&#x27;s a bug within a mile, it will find me.  This works.  It is not greasy and has a pleasant, but not strong smell.</li>
    <li> Daughter took these to Alaska...convenient</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan.  My boyfriend and I can share the very large wipe and moments after applying it our skin the mosquitos stop biting us.  Using the pads compared to the spray seems less wasteful, since you are applying them directly to your skin.  The package contain eight towelette packets so, it is very easy to throw one in your purse and always be prepared.</li>
    <li> these are perfect for babies when you don&#x27;t want to spray around them. Love having these in purse or diaper bag.</li>
    <li> I like the individual packages. Keeps the bugs away. Not too fragrant. Easy application.</li>
    <li> Towelettes are so handy.</li>
    <li> these are great patches even if they&#x27;re a bit smelly.  They work great in forest type settings and insect prone areas</li>
    <li> Amazingly this kept me from getting a single bite from multiple odd bugs when I was recently in southern Mexico. I was there for a wedding and every guest was covered in bites (dozens, mind you). Normally bugs and mosquitos flock to me like fresh fruit on a hot day, but this time was different. I absolutely love these wipes, they get through airport security, are super convenient and am so glad I found them on Amazon! Thanks in large part to previous reviewers. They come individually packaged and one wipe is enough to get your whole body, head to toe, but you have to work fast. There is a somewhat herbal smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and is easily covered by a perfume.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my trip to Costa Rica and it really worked well!  I hardly got any bug bites!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My son got Lyme disease back when no one knew how to diagnose it and that has been a long journey. His wife, my daughter in law, has done lots of research and told me to start using these towelettes to repel deer ticks. She said the spray is also good but for some reason the towelettes repel deer ticks better. I play golf where there is tall grass and lots of deer, and usually I just don&#x27;t go in the tall grass after a stray ball, but when I&#x27;m tempted I use the towelettes. I also use the pump to spray my shoes because it&#x27;s hard to use the towelettes on shoes.</li>
    <li> I use Skin so Soft bath oil in my horse&#x27;s fly spray \\&quot;recipe\\&quot; and these towlettes for my horses face, ears and nose (and my own) before a trail ride- really effective and easy to use since they are individually wrapped- the price is competitive and the delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> Thanks for having this product so handy on the internet.  I enjoy the ease of ordering online and easy payment arrangements</li>
    <li> These really work for us.  The wipes allow for much more thorough coverage, and if you fold them back up and return them to the pkg. (folding the top over and clipping it shut), you can often get a second use out of them.</li>
    <li> We have bought these two summers in a row.  We go to a pool that has a lot of mosquitoes around it and we go to the beach in Texas.  It keeps away all the little nasties!  It&#x27;s not water-proof, but it actually works still if you get slightly wet or sweaty.  We don&#x27;t get bit at all with this.  When we use the natural sprays from the store, they are worthless and the stink.  We spray them on and our lungs get more of the spray than our skin.  These wipes make it easy, they smell great, and we can use 1 wipe for a couple applications.  There is a lot of liquid in the pouch a little extra once you pull the wipe out, so we put the wipe back in the pouch for another application.  No more nasty smelling bug spray that you have to keep applying.</li>
    <li> It is possible it may keep away some type of mosquitoes ...not the ones we encountered so far.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I use it on my horse&#x27;s face and chest.  It works, somewhat.  I expected better results, but we have had a very wet year.  I would say it keeps about 70% of the bugs away, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> We purchased this product to have on hand for guests at an outdoor wedding.  While testing it (prior to the wedding) we found that it worked very well.  Initally it feels sticky and makes the skin shiny, but that goes away in a short while.  We also found that one towelette could cover the arms and faces of four adults, which seems very wasteful (minus one star).</li>
    <li> I used these wipes while vacationing in the BVI&#x27;s. They definitely minimized the number of bites received however I did still get a few. I don&#x27;t know if that is due to lack of effectiveness of the product or if I&#x27;m so delicious bugs were willing to die to bite me.</li>
    <li> This product works great for me. I use it when I travel internationally to places where mosquitoes are a problem. When I use it I do not get bit!</li>
    <li> I am /extremely/ prone to mosquitoes. I&#x27;m that one person in the group that attracts all the mosquitoes away from other people.  And when I get bit, it typically swells to gross proportions because I&#x27;m allergic. I&#x27;ve been using Avon Expedition bugspray (the green bottle), which has worked fantastically for when I&#x27;m out hiking or working.  But it started to fail when I was just sitting outside, not moving around, after dusk for a bbq. I was given one of these towelettes and it protected me for the rest of the night.  One sheet is very wet, and you get a nice moist layer on your skin, which dries eventually. Some people might not like that it&#x27;s not \\&quot;dry\\&quot; like some sprays, but at my susceptibility, I welcome effective relief at any cost.  Granted, I have only used these towelettes twice before mosquito season was over, but they worked completely both times. Will update for future experiences.</li>
    <li> service was great and product is great.  THanks</li>
    <li> I brought these with me to China, where there are a lot of mosquitoes.  I used them and they smelled great and worked so well.  In fact, they worked a little too well!  My travelmates &amp;#34;borrowed&#x27; them until I had completely run out.  The only downside is that bugs will always find a vulnerable spot that doesn&#x27;t have any repellant - in my case it was my eyelid.  I think this would have happened with any repellant, since last I heard they don&#x27;t make any products that are safe for eyelids.</li>
    <li> just as advertised, fast shipping.  thanks.</li>
    <li> These things really work.  They are better then spraying bug spray everywhere. You get the perfect amount exactly where you want it. Went camping for 4 days and one wipe kept me free of bugs all day.</li>
    <li> I love these little packs. I live in an area with lots of mosquitos and I always carry a few of these in my purse - super handy! And they work really well. I never get bit while using these and I&#x27;m a magnets for biting insects.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Unlike the lotion-based product that leaves you feeling sticky or greasy with an unpleasant smell, this produce is alcohol based; it goes on without leaving any residue, smells better than the lotion, and works like a charm against mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks.  Great to apply before spending any time in the yard.  Lasts for a fairly long time.  Arrived safely and on time.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this produce, especially during spring/summer.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I especially like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to spray anything into the air, I just rub it into my skin.  It controls the bugs well, too.</li>
    <li> Keep these handy in my golf bag, beach bag and even my purse. Work well and smells nice. Safe for children.</li>
    <li> When I saw this product I was thrilled.  Three products in one.  What&#x27;s not to like?  Problem was the smell.  My husband is particularly sensitive to perfume.  He warned me that he&#x27;d had experience with fellow officers using this product during FEX [field exercises] when assigned to a Navy Construction Battalion and that the scent was overwhelming.  Sure enough the product hadn&#x27;t changed scent.  I gave it to a friend.  I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
    <li> Love having these on hand when in the yard as the critters attempt to &#x27;get&#x27; me.  I rub on the dogs&#x27; fur too!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I am a mosquito magnet and I was amazed! I have also used the lotion and love it. The convenience of the disposable sheets is a real plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always love Skin so Soft bug guard.</li>
    <li> I go bike riding on trails and this is great during the spring and summer when the bugs are all out.  Not a single bit with this product.  Not a strong smell at all.  I love the convenience of the pkgs.</li>
    <li> Great product to keep mosquitos away and very easy to keep handy! I keep them in my car and also bring them when camping. Love the convenience!</li>
    <li> Love these!  They come in handy packs that I can stuff in my purse or back pack.  The repellent works well, at least for the insects that I was bothered by.</li>
    <li> works better than most other repellents but some&lt;br /&gt;mosquitoes still get through!&lt;br /&gt;Works very well overall! Works even in tough conditions.</li>
    <li> Keeps the bugs away.Love Avon products!!</li>
    <li> I live in Florida so keeping the biting bugs off is crucial.  I like these because they are much easier to carry without spills.  The product works very well to keep the bugs away without making you smell like bug spray.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works</li>
    <li> So convenient to have this in the packets.  I carry them on my motorcycle and soooooo glad to have when the sun drops and the bugs come out!!!!</li>
    <li> The towel size is too big for our use. When we are using it we are fully clothed and need to apply the towel only to face, neck, part of hands and feet. We have cut the towel in half and saved one half back in the package. We have yet to find out if the saved sheet is useable when we need it next..</li>
    <li> I sent my son to camp with these and he had no bites on him.  He prefers these over being sprayed with stuff or even using the lotion so we use these all summer long.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t travel in teh south without major bug repellant. These were perfect as I didn&#x27;t have to worry about putting them in my carry on. They didn&#x27;t have a weird smell either.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell that great but seems to work against mosquitos.Reapply every 3 hours.Try not to miss a spot or you will still get bitten.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been widely known for years and years that Avon&#x27;s product called Skin So Soft was the premier mosquito and insect repellent.  Avon used to have fits that outdoor stores used to sell the products without being official \\&quot;distributors\\&quot; So now Avon wised up, and now the best of both worlds!  SSS (99%) and Picardin (10%)  I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough!</li>
    <li> Still a great product! Always has been and it smells much better than the other bug sprays! Would not hesitate to purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.....still was bitten by mosquitos</li>
    <li> We recently went on a two week trip to southeast Asia, and given that my wife usually gets eaten alive by mosquitos, I purchased this repellent along with four other kinds.  This was the best out of all of them, and by the second week we were only using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Flat out works.  Neither of us were eaten alive, much less bitten.  I did have one evening when I was out and about without this or any other repellent, and I regretted it greatly.&lt;br /&gt;- Very portable - you can carry these on a plane without any worries about the 3 ounce rule if you are traveling&lt;br /&gt;- Soft and moisturizing on skin - my wife has very sensitive skin, but she had no issues with this repellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I think you have to apply this more often than other types if you are going to have strenuous activity, but they are pretty portable to begin with&lt;br /&gt;- I suppose if you don&#x27;t like smelling a bit girly or prefer the smell of harsh chemicals, you should try another repellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be our go-to repellent for any of our mosquito-filled trips!</li>
    <li> I have already been using this product as the aerosol can and it really works.  I bought the wipes to take on vacation and to use with kids as I do not like spraying aerosol and them accidentally inhaling the product.  This product works better and smells better then any other we have tried-and we have tried everything!  My husband will even use this before some of the other products marketed towards men!</li>
    <li> See above.  The wipes work and are great to bring with you on a trip, like we did to Jamaica.</li>
    <li> Well, these do seem to work but you get the product all over your hands so be sure to wash up well after using.  Unfortunately, my dogs love the product and try to lick areas where it has been applied; that&#x27;s a problem since I doubt it is good for their health.  So you doggie people, be sure to keep away from them &#x27;cause they seem to \\&quot;love it\\&quot;.  Also, you will probably need more than one towelette for full coverage; depending upon your size and how much are you plan to treat.  Anyway, it has worked for me but it does have a strong odor.</li>
    <li> Liked this product, didn&#x27;t smell like some bug sprays.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use foil packs that you tuck in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this product through Amazon.</li>
    <li> It worked great out in Oklahoma when I was filming in Okmulgee, in the heat and humidity with the chiggers and ticks. I didn&#x27;t come home to the hotel with one bite on me. Seriously buy this!!! you will not go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Bugs, mosquitoes in particular, seem to be drawn to me so my doctor recommended Skin So Soft bug repellent products. I bought the towelettes and the spray and couldn&#x27;t be happier. My skin reacts very badly to bug bites, i.e. swelling, redness, etc. - and whenever I use the Skin So Soft, I am never bitten! It also has a great scent that does not wreak of that awful chemical smell that most bug sprays have. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from bug attraction overload!</li>
    <li> I guess I ordered this before our SA cruise but can&#x27;t find them, didn&#x27;t use them so I don&#x27;t know if we got them. We did get the aerosol spray and lotion and did use them and they did work in SA and the Amazon so I&#x27;m sure these towelettes would work also. We were gone 3 months so I&#x27;m sure it is too late to track them down now.</li>
    <li> Great stuff,always have it with me for camping or just working in the yard.So far no bug bites and smells good as well.</li>
    <li> The pouches are very handy since they are so portable.</li>
    <li> Love these for travel....no bad smell</li>
    <li> Used on our trip to Taiwan where the mosquito are ferocious. Easy to carry in backpack and&lt;br /&gt;to reapply when needed. Will buy more and keep around the house and on trips.</li>
    <li> The problem was the packets were enough to get part of my body, not quite all I needed covered. I had to use a whole packet several times a day, and I quickly ran out. It only lasted a few hrs, but while it did it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend remembering to keep a ziplock with you so you can partially use a sheet on , say, &amp;#34;renewing the coverage on your arms&amp;#34; several times before it drys out.</li>
    <li> We really like these towelettes! They are very effective for the no seeums that we have here in Florida. they are very easy to put on and do not leave a greasy, foul odor!</li>
    <li> Works great without the burning associated with other repellents. Conveniently sized for pockets or in a backpack. Definitely keeps the mosquitoes at bay.</li>
    <li> Worked most of the time in Costa Rica.  Kind of leaves a film on the skin that feels like your being smothered in the heat but it kept the bugs a bay, mostly.</li>
    <li> We purchased the sss towelettes for our 20 month old daughter. We live in Houston and the mosquitoes are relentless. I am not comfortable with products that include deet and this was recommended by her pediatrician. We have used it a couple times and so far I&#x27;m pleased. The towelettes are rather large so we may switch to the pump since we use it on our child. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad and for the time outdoors she was spared bites.  We are not outsoorsy because of the sweltering heat in Houston so not sure how it will work when camping, etc. The three stars is due to being charged twice for shipping even though both items were in the same package and weighted less than a pound. Ridiculous!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product to tuck into your sport bag or pocket for golf, tennis, beach, hiking, camping etc.  Convenient  and works very well.</li>
    <li> These are great! I didn&#x27;t want to open them at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were individually sealed within the main bag but when the time came to use one, I was pleased to find the towelettes each in their own sealed bag. This is a lightweight solution to throw in a day pack or purse or whatever as there&#x27;s no cap to leak, which for some reason seems to be a fault with many insect repellant dispensers. I think one towelette could cover two people since the one I used was still very moist after I applied it to my arms, legs and head/neck. The fragrance was not so strong that I&#x27;d remember it. Not too greasy either. Couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing it after an hour with the exception of the absence of bugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picaridin is not as effective as DEET but it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing poison either. If you&#x27;re going somewhere with biblical plagues of biting bugs and/or where the biting bugs are known to carry diseases (i.e. equatorial continental regions) I&#x27;d recommend something else like Jungle Juice with 98-100% DEET. These picaridin wipes are excellent for backpacking or back yards in dryer temperate areas where the bugs are just bad enough to warrant combat but not so bad that you need heavy artillery.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a safe bug repellent to keep Mosquitos at bay, but unfortunately this product serves better as a mosquito attractant. I&#x27;m not sure where all the positive reviews came from but this stuff is like candy for those miserable blood suckers. If you need an attractant for your bug zapper, then look no further. Thanks to amazon I will be returning this useless product.  My wife loves Avon products but this ones a dud.</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t have a local Avon rep so we buy these on line.  Towel can be used by 2 people and works great to repel bugs.</li>
    <li> My daughter took these to Costa Rica on a study abroad in the rain forest. She said they were fantastic. Every bit as good as the products with deet and they smelled better and didn&#x27;t leave her feeling sticky</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when Amazon offered this product. I had been searching for easy to carry, effective and easy-on-the-nose insect repellent by Avon. I knew Avon offered a great product but was pleased this was available on Amazon. I traveled to Jamaica with it and it sat easily in my purse. Very effective!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Fast shipping.  The wife and I carry the towelettes with us while hiking.  We also wipe it on our dogs when they are going outside.  Works wonders for the flys and mosquitos</li>
    <li> Best ever! I wouldn&#x27;t use any other bug spray on my family! Even after you use the wipe you can hang it over a chair and the bugs still stay away.</li>
    <li> My sister is allergic to deet and these provided the protection she needed.  She was bug bite free! :D</li>
    <li> I garden a lot. This year the mosquitoes have been especially vicious. The Avon Skin-so-Soft Bug Guard wipes have saved me from getting eaten alive. I also appreciate the lovely fragrance and ease of application. Try them ... you&#x27;ll be glad you did ! ! !</li>
