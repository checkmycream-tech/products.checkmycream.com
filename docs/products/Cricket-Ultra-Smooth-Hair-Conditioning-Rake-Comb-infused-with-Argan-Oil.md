      <li>It is so cheap  </li>
      <li>The comb leaves my hair smooth.  </li>
      <li>The teeth of the comb are polished smooth to help the comb glid through the hair and help prevent damage.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the Argan Oil actually comes out and gets into your hair, but this is a really nice, reasonably price comb for long wet hair detangling after shampooing and/or conditioning.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Good quality comb for brushing my hair after a shower. I have long fine hair and this gets the tangles out. This is the second time I&#x27;m buying this after losing it.</li>
    <li> love it! My hair has been so healthy.  I have been doing a lot of other things but this has helped a lot</li>
    <li> perfect, just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Really great hair tool!! Makes my hair feel very Silky and Smooth. I would recommend to anyone who wants more for their hair!!</li>
    <li> This is false advertisement. Don&#x27;t waste you time and money. This comb is not seamless nor is it smooth. It has blatant seams in the teeth and is not smooth. No it&#x27;s not expensive, but I hate being lied too.</li>
    <li> It does make my hair smoother.</li>
    <li> Only brush I use. Works great for low maintenance types. I use shampoo bars and ACV rinses, and wash my hair once a week, so I am very low maintenance as far as hair goes, and a quick brush thru with this between wash days is perfect. No more losing tons of hair down the drain!!!!</li>
    <li> this comb is so good! i have a wavy hair and when I use this comb it removes the tangles right away. I also love it because after I use it, it makes my dull hair a bit shiny, but not that shiny which is good because I dont like a very shiny hair. It is the best comb I have ever bought. You wont regret buying it. It is so cheap  yet it is worth the money! good quality too . i love it.</li>
    <li> Nothing really special about this comb. I do like it better than the combs I have got from Wal-Mart however. It has a nice coating on it and doesn&#x27;t tear my hair out. But it still made my hair a bit frizzy and staticy? (I know that&#x27;s not a word). I use this comb mostly after showing (it&#x27;s not recommended for the hair) but, when I am on the go this is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; comb.</li>
    <li> Good comb for hair in shower.</li>
    <li> The comb is smooth and seamless so it does a great job of detangling my hair after washing. I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it for the argan oil :-P. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything on its own so I&#x27;ll keep using a separate argan oil.</li>
    <li> It is NOT seamless!  I wish I had read through the reviews before buying.  It is a comb that is not seamless...period.</li>
    <li> Great comb.  Glides through my long hair wet or dry eliminating tangles. My hair looks silky, shiny and healthy. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have some difficult 3b curls and was having a bad hair day when I got my cricket in the mail. Having already brushed out most of the curl into frizzy volume in the morning and put it up in a topknot, I took it down to try the comb. After some tugging and pulling through snarls, which didn&#x27;t take long at all, I could actually start to see the curls begin to redefine. I would say it cut down frizz by about 1/3 from my absolute frizziest state dry. It did leave my hair noticeably shinier which I was happy with; it&#x27;s hard to get decent shine with curly hair without products or a glaze. When I try it wet I&#x27;ll update my post.</li>
    <li> Serviceable sturdy nicer than drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for curly hair...</li>
    <li> go for something with a handle -- slips easily out of wet hands and makes untangling hair even harder!</li>
    <li> I never knew a large comb would make such a difference on my hair. My hair is thick and long and hard to comb in the morning. I haven&#x27;t used a brush in years because it pulls my hair out. I decided to go with a really large comb and see how well it worked, it is amazing. It goes thru my hair easily and I loose a lot less hair everyday. I am a firm believer in this size comb now. Very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I mean it, you are going to love this comb, smooth and sleek.  It glides through long hair.  Seller, great.</li>
    <li> This comb arrived exactly as described; it has large, smooth, and nice wide teeth.  It does have seams, but they are minimal.</li>
    <li> Great for your brown baby. Wide teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this comb because it is argan oil infused. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday. I don&#x27;t feel anything special about it. But I give it a 3 star anyway because it is a good quality every day comb with nice color.</li>
    <li> This is the best detangling comb I&#x27;ve ever had! I have a lot of very long, fine hair that gets tangled very easily and this comb can glide right through it! It&#x27;s a lifesaver! I&#x27;ve had it for months now and it has definitely held up against normal wear and tear. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I like the comb a lot. I have been using it for a few months already. I have a lot of hair, and the comb is just perfect. The description says the product is infused with argan oil. I don&#x27;t know how they do it but the comb is excellent.</li>
    <li> Very good  stuff.........</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this comb and a non infused comb, but the quality of the plastic is good. It&#x27;s a good weight.</li>
    <li> Wow, This Comb Really Works... I bought this comb because I couldn&#x27;t find a wide-toothed comb to use on wet hair at the store. I had my doubts about the conditioning it was supposed to do, but was just glad to have found a comb. I was floored when i began using it, it really did move extra-smoothly throughvmy hair, it detangled better than the comb I was replacibg ever did and seemed to actually have the conditioning qualities that they claimed in the description. I&#x27;m an avid swimmer and especially appreciate how easily this comb moves through my very long, curly hair after a swim. I really recommend this comb and am very pleasantly surprised that it lives up to it&#x27;s description.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  Does exactly what it says it will.  Leaves my hair feeling great and silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. Leaves hair soft, without any build up. Imparts shine and is a perfect tooth width for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I read about this comb in a magazine and was skeptical of how a comb could be argan-oil infused and smooth my humidity -laden hair.  But I have found it really does have an effect.  It won&#x27;t be dramatic,  but it does contribute to a calmer set of locks.  I have medium - length hair and I like to use it right after I wash it (when wet) and then again after styling and just before heading out the door.</li>
    <li> Love this. Use it many times a week for detangling and extra conditioning. Does its job well without pulling or snagging hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for kids hair!! Detangled wonderfully!! Would definitely buy more!!</li>
    <li> Works fine, but I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s more special than the wide tooth combs for 99 cents at any superstore?</li>
    <li> A pleasure to use! It smooths tangles without pulling the hair.&lt;br /&gt; I bought several, and wish it came in a small purse size.</li>
    <li> The oil is just a gimmick. It&#x27;s solid plastic, do you really think it&#x27;s going to secrete conditioning oil every time you use it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a visible seam along the ends of the teeth, and between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this is HUGE: 6 inches by 3 inches. Maybe good if you have a big afro made of spaghetti.</li>
    <li> Very nice smooth wet comb that glides through hair and is great for travel. Not bad for the price at all. Would be perfect for the beach.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, sturdy, wide-toothed comb. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference from the supposed argan oil infused into the plastic--I figure it&#x27;s probably such a small amount that it makes no difference. My only problem with this item is that the plastic is rather soft and can be nicked rather easily if you keep the comb jumbled in a drawer with hairpins and brushes and other stuff. One of the teeth of my comb has a little gouge in it that catches my hair sometimes.</li>
    <li> I am so skeptical about combs, most times they never work, pull my hair out and stab my scalp with their pointy ends. This comb is none of those things, its very gentle on the scalp and actually detangles really well. I use it in the shower while my hair is wet and has conditioner in it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it. The big teeth makes it easy to comb your hair. We can&#x27;t really tell if the argan oil makes a difference, but we don&#x27;t really care. It was a good price since I couldn&#x27;t find any in store similar.</li>
    <li> very good,smooth,good quality,recommend</li>
    <li> works great on not pulling out my hair</li>
    <li> Great comb, tamed frizzy hair, no static. I saw a difference in comparison to using a regular plastic comb. Wish I had a comb like this all these years.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair. This comb is excellent for a wet or dry comb through. Its great for knots. But for smoothing with Argon Oil...not so much. I cant even tell that this comb is infused with Argon Oil other than when I touch it; there is no evidence in my hair no matter how much I comb through; hence the reason for 2 stars. I&#x27;d still buy it again, but for knots, not smoothing by Argon Oil.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this comb. My hair tends to tangle and this comb does a nice job of just gliding thorugh my hair without pulling or causing me to tug at it. Although its infused with Argan Oil it does not leave your hair greasy or oily. The teeth is wide enough to go through any hair type wet or dry. Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair, this is the one!</li>
    <li> Nice comb, not too heavy.  Seems to be very sturdy.  I can&#x27;t really tell if feels infused with any oils as stated, but it feels nice and doesn&#x27;t pull out hair.  Good comb for the price.</li>
    <li> Ordered four combs.  This product is fantastic for combing out wet and dry hair.  It just glides through your hair.  I do not know how they do it, but I am glad they invented this comb.</li>
    <li> So glad I decided to get this comb.  I am actually thinking of getting an extra.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and this works great!</li>
    <li> Great comb! Not sure if I notice the moraccan oil infusion but the comb itself works great for wet or dry long hair.</li>
    <li> I really like how easily this pulls out any tangles I have in my hair.  I have very thick and curly long hair that has a tendency to tangle easily even w a lot of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think this would be too much different than the dollar big tooth combs I get from the beauty salon but I was wrong.  Not only does it untangle it seems to slide easier through my hair.  This comb just surprised me that it tackled my unruly hair and it didn&#x27;t even bend (unlike the dollar ones I used to get that I would snap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I will ever need to buy another one until my daughters are older.  They are probably going to be doomed w my hair and I will definitely let them know to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work from the top to the bottom and it tends to loosen up the tangles at the top to midway down my hair fairly easily.  I don&#x27;t think any comb would make the bottom (ratty) part any easier to comb through but this tackles that with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the Argan Oil helps at all but I would like to believe it does.  I even have combs I prefer that are infused with Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product and with any good hair care product you can&#x27;t go for the bargain.  But in the long run spending a few extra bucks actually saves you money.  I always broke the others so I&#x27;m sure I have invested more than the price of this comb in the generic brands.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love using this poem, works great to detangle my hair after getting out of the shower. My husband loved it so much I had to order one for him so he&#x27;d stop stealing mine!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I didn&#x27;t know about using big combs like this to detangle my crazy amount of hair but this works like a gem, even when it&#x27;s wet tangly mess.</li>
    <li> While using this product, it helps to detangle my hair nicely, and it combs through nice and smooth. I really do like this comb.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this comb years ago when trying to grow my hair long.  I no longer have to pull on my hair to comb it out.  That process weakens it.  The affect is I&#x27;m no longer getting breakage or split ends.  My hair is naturally blond and fine and I&#x27;ve always struggled with both.  My hair salon turned me onto it, and it&#x27;s the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
    <li> This comb really does work. I have really curly fine hair, so frizz and static are my norm. This really helps my hair, and I really can see a difference from my conair comb( which was a rubber wide tooth) now I need one for my bag to go. I have other cricket products, they are all pretty great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this comb! It smooths out the frizz without weighing down my hair! It&#x27;s amazing! This is the only comb I will ever buy now...</li>
    <li> This comb is absolutely wonderful. If I was asked to name it I would call it &amp;#34;No More Tears&amp;#34;  I haven&#x27;t heard any crying since I purchased this to use in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It can be used to make parts just as accurately as a fine toothed tail comb and it combs out the kinks whether the hair is wet or dry.  I hope to keep this for a very long time.  It is indeed a good/wise investment.</li>
    <li> GREAT comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair, down to my waist, ad this comb gets through all kinds of knots I get from the Harley. It&#x27;s also super for distributing conditioner. Makes my hair so shiny! LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to comb out my tangley hair during my shower, after I&#x27;ve washed out about half the conditioner.  I have long hair and it really helps with the tangles compared to just using my fingers or brushing after getting out of the shower. They say the comb is infused?  It seems like a regular comb to me, so I&#x27;m not sure what that&#x27;s all about.  It has a nice little divit in it that helps me get a good hold of it without dropping it in the shower.  It&#x27;s attractive and professional-looking.  I really recommend it.  :)</li>
    <li> This is the only comb I will use both in the shower and out. No downfalls of this comb. Overall great product</li>
    <li> Excellent comb for thick wet hair.  Use it in the shower or right after.  Easy on children&#x27;s long hair and fits in your purse</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really seems to help with tangles, feels good in your hand when working with it and is a beautiful caramel color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice item!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This comb is perfect for detangling hair after shampooing. The teeth of the comb are polished smooth to help the comb glid through the hair and help prevent damage. The Argan oil infusion is not a gimmick. It doesn&#x27;t condition the hair, it prevents static build-up whilst combing hair when dry. I don&#x27;t particularly like those detangling brushes like the Tangle Teezer or the Wet brush, especially for really long hair, as they pulled too much hair out. My hair length was to the middle of my back and this comb was a life saver! My hair is now much shorter, but I still find this to be the best comb for your hair to gently detangle and not cause damage.</li>
    <li> I think I love it? My sister &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it from me and I never saw it again :c</li>
    <li> bought this comb to keep in my purse for touch ups and I love it.  Easily goes through hair with out fighting tangles and leaves hair smooth.</li>
    <li> I switched over to this comb to decrease breakage on my hair.  The comb leaves my hair smooth.  A few strands will be broken now and then but its definitely less than with the brush i was using before.</li>
    <li> This comb is the first one that combs SMOOTHLY through my waist long hair!  I love it so much I just ordered 2 more!!!  AWESOME  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I would give this comb five stars, nothing wrong with it, but really, it is plastic, and does not impart any oil to your hair. Does not feel oily on your fingers, I cannot believe there is oil in the plastic, and it certainly does not have oil on the surface. The package gives claims about Argon Oil Olive oil, and Keratin that are ridiculous to obtain from this comb. The comb is fine, just don&#x27;t expect these wonders.</li>
    <li> Love this, love the material. I use it in the shower to comb in my conditioner, it massage my head. the tooth are wide enough for my crazy thick hair and because it moves the conditioner easily through my hair I now use less conditioner,</li>
    <li> This comb is absolutely magical! It does look like it would just be a plain comb, but it is more than that. I have thin and frizzy curly hair that tangles very easily, and this comb just glides right through it without needing a leave-in conditioner. I have tried plenty of other combs and none of them glide or detangle as easily as this one does. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> It is as expected, a high quality comb. Product feels strong and glides through hair. If I&#x27;m in the need for products like this again i will buy this brand, no question.</li>
    <li> I bought this comb because I was looking for a smooth comb that wouldn&#x27;t scrape my scalp.  Unfortunately this comb is not as smooth as the other reviews would have you believe.  I also bought a Swissco comb which was perfectly smooth and also beautiful to look at.</li>
    <li> So far after two months, it hasn&#x27;t broken any of the teeth.  I think it should hold up; which is important to me because I have long hair and it can be hard to deal with at times.</li>
    <li> The comb definitely works, and I feel as though I am breaking my hair less when I use the comb. However, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s anything super special. I have not noticed any difference in my hair because of the Aragan Oil. The product is fine if you just want a wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> The comb is very sturdy enough and works like a comb should.  The teeth are comfortable and doesn&#x27;t snag the hair.  I&#x27;ve used on both dry and wet hair and it&#x27;s satisfactory.  I purchased it because of the conditioning elements (argan oil, etc).  I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the conditioning aspect but it does help with the flyaways.</li>
    <li> I use this on my wet hair every day to brush out after a shower. Works well, sturdy. Other combs I&#x27;ve had break too easily.</li>
    <li> Used this as a follow up to  detangling with the Cricket Ultra Smooth Hair Detangler Comb infused with Argan Oil, Olive Oil and Keratin to make sure I got out all the kinks and tangles. I am happy because no hair came out. Detangling was a breeze. My hair and I thank you.</li>
    <li> Cool comb!  Really does seem to moisturize and doesn&#x27;t tear your hair, wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Works great! My hair gets really tangled and I find this comb easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like it, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair even when knotted</li>
    <li> I love this comb; it does its job well going thru my hair post-shower.  Am considering buying a second if the price comes down.</li>
