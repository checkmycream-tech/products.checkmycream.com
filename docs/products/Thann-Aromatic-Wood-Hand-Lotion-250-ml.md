    <li> Just what my wife wanted after getting the hotel sample after our last stay. Great lotion with a very unique scent. The only ding is in the bang-for-the-buck dept. Small bottle with a Big price tag. I probably won&#x27;t buy again unless the price comes down significantly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected; great!</li>
    <li> I got this lotion in a fancy hotel in Indianapolis.  I loved the scent and wanted to have more after the little bottle ran out.  I have compliments about&lt;br /&gt;it all the time.  It is different but sexy........It could use a few more emollients to keep your hands moister but the scent beats all</li>
    <li> Love the product. It is a bit expensive. Will not be ordering first agaid because do price</li>
    <li> I love the scent!  No greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> My wife discovered this at the Mariott Hotel in Philadelphia when we stayed there.  All of the complimentary toiletries were Thann products.  She loves them and it DOES give your hair extra shine.</li>
    <li> I bought this item along with the shower gel and it is fantastic!  See review for shower gel.  ASEAN Mall did a great job getting this to me quickly.  Very happy with my purchase!  I will do business with them again.  Wish they had the orange and tangerine lotion I would buy that too.</li>
    <li> love the smell. it is beautiful and mostureizes beautifully.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion not greasy.  A little pricey...</li>

    <li> I liked this very much</li>
    <li> I love the aroma. It smells so fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> F to the Y to the I:  Mind &#x3D; blown.Man, this is like ummm nutter butter.</li>
    <li> Perhaps one of my favorite products ever. The lotion smells great and does not give you that greasy feeling most lotions leave behind. Great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased it as a gift for a gentleman who doesn&#x27;t wear Cologne. The scent is warm and woodsy, it doesn&#x27;t overpower, it causes interest as the botanicals nourish the skin. It was a success. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff; smells heavenly and leaves your skin soft and moisturized. Though i&#x27;s a huge luxury at $40 for such a small bottle of stuff they give away free when you stay at Marriott.</li>
