I love to paint my own nails and find this tool really nice and easy compared to using toothpicks, the paint sticks onto them nicely and creates a pretty dot. You wouldn&#x27;t think this but I couldn&#x27;t find dotting pens anywhere in stores so that is why I decided to order them on here.

    <li> Took forever to get here, but what a great price!  I cannot wait to play with all these different sized dotting tools.  They&#x27;re sturdy looking and the handles are pretty.</li>
    <li> Fantastic tool to use for nail designs with different sizes to use. Let the creativity begin!!  Fun way to pass the time.</li>
    <li> This product is a great dotting tool for my nails and toes.  I would definitely recommend to a friend.  I sent a link to one and they are looking into as presents.</li>
