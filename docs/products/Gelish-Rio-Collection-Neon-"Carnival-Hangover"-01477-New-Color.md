      <li>It&#x27;s a neon purple- still very nice</li>
      <li>On the bottle it was pictured to be a bright purple color, and I was assured by Sally&#x27;s staff that after curing it in the UV that it would be purple.</li>
      <li>Mine turned out a bright pinkish/purple.</li>
      <li>and it was a bright pink.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
      <li>Loved the color</li>
      <li>I purchased this one because I thought it would be good for summer</li>

      <li>It is very strong and durable.</li>

      <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone that loves bright colors like I do!</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>I love this color, but is not purple.</li>
      <li>love the Gelish product.  </li>
      <li>but I do love the Gelish polish</li>
      <li>Love this color of polish.  </li>
      <li>The color is okay</li>
      <li>The quality is top notch, like all Gelish products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Personally I love this color.</li>

      <li>Fast shipping, accurate description, works great.</li>
      <li>Good vibrant colour.</li>
      <li>Pretty nice purple.</li>
      <li>I’m a huge fan of Gelish and this was one of the first colors I bought over 2 years ago when I started doing my own gels.</li>
      <li>I love all the gelish nail products and have a very large selection of colors.</li>
      <li>I ordered this color and wasn&#x27;t really sure if I would like it because I&#x27;m not really a pink kind of person.</li>
      <li>you want to get this color make sure you look at pictures first before you purchase.</li>
      <li>It’s more of a bright pink.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other brands, but Gelish seems to last the longest and have the best quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(right?), but since Gelish isn’t cheap I decided to use it until I run out.</li>
      <li>I thought I’d give it a quick review.</li>
      <li>and it was very pretty.</li>
      <li>It is a nice color of red and looks really good, especially with summer months and time for sandals!</li>
      <li>Hope you are aware before you purchase!</li>
      <li>Although the color in the spot is very bright, when you apply the product you obtain a very different color, like a strong pink but not the electric purple/pink you see in the picture or in the spot.  </li>
      <li>You would think by looking at the bottle it is purple, but it is trully a very pretty bright pink.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s bright and bold and not too pink!</li>
      <li>This color is a bright pink, not purple.</li>
      <li>Not so.. it ended up as a bright, neon pink color, which is fun, but spending $12 expecting purple</li>
      <li>This is a bright pink, not the sheen purple that is the stripe on the mini bottle I bought at the store.  </li>
      <li>It appears to be a fun purple.</li>
      <li>I have started using the gelish system at home and have been enjoying it very much, so I decided to invest in a new color.</li>
      <li>But if you love pink go right ahead... is hot!!!</li>
      <li>Shipping is super fast (1-2 days)</li>
      <li>The product shipped very fast but the color is not even close to what is pictured.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s pretty for summer, but do not purchase this color if you want the purple shown</li>
      <li>I put the color on, but I am sure I will be taking this off by next weekend.  </li>
      <li>very displeased!</li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied color is more like a hot pink than purple that I thought it was going to be.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I have tried different brands and this one is so far my favorite.</li>
      <li>It goes with a lot of different clothes and good for year round wear.  </li>
      <li>So, if you don&#x27;t want pink instead of purple safe yourself the disappoint and do not other this color.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think its that far off from the color it shows on the bottle.</li>
      <li>Also, as you all are all well aware it takes a long time to remove the polish and redo your manicure so kind of a waste of time.</li>
      <li>The color looks exactly like the hot pink &amp;#34;shake</li>
      <li>It’s a beautiful pink color, but it&#x27;s also pretty thin and needs 3-4 coats for moderate coverage.</li>
      <li>Love the color, but I will put it on a little thicker next time or do 3 coats.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite color, mostly pink not much purple to it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pink, but not even a cute pink.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look nearly as purple as the splotch on the bottle.</li>
      <li>only gripe, which is a pretty big deal, is that it’s pretty sheer.</li>
      <li>I like this color even though it is many different shades of pink and purple mixed up together.  </li>
      <li>Price is perfect, Sally sells the mini for the same price which I think it&#x27;s crazy!</li>
      <li>I ordered &amp;#34;carnival hangover&amp;#34; but in the bottle was purple not pink.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not pink.</li>
      <li>I know this was a short-lived line, so I&#x27;ve actually purchased multiple bottles for future use, I like it so much.</li>
      <li>Used with sephora led light (and sephora base and top coat).</li>
      <li>This polish coats thinly and separates easily, making for more difficult and time consuming application.</li>

<li> The polka dots are one coat, but the go on pretty thick with my dotting tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> In reality it is a bright ugly pink.</li>
<li> It goes on well and lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> that’s 3 coats of white and 3 coats of the pink.</li>
<li> I do like the pink</li>
<li> All the reviews said it was pink and not purple</li>
<li> I suppose I wouldn&#x27;t hate it so much if I wasn&#x27;t expecting a fun purple.</li>
<li> posting is 3 coats on every other nail, with the heart on my ring finger</li>
<li> But It was a little watery compared to other neon colors that I got.</li>
<li> I slammed my finger in a door and have a black nail.</li>
<li> If I would have thought about it I could have done a white base coat first.</li>
<li> I know this because I have used this shade for a few months now.</li>
<li> and I can still see the icky black underneath.</li>

    <li> I ordered this color and wasn&#x27;t really sure if I would like it because I&#x27;m not really a pink kind of person. When I got it and put it on I loved it! It&#x27;s bright and bold and not too pink! I get all kinds of compliments on how good it looks! It&#x27;s a great color for summer as well and I would highly recommend it to anyone that loves bright colors like I do!</li>
    <li> I love all the gelish nail products and have a very large selection of colors. I purchased this one because I thought it would be good for summer and it does not disappoint. Keep in mind this is solid color and has no sheen or glitter to it. So it can be used alone...but I added vegas nights over it and it was very pretty. Sparkled in the sunlight.</li>
    <li> This color is a bright pink, not purple. I do like the pink, it&#x27;s pretty for summer, but do not purchase this color if you want the purple shown</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
    <li> I’m a huge fan of Gelish and this was one of the first colors I bought over 2 years ago when I started doing my own gels. I have been using it sporadically for the last 2 years, so I thought I’d give it a quick review. I have tried many other brands, but Gelish seems to last the longest and have the best quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know they say to throw polish away after a year (right?), but since Gelish isn’t cheap I decided to use it until I run out. I’m on my last 25% of the bottle now. It doesn&#x27;t look nearly as purple as the splotch on the bottle. It’s more of a bright pink. The quality is top notch, like all Gelish products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe, which is a pretty big deal, is that it’s pretty sheer. I’m posting a picture. I slammed my finger in a door and have a black nail. I put 4 coats over it and I can still see the icky black underneath. If I would have thought about it I could have done a white base coat first. Oh well, what’s done is done. I’m too lazy to take it off and start over. The picture I’m posting is 3 coats on every other nail, with the heart on my ring finger that’s 3 coats of white and 3 coats of the pink. The polka dots are one coat, but the go on pretty thick with my dotting tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get this color make sure you look at pictures first before you purchase. I&#x27;m posting a couple in different lights. It’s a beautiful pink color, but it&#x27;s also pretty thin and needs 3-4 coats for moderate coverage.</li>
    <li> My friend had this color and it looked so good on her, I had to have it. I will say that the color you see in the picture doesn&#x27;t match at all what it looks like on your nails. You would think by looking at the bottle it is purple, but it is trully a very pretty bright pink.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst gelish colors I have ever seen. It appears to be a fun purple. In reality it is a bright ugly pink. I suppose I wouldn&#x27;t hate it so much if I wasn&#x27;t expecting a fun purple. I am skeptical of all the RIO collection colors...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pink, but not even a cute pink. All the reviews said it was pink and not purple but I thought I&#x27;d take the chance. Very disappointing, false advertising.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite color, mostly pink not much purple to it BUT anything Gelish get 5 stars from me. Love them!!</li>
    <li> This bottle exceeded my expectations. I was expecting a mini bottle like the ones they sell at Sally but it was over double the size for the same price! Will never buy from Sally again.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this color! Thought it was purple and it was a bright pink.&lt;br /&gt;Took the color back to Sally&#x27;s Store but I do love the Gelish polish product.&lt;br /&gt;The polish does last for two to three weeks</li>
    <li> this product pictured is not the same colour in reality.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a neon violet or magenta....but when I received it, it was the correct bottle, right name, but painted on it looks dark, dusky pink.&lt;br /&gt;Yuk!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect colour for the summer. Good vibrant colour.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that I missed the other reviews that said this is a pink color not fuchsia like pictured!  Hope you are aware before you purchase!</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on Amazon, but at Sally&#x27;s...I wish I had bought it here!  I did not notice this was part of a NEON collection...I am not fan of neon of any color.  This is a bright pink, not the sheen purple that is the stripe on the mini bottle I bought at the store.  I put the color on, but I am sure I will be taking this off by next weekend.  I love the gelish polish, the polish is great if you like the color.</li>
    <li> Loved the color but it&#x27;s not pink. It&#x27;s a neon purple- still very nice</li>
    <li> The product shipped very fast but the color is not even close to what is pictured. The color is okay but I would of course rather have the one pictured as I was looking for a neon polish.</li>
    <li> Love this color of polish.  It is a nice color of red and looks really good, especially with summer months and time for sandals!</li>
    <li> Love the color! Used with sephora led light (and sephora base and top coat). Perfect summer color!</li>
    <li> So far the best gel polish I&#x27;ve found. I have tried different brands and this one is so far my favorite.</li>
    <li> This color is not neon at all, it was the dullest purple I have ever seen. I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied color is more like a hot pink than purple that I thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I thought it was.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice purple. Use this in my sunset theme mani. Looks nice on its own. 3 coats for best coverage. No issues with clumps or curing.</li>
    <li> This polish coats thinly and separates easily, making for more difficult and time consuming application.</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;carnival hangover&amp;#34; but in the bottle was purple not pink. I know this because I have used this shade for a few months now. Not happy.</li>
    <li> love the Gelish product.  Lasts for weeks if applied properly and if taken  care of can last 2 weeks or longer</li>
    <li> I like this color even though it is many different shades of pink and purple mixed up together.  It goes on well and lasts a long time.  It goes with a lot of different clothes and good for year round wear.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this color, but is not purple. I think the manufacture bottle the wrong color. The color looks exactly like the hot pink &amp;#34;shake it till you samba&amp;#34; from the same collection. So, if you don&#x27;t want pink instead of purple safe yourself the disappoint and do not other this color. But if you love pink go right ahead... is hot!!!</li>
    <li> Love the color, but I will put it on a little thicker next time or do 3 coats. It is still looking good though after 2 weeks of wear.&lt;br /&gt;No chipping or breaking nails.. It is very strong and durable. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Although the color in the spot is very bright, when you apply the product you obtain a very different color, like a strong pink but not the electric purple/pink you see in the picture or in the spot.  The quality is perfect, it last 3 weeks</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! Price is perfect, Sally sells the mini for the same price which I think it&#x27;s crazy! Shipping is super fast (1-2 days)</li>
    <li> I purchased carnival hangover and I absolutely love it! The color is very bright! My order came very quick and was in great condition.</li>
    <li> I know this was a short-lived line, so I&#x27;ve actually purchased multiple bottles for future use, I like it so much. I don&#x27;t have any issues with lifting with this color and two coats is sufficient coverage. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> Personally I love this color. Mine turned out a bright pinkish/purple. Great for summer! Would buy it again anytime. I really don&#x27;t think its that far off from the color it shows on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Liked the color. But It was a little watery compared to other neon colors that I got. And it took me 25 minutes to soak it off. It never happened before. I will keep it cause the item is not returnable.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, accurate description, works great. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have started using the gelish system at home and have been enjoying it very much, so I decided to invest in a new color. On the bottle it was pictured to be a bright purple color, and I was assured by Sally&#x27;s staff that after curing it in the UV that it would be purple. Not so.. it ended up as a bright, neon pink color, which is fun, but spending $12 expecting purple I was very disappointed. Also, as you all are all well aware it takes a long time to remove the polish and redo your manicure so kind of a waste of time.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the color I ordered! It was a pink. :( very displeased! Was expecting a neon purplely color. At least somewhat purple an it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
