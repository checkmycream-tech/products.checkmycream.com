      <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and feel great.</li>
      <li>I researched the best products to get rid of eye puffiness - and was expecting that I was going to have to invest a significant amount of money to get a great product.  </li>
      <li>this sounded like a good product.  </li>
      <li>and condition was good.</li>
      <li>looks good, though some of the ingredients have changed in this product</li>
      <li>however, I do feel like it is probably a good thing to use still, because hey, hydration is hydration.</li>
      <li>I gave him 3 good swipes instead of the recommended</li>
      <li>and he was a good sport about it.  </li>
      <li>That can not be a good sign.  </li>

      <li>It feels good when I apply it under my eyes.</li>
      <li>The product is good.</li>
      <li>Well, it FEELS good going on....</li>
      <li>She looks good</li>
      <li>I want a good deputing product that works reliably and do not have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It does feel good, though, when it goes on.</li>
      <li>I still did not see effect on puffiness, but it seems good till now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Loreal rollerball and it&#x27;s nice but not as good for puffy eyes/dark circles... great for filling out the skin though</li>
      <li>The application feels great, very cool and soothing.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>and I am glad I did!</li>
      <li>I love the cooling effect and how it makes my eyes feel after applying it!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
      <li>(He liked the way it feels too.)</li>
      <li>He actually liked it and would ask me to put it under both of his eyes before bed.</li>
      <li>and then I&#x27;ll use it for that, and it works nicely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Under my own eyes I also saw immediate improvement, *</li>
      <li>Honestly speaking, or rather writing.</li>
      <li>I keep this product in the fridge, and it feels nice to put it on my puffy eyes in the morning.  </li>
      <li>That was nice.  </li>
      <li>This is especially useful for me after putting in contacts.  </li>
      <li>Feels great - cool (in temperature).</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply and smelled good.</li>
      <li>so I am always happy when a product comes out that is super fast and still works great.  </li>
      <li>feels good and cool to put on though.</li>
      <li>Great to have on hand though, certainly easier than an ice pack.</li>
      <li>I am not scientist, but the more I study about cosmetics, the more I would like to say everything is explained by definition \\&quot;cosmetics\\&quot; itself</li>
      <li>If your problem is more with puffiness give it a whirl because it does help.</li>
      <li>I got this for my husband for bags under his eyes and he is trying 2 different products and this one is working the best for firming and tightening under eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and does the job.</li>
      <li>Wish I had more time for skin care</li>
      <li>However, it has been an honor to be mistaken for this famous lady.</li>
      <li>The second best is that I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in eye puffiness.</li>
      <li>For the price there should be more.</li>
      <li>I know this didn&#x27;t work for a lot of reviewers, but I love it.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t going to magically make your bags go away no matter what their ads say.</li>
      <li>but it probably picks up bacteria better than a pump.  </li>
      <li>It feels refreshing</li>
      <li>If you are puffy or stressed this is refreshing.</li>
      <li>I love that it has caffeine which decongests puffiness.</li>
      <li>I have found those freezable gel masks to be the most helpful products for eye puffiness...and they are a fraction of the price of a roller of this stuff.</li>
      <li>I should have known better.......</li>
      <li>it would be better if it came in two&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>and I hope it works for you. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>not too sure if it is working</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a concealer, too, and I like being able to do two steps at once.</li>
      <li>this was for my sister and he is in love with it.</li>
      <li>Not too sure if this does all that it should or claims to do.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I notice a visible difference when I don&#x27;t use it--under my eyes seem more puffy for lack of better words.</li>
      <li>I just love this product.  </li>
      <li>Have used better products,..</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference with under my eyes however, it does provide a cooling sensation to make the eyes more relaxed.</li>
      <li>and it helped more</li>
      <li>Its just OK.</li>
      <li>Not too sure about this product.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t  going to magically make your bags go away no matter what their ads say.  </li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t  going to magically make your bags go away no matter what</li>
      <li>but if I ever do this will be there !! :)</li>
      <li>I have since gotten over that aspect, but honestly it is mostly because I put it on at home and once it&#x27;s rubbed in I don&#x27;t believe anyone can tell.</li>
      <li>It may even feel better, if you put it into the frig?</li>
      <li>I love it--</li>
      <li>No wonder there is no money-back-guarantee unlike many skin products.&lt;br /&gt;Fool</li>
      <li>I love how this makes my eyes feel so refreshed.  </li>
      <li>and I think this product has helped them look better.</li>
      <li>I like more for the caffeine.</li>
      <li>So if sleep bagginess is your only problem, it&#x27;s probably perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a regular buyer of this product! As always it awesome!!</li>
    <li> The roller ball is cool and soothing, but it continues to dry out from day-to-day and takes about 15 rolls per eye to get the liquid applied.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product.  She looks good so it must work!! We have put it on auto ship to save some $$</li>
    <li> This is a gentle and well-priced anti-puff roller.  I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years and told several friends when they asked what I&#x27;ve been using.  That in itself makes me realize it must be working!!</li>
    <li> I bought it because I always look like I haven&#x27;t slept. I didn&#x27;t think it did an exceptionally good job with the dark circles, but I did notice after three weeks that my eye lashes were really long and thick. I noticed when I started a new job where I had to wear my sunglasses on my way to work and my lashes kept rubbing against the lense of the sunglasses. I saw then paid attention in the mirror and noticed my eye lashes look like when I was a little boy, really long and curved.I&#x27;ve used nothing other than this, so it has to be this product that caused it. I&#x27;ve been using it on my eyebrows now because they were a little sparce and I&#x27;ve noticed that they&#x27;re much darker and the whole outline looks more covered now.[[ASIN:B001DPMETG Garnier Nutritioniste Skin Renew Anti-puff Eye Roller - 0.5 oz (15ml) Size]]</li>
    <li> My eyes can&#x27;t do without this.&lt;br /&gt;I once was on diuretic tablets for my water retention, but that was quite a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for the past six mos. It makes a big difference in the morning and an even greater difference in the late afternoon when my eyes really start looking tired underneath.&lt;br /&gt;This roller is unbelievble for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t look tired 99 percent of the time anymore, like I did before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, this was a very disappointing product.  My 73 year old mother, my 21 year old daughter and my middle aged face saw no difference when using this.  We had expected immediate results, then thought it might be a product that needed to be used for a few day before results become noticeable.  None of us saw results.  It was one of those \\&quot;We should have known better\\&quot; moments.    I&#x27;ve had better results with a thin application of Prep H (under eyes!), followed by a cold spoon under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Soothing...works well</li>
    <li> I  see a slight difference with my eyes. I like more for the caffeine. Since the skin under the eye is the thinnest the caffeine can give some energy since I don&#x27;t drink coffee. When I&#x27;m tired or my eyes are feeling strained I roll this under my eyes just for a rejuvenating feeling. The cool roller ball is really nice</li>
    <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t like this product very much. After using this product for 3 weeks in a row she couldn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> I like the product so far, like the way it feels and it seems to do what it says it will (help with the dark circles). I bought mine at Walgreens and found it about $3.50 cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have been waking up with huge puffy eyes. i am 44 . I must say I bought it and immediately I saw my eyes begin to reduce in puffiness. It&#x27;s not a face lift in a bottle, but if you have congested eyes in the a.m. it can really help!</li>
    <li> I love the cooling effect and how it makes my eyes feel after applying it!  I did notice a reduction in puffiness and dark circles, but I didn&#x27;t have an extreme problem with puffiness to begin with.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and I love it!  You must have resonable expectations for a $12 product!  It&#x27;s not a miracle in a bottle, but it does work.  I suggest if you have severe puffiness and/or dark circles see a dermatalogist or plastic surgeon...</li>
    <li> I bought this for around $12 because I have a bad problem with puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  I do not wear makeup and I don&#x27;t spend money on stuff like this, but this sounded like a good product.  I guess their advertising worked on me.  But it does not work!  It didn&#x27;t even improve my problems!  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.  I think it feels weird rolling this stuff on, and then under my eye is wet for a few minutes.  It also seems to make my eyes itch.  This was the biggest waste of money and I will not buy another Garnier product.  I&#x27;m rating this item as 1 star, although it doesn&#x27;t even deserve that.</li>
    <li> The eye gel is not fluent</li>
    <li> I have horrible dark circles that won&#x27;t go away no matter how much sleep I get or how much water I drink.  I asked for a suggestion at Ulta, and was directed to this product.  The package claims to reduce puffiness, fight wrinkles, and eliminate dark circles.  The only thing I want to eliminate is the dark circles, my skin is sunken in, not puffy at all.  The saleswoman informed me that there are not many products that will only fight one of those three.  I think this product almost increased the darkness under my eyes, possibly because it has ingredients to fight puffiness?  Bottom line: This is a waste of money, even though it&#x27;s on the cheaper end of undereye products.  I saw no positive change.  And it didn&#x27;t even feel speacial (ie cooling/refreshing) rolling on.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for bags under his eyes and he is trying 2 different products and this one is working the best for firming and tightening under eyes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and does the job. I didn&#x27;t experience any itching around my eyes alike some reviews stated. Although the relief and visibility if the dark circles diminished, it was only a temporary effect.</li>
    <li> Im not the type of guy that uses skin care products. Soap and water thats it. Almost everyday ...for years Ive had dark circles around my eyes ,kinda like racoon eyes.   I saw this product \\&quot;Garneir Skin Renew\\&quot; while I was at the store with my wife. She said throw it in the shopping cart , give it a try.    So I used it once in a while , didnt notice any difference but it felt kinda soothing..    Then I started using it 2 or 3 times a day and that made a huge difference. Dark circles are gone...Didnt happen immediatly , but they are gone.    Id say give it a try , It worked for me.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it was touted by two \\&quot;reliable\\&quot; women&#x27;s magazines as being very effective for the price. I&#x27;ve used it for a month &amp; a half religiously &amp; have seen no improvement in diminishing my dark circles or wrinkles. I should have known better.......</li>
    <li> I like this product enough to make a comment on it, and I hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes have been puffy and tired due to allergies, aging, and eye strain from using the computer all day and night. I needed something to sooth my eye skin as I know it is fragile. So I picked up this eye roller, attracted by the energetic green bottle and the idea of a single, versus multiple, roller ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is a ritual in my evening and morning bedtime thing. The large roller ball, for me, is large enough to cover my undereye area, and I love the cooling effect it has. The caffeine in it is topical and doesn&#x27;t keep me up or have any other systemic effects. And the product absorbs quickly, leaving no icky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best effect is the calming I get inside from using it. The second best is that I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in eye puffiness. I overdo it in my life a lot, and this reminds me that I need to take care of my skin if I want to continue doing what I do when I&#x27;m older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product an A+!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product cause I have dark circles under my eyes--the product does work however after the first use, It made my eyes burn and itch and also it started making my eyelids twitch--it was very noticeable to people. I didn&#x27;t think it was the product, but I stopped using it and it took almost 2 weeks for the twitching to stop. I am not sensitive to cosmetics usually-but I think its the concentrated caffiene in it.</li>
    <li> For years i have tried to find a face product that did not get under my skin and cause pimples.Everything I have ever bought no matter what the bottle said always gave me white heads and had to give the product away.I will say this product does NOT clog up your pores or cause pimples at all,i bought it on clearance for 6 bucks at Krogers.It works good to keep your skin supple,I don&#x27;t really know if it does much more then that yet.So if you find it on sale I would buy it but not for 12 bucks...</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it helps with puffiness, but dark circles under eyes - yes. It gives instant result, it doesn&#x27;t last long, just temporary, but if you had hard night or just want to look fresher - it&#x27;s pretty good. Just for instance look at yourself in the mirror before and maybe 10-15  minutes after application to see visible contrast. I think  it does something with blood vessels (course of dark circles) and it is not permanent. E.g. make them very narrow, that blood circulation stops in them and they become white and almost invisible. I am not scientist, but the more I study about cosmetics, the more I would like to say everything is explained by definition \\&quot;cosmetics\\&quot; itself (Preparations applied externally to change or enhance the beauty of skin, hair, nails, lips, and eyes ). Just whole conception of miracle remedies which topical application can bring dramatical changes to our internal problems of skin such as dark circles or puffiness that related to general health (for example bad function of kidney, too much alcohol yesterday, aging, tiredness, bad balance of liquids in body). I mean realistic expectations win.  If someone has sagging bags under eyes, no way, it can&#x27;t help. Probably \\&quot;anti-puff\\&quot; in the name is not right.</li>
    <li> After less than a week, I no longer have puffiness under my eyes.  The dark circles I have are slightly reduced in degree, but they haven&#x27;t gone away.  The application feels great, very cool and soothing.</li>
    <li> I found this product when searching here for something to treat dark circles for men, and I have to wonder if it was misclassified. The product contains under-eye coverup that is supposed to blend with your skin, but in my case it just made by dark circles look gray/green, which is worse than their natural appearance.</li>
    <li> My eyes started itchy like crazy after I put this on.  I thought at first it was just allergies from the fall season, but as soon as I washed it off, my eyes were way better.  I would not buy this again, I&#x27;m going to get my money back!!!</li>
    <li> I use this daily..just started using it.  decent purchase- I hope to see some results.  not too sure if it is working but in my mind it is haha.  Sender was prompt. no issues</li>
    <li> Im a 25 year old super-mom with a two year old and a one year old. I also refuse to give up my social life or my career to be a as-close-to-perfect mom. It began to take a toll on my eyes this year. After browsing the isles for an entir lunch break I chose the Garnier Eye roller based on price and promise. it works. It instantly brightens the eyes and my dark (gray) circles are completly gone. If you have minor circles caused by lack of sleep and tou much action and dont want to break the bank I would def recommend this roller.</li>
    <li> Been using it about a week or so and I am not sure there are any benefits to this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have been getting puffy eyes that last all day.  While reading a magazine this product was listed on their top ten recommended products for 2011.  In the three weeks I have been using it my eyes are just as puffy as before.  I apply it in the morning twice and in the evening before going to bed.  Very sad to say that not once did I notice any difference.  It also did not help my fine lines or dark areas under the eye.  I am a young 42 year old that is very unhappy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems with \\&quot;burning the candle\\&quot; eye puffiness.  While my bags do have a darker color and have the first signs of crows feet, these are not my target issues.  I started using this product about a year ago and really liked it - it&#x27;s not a miracle but definitely makes a difference when used regularly.  It only works on the puffiness so if you&#x27;re looking for color or wrinkle relief go elsewhere.      When I&#x27;m really pushing it, I keep it in the fridge next to my coffee creamer and put it on in the morning.  HEAVEN!  I recently  bought a Clarins eye creme which cost $60.  I&#x27;ve been comparing the two products and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the effectiveness.  For the price, I will continue to purchase the Garnier roller, not the Clarins.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all, save your money. It&#x27;s basically snake oil in eye roller form.</li>
    <li> I think this product is probably better suited for people looking to combat the dreaded tired look caused by actual fatigue, as opposed to an anti-aging product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product under my son&#x27;s eyes after he had a couple of bad falls off his scooter. Unbelievably, it actually worked! It reduced the appearance of the bruising and swelling! He actually liked it and would ask me to put it under both of his eyes before bed. (He liked the way it feels too.) I saw people mention possible side effects from the caffeine, buuut... it didn&#x27;t keep my son up at night or anything lol. He&#x27;s 12 and doesn&#x27;t drink anything caffeinated, and he had no side effects whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under my own eyes I also saw immediate improvement, *except* when my under eye issues were caused by a cold. In that instance, this product did absolutely nothing for me. I had to look as sick as I was feeling lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used any under eye product regularly before this. I was curious about this product for awhile, but was hesitant to even bother with it because don&#x27;t *really* have under eye issues aside from when I&#x27;m tired or my sinuses are bothering. Turns out that this is exactly the type of product I would need! I wouldn&#x27;t count on this to turn back the hands of time for anyone, but it&#x27;s def a product to have on hand for a midday refresher, or before you go out to dinner after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for long term effects at this point. I&#x27;ve been using it semi-regularly for a few weeks now, at least once a day. I haven&#x27;t noticed any lasting difference in the general appearance of my under eye area thus far. It is a product that I&#x27;m likely to continue using and repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times I used it my eyes were slightly itchy initially, but only slightly and it quickly subsided. With continued use, it doesn&#x27;t cause me any itching at all. My son, on the other hand, never had that issue.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for both puffiness and dark circles..It works short term for puffiness but no result for dark circles, been using it over 3 weeks now! Oh well Guess you can&#x27;t have it all!</li>
    <li> Used the Anti Puff roller for over a month and saw no results on reducing puffiness.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  In fact, I keep one in my desk at work for those long hours as it helps me exude some measure of alertness to my peers.</li>
    <li> Gives my under eye area a cool shock, but I don&#x27;t really notice much difference in black circles. Puffiness isn&#x27;t really an issue for me, but every now and then I&#x27;ll use it for that, and it works nicely. Not sure it would for chronic puffiness, however.</li>
    <li> I was totally into the hype on this because of the caffeine and massage effects (plus I think Sarah Jessica is great) so I did believe I&#x27;d see those late night bags go down after rollering away with this -- but honestly? it didn&#x27;t do much.  I keep trying and I don&#x27;t know? maybe it&#x27;s my \\&quot;kind\\&quot; of bags/dark circles are resistant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I read in a magazine recently to put spoons in the freezer for a few minutes then put them on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a cold spoon on my left eye.  This roller thingee on the right.  Spoon won. So for me I&#x27;m kind of thinking it&#x27;s on the \\&quot;do not buy again\\&quot; list. :(</li>
    <li> I have used the Garnier skin renew anti-puff and it has a slight tingle and no effect on reduction of puffiness. I would not buy another tueb.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been said, but the results aren&#x27;t dramatic. However, this product will reduce puffiness for a few hours and will give you an instant jolt since the main ingredient is caffeine. It makes my eyes feel more open and awake which makes me look less tired in itself, even if dark circles/puffiness are still present. It also smoothes out the under eye area and concealer can easily be applied over it. The product lasts a while and it&#x27;s only $[...].</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over six weeks and it brightened my dark cirlces considerably.  The difference in the bags however are not that noticable.  I like the coolness of the metal roller and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use my fingers to apply the product.  I paid about 12 dollars in a store for it and it is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This is a great roller. This product feels light going on,  it rolls very easily, is small and compact that fits in a small purse or makeup bag. I don&#x27;t understand why it gets a low rating. It works like it says on the box. It doesn&#x27;t cause eye twitching that I read on the reviews. It greats for the puffy and dark circles around the eyes. The reason I gave four stars is the price should be lower.Its almost $12.00 for the small tube at Walmart. For the price there should be more. I probably won&#x27;t buy again due to only the price. This product does work if you are loyal to only garnier products.</li>
    <li> let me start off by saying, that different products work on different people and sure as hell this one did not work for me!...the only eye creams that make my eyes feel better cost a bomb so i was really keen on trying this one out and was also praying that it would be the miracle cream i&#x27;ve been waiting for!...alas, for great hopes...this did nothing for my puffiness or dark circles!...(been using it for 3 weeks now)  the concept is quite nice, having an eye roller to massage the eye area and stimulate circulation, but outside of producing a slight warmth it made no other difference.  one thing though, the roller is a bit of a pain, you have to use gravity to coax the product out and then use gravity to keep it in!!!...otherwise the massage part of it is rather dysfunctional...(tilting it up and massaging leaves you with too much, and tilting down leaves you with too little...)  all in all a very so-so product. will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a friends recommendation. I was skeptical but have found that it does work. I use it morning and night and the puffiness has decreased considerably.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect this product or any other topical product to reduce very dark under eye circles. Only a dermatologist can really do that and he/she needs to use laser treatments. redness under the eyes comes from seepage of blood from tiny capillaries. No cosmetic product can make that go away completely or dramatically. As for serious puffiness, again, you likely won&#x27;t get long term results from any cosmetic. The Eye-Roller can help you look a little better and feel refreshed but it isn&#x27;t going to magically make your bags go away no matter what their ads say.</li>
    <li> I researched the best products to get rid of eye puffiness - and was expecting that I was going to have to invest a significant amount of money to get a great product.  This one had the best reviews, so I gave it a try.  It&#x27;s amazing.  Instant results.  It also provides a great base for eye makeup - keeping it in place and prevents creasing.</li>
    <li> This does not do as well as some expensive brands, but look at the price. The only thing that worked amazingly well on my dark circles (which are hereditary and no amount of good sleep will cure) was Soap and Glory Eye Gel when it was at Target. Since Target stopped carrying it, it&#x27;s $30, and that&#x27;s too much for my budget.   This product at least does have some caffeine. I have tried 10+ dark circle reducing products and if caffeine isn&#x27;t in there somewhere it&#x27;s not going to do anything for my dark circles/puffiness, so this is a very good ingredient. Although caffeine is known to be very good at reducing these problems it is for some reason hard to find in most eye gels these days.  It&#x27;s a concealer, too, and I like being able to do two steps at once. It acts as a sort of 1/2 and 1/2 product: half reducing the dark circles with the caffeine and half concealer. Since you can treat the dark circles and apply your concealer in the same step, it saves a lot of time in the morning waiting for a gel to dry. It&#x27;s very easy to use in that manner, it&#x27;s a big time saver.  If you have the funds I recommend the Soap and Glory, but otherwise this is perfectly fine for the price.</li>
    <li> It did not work. It made my under-eye area very sensitive and did notthing about the circles. If you have barely-noticeable circle problems, make sure to drink enough water and moisterize properly, that  should do the trick. Also, do not rub your eyes a lot. When wiping off makeup, wipe into inside corner, in that driection, then down. Never rub outwards. (: The cooling effect was nice though, but just use a cold spoon. If anything this made my eyes more puffy and tired looking. The stinging feeling wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This product gives me relief from my inflated under eye bags. I put it on in the morning to help reduce the appearance of my puffiness.</li>
    <li> No change , is waste of money, please do not spend any money on these products. I tried cucumber, potato, and tomato juice and it helped more</li>
    <li> Ive tried a few products that claimed to reduce puffiness, but I was able to see results after a week of using this product..I likes !!!.. But like the saying goes..what works for one doesnt meant it works for all...</li>
    <li> I have old age bags under my eyes and I think this product has helped them look better. I also think it has reduced the wrinkles under my eyes. I like how I can roll it close to my eyes without it getting into my eyes like moisturizers have done. It is a gel like substance that stays where you roll it on. I apply it heavily and let it dry up by itself. I don&#x27;t dab it in. I don&#x27;t think it has done too much for my dark circles but I feel like my overall eye appearance has improved since using this. I will continue if only because it has reduced my puffiness and the wrinkles around my eyes. That is worth at least $13 to me.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL if anything it makes the circles under your eyes WORSE!  I thought it was just me!  I made my husband try it and he was a good sport about it.  He looked worse too! (I used this product at the age of 29)  This product doesn&#x27;t work at all!  Complete waste of money.  If you want a product that does work use the earthen theraputic cucumber eye pads those work!  I have to say some of there other products look good from the comercials but now I refuse to try them b/c of this one product.  I also question SJP since she&#x27;s a spokes model for these people.  I wouldn&#x27;t put my face on a product that doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I suffer from extreme allergies and therefore have dark circles and also had a bit of irritated eyelid skin from scrubbing too hard when removing makeup. This product did an excellent job in relieving both conditions. I am generally one who purchases expensive skin care products (Chanel, Clarins) yet I feel that for $12 this exhibited similar results and did not irritate my VERY sensitive eyes. The purchase which I made at Target, came with a sample of the Skin renew cream which I have absolutely fallen in love with and I will write a review for that separately.</li>
    <li> Problem is I can&#x27;t find them anymore  I wish I could  they were refreshing and seemed to last for hours</li>
    <li> Excelente qualidade. Diria que trata-se do melhor produto do mercado para a finalidade que promete. O preço justifica a compra e o vendedor é muito ágil na entrega da mercadoria.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product daily for several months, until yesterday.  I don&#x27;t think it occurred to me just how potent the caffeine in it really is, and I&#x27;m too sensitive to caffeine.  It worked well for my eye puffiness.  But I&#x27;ve been noticing lately that I&#x27;m having irregular heartbeats and very jumpy eye lids.  Today, I went to the eye doc because I&#x27;d noticed something blocking my vision, and was told I most likely have a microscopic blood clot on the back of my eye, probably due to the irregular heartbeats.  I&#x27;ve never had issues like this before.  I don&#x27;t know if this is all related to this product, but after reading others about their weird side effects, I&#x27;m not taking any more chances finding out.</li>
    <li> I have use this product for a long while now but do NOT see any improvement at all. Its 0 helpful.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for under-eye puffiness and I was not happy at all. First of all it specifically advertises instant results. Now I&#x27;m realistic and I&#x27;m willing to give products a chance, but I also expect products to live up to their own standards. This product says \\&quot;Instantly: eyes look renewed and refreshed\\&quot;. Not so. \\&quot;In 1 week: under-eye puffiness is reduced ...\\&quot;   Not so. I got no such results and was very disappointed, not just because of my lack of results but also because of the price I paid to be so dissatisfied. Although it was a bit cheaper in the store, it was still over $10.00 (on sale) for a half ounce (0.5 oz). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product because of the little to no results (none for me) verses the price.  Ironically enough, I used a cold eye pack/mask because of a headache one day and realized that treatment worked for my under-eye puffiness. I had gotten better, faster temporary results for free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product lives up to all it&#x27;s promises but it certainly does give you an instant perk-up effect and that&#x27;s worth the cost.  My husband has seriously dark reddish under-eye circles and puffiness, the kind you might even cough up serious cash for that Hylexin stuff but this product lessened those problems considerably within 5 minutes of applying.  I gave him 3 good swipes instead of the recommended two though.  He may even take the tube away from me and bring it to work to use in the afternoons!  The effect didn&#x27;t last but he didn&#x27;t mind.  He likes having this option for temporary relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, again, there was a good instant effect but my problems aren&#x27;t as noticeable.  I did like the instant alert feel I got from the product and the cooling effect of the metal roller which was like the old trick of putting a chilled spoon on your under eye circles.  That was nice.  What wasn&#x27;t nice was the seriously jumpy feel I got a few minutes afterward and the chest tightness that felt similar to having taken an imitrex injection.  However, the effect was only fleeting and it passed in seconds.  it&#x27;s not enough to turn me off to the product.  I decided to post a review explaining this side-effect in case anybody else was wondering why they felt weird after using the eye-roller!  it&#x27;s not so bad, really - just surprising.  It makes perfect sense given that the active ingredient is CAFFEINE and you are applying it in a circulation rich area.  No wonder I felt a little jolt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t expect this product or any other topical product to reduce very dark under eye circles.  Only a dermatologist can really do that and he/she needs to use laser treatments. redness under the eyes comes from seepage of blood from tiny capillaries.  No cosmetic product can make that go away completely or dramatically.  As for serious puffiness, again, you likely won&#x27;t get long term results from any cosmetic.  The Eye-Roller can help you look a little better and feel refreshed but it isn&#x27;t  going to magically make your bags go away no matter what their ads say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have realistic expectations, the Eye-Roller will please you.  It does temporarily reduce puffiness and minimize dark circles.  it won&#x27;t eliminate them or make them permanently lessen.  I can learn to live with the minor bad side-effect of temporary jumpiness to get the immediate relief and good effects this offers.d but it isn&#x27;t  going to magically make your bags go away no matter what their ads say.

    <li> I love this a lot, I use it every morning and it definitely diminishes my bags in the morning.</li>
    <li> Not too sure about this product. Its just OK.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m odd man(woman)out, but I used it today for the first time and was immediately impressed with the results.  I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with puffy eyes so that might be why, but I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my eye area looked more youthful than I&#x27;ve seen it lately.  It&#x27;s keeper for me.      My friend recommended this product to me and she says it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s worked for her.  She does have an issue with puffy eyes and this reduces the puffiness for her.  Oh and the product was cheaper at the store than it is here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it really does work !!  However, I will not buy it online, especially here.  The bottle was only two thirds full.  It was in a sealed in a package, but not wrapped around the opening.  I&#x27;ll get it from the drugstore next time.</li>
    <li> I like how it makes my eyes feel nice and cool when I roll it on. It seems like it&#x27;s working on my tired eyes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference with under my eyes however, it does provide a cooling sensation to make the eyes more relaxed.</li>
    <li> Have used better products,..</li>
    <li> I wake up with mildly puffy under eye bags, on occasion. This feels great, very refreshing under your eyes. I have not noticed a drastic de-puffing, but I will continue to use because it feels good. Just don&#x27;t expect a big difference in your bags. Great to have on hand though, certainly easier than an ice pack.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy...this was for my sister and he is in love with it. The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions.</li>
    <li> I definitely do not notice a difference...however, I do feel like it is probably a good thing to use still, because hey, hydration is hydration.</li>
    <li> this product is exactly what amazon has advertised. This product works as described. good rolling action. it would be better if it came in two&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It feels good when I apply it under my eyes. It makes me look a little more awake each day before work.</li>
    <li> Awesomely works Lasts a LONG time.</li>
    <li> The little roller ball is cooling and soothing and yes, I see a difference with consistent daily use.  Have recommended this to friends.  The effect is not dramatic, but it&#x27;s definite.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love that it has caffeine which decongests puffiness. I don&#x27;t like the roller, too small so I apply on my finger and massage under my eye area. I do notice puffiness go down a bit but no dramatic results.</li>
    <li> Bought this at walgreens for 10$ after a s***ty night of crying and no sleep hoping to make myself more presentable. It feels refreshing but my eyes aren&#x27;t any less swollen. Should&#x27;ve went the old fashion route of using ice.</li>
    <li> I usually put this on while I am on my way to work, multi-tasking &amp; trying to reduce puffy eye baggage...It&#x27;s cooling but other than that not sure it really is doing anything. Honestly speaking, or rather writing.</li>
    <li> have not noticed any impovement in puffy eyes. feels good and cool to put on though.</li>
    <li> I know this didn&#x27;t work for a lot of reviewers, but I love it. I&#x27;ve always had dark shadows under my eyes, even as a child, and this is the only product that actually works! It also helps with wrinkles and puffiness as advertised. Maybe the disparity between reviews lies with the difference in people&#x27;s skin types?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my eye area for two years now.  I do not experience the puffiness that I notice on others (filled bags).  It works for me, but everyone is different so I can not attest to the results others may have using the product.  I also place the product around my mouth where laugh-lines are.  I do not have deep crevices there.</li>
    <li> It does not work like it claims.&lt;br /&gt;I see no difference in my eye puffiness or color.&lt;br /&gt;try another product.</li>
    <li> My left eye has been twitching for the past few weeks. I was worried I had some major health issue going on. I would have never attributed the eye twitching with this eye roller had I not finally googled it. I believe it is a side effect of the caffeine. Also it did nothing for my under eye puffiness or dark circles. Definitely would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It worked for me right away. It drastically reduced the puffiness under my eyes. I didn&#x27;t think anything would work, but tried this on a whim and I am glad I did!</li>
    <li> Wish I had more time for skin care but I don&#x27;t so I am always happy when a product comes out that is super fast and still works great.  This one is not only reasonable in price but it does what it says.  That&#x27;s all we can hope for in skin care products.  The effect is fast....3 or 4 minutes and puffy eyes are softer and less puffy.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on Amazon, got it from my local Target store. I&#x27;ll be plain and simple, don&#x27;t waste your money, it does not work!</li>
    <li> I started using this two days ago, and it wasnt until this evening that I realized it was the cause of my sudden eye pain and one swollen eye. Maybe I am allergic to it, I don&#x27;t know. My eyes have been in pain since last night and getting worse through the day. As soon as my husband walked in the door he noticed my swollen red eyes. Not only are they more puffy, but they are tender to the touch. Even closing my eyes hurts. This is after only 3 applications. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE!</li>
    <li> My daughter suggested this product.  It arrived in a timely manner.  The metal roller was cool on the skin as stated.  I used the entire contents of the tube and saw NO improvement in the puffiness under my eyes!</li>
    <li> The one and only time i applied this, it was nice at first. About an hour later while i was driving, my eyes had some kind of reaction to whatever is in this and they started to water. Not just a little bit, i mean it looked like i was bawling my eyes out. It was so bad i had to pull over until it stopped about 10 minutes later and then my eyes were incredibly sensitive to the sun after that. Thankfullyi  was close to home. I dont have sensitive eyes, but if you do, keep caution when using this.</li>
    <li> This product is not perfect but it certainly does deliver most results it states. I LOVE the nice cooling affect it gives especially when I first wake up with \\&quot;puff ball\\&quot; eyes. It does reduce the puffiness no question there, does it last all day? No &amp; I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a miracle product &amp; if anyone does expect that they need to see a Dermatologist for whatever they can do. I have slightly dark circles under my eyes but nothing major, it doesn&#x27;t seem to help cover the dark circles up but again I was expecting to still have to use an under eye concealer. If your problem is more with puffiness give it a whirl because it does help.</li>
    <li> This really works!  Twice a day, three weeks into regular use and I really can see a difference - wish it were instant and permanent, but this is working well.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a roller ball applicator....very gentle around the eye area skin. I expect I will order another one.</li>
    <li> This Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Puff Roller really makes a difference in your dark eyes.  Do they go completely away?  No, but there is a difference.  It is worth a try!</li>
    <li> This helps me face each day with a smile.  I don&#x27;t leave my bedroom in the morning until I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;de-puffed&amp;#34; with this great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my eyes feel so refreshed.  It feels like I am rubbing cucumber under my eye.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like it but it&#x27;s chilly</li>
    <li> I should have known that something claiming \\&quot;instant\\&quot; results would disappoint, unless the instant result they are referring to is the cooling feeling of the roller. It does feel nice, but I have noticed little to no improvement of the puffiness around my eyes, and I have used this product for three weeks.</li>
    <li> This works well because it lets me massage away the bags with the little roller against my bone under and above my eye.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any results after a month of use</li>
    <li> I love it-- it instantly takes the puffiness away from under the eyes.  I used it daily before applying my makeup.</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money.  This product does not work as advertised.  I used it for over a month for under eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> Wow, even my husband noticed the difference! I have been using this product for about 3-4 weeks, every morning after the shower. What a difference the Anti-puff eye roller has made. Even for those nights when I did not sleep as well or as long as I had hoped, my under eye area is smooth, not puffy or dark. Coordinating the effort with other face care products really is helping my skin look less wrinkled, tired, or dry. Highly recommend and will not look for anything else. Priced reasonably too.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty pointless product. You really don&#x27;t need an eye moisturizer, and the ingredients in the formula don&#x27;t have the research behind them to prove whether or not they even work.&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t work noticeably for very long.</li>
    <li> not shockingly enough I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and have since fallen out of using it.</li>
    <li> After using this solidly for 6 weeks, I saw no noticeable improvement for puffiness or under-eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;But the worst issue was the side effect I was not prepared for-- under eye twitches.  I see others had similar experiences (from the caffeine?) but it took 4-5 days of no use before the constant twitch under my eye went away.</li>
    <li> Feels great - cool (in temperature). Works great. No puffiness or dark circles.</li>
    <li> Thought I would see what all the fuss what about after reading about it on Maskcara&#x27;s blog, and for the relatively low cost thought that even if it didn&#x27;t work I wasn&#x27;t out much money. At first, didn&#x27;t seem like it did much, but after several days of use(once in the morning, and once before bed) my under eye bags were almost gone. I notice a visible difference when I don&#x27;t use it--under my eyes seem more puffy for lack of better words. The key ingredient in this is the caffeine. That is what makes it work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily now.  I find that it works very well in reducing the bags under my eyes.  This is especially useful for me after putting in contacts.  I find the effects are within an hour and last throughout the day.  It has never irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye twice a day.  I didn&#x27;t find it had any immediate effect on puffiness.  Based on the product name, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected that.  It probably did help some with wrinkles over the long term.  If I had to choose, I would buy the Garnier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying this item as well. Hope all of my efforts will work - the puffiness and dark circle under my eyes are annoying me so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48, have chronic insomnia, work at a computer all day and don&#x27;t drink enough water. That being said, the bags under my eyes are the size of your typical piece of carry-on luggage. Over the last six months, I&#x27;ve tried four types of \\&quot;anti-puff\\&quot;, \\&quot;anti-dark circles\\&quot; and \\&quot;serums\\&quot;: ROC Retinol Correction Eye Cream, Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Puff Eye Roll-On, Clinique All About Eyes Serum and last month, I bought and tried L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye Correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the ROC product first. I followed all the directions and used it every day. I saw no change at all. Then I got the Garnier product. It seemed to work somewhat. When I got the trial size Clinique product, I used the Garnier on one eye and the Clinique on the other, just to see which product worked better. The Garnier worked better, the puffiness wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad, though the circles were still dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While on shopping trip at Ulta, looking for eye makeup remover, I stumbled on the L&#x27;Oreal product. It was around $12 and I had a 50% off of any product coupon. I&#x27;ve been using it on one eye with the Garnier on the other for two weeks. The Garnier was thrown in the drawer with the other failures. L&#x27;Oreal works. After two weeks, the darkness has faded, the small lines at the corners of my eyes have lessened and within 30 minutes of use, the puffiness is almost non-existent.</li>
    <li> This thing really works, after my cold shower at night (better for overall health) I apply it and go to bed, next day around noon I apply it again after washing my face with cold water; if you take showers or was your face with warm water you will just dry your skin. My dark circles around the eyes were bad and I had wrinkles, with this I have noticed the wrinkles are no longer there and the dark circles have diminished a lot!&lt;br /&gt;I am a man but those darn dark circles just made it hard for me to be taken seriously, people always thought I liked to party really hard.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different things and never worked, this one did for me and I hope it works for you. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Garnier generally makes good products; however, this is not one of them. I used this product consistently for two weeks with absolutely no benefit. I have found those freezable gel masks to be the most helpful products for eye puffiness...and they are a fraction of the price of a roller of this stuff.</li>
    <li> not only did it not help at all, it also gives my skin burning sensation.  would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Gave me headaches! It stung going on, and I tried it for 2 weeks, but started to get migraines. I stopped using it and they went away. Could work for some people, I suppose. And it did make my bags go away.</li>
    <li> This one has caffeine which gives my eyes a lift.  I love the cool feel of the roller ball but it probably picks up bacteria better than a pump.  So use it up fast.</li>
    <li> The 2 packages of Garnier skin renew anti-puff eye rollers we received on June 17, 2015, were manufactured in June 2012 and expired after 3 years.</li>
    <li> Though I&#x27;ve moved on to other type products for eye issues, this is what I tried initially and I have to say that for what it is it works pretty well! Not the &amp;#34;ideal&amp;#34;, (for me anyway!), but it&#x27;s easy and somewhat economical, doesn&#x27;t cost a whole lot and lasts quite a while! The only &amp;#34;Garnier&amp;#34; eye product I tried that wasn&#x27;t a total waste of money...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as expected.after using as described it has not helped at all.  Would not recommend to others who suffer from eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> When the product rolls on under the eye, it feels very cool and soothing on the surface of the skin.  However, it does not actually reduce puffiness or dark circles.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I read some pretty good reviews online. What a waste. Doesn&#x27;t do anything. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I generally have Juvaderm injected under the hollow of my eyes as that is one of my problem areas.  However, twice now, I&#x27;ve had a bad experience under my left eye in which the area looked like a huge pillow under that eye.  I massaged and put compresses and to no avail.  If I cry that only made it that much more puffy and it looks awful!  Today I woke up after crying and was so taken aback by the problem and I looked for anything in my cabinet to fix it, ugh!  I forgot a friend of mine gave me like 6 of the anti-puff eye rollers.  So I figure, lets try.  I not only rolled it under my eye, but was able to move some of the hardened gel (now 3 months old) to other areas under my eye to give it a more even look.  I used some pressure with the roller and it worked like a charm! Thank god for this product!</li>
    <li> Not only doesn&#x27;t this product work to reduce puffiness, but it sometimes stings when it is applied.  That can not be a good sign.  This is useless.  Alas, the puffiness persists undiminished.</li>
    <li> I might have been expecting too much of it. It was made for puffy eyes but mine have 87 year bags under them. So, instead of blaming the product maybe I should give my eyes one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not Steffi Graf. For some reason your web site has been greeting me with \\&quot;Hello Steffi Graf\\&quot; for quite awhile. I&#x27;m sorry that I unintentionally made people think she was 87 years old. However, it has been an honor to be mistaken for this famous lady. We don&#x27;t even look alike. I&#x27;m a man.</li>
    <li> I have used the entire tube and I have noticed no difference.</li>
    <li> Been using it for over a month now and I do not show any positive results at all.No changes to puffiness nor underbag relief at all.</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing a period of insomnia so I needed something serious for my dark bags around my eyes and decided to try this product.  I am pretty disappointed, I might as well be using nothing because it worked about that well!  I was using Burts Bees prior to this and was very satisfied but I had a hard time finding it in stores near me, I guess I&#x27;ll be ordering it online because the Garnier surely isn&#x27;t cutting it!</li>
    <li> I am 56 and have had puffiness and dark circles since I turned 50. This product did nothing at all. I was very disappointed because I saw alot of good reviews.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about purchasing this product after reading the mixed reviews. I&#x27;ve seen it in the store, and I will say, on \\&quot;Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot; you absolutely can&#x27;t beat the price! I can&#x27;t speak for everyone (i.e., age, skin condition, etc.), but I can say that I am 44 and all of a sudden, I&#x27;ve been seeing dark circles under my eyes and a whole lot of puffiness. I&#x27;m not sure, if it&#x27;s age, environmental or both, in any case, I wasn&#x27;t happy about it at all! So, I purchased this product and I&#x27;m thrilled! The first time I used it, I stood in front of the mirror and watched it working...the very first time! One of my eyes seems puffier than the other, and the one that&#x27;s not so puffy, basically, deflated as I watched. All I can say is this, I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week now, and I won&#x27;t be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application tip: be sure to shake the product and as you apply it, squeeze it a little. The tube is a bit flexible, and the first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t know to gently squeeze it. You will slightly feel the product coming out, as you apply it. It&#x27;s very refreshing and feel great. It may even feel better, if you put it into the frig? Also speaking to another reviewer, I did not find this product to sticky or tacky at all, or I wouldn&#x27;t be using it! After using this product, the skin under my eyes feel refreshed, not sticky, and not tight...you don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there. It goes on very light and smooth with no change in the feel of your skin. I apply it, right out of the shower in the morning and after about 5-10 minutes, I can put my make-up on...right over top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dark circles or a \\&quot;puffy-eye\\&quot; issue, give this a try. It worked wonder for me, and I hope it does for you too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I saw it on a daytme talk show several years ago as one of the &amp;#34;self magazine best priducts under 50 bucks&amp;#34; and I got it then and I have used it ever since.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Using just a little dab of this eye gel does the trick!  i have really puffy eyes and this product makes them all go away!  I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have permanent dark circles and puffiness every morning and have tried a lot of highly rated products to help with them. None of them have worked. I bought this and noticed a huge difference in puffiness after using it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is I&#x27;m not sure if it had any effect on the dark circles...maybe a little? However, the shadows being cast by the bags under my eyes made the circles look worse, and since this eliminates bags it actually did make them look better...and for that I love this stuff, even though I do still have minor dark circles.</li>
    <li> I get plenty of sleep but now that I&#x27;m in my 30s, my eyes are always puffy so I tried this in hopes it would help,  but it didn&#x27;t, I used it as directed too. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> this is one of my favoritge beauty products and want to share it with all of my friends so I bought it for my girl friends birthday</li>
    <li> It goes on cool and easily.  If you are puffy or stressed this is refreshing.</li>
    <li> this moisture cream is really neat to usr  arrived exactly when stated  have just been using 4 a few days so have no results yet  but price was right</li>
    <li> looks good, though some of the ingredients have changed in this product&lt;br /&gt;Delivery and condition was good.</li>
    <li> I talked to my wife some time back about needing a product to reduce the dark circles under my eyes and hopefully help with the bags which seem to be developing. She is highly researched on beauty products, latest research, etc. and so I respected her opinion. She said that most products which have proven to be successful are quite expensive and not sure they were designed for guys. I had mentioned my quick search had brought me to this product so wanted to know if it would be worthwhile. She read up about it and said it sounded like it was worth a trial...particularly at this price. So I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several months of somewhat consistent, but not daily use, I do find that it seems to have helped! I believe the dark circles are mostly gone, I feel like the skin under my eyes has tightened (e.g. less bags), and there is a bit more life in my eyes then there was a few months ago. While I wouldn&#x27;t call this an amazing or miracle product, I do feel some degree of effectiveness has definitely been seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, being a normal (not metro-sexual) guy, is I had a very tough time initially in that it is applied as what my wife calls a \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; -- my word is liquid make-up. I have since gotten over that aspect, but honestly it is mostly because I put it on at home and once it&#x27;s rubbed in I don&#x27;t believe anyone can tell. No one has ever asked me if I was wearing makeup or any such thing, so I don&#x27;t believe the concealer is visible once rubbed in. Again, the results work and no one knows so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> The seller was excellent, but the product irritated my eyes.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully for decreasing under-eye puffiness without leaving residue.</li>
    <li> I bought it for about $16.&lt;br /&gt;I used it daily, as instructed. After weeks, I saw no results whatsoever. It didn&#x27;t help with the puffness and not at all with the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I truly feel like a waste of time and money. I don&#x27;t really use products -I tend to buy and put them away and never touching it again. But the dark circles are something I&#x27;d love to be rid of. So I used this one properly. And it did not work. Not at all.</li>
    <li> Yes....no miracle worker of course but YES, this de-puff your eyes big time.  I definitely recommend and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I srarted using it recently but seeing improvement every day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bags under my eye my whole life. They&#x27;re chronic. Maybe it&#x27;s genetic, maybe I have untreated allergies, maybe it&#x27;s a combination of lots of things. It doesn&#x27;t matter how I slept, I&#x27;m going to have them anyway. I&#x27;m always trying to find a solution, anything to help hide them so i don&#x27;t have to hide behind my glasses forever. So I got this hoping it would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my eyes are baggier than usual due to poor sleep, this does help a lot. it doesn&#x27;t get rid of them all the way though. It can&#x27;t treat the other sources of my bagginess, only the sleep-related part. So if sleep bagginess is your only problem, it&#x27;s probably perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it nearly every day for at least a month. I&#x27;m not sure if there is any permanent improvement. I&#x27;ll keep using it until it runs out just to see.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change, but it did seem to reduce puffiness right when you use it. The effect doesn&#x27;t last long, however, and by afternoon the puffiness will return. It does feel good, though, when it goes on.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes/skin.  This does not burn or sting. Score... I have an aveeno one that stings (rollerball).  I&#x27;ve tried the Loreal rollerball and it&#x27;s nice but not as good for puffy eyes/dark circles... great for filling out the skin though (creases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but it actually does help with puffy eyes!  I have very serious allergy issues and it&#x27;s a struggle... the dark circles diminish as well.  It&#x27;s not a permanent fix but it lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> Well, it FEELS good going on....cool to the skin. But after 3 weeks of use every morning and night, no noticeable difference. Now cucumber pads, THOSE are great...get them on Amazon too!</li>
    <li> I first used this product when I was 20 (I&#x27;m now 22). I woke up one morning, and my under eyes were SUPER puffy. And it freaked me out because that has never happened to me before. I was working at Rite Aid at the time, so I picked this product up and used it that night because my eyes were still puffy. It was easy to apply and smelled good. The next morning I woke up and the puffyness was gone completely. I never had a problem with puffyness again but if I ever do this will be there !! :)</li>
    <li> I used it and it seems to be helping just enough so that I&#x27;m afraid to stop using it. It&#x27;s easy and quick. the little applicator seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> Thsi is the wierdest skin product I have ever used. Another reviewer is right -- it makes me feel jumpy and I prefer serenity with my skin care. But worse -- far worse imho -- is that now I see two areas of puffiness on each undereye area instead of the normal smaller puffiness near the outer corners of my eyes. Now I see a second puffy area lower than the higher one. Ugh. Back it goes. I&#x27;ve used other products that at least remove the dark spots and I only have a small puffy area under each eye. Back to my simple eye creams. The packaging is pretty,though.</li>
    <li> Item arrived leaking from it&#x27;s cap.</li>
    <li> When I received this product the box was destroyed and the tube was leaking out. I will never but this from amazon again! It looked like someone pulled it out of a garbage can and than shipped it off. Thanks for wasting my money.</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  I wake up with puffy eyes and it reduces the puffiness in seconds.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> took a long time for them to actually become less puffy&lt;br /&gt;left it sticky, couldnt apply it if i needed to put on makeup&lt;br /&gt;just useless</li>
    <li> This actually works, I was surprised.  I have horrible bags under my eyes and this makes an obvious difference.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily to reduce eye puffiness.  It works wonders and for the price, should be a must-have for anyone who needs to de-puff in the a.m. as well as p.m.</li>
    <li> I keep this product in the fridge, and it feels nice to put it on my puffy eyes in the morning.  It often reduces the puffiness for a few hours, and then they are back to being puffy again. If I use it everyday, it wears off in it&#x27;s effects - rather than building up to reduce the puffiness long term.  I know my puffiness is caused by minor allergies.  This product isn&#x27;t real expensive, which is why I continue to use it, but I am looking for something better.  I want a good deputing product that works reliably and do not have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
    <li> My problem is bags just above the cheekbone ,this product helped a little. I think it would do wonders for someone who had the typical eye circles. It does soothe the puffy areas</li>
    <li> This item was advertised as new, but when it arrived the package had been opened and seal broken like it had been used.  I would never purchase used make-up and I am very disappointed that this item was misrepresented.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and cool on your skin when it&#x27;s applied. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and see some improvement I will continue using it  to see if my eye puffs continue to improve.</li>
    <li> Used this product for over a month and have seen 0 results. It has not reduced my puffiness, under eye circles, or wrinkles. Will go back to my neutrogena eye cream. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my eyes look less tired and reduces the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Prompt customer service, will order again. Thank you</li>
    <li> It did not do the job as I had hoped.  Still have the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all for dark circles.</li>
    <li> While this has a nice cool feeling on the undereye area, I have used most of the roller without any noticeable results for puffiness or dark circles.  I&#x27;ve found the creams to work better and they don&#x27;t leave the undereye area feeling a bit stiff as this product did.</li>
    <li> Still some puffiness.</li>
    <li> Did not like.  Felt that is was falsely advertised.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product..no..I NEEDED to like this.It did nothing for me.No results what so ever.So it&#x27;s def.not for me!</li>
    <li> This is not a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for under-eye problems, but it definitely provides noticeable improvements on days that I use it, which is every day. I am 48 and have used this product for about 5 years on a daily basis. It is cool and soothing going on, and in just a few minutes it improves under-eye puffiness and helps to smooth out the fine lines. It goes on under my make-up every day and is a must-have. I think it is a great product for the price. You might be able to get better results with something that costs far more but I am happy with this.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandma who is constantly complaining about &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under her eyes.  She used this stuff daily and said she liked it.</li>
    <li> Unimpressed. Tried it but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Great product to help reduce under eye puffiness</li>
    <li> Not too sure if this does all that it should or claims to do. But I do like it. The ball is very cooling and feels good after a long cry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time and haven&#x27;t really noticed that much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it over a year and applying a couple of times a week, I can&#x27;t see any change at all. Not recommended even it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
    <li> Totally worthless! Both of my eyes had almost equal amount of puffiness and black-eye, so as a scientist I have applied the product faithfully twice a day on only my right eye. Today is exactly one month after I started my experiment and there is ABSOLUTELY no difference between my eyes. NOT A THING. I can&#x27;t tell any difference, so couldn&#x27;t anyone whom I showed my eyes to. No wonder there is no money-back-guarantee unlike many skin products.&lt;br /&gt;Fool me once, shame on you. I will never ever buy any product from Garnier.</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t de-puff. It does absolutely nothing. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a completely worthless item... at least if you are a graduate student and always look tired.  I mean after a week I could not notice any difference.  Do yourself a favor and catch up on sleep and instead buy yourself some fresh fruit.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, it was because my sister purchased it for me for a present. She had achieved dramatic results around the eyes with it and loved the product. I started noticing quite a difference pretty quickly and love this product, too. It lasts a very long time. You will be surprised how long. The puffiness is reduced dramatically. With continued use, I think the skin around my eyes looks younger. This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product is good. I feel instantaneously relieved by the coldness of the roller. I still did not see effect on puffiness, but it seems good till now.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my local grocery store on my never-ending quest to reduce my under eye puffiness. I am 34 and have a hereditary type puffiness that I have battled my whole life, and I gotta be honest, this one did nothing for me. The roller itself is nice, and I still use it in the morning in the car (so every morning) and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement over the last 3 weeks. On the other hand, like I said, the roller is nice and the coolness of it certainly helps perk me up a little in the morning. I will definitely finish the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I notice a small difference in the puffiness under my eyes when I used it consistently....nothing life changing though. i</li>
    <li> nice ,and cool and with the coupon you can save 2 dollars. that&#x27;s what i want ,easy to use.</li>
</ol>
