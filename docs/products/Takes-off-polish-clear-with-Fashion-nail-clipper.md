    <li> Did the job very well</li>
    <li> Very strong and works quick!</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the nail solan solutions for shellac gel removal. Soak for 10 mins then using a flat edge the gel comes off. Pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> This product works so awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> After using this about once a week for 3+ months, my nails would not stop splitting and peeling. I haven&#x27;t used it in about a month now and my nails are back to their strong healthy state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this, I always washed and moisturizer my hands. I also take biotin everyday, but my nails were still splitting/peeling.</li>
    <li> Works great and really saves on the manicure tab</li>
    <li> Love this polish remover. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of remover and nothing works near as well as this does. Very fast polish removal and clean artificial nail removal. Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done! I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit stronger than other nail polish removers I&#x27;ve used but still tolerable but it is the best nail polish remover I have used because it takes off nail polish fast and you don&#x27;t need to waste as much cotton balls or use that much polish remover</li>
    <li> After buying this over priced product I stumbled across it at Walmart for $2 . Yes TWO DOLLARS the same brand, same amount/volume. Really amazon? Well lesson learned. It got my acrylic nails off after soaking. Well most of them. A little difficult to get off my feet.</li>
    <li> Removes polish fast and easy including glitter polish. Love it. So much better than any other I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> You can find the same size and brand at Walmart for 2.50 but it is so worth it! Never using any other type of Nail Polish remover!</li>

    <li> Best Nail Polish Remover ...I Will  always use this brand.... TWO swipes with the cotton ball and your nails are ready for the next COLOR or a home manicure....SUPER PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Awesome! works great on glitter</li>
    <li> IT works well. And arrived fast</li>
    <li> Nice size for the price</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time.  It did remove the old artificial nails, glue and polish.  Not too much on the strong smelling side so was able to tolerate the odor.  Even my husband didn&#x27;t complain.  Works as stated.  Will keep this one on the shopping list.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if I would purchase again. After following the directions on several occasions, I realize this product worked no better than your average, store bought nail polish remover. Only a bit harsher for the nails.</li>
    <li> Bought this to soak off Gelish brand nail gel. Works like a charm and much cheaper than Gelish remover. Cut a cotton square into little pieces to fit your nail. Soak up some acetone, place on nail and wrap in foil. 10 minutes and the gel has begun to lift away. I scrap away and file away an access. Good as new and ready to apply a fresh set of gel.</li>
