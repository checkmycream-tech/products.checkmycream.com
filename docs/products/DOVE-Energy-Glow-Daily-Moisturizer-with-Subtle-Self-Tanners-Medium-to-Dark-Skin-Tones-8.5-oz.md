      <li>Best self tan out there!</li>
      <li>This lotion is the best tanner I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>this is the best tanning cream for my skin.</li>
      <li>But I think it&#x27;s the best self tanner out there!</li>
      <li>It is perfectly even with no streaks or splotches, so that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
      <li>I am very impressed with this  product.</li>

      <li>I love this product and I&#x27;m so very happy to find it on amazon.</li>
      <li>The smell is very pleasant but not at all overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m already fair and wanted the lotion to add some \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin, but all that I received was a body lotion.      </li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s a good price, this product is well-worth it.  </li>
      <li>but, I was sent lotion for \\&quot;fair skin</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and have not found another product that tans and gives color to your skin like this product does.  </li>
      <li>I have relatively fair skin and bought the \\&quot;fair to medium\\&quot; one on a whim.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This product works amazingly.</li>
      <li>and I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  </li>

      <li>I love, love, this product.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the product both colors, (depending on the time of year) and I am bummed Dove has discontinued making it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Much better than Jergens, and smells better too.</li>
      <li>but I just want to be sure the color never &#x27;leaks&#x27; onto my furniture or clothes.</li>
      <li>Compared to all the regular drug store brands, I think Dove has the best self tanner line.  </li>
      <li>I used it on my face, which is horribly sensitive, and experienced no burning or breakouts.</li>
      <li>Nice, light trexture and goes on pretty smoothly.</li>
      <li>It is by far the best for natural looking tan.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully this lotion will always be available.</li>
      <li>I was fortunate to have found it at Amazon.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s no longer available in stores</li>
      <li>I already had a light tan to start out</li>
      <li>This is by far the best and only tanner for me.</li>
      <li>This lotion makes you look healthy and is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I use it every other day for a great looking tan.  </li>
      <li>Thank you to the seller for shipping me the corrected item quickly upon notification of the error.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to apply, just like a lotion, with absolutely no streaking of any kind.</li>
      <li>so I guess it was worth the price.</li>
      <li>I like Dove much better than Jergens and other tanners because it seemed to work better.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, my daughter had an allergic reaction to it the first (and</li>
      <li>no streaks, but a pretty color.</li>
      <li>Product never fails.</li>
      <li>I had back surgery and haven&#x27;t been able to tan at all.  </li>
      <li>I put it on fairly liberally and noticed that as it dried it made my skin somewhat sticky which didn&#x27;t thrill me.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion and it&#x27;s becoming more difficult to find.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers say it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
      <li>she paid for and in this case I positively did not.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much as I don&#x27;t have much experience with self tanners!</li>
      <li>It also makes me look really tan.  </li>
      <li>This product is very hepful for those who are restricted from getting too much sun exposure.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for nothing--Donald Price</li>
      <li>Always go gently there, never with excess.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Results were noticeable within the first application and were so natural and non-orange!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other products and have paid top dollar</li>
      <li>I knew it from last year, and couldn&#x27;t find anything else at drugstore prices as good as this except for a few of these online, at very high prices.</li>
      <li>, so be aware if you have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>but the price was way too high</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>My tan looks natural, and there are no streaks on my skin.</li>
      <li>I think it looks so natural</li>
      <li>but because it still feels \\&quot;cool or wet to the touch\\&quot;, I put an old pair of thin sweats on until I&#x27;m absolutely sure it is dry.  </li>
      <li>I have tried about all the self-tanners available in drug stores and a few more expensive ones at the cosmetic counters in department stores.</li>
      <li>For some commercial reason, this product was not available most places, certainly not in stores.</li>
      <li>The shipper had the product right out, within a few days.</li>
      <li>The color is very subtle, it just has a healthy look without being yellowish.</li>
      <li>I use the medium to dark Dove lotion, and it really does give me a darker, brown color rather than a bronze color that starts to look orange after a couple applications.</li>

<li> tones.\\&quot;  Needless to say, I was really disappointed.  </li>
<li> Ordered the Dove Energy Glow as discribed on the Impossible Discounts web page.  </li>

<li> , it&#x27;s moisturizing without being greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad scent.  </li>

<li> Very Disappointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received the product timely; however, the product that I received was not the product that I ordered.  I was extremely disappointed when I learned that Dove had stopped making the self tanning products and I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  EXCEPT... I ordered the lotion for   \\&quot;Medium to Dark Skin Tones\\&quot; but, I was sent lotion for \\&quot;fair skin tones.\\&quot;  Needless to say, I was really disappointed.  I&#x27;m already fair and wanted the lotion to add some \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin, but all that I received was a body lotion.      I think that the customer should get what he/she paid for and in this case I positively did not.  Just look at the picture of the product; it specifies Med to Dark, but that&#x27;s not what I got.    Very Disappointing.</li>
    <li> This self tanner works for me when others won&#x27;t. I get compliments on my tan all of the time.</li>
    <li> I love, love, this product.  I highly recommend it.  I&#x27;ve used other products and have paid top dollar but this one tops the cake.  Its cheaper and works extremely well.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have fair skin and have not found another product that tans and gives color to your skin like this product does.  There is also no smell.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Product never fails. It goes on without streaking giving you awesome color. Best part no residue. Wont streak on remain on clothing. Best self tan out there!</li>
    <li> Nice, light trexture and goes on pretty smoothly. It took me a couple of applications to get to the color I wanted, but it turned out not orange or streaky. Very pleasant scent too.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this  product. I have relatively fair skin and bought the \\&quot;fair to medium\\&quot; one on a whim. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much as I don&#x27;t have much experience with self tanners! But this blew me away. It is so easy to apply, just like a lotion, with absolutely no streaking of any kind. The smell is very pleasant but not at all overwhelming. (I couldn&#x27;t notice it after I applied it.) I used it on my face, which is horribly sensitive, and experienced no burning or breakouts. Results were noticeable within the first application and were so natural and non-orange! No staining of clothes and quick-drying. WOW! Thank you, Dove, I&#x27;ll stick with your brand!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it&#x27;s becoming more difficult to find.I use it on my face. The color is very subtle, it just has a healthy look without being yellowish. I wish it came in bigger bottles.  Shipping was fast. Hopefully this lotion will always be available.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly. My tan looks natural, and there are no streaks on my skin. It also makes me look really tan.  It&#x27;s Much better than Jergens, and smells better too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the product both colors, (depending on the time of year) and I am bummed Dove has discontinued making it. Thank you to the seller for shipping me the corrected item quickly upon notification of the error.</li>
    <li> So sorry this product has been discontinued. I was fortunate to have found it at Amazon. It provides the best natural-looking self-tan for the money that I have found. I have tried about all the self-tanners available in drug stores and a few more expensive ones at the cosmetic counters in department stores.</li>
    <li> I already had a light tan to start out and I just wanted something to maintain the color (or even deepen it).  I only used this product three times in the last 6 days and already I can see it has an orange tint to it.  It is perfectly even with no streaks or splotches, so that&#x27;s a plus.  I put it on fairly liberally and noticed that as it dried it made my skin somewhat sticky which didn&#x27;t thrill me.  I also don&#x27;t care for the smell... I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers say it&#x27;s nice.  I guess it is all about your preference.  I don&#x27;t care for it.  Additionally, my daughter had an allergic reaction to it the first (and last) time she that used it, so be aware if you have sensitive skin this might not be for you.  I&#x27;ve never used any sort of \\&quot;fake bake\\&quot; before, I think the next time I will try something else.  Sorry, Dove.  I usually like your products but this time I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> The Dove Energy Glow gives the perfect natural tan.  I had back surgery and haven&#x27;t been able to tan at all.  This lotion makes you look healthy and is very moisturizing.  I love It!!</li>
    <li> Ordered the Dove Energy Glow as discribed on the Impossible Discounts web page.  The self tanner was listed as Medium to Dark, which is what I use.  When the product was received, it was for Medium skin tones.  Emailed Impossible Discounts immediately to alert them of their error.  I am still waiting for a reply, and that has been over a month.  Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be ordering anything from them in the future.  Have yet to have any problems when I order off the Ebay website.  Thanks for nothing--Donald Price</li>
    <li> this product is over priced.....prior to being forced to purchase online only, it was less than $10 in stores; otherwise results are as they&#x27;ve always been</li>
    <li> Compared to all the regular drug store brands, I think Dove has the best self tanner line.  I&#x27;ve tried several others and Dove is the only one that doesn&#x27;t have an orange tint.  I use the medium to dark Dove lotion, and it really does give me a darker, brown color rather than a bronze color that starts to look orange after a couple applications.</li>
    <li> this is the best tanning cream for my skin. no streaks, but a pretty color.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best tanner I have ever used.  No nasty smell and no orange looking legs.  My dermataligist couldn&#x27;t believe my tan came from a bottle.  She was so impressed! I use it every other day for a great looking tan.  Be careful around the feet.  Always go gently there, never with excess.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love Dove Energy Glow self tanner!  I think it looks so natural, it&#x27;s moisturizing without being greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad scent.  I&#x27;m having trouble finding it and was wondering if Dove has discontinued it.  But I think it&#x27;s the best self tanner out there!</li>
    <li> For some commercial reason, this product was not available most places, certainly not in stores. I knew it from last year, and couldn&#x27;t find anything else at drugstore prices as good as this except for a few of these online, at very high prices. Amazon had the best price, and except for the price of shipping which even then was kindly reduced at my request because of the quantity I ordered, I was delighted to receive this. The shipper had the product right out, within a few days. Think I bought all this shipper had at the time.     This is by far the best and only tanner for me. I am 74-yo, have freckled blotchy skin, and this enables me to go out in other than just long pants. Hope this manufacturer gets back to bringing this back to market.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find Dove Energy Glow Daily Moisturizer with Self-Tanners in the stores anymore.  I purchased this online but the price was way too high so I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  I like Dove much better than Jergens and other tanners because it seemed to work better.  If it&#x27;s a good price, this product is well-worth it.  I use it usually in the evening after a workout or during the day if I&#x27;m going to be home.  I put it on, wait about 5 minutes to allow it to dry but because it still feels \\&quot;cool or wet to the touch\\&quot;, I put an old pair of thin sweats on until I&#x27;m absolutely sure it is dry.  I have never seen the color on my sweats but I just want to be sure the color never &#x27;leaks&#x27; onto my furniture or clothes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why Dove does not sell this product in the regular stores.  It is by far the best for natural looking tan.  Looks even better when I have a base tan.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m so very happy to find it on amazon. Paid a lot for it but it&#x27;s no longer available in stores so I guess it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product is very hepful for those who are restricted from getting too much sun exposure.  Helped eliminate those chalky looking legs for those who can&#x27;t afford, from a health standpoint, to get tanned legs.</li>
