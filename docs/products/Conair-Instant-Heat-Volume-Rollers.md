<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of lame that there&#x27;s a storage slot for the metal clips but this set of curlers doesn&#x27;t actually include the clips themselves. Instead the set comes with plastic clamps which I don&#x27;t care for. I got rid of those. Luckily I have an older set of curlers and I was able to salvage the old clips for using with this new set.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a set that had fallen apart. Perfect travel set.  I have my own metal clips that I prefer to use over the plastic ones that come with it.</li>
    <li> Works well, just wish it had two more curlers.... If you had a lot of hair you might need two or three of these guys. I always seem to have to patches off hair that are left out... so I need to go back and reheat to finish the job.</li>
    <li> Simply the best for getting soft - smooth curls for my long hair!</li>
    <li> great for travel. Not the highest quality, but excellent value for the money.</li>
    <li> I used these one time only - in Europe and they wouldn&#x27;t work the second time.  I tried several other outlets and adapters but they were completely broken.</li>
    <li> love these curlers - bigger than standard.</li>
    <li> I wish there were two more rollers but this is great to travel with and works nicely between US and Europe.  It heats up quickly, thankfully!  It has a US plug end, so plan accordingly.</li>
    <li> Curls do not hold, more like waves to flat in a few hours.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough to create waves in thick hair.  My daughter chose this from a relative&#x27;s Amazon gift card for Christmas and she was very disappointed that it did absolutely nothing at all to her hair.  Also, 5 rollers isn&#x27;t nearly enough to curl a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> Heat up quickly. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for travel and are dual voltage.  I take them everywhere and even have a zippered case to store them in along with my hair brushes and a travel size can of hair spray.  They are light, heat up quickly and the pins hold well.</li>
    <li> These heat up fast and are just the trick for when I want to give my hair more fullness.  I don&#x27;t leave them in long enough to actually CURL my hair.  I also like the size of the case.  While I haven&#x27;t tried to travel with these, I would not hesitate to wrap it in bubble wrap and place it to the side of one of my carryon bags.</li>
    <li> Have bought these rollers many times over the years.  Have tried others but these are the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They give a lasting curl, don&#x27;t burn the hair, and don&#x27;t tangle the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy two sets at a time to have 10 jumbo rollers to use every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had the base unit wear out, but I have worn off the velour covering on the rollers after several years of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Although it is compact enough to easily fit into a suitcase, I did not purchase this product specifically for travel. I use it on a regular basis. The rollers heat up very quickly -- there&#x27;s an LED on one of them that goes from red to white when all the rollers are hot. The rollers seem very durable but the clips are plastic. (An order form for replacement clips came with the rollers and I&#x27;ve been wondering if I should go ahead and order some in case I break one.) My hair is very thick but I haven&#x27;t had any tangling problems and the set lasts a long time. This is so much better than the time-consuming and arm-tiring method of blow drying I used to do.</li>
    <li> The rollers are nicely portable, although you must separately purchase clips that fit into the case.  Biggest issue with curl is the each roller is split to slide into the heating unit, not like your typical circular heating port.  If the tip of your hair falls into this, the curl is irregular.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 10 set of jumbo clips seperate, cuz i dind&#x27;t know they were included in the package.   But you can&#x27;t really complain for getting more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months. It&#x27;s easy to use and heat very quickly. But there are not enough rollers. It&#x27;s better with the full set of 12 rollers. It&#x27;s good for traveling. All in all, I recommended.</li>
    <li> These jumbo rollers are very easy and convenient to use, the box is small and light, so you can definitely take them with you on your trips. However, there is one thing you need to know before you purchase this product: it is completely useless on long and thick hair. I have tried heating them for over an hour and leaving them on my hair for over 2 hours. Still, when I take them off, there wouldn&#x27;t be a slightest hint of a curl in my hair. My hair is naturally wavy, but after using these curlers, it would actually get straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using them on dry hair, slightly wet hair, right after washing my hair, two days after washing my hair, with or without product - all to no avail. I have tried using them on only half of my hair, as some readers have recommended but the result is still a slightly straighter hair and no trace of a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if your hair is long and thick, this is definitely not a product for you.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling. Easy to pack in my suitcase. I bought extra rollers at Sally&#x27;s and I was set!</li>
    <li> I have thick, long hair and a lot of it. I wish they made a larger set of these rollers. They take a little longer than I would like to get super hot. I never have much luck with rollers....So it may just be me.</li>
    <li> I love the body and bouncy waves I get from these rollers. I have fine, straight, layered hair that just brushes my shoulders and these rollers completely change the look of my hair, giving me lots of fullness and waves. There aren&#x27;t enough rollers to do my whole head at once (they really need to make this with 8 rollers) so I have to reheat three and then do the rest of my head. My hair is so straight that I have trouble wrapping my ends around, so here&#x27;s what I do: after blow drying my hair with a light thermal styling  gel, I  lift big sections of hair, comb through, lightly mist with water, fold one square of thin  toilet paper (or one sheet of a two layer sheet) around the ends and use it like an end paper to bend the ends around the roller smoothly, just like the hairstylist did when you used to get perms. If I don&#x27;t do that, I get weird crimped ends or they keep popping out of the rolled section. It also seems to protect my ends from the heat a bit. The water mist makes the set last much longer than if I rolled my hair completely dry. Just don&#x27;t add too much water or the heat of the rollers won&#x27;t dry the moisture. Let the rollers cool in your hair and take them out. Let your hair cool few minutes before brushing or finger combing.  Downsides: I give this product a four star rating because it really needs more rollers - even two more would be nice- and because I can tell the lid is going to crack just like everyone says it will.   I travel a lot and I suppose this is my best option. I have a set of the pink travel conair hot rollers, which has more rollers in it, but they are smaller and give me dorky looking curls.</li>
    <li> These rollers work pretty well.  Not as well as I hoped, but my hair is extremely thick.  If you have thinner hair then you&#x27;ll love these.  They even come with the nice white clips not the metal pins.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it.  She would order again.</li>
    <li> This is the second set I&#x27;ve ordered after leaving one set behind when traveling.  I love the body the curlers give you.  I would recommend these curlers to any one who needs just a little more body to their hair.  Seller was great working with too!  I purchased the Super Clips with these but they actually came with their own!</li>
    <li> Love these!  Just enough of them and still small enough to tote around in my gym bag or suitcase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t need a full-size set of rollers with varying sizes.  I just needed a few large electric rollers and these fit the bill perfectly.  They heat in an instant and provide the right amount of curl.  Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This jumbo rollers set is great!!  It doesn&#x27;t burn your hair like curling irons do and the rollers are velvety.  I like the fact that they are BIG rollers so you wont get mini curls that end up looking like you are back from the 80s.  I would of rated this set 5 stars but the fact that the set comes in a hard-case, I rated it only 4 stars - not as convenient for traveling when it&#x27;s a hard case.  When I pack it on my carry-on roller bag, I&#x27;m always afraid the top lid will crack because it&#x27;s in my suitcase.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great set if you want BIG curls or waves.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and there were not enough rollers.  I wasn&#x27;t trying to do all my hair just some. There is nothing wrong with these, they are definitely compact and easy to use they just weren&#x27;t great if you have thick hair and a lot of it. You would probably need at least 10 rollers.</li>
    <li> This hairsetter is compact, heats up fast and is dual voltage with switch on bottom.I used it for 2 weeks in Europe. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the jumbo size, but there are not enough rollers.  They work well, and the flocked feature protects from hair breakage, compared with the plastic coated type with little spikes.  What I do not like is that the plastic case breaks easily....I am on my second set, and it too has broken.  Also, hair easily collects in the bottom and is difficult to remove.  Would prefer a soft sided carrier, which would be much easier for travel.  This model takes up a lot of room in my carry-on bag.</li>
    <li> The rollers do exactly what I want.  They create big soft curls that give a nice amount of body to my hair.  They heat up quickly and are easy to use and store.  I love that there are only five rollers to mess around with.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but I can get all of my hair in those five curlers and be done with my hair for the day.  I&#x27;m really glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same set for over ten years and still rely on them for big bouncy curls or just to straighten out the frizzies. I&#x27;ve tried other versions, but these are the only ones that tame my thick hair and are easy to put in and I can let them set while I do my make-up and get dressed and then I am on my way! It is finally time for a new set as these ones have finally started to act up, but it&#x27;s probably from me leaving them on too long at a time by mistake so now they over-heat and melt the rollers so the rollers no longer fit in the heater.</li>
    <li> The jumbo rollers are a great size for adding soft curls and volume.  The set heats very quickly so it&#x27;s also easy to reheat the curlers, if 5 rollers aren&#x27;t enough. The ends don&#x27;t get abnormally hot (as cited for other sets). The unit also cools very quickly, which is great for last minute packing.  The only two points that kept this from being a 5-star rating are:  1. the size is rather bulky.  It would have been more convenient if the unit was smaller and with the 5 rollers in a row.  To keep the lid from flying open in my suitcase, I secure the unit with a large rubber band and then put it in a large ziplock bag.  (The bag protects my clothes in case the lid shatters.)  2.  The unit has a well for wire clips but doesn&#x27;t include any.  Instead, the unit comes with large plastic claw-style clips that don&#x27;t fit inside the unit and take up a fair amount of room.  If you prefer wire clips, be sure to save the paperwork in the box.  The paperwork includes an order form for the wire clips, which are very difficult to find online or in stores.  However, after ordering, I received a letter that they are currently out of stock and to call in another month for a status.  All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase; and it&#x27;s much easier than traveling with my full set of 12 jumbo rollers.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers. My set is about 7 yrs old! The top is broken off and I&#x27;ve lost 2 pins, but I just use a couple jumbo sized hair clips and it stays in. It does take a little practice, but I&#x27;m done rolling in 5 minutes.   I have fine, longer (4-5\\&quot; pass shoulders)hair. When I know I&#x27;m going to use the rollers I add some moose/gel before blow-drying. I section off my hair and spray aerosol hairspray on it. My hair clings to the roller and stays in better, plus it gives great volume. I also give a good spray all over after I&#x27;m done. I usually put on make-up while the curlers are in. I take them out and have \\&quot;Super Model\\&quot; hair, according to my hubby! I let the curls cool and relax then run my fingers through and I&#x27;m done.   Another tip: Try rolling them in different directions....as in roll one under and the other up.   Hope this helps...</li>
    <li> I rarely use rollers, but needed something to take with me when I travel.  These work wonderfully, and take up very little space in my luggage.  Amazon always has the very best prices on everything!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these rollers for years with great results on my long to medium length hair, and just finally getting my second set. The originals are still working but the velvet is wearing thin and I was afraid they wouldn&#x27;t still be available when I finally did need them. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about them is the bulkiness of the clips when traveling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using conair hot rollers for about 15 years.  My old travel set and my \\&quot;home set\\&quot; (which is a larger 12 roller set) have broken covers, worn rollers, and strectched out wire clips (They both came with wire and plastic clips. I never liked and only used the plastic clips that came with them one time).  I needed hot curlers to bring with me to my niece&#x27;s wedding that would heat and set my hair quickly and not take up too much room in my suitcase. I have long, very straight, fine (but a lot of it) hair and I wanted large rollers, so I ordered this set.    I used these rollers for the wedding and my hair was WOW!  They heated up quickly and got hot enough to set my hair quickly with curls that lasted for the duration of the wedding (a not very common occurrence for my hair!)I was so pleased that I ordered a second set so that I can use one for travel and combined the 2 to replace the large \\&quot;home Set\\&quot; I have if I decide to use more than the 5 rollers provided in one set (they are easier to store separeately than the large set).      The only cons are the fact that the travel size is still a bit bulky, though they take up less room then my original travel set and the clips are terrible.  I would suggest they put these rollers in a linear case to cut down on the bulkiness of the design.  As for the clips, I just saved the wire clips from my old sets and use those and would suggest they put both wire and plastic cllips with the product to give the consumer the option of which clips to use like they used to ).  The only other con is that it was shipped UPS and although I got very fast service which was GREAT and the first set was in perfect condition....the second set came in a pretty crushed box with very little protection around the item inside that box...fortunately the set was not damaged.</li>
    <li> I did not like the \\&quot;velvet\\&quot; covering on the roller.  It does not get hot enough to produce any type of curl.  Not very much volume produced either.  Would not suggest or purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have pretty fine long hair but alot of it-little over the shoulder in length.  These give volume and a nice soft wave. Clips hold fine for me but sometimes leave a slight crease mark. Heat up very, very fast. Easy to use.  They would be more perfect if there were 6 of them but I can make do with 5. I still have to use the big curling iron for the small shorter pieces of hair around my face.  They almost give that look that the hairdresser can get using the big velcro rollers and then have you sitting under the hairdryer.....Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Love the size of the rollers.  Just what you need for long hair.  While this is a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; hairsetter, the company should make a set with 10 Rollers (all jumbo size) as I had to purchase 2 sets for everyday use.  The cover is terrible. Pretty much guaranteed, the cover will crack within 6 months of use. I&#x27;m already on my third set and when you call or write -- you dont get any response for replacement or with any solution.  Just have to buy a new one.  I&#x27;m alredy on my third set. Not good!</li>
    <li> I constantly get compliments on my hair when it is curled and these hot rollers take all the credit.  Yes, I agree with the previous reviews that the lid cracks too easily, especially when travelling.  When that happens, I just remove the cracked lid (or what&#x27;s left of it) and wrap plastic wrap around the curlers to keep them in place when travelling.  Of course, it will take your curlers a little bit longer to heat up, but worth it if you don&#x27;t want to buy a new set.      Another obvious point:  wait until the curlers have completely cooled before wrapping them in plastic wrap and remove the plastic wrap when plugging the curlers in.    My only complaint:  I just bought a new set from Amazon and there were no metal clips included.  It only had the plastic claws and I find that they work horribly to secure the curler.  I always end up with a crimp in my hair regardless of where I placed them.  And I cannot find any place on the web that sells jumbo metal clips separately.  Anybody have any suggestions?</li>
    <li> These are great rollers.  The previous reviews were highly accurate.  They heat up fast and work great.  I didn&#x27;t know that it came with the appropriate clips and ordered more, so don&#x27;t order additional ones.  It comes with them.  Overall great product and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had purchased these in the past and could not find them again when mine gave out.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  They were shipped to me promptly and I am once again enjoying them.  Being so small and compact is great.  The only real problem I had was having them not protected enough in suitcase when traveling and having the top crack.  Lesson learned. THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> heats up in less than a minute! is pretty small, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room.  i have super fine hair that lacks body but these curlers work wonders!  i blow dry my curly hair straight then put these rollers in for about 20 mins and voila! body all day.  the 5 rollers are perfect for me, i do one on top, two on side, and two in back.  the clips it comes with to secure the rollers are great also.  this product allows you to quickly get volume, body and a great style that really does last throughout the day!</li>
    <li> I have one that I use every day.  It&#x27;s great for trips for it is small and can be wrapped in clothing while in the suitcase.  Also, there is a toggle on the underside to change voltage while traveling.  I purchased this new one for a gift which will be sent to Germany.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
    <li> I am on my third set, (gave my daughter my old one)  Just wish they came with 6 rollers, but other than that.  Great size, love the flocking, will probably always have a set.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these rollers!! Infact have them in my hair as I write this review. I use them every time I wash my hair. I have baby fine , limp shoulder length hair and I use these rollers to give my hair body and bounce. The rollers do that beautifully and the dual voltage are a bonus for people like me who travel to Europe &amp; Asia often. The only complain I have is about the plastic lid....mine cracked after just a couple of uses but it had no effect on the performance of the rollers (hence the 5 stars). If u want rollers for volume , bounce and body these rollers are a god send!</li>
    <li> I keep my heat down to save on heating bills, but still I couldn&#x27;t believe that it would take about 30 to 45 minutes for these to heat up good enough to put a curl or body in anyone&#x27;s hair. my own hair is not fine or very thick and usually takes a curl. I owned a set before and loved them, but maybe I just got a set that didn&#x27;t work very good.</li>
    <li> The clips don&#x27;t hold the curlers in your hair very well.</li>
    <li> The best travel purchase I have made in a while.  I have frizzy, curly hair and depending on the climate can either be a sweet head of hair or a hot, homeless looking mess.  This helps me tame the frizz on the road and packs well in a carry on bag.  LOVE this.</li>
    <li> These rollers work very well - they heat up instantly and do a great job for me, and five is the perfect number.  My major complaint, however, is that the size and construction of the case sort of defeats the purpose of making these \\&quot;travel\\&quot; rollers.  The case is fairly large and takes up a good amount of space in my luggage.  I subsequently purchased a set with a soft case and would highly recommend that to others.</li>
    <li> These went straight to the trash, not enough rollers, and not hot enough to curl anything  A set made 25 yrs ago worked.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers. I have been using this brand and size for many years. So every time I wear them out I continue getting them again</li>
    <li> This travel roller set was recommended by my sister-in-law. I travelled out of the country last month and brought it with me.  Light weight, jumbo rollers perfect for my hair. Easy to use.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> Item is as expected &amp; shipped promptly. I was mildly confused by the extra space in the front of the actual system but works great.  You do need to allow it to warm up longer than some other systems but it does its job.</li>
    <li> Love these compact rollers for a quick \\&quot;do\\&quot; but I travel alot and the clear top will crack under the rigors of travel.  I have made a corner for it in my suitcase with a strong piece of cardboard around it so nothing can put pressure on the lid.</li>
    <li> These are easily transportable and packable hot rollers! Love the size and they do create volume and smooth my hair to produce a glamorous hair style! They present and perform as described and for me exceeded expectations!</li>
    <li> Gave me gorgeous wavy/bouncy curls in a pretty short time (only about 15 minutes). I chose the large curlers because I wanted the bouncy, flowy hair and not the tighter spiraly curls - this worked for that. However; took a very long time to heat up and gave me split ends so I use it sparingly. Somewhat concerned with the plastic-y smell when it is heating up, as other users have noted.</li>
    <li> The rollers arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I have the larger set of these same rollers and they are perfect for adding volume to your hair.  I have mid-length hair so I get a little bit of curl, but not so much that it looks overdone.  They are cool to the touch with felt on the roller, so it makes putting them in your hair easy.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs a good travel roller, because the size is good for travel.  One suggestion would be to have 6 rollers instead of only 5.</li>
    <li> In terms of basic functionality, there is nothing wrong with these rollers... they heat up quickly and evenly and the clips work fine. It&#x27;s just that with medium-length hair (just past my shoulders) that is slightly dry/damaged, I feel like the larger curl doesn&#x27;t hold for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get big voluminous waves with these guys, but an hour later they&#x27;re pretty much gone, even with hairspray. These rollers are meant primarily for volume and not for curl, but even still, I feel like their effect is mostly lost on my style and length of hair. I had much better luck with my previous hot roller set (which I sadly left behind when I moved across the country), which was a mix of small/med/large curlers by Conair. Those produced much more long-lasting and more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking curls.</li>
    <li> I opted to purchase this after reading the reviews and thinking...well, some people like them.  Wrong choice.    My hair usually curls so tight with my old hot rollers that I thought that these bigger ones would give my hair more body than curl.  Well, after using them twice, I look more like I tried to flat iron my hair and failed.    I&#x27;ve never returned a product before, but think these are going back.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the Conair Instant Heat Travel Hairsetter.  The rollers are the right size for a quick fix up and fit nicely into your suitcase or even at home, on your bathroom vanity.  The set heats up quickly and the rollers give my hair a good wave.  The clips fit nicely snugly on the rollers keeping it tighly in place.</li>
    <li> Heats up well and styles the hair good !</li>
    <li> I bought this set to replace a set of jumbo rollers by BabyBliss.  The case looks identical and the rollers are exactly the same.  However, these rollers take about 10 minutes to fully heat and never really get hot enough.  The plastic clips don&#x27;t hold my hair very well and are too bulky to pack in a suitcase.  If I had it to do over again, I wouldn&#x27;t purcahse these rollers.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of rollers.  Perfect size for travel and small bathroom counter space.  The only downside is having only 5 rollers.  I would love to have 6 in this case.  My hair is very long, layered and naturally straight.  I need large rollers for body and to smooth the ends after blow drying.  This set works great.  Big relaxed curls and body.</li>
    <li> Great set, heats up in 5 mins. I have fine, thin hair. If you have thick hair order two sets</li>
    <li> This did not come with the pins as it was supposed to, now I only have the option of the clips that leave a mark in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair that has layers. These are the perfect rollers/size when I want a little curl/lift</li>
    <li> Great product and affordable.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Heats quickly and is very portable</li>
    <li> PERFECT FOR HOME OR TRAVEL - LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  Heats quickly, fab curls.</li>
    <li> I like the overall size and weight as they talk up less room than my regular rollers in my suitcase.  They are slower to heat up and do not get as hot as my other ones.  Overall I am happy with them.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible if you have long hair.  There is a huge slat in the middle of the curler on the bottom side where the heating unit goes through that snags your hair.  I almost had to cut part of my hair to remove the curler.  I&#x27;ve requested a refund.  The 2 minute heating time is more like 10 minutes, as others have said.  They&#x27;re lukewarm in 2, but useless.  They might work if you have shorter hair, but this is NOT for anyone with more than 4 or 5 inches of hair.</li>
    <li> Great for travel as this product has dual voltage.  I did have to buy extra curlers as five is not enough.  I like that it heats up in two minutes.  I may use these at home when I&#x27;m in a hurry and can&#x27;t wait 15 minutes for my old jumbo rollers to heat up.</li>
    <li> I love this little unit! It heats up very fast and the rollers have a nice texture on them. The clips are great, don&#x27;t leave marks or creases. I put the rollers in briefly and pull them out after a minute so I can use then twice if the back of my hair needs curl as they retain heat. I plan to buy again as gifts for my daughter and friends!</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is so fst and easy and just gives my hair the right amount of smoothness and bounciness.  It heats up extremely fast.  I have below-shoulder length hair, fine but thick.  I can do my entire head with these rollers...one for the top, one on each side, then one for the top back and the last for the bottom back.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair setter for travel, doesn&#x27;t curl your hair, clips wont hold rollers in hair, it&#x27;s big and bulky, and I ended up just leaving it in the hotel room it was so useless.  Dont waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> This is a great travel set - just like my regular set, just a smaller version. The only thing I found odd was that the set came with \\&quot;super clips\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;wire clips.\\&quot; (1) This is a TRAVEL set, why include something larger (instead of smaller) for travel? (2) There is a pocket in the set to hold the wire clips - why not include the wire clips instead? I&#x27;ve already written to Conair to bring this to their attention. I did order the wire clips to put with the set to use for traveling!</li>
    <li> This is the only tool I use to style my hair.  I use it mostly to tame the frizz and flatten the hair (I have a lot of little natural curls). The large rollers create a wave in long hair and take away any flyaway hairs.  Movie star hair!    I like the velvet lining that does not burn hair.    I&#x27;m 40 and have been using these since I was a teenager.  This is also my 3rd set!    Make sure to not overheat the rollers.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair, pretty much the long \\&quot;Rachel\\&quot; (Jennifer Aniston style when she was on friends).  I use these as my sole set of rollers and I travel a lot so I stick them in the bottom shelf of my 26\\&quot; suitcase and I have no problem.  They are at least 6 to 7 years old and they still work great.  The lid did crack a long time ago then eventually broke off completely.  Guess what, they still work fine!  I am looking to buy another set just for home so I can leave the old set in my luggage always.  I have owned dozens of hairsetters before this one and this is my very favorite.       I think they are ideal for someone with longer hair because you NEED the jumbo size.  I just put 3 to 4 rollers on the top of my head and that is all I need.      Buy them!</li>
    <li> The curlers heat up quickly but I was looking for a set that were as large as the ones my hair dresser used.  These aren&#x27;t that large, even though they are larger than my regular set.</li>
    <li> I bought this set basically for travel because it was hard to find jumbo travel rollers.  It would have been nice to have had 6 rollers rather than 5 and it didn&#x27;t come with the metal pins like the bigger sets do (it came with plastic clip-ons).  But, all in all, the Conair jumbo rollers are comfortable and so much better than the hard plastic ones.</li>
    <li> Bought these to augment an existing set of Conair rollers with 4 jumbos (the only size I use), 8 med-lg rollers and unwieldy clips that randomly spring off my head and launch in different directions.     Turns out, these are the same size rollers as the smaller, superfluous ones I already own and the clips, though better-behaved than the originals, leave nasty creases in my hair.  Even worse, the unit was designed without an on/off switch.  The instructions actually say to pull the plug out when you are finished. This seems to contradict conventional thinking that it is risky or perhaps even dangerous to yank a plug out of a socket before turning the appliance off.     Ultimately, I felt compelled to give the  Conair TS7N two stars because it takes up very little space and the rollers heat up quickly.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  The rollers do not get hot enough to firmly set your hair, the clips do not have anywhere to be placed so you must carry them separately and it is not as small a unit as their older product with 5 rollers &amp; clips in a small case.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend these rollers to anyone with long hair.  After attempting to use these rollers for a formal event, I resorted to using a curling iron.</li>
    <li> the curlers really heat up in about 2 minutes maybe less, unplug, set in your hair and the curl sets well and stays all day, great product, i gave all my other electric curlers with 3 different sizes away, this really is all i need</li>
    <li> These rollers are so simple and they&#x27;ve made a huge difference to my hair in just one week.  They get rid of frizz and give my extra long hair that hint of a curl that says I&#x27;ve spent some time on styling that day.  In fact I&#x27;ve spent about five minutes but the difference between using and not using these rollers is huge.  Now my hair looks smooth and has a real line of style that makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers for travel since I already own the Conair rollers of 20.  The five rollers heat up quickly in less than five minutes.  Because there are only five rollers, I will roll half of my hair for five minutes, remove them, heat them up again, and then roll the other half.  Positives:  rollers work, heat up quickly, and are more convenient to travel with than the large 20 rollers!  I do not particularly care for the clips that came wtih them, since they tend to leave &#x27;clip marks&#x27; in my hair.  I prefer the sliver clips that came with the 20 size rollers.  Other than that, great product!</li>
    <li> These rollers are so simple and quick to use.  They give your hair lots of volume and make your hair look like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model.  Perfect amount of wave and the best part is that they heat up in 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> These rollers are terrible.  They do not get hot enough to curl hair</li>
    <li> These curlers are an overall good buy... heat fast, curl well, easy to use.  The two things I don&#x27;t like are: There are not enough curlers... really need just 2-4 more. I have short hair and I still have to break out the iron.  Also, you would think that because it is a travel set there would be some way to put the clips that hold the rollers in with the carrying case or that they would use the pins.  I really didn&#x27;t buy it for travel so this does not affect me as much, but even still it is a pain to store.</li>
    <li> disappointed-- they aren&#x27;t soft as they appear.   They heat almost instantly but don&#x27;t stay in short hair with the clips provided.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and I use the standard Conair hot rollers almost everyday.  I found these rollers to be slower to heat, not as hot as the home set, and too bulky.  I bought these because I feel hot rollers cut down on the time it takes me to do my hair everyday however by the time they got hot and I added two more (5 is not enough for my hair) I found that this took more time than my travel curling iron and yielded less satisfactory results.  Furthermore, they are bulky, the clips are big as well, and I will be much better off skipping these on my next trip.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set of curlers before a recent trip to Italy.  They work perfect!  They were easy to pack and heated up perfectly.  I had read some reviews that the lid cracked easily.  Mine made it to Italy and back I had no problems.  I have to say I am very pleased with these curlers - in fact, since I have been back, I have continued to use these instead of my regular curlers!  Good purchase!</li>
    <li> I love these curlers. I have long thick hair. The larger curler is great. I like having all the same size curlers. I never used the little ones in other sets. These heat up fast and curl great. The velvety covering really helps protect the hair. I like the pins that come with this set. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize the superclips are included, so I bought them as well.</li>
    <li> These just don&#x27;t get hot enough and take up more room in a suitcase than you think.  I have a set of the Conair Ion rollers which heats up quickly and gets REALLY warm...so that each roller doesn&#x27;t need to be in for very long.  I have to plug these in for 15 minutes just to get them warmer than what is normal for THIS set.  Then, they must be left in my hair for five minutes or more.  Plus, in a set of only 5, they need to perform extra well, in case you need more than 5 rollers.  With this set there is NO putting a roller back in the base expecting to get it hot again for another section of hair.  Just way too slow and not hot enough...and my hair takes a curl easily and is not very thick.  This set was a real disappointment and I don&#x27;t use it anymore.    Would love to see Conair or Clairol or SOMEONE create a travel set with whiz-bang heating, and a sleek, in-line design of 6 jumbo rollers, that would fit neatly along the SIDE of a suitcase, instead of being a big ol&#x27; real estate-eating chunk of square  plastic.</li>
    <li> So I bought this thinking it was like the old roller set I had in the 80-90&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not that bad but the holder to keep the roller in place doesn&#x27;t work well. The roller shifts around and the hair falls out of place, thus making me really upset. So if you can figure out a better way to hold the hair in place without falling out, great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice travel size if anything. Another thing, I thought the roller size jumbo, but obviously not as jumbo as I had wanted them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would up putting this set in the back of the closet and bought a huge curling iron, which does a great job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps</li>
    <li> These are great for long hair, but there&#x27;s only 5 rollers.</li>
    <li> Hooray for this product which comes with the plastic comb clips rather than the useless wire clips that are part of the Conair Jumbo/Super Jumbo hot roller set.  These heat up fast and work great.  Still new to using hot rollers but I can say even for someone without experience it is pretty fool-proof and your hair will not be frizzy after.</li>
    <li> This is okay. I thought the curlers would be bigger for a smother look.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite jumbo roller set, I purchased them before and still use the old set but thought I better buy another in case they ended up discontinued and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find them again if my old set died on me. Works perfect for me, I have naturally curly hair and these rollers take out the unruliness and give me long lasting body. If you have really straight hair, the body will just go flat after a short time but for me love it.</li>
    <li> Even if they right set - what&#x27;s with the clips? Huge plastic clips and no place to store them. Am I supposed to remember where I store them and keep them separate from the rollers. Really dumb idea. And I agree, they do crimp your hair. Anyway, the rollers are too big for the length of my hair and I also had trouble keeping them in. Fine, soft hair and even with the flocking, they were sliding off my head. Next....</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. In fact, I&#x27;m on my third set. If you close the lid they do get very very hot, and they don&#x27;t take up much room on the bathroom counter. My only complaint is that they take up a huge amount of room in a suitcase. And, the plastic lid cracks. In fact, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m on my third set. After about a year of business trips, the lid will be cracked beyond use. So, I&#x27;m going to buy another set of these for the bathroom counter, and try another brand for the road.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair extensions and these delivered! This is a travel size set and I love that it doesnt take up the whole counter. The clips did not leave indentions. I recommend this set, its great!</li>
    <li> These curlers work great for me! I use them mostly to \\&quot;calm\\&quot; my hair.  I have a mixture of textures of hair--a little straight, a little curly, a little wavy and I live in Florida so you can imagine the crazy look I get when I hit the humdity, lol! Despite the mixture my hair is it is pretty fine and soft and about 4 inches past my shoulder. The curlers leave my hair smooth and shiny and with big bouncy curls on the ends.  Because my hair is so fine, five curlers are exactly the right amount for me.  BTW, when I first tried the curlers, I was not impressed my hair didn&#x27;t hold the curl but then through trial and error I found the right combination for my hair. I don&#x27;t know if the same would work for any of you who are having trouble holding the curl but for me: I let the curlers heat about 10 minutes.  I MIST my hair with plain water right before applying the curlers (and also sometimes a VERY light shine spray if its very dry). I leave the curlers in AT LEAST 10 to 15 minutes before removing them.  Anyway, again works great for me! Hope it does for you!</li>
    <li> I have the full size version of these rollers, and I can tell you - they are FAR superior to these travel curlers.  The box advertises instant heat, but in reality my curlers take about 5 - 10 minutes to heat up fully.  (I have pretty thick hair, so this means I have to put all five curlers in my hair 2 times, thus having as much as 20 minutes heat up time to do my whole head!) Even at full heat, these curlers don&#x27;t make the cut.  They are barely warm (especially compared to my full size ones) so they barely curl my hair.  After about 30 minutes, all curl is gone completely.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective set, but these definitely weren&#x27;t worth the money or the space savings.  I should have tried them before I left for my trip, becaue they don&#x27;t work at all on my hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read or see in the photo that clips came with the rollers, so ordered the pop-up suggestion.  Now I have lots of clips! No surprise that the rollers work better than the 10-year old Conairs I replaced.</li>
    <li> Love these curlers.  Five is all I need and it travels so well.  Warms up fast too!  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The curlers heat well and work fine, but the design of the unit could be MUCH better.  First, they sent huge hinged clips for the curlers, rather than the small metal U-clips. The unit has a little \\&quot;well\\&quot; or pocket to store the U-clips, but no such clips are provided. The big clips are very bulky for travel, and there is no pouch, pocket, or container to store them in.  Second, the unit has a pedestal, which creates another 30 cubic inches of wasted space when packing. I&#x27;d rather have just the compact heating base without the pedestal design.  Third, the unit is brittle plastic that is not shock-resistant and will crack easily. I could imagine a much better casing designed for travel.  Last, there is no on/off switch so you have unplug and replug the unit with each use, which is a pain.</li>
    <li> These hot rollers are very good. I just thought initially that 5 rollers would do the trick. Unfortunately when your hair is down your back AND thick, you are going to need more than 5 hot rollers. I&#x27;ll likely just be ordering another set of the exact same kind, though!</li>
    <li> Now my wife doesn&#x27;t have to lug the bigger set around.</li>
    <li> These rollers do a great job, they do heat up very quickly, but I was looking for GIANT rollers.  I would still recommend them.  They&#x27;re the best rollers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Work great!! Would recommend buying two though if you have long or thick hair. Curls come out great!</li>
    <li> They are ok, but I probably should have gotten a set with a few more rollers.  But if you only need five, this set is fine.</li>
    <li> Very happy with Rollers.  Quick heating - just wish they would have included the wire fasteners rather than the clips (that tend to leave marks in my hair).</li>
    <li> Heats quickly. Nice curls.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the Fifth star is because I have lots of long hair and could use a couple more rollers. I know this is a travel set, but just thinking that 2 more could fit into a rectangular case and still be travel-sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers heat up really quickly and they give such a nice, natural, &amp;#34;celebrity hair&amp;#34; curl. I had problems in the past with Revlon curlers that made my hair look so weird and old-fashioned. These work for as long as you want to leave them in, you just flip your hair and spray and the volume stays in...very interesting how well they work and stay! Love &#x27;em. (They are even perfect for when I have barely any time to finish getting ready for work or going to dinner, etc. I just throw them in while doing make-up and BAM, kind of excited, and have only used them twice).</li>
    <li> These curlers heat well (hot enough) and have a soft lining that keeps the hair smooth. I have had several Conair curler sets in the past and they tend to last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this set comes with plastic claw clips instead of the metal curved bands. These clips leave marks/ bent areas on my hair, even when I am careful about how I place them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set does have a switch to change the voltage for traveling.</li>
    <li> Now that we have to cram into one suitcase, i got these strictly for travel. I haven&#x27;t yet had the other problems people say. I just love the size of the rollers. Thanks to the reviewer who said converter- I assume in europe that a converter would have to be used on everything and I will be sure to bring one.I have been stuffing the big set into my suitcase, but this one will fit much better and hopefully not looks so suspicious on an xray scanner.</li>
    <li> Very quick to heat and its great, wish it had 6 rollers.  But as I used one I added another one I had from another set and it heat quickly. So that resolved not having 6 in the unit. Good product for traveling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice little set for the price.  I sent for the wire clips because the &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; clips don&#x27;t hold the roller&lt;br /&gt;very well.  It says it&#x27;s a travel size, but it takes up twice the room that my old &amp;#34;swingsetter&amp;#34; did, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d bother bringing it in a suitcase.  It&#x27;s ok and does the job pretty well, otherwise.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews on these wonderful little rollers.  This is my 4th set of these rollers.  They are compact for enough for travel and I&#x27;ve been using them daily for 10 years now.  I know the reviews say that the lid and hinge break--they do!  But the great thing about these rollers is they still work just as well without the lid--in fact--they pack easier in your suitcase without the lid.  I can&#x27;t achieve the big \\&quot;full-volume\\&quot; hair look with a blowdryer and a round brush so these things are great to just pop in for a few moments and achieve that look without standing with a hairdryer.  I love them!</li>
    <li> These are perrrrfect! LOVE THEM, they get hot really fast and are light good for travel or home use. Definitly recommend</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for traveling. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the plastic clips.. I would much rather have metal clips.</li>
    <li> This is terrible. I didn&#x27;t like the out come at all. It does not heat up enough. Noting special. The roller is only 5 so i ordered more 5 roller. But the problem is it&#x27;s not good result.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price! I&#x27;ll recomend it to all my friends! Im very happy that I found it! It saves so much time to get ready!</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and works exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> This compact curl set can add lots of volume to any length hair, but I think you&#x27;ll have better results with medium to long hair.</li>
    <li> Did not really like this hair product.  It seemed to heat up too hot then cooled down too quickly....the rollers were not easy to handle...burned fingers.</li>
    <li> Love them. Gives soft, big curls that last.</li>
    <li> These rollers are definitely a good choice if you are looking for large, consistent waves. They heat up quickly and are relatively comfortable. I also have a larger set of 1-1/2-inch rollers, because this set is not enough to do all of my hair. If you have thick, long hair you might want to consider purchasing a set with more rollers, but for travel and touch ups, this set is perfect.</li>
    <li> Rollers are big and add volume to hair.  Work great but do not seem to get as hot as my older set from same manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have bought many of these over the years. The rollers work well but the cover continues to crack with each one I have purchased. They need to come up with a stronger cover as I am tired of having to replace after such a short time.</li>
    <li> These are great for traveling, however they didn&#x27;t curl my hair as much as I&#x27;d hoped. This is likely just because of my hair and not the product! I did buy the clips to go with them, and that was a big help. It heats up really quickly and is easy to take with you on a trip.</li>
    <li> This are the best large hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever bought. They heat up super fast. I work 2 jobs, so I have to change from jeans &amp; t-shirts to professional clothes in 15 minutes. These curlers allow me to freshen up my hair style in nothing flat. LOVE them!</li>
    <li> I like these curlers very much.  Haven&#x27;t used hot curlers for 20 years but now I&#x27;m wondering why I gave them up.  So much easier on my arms (and tight schedule) than a curling iron.  You don&#x27;t need any extra super clips since this package comes with 5.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot but wish there were an even number of curlers. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to have 5. But overall, they are great, heat up fast and good for on the go. Th clips also reduce dents in the hair.</li>
    <li> heat quickly, work well.</li>
    <li> I love the effect I get from the jumbo rollers.  My hair is shiny and bouncy and looks very healthy and nice. BUT, the super clips that you use to hold the rollers in place leave ridges on the hair.  I don&#x27;t know how these would work with the old style wire pins because the rollers are large and because there are only 5 of them, you have a large clump of hair on each one so they can be heavy.  So even though I love the body that the rollers give my hair, I have to take out my flat iron and straighten the hair that is left with ridges.  One additional roller would also have been handy.</li>
    <li> Okay, maybe I can use the 5 rollers when I travel, but I really wanted to get 4 Jumbo rollers to replace the extra jumbo (too large!)rollers in my other set that has 12.  (Now I have an extra one and heat it up too!)  This was the cheapest way to do it.  Conair hot rollers are as good and maybe a little better/faster/reliable than all those really expensive sets out there.  I have gone back to using hot rollers as these velvet covered rollers seem to protect my hair a lot better than the fancy curling irons.  And, I can do something else while they sit in my hair and they are a lot faster than a curling iron... (Of course, I grew up rolling my hair every night/day with about every kind of roller made... but these sure make my very long hair look really good... and that came from a professional stylist who commented on my \\&quot;do\\&quot; and the great condition of my hair... so, yes, I really like these Conair hot rollers! :)</li>
    <li> These are the best hot rollers I have ever had.  They heat up fast and smooth out the waves and frizzies.  I like how they&#x27;re so big, they don&#x27;t make my hair too curly, just smoooooth.</li>
    <li> this is the latest version of a product i have used for years. travel curlers used to be more compact, lined up in a row. that changed into a much bulkier oval case i suspect to accommodate flocked rollers that are heated more safely and MUCH less likly to burn. the rollers are also slightly smaller and big clips are used which can not be carried in the roller case,a hassle for storage and travel. i&#x27;ve saved the old roller pins to use instead and i think they can be ordered separately. this is a good product, heats fast and the flocked rollers are safe for your fingers and easier on your hair.</li>
    <li> stopped working after two uses in less than a week.  it wasn&#x27;t dropped or mishandled.  3rd time i was going to use it, i plugged it in and turned the switch to on; never came back on.</li>
    <li> I like the rollers, (they heat up pretty quickly, the clips hold them in, and they are big enough to give volume but still some curl) but 5 is not enough for thick hair or long hair. My hair is a few inches past my shoulders, thick and curly. When I take the time to blow it dry, I like it to last for a couple of days so on the second day I put these in to create some volume and style. They work well but I have to do half of my head at a time because if you take too big of a section you won&#x27;t get the volume because no heat reaches the roots. But the price is right so I guess i could just buy another set!</li>
    <li> I got these for my mother who has fine, straight and semi-short hair....and they are ok, but not the best. The rollers are covered in a felt like material, and if your hair is fine it tends to slip off the roller...be prepared to roll it a couple of times before you get it right. The clips are good though, not as hard to place/use as the metal pin thing these curlers usually have. These heat up quickly and are convenient (although five rollers seems too few, but it is for travel right?), but not for precise styling.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had electric rollers for 30 years. I have very thick chin length hair that weights itself down. I wanted these to add some body and they do. Very happy with them but wish I could find a larger set with all big rollers. It takes me 3 turns to do all of my hair but after the first day I only do the top to add a little body.</li>
    <li> Other than it does not travel well because the plastic cover breaks in your suitcase, these rollers are the best. I have been using them for 5 years. They get super hot and give a full curl, giving hair volume without being too curly.</li>
    <li> I recommend for sure this product because it works properly and I&#x27;m really satisfied. It is of high-quality, I couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a second set of these curlers and am so happy to have finally found them.  They used to be named Big Curls and now apparently that name belongs to Conair&#x27;s big curling iron.  These curlers are terrific even for my thick hair.  I throw them in and in a couple of minutes my hair has a curl that lasts all day.  A few minutes is all it takes. The case is small so it is not too obnoxious sitting on the counter.  Quick &amp;amp; Easy.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years....as they wear out, I just keep replacing it.  The unit continues to work, but the felt on the curlers tends to wear off which makes it difficult to hold the curlers as they are HOT!</li>
    <li> Great for long hair is this compact, small for travel instant hair setter.  It is hard plastic and comes with five large rollers for smooth soft curls.  I love that it is small and packs easily in my luggage. It heats hot in two minutes but keep the lid closed for a better heat.&lt;br /&gt;I slightly dampen with my fingers each section of hair for a longer lasting curl, One curler for my top, one on each side of my head and two curlers for my back hair .Wish it had just one more curler, but I even use this one at home instead of my larger set.  It is quicker and gets the job done just as well.  I give it five stars, by far my favorite hot curler set..</li>
    <li> I have had these rollers before and wore them out after several years, so I needed a new set - they are the best for traveling as well.  Shipping was quick too.</li>
    <li> I have not found a roller set that has worked on my thick, fine hair since I was 15 years old.  I am 41 years old and have spent so much money on products that did not work.  I love this product.  It curls my hair and it is so compact. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Heats up nicely and easy to use!!</li>
    <li> Purchased theses rollers and used them a few times. Pros are they heat up fast. Cons are they are very heavy and fall out if hair. The clips leave indent on hair and it is hard to get this out. I prefer to use the round brush and a large barrel curling iron.</li>
    <li> This worked well in the U.S. on the 120 setting, but when I took it to Kenya and switched it to the 240 setting, it wouldn&#x27;t heat. I had to switch it back to the 120 setting and plug it into a converter.    I didn&#x27;t like that it comes with big plastic hinged clips instead of the thin, curved metal pins like most hot rollers. That fat bag of plastic clips takes up almost as much room as the rollers. For something that&#x27;s supposed to be for travel, that&#x27;s a bad feature.    Bottom line, I&#x27;ll keep it and use it for travel in the U.S., but won&#x27;t take it overseas again.</li>
    <li> last set, didn&#x27;t guit still works but wore the rollers out after 15 years. Hope this set last just as long. Great product, use them everyday. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> these rollers repaced my 10+ year old ones, which were still working, just took a long time to heat up. these heat up in 2 minutes or less. they&#x27;re great. work well. no curler pins included, so used my old ones.</li>
    <li> perfect size for travelling, heats up fast and has big clips- I wish it had the smaller metal clips that you can fit in the little tray- I used my old ones and the clips this comes with don&#x27;t have a place to store them. Otherwise I wish it had an on/off switch also.</li>
    <li> The clips that came with this set  do not fit in the slot provided.  They have to be packed separately if you want to travel with them.  You can order clips that fit in the slot provided for an extra charge, but the top will not close all the way because those clips are too tall. The set heats up very fast and if you have thin hair, be careful, you will burn your scalp if you let them get too hot.  The rollers do provide good volume for my fine limp hair.</li>
    <li> The description of these rollers was right on...I do love them!!!</li>
    <li> I have just retured from a cruise and this set is great!  My hair never looked better. Usually I have trouble with my hair on these trips but these rollers did the trick.</li>
    <li> Why they suck:    -they barely got lukewarm, and after leaving in my hair for half an hour there was NO curl (and my hair curls easily)    -it&#x27;s a travel set, but the clips that come with it don&#x27;t fit in the travel case, and don&#x27;t come with any kind of carry bag -- how is that fit for travel?  That&#x27;s okay though, because I&#x27;ll never use them anyway.    (would have given it zero stars but was forced to give at least one)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  It is exactly as advertised and works great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another one for a gift.</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking they were Jumbo big ones in order to dry my hair using less blower and hair iron cz I like my hair straight or with, at least, long loose waves,but this are pretty regular size ones, nothing &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; about these ,so you will end with those ordinary regular waves...</li>
    <li> I have long, thick Asian hair, pretty straight, impossible to tie in a knot. I&#x27;ve been using a curling iron for the past few years for the occasional curls, but it&#x27;ll always leave the top of my hair flat and the bottom curly (in a tight way). I wanted a more even distribution of big, soft waves that add volume throughout. Saw a YouTube video and decided to give these heat rollers a try. I gave it 20 minutes to heat up the first time, probably more than needed. Though it was my first time, it only took a couple minutes to pin up all 5 rollers. I left it in for 15 minutes, and when I took them out, I cannot believe the results — exactly what I wanted. It lasted a few hours (without a decent hair spray the first time), and even at the end of the day it looked soft and full of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it doesn&#x27;t always look perfect 100% of the time, I think it&#x27;ll just get better with practice. Great purchase, and good bye to hair damaging curling irons.</li>
    <li> Great rollers!  Love them!</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  Hair will hold wave for a short period of time, but doesn&#x27;t really curl hair beyond the ends.</li>
    <li> Great product, however the plastic lids keep breaking. A better plastic for the top would make this product perfect. Tom</li>
    <li> Great price and work well with my thick hair.  They heat up very fast so I can do 5 curlers and reheat and do 5 more curlers.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt take long to roll my entire head of hair. Compact and easy to store.</li>
    <li> I like these rollers quite a bit, although it seems that the set should consist of 6 rollers rather than five, as most women would use two for the top of the head and two on each side.  Perhaps this is to get you to buy a second set, which is actually not a bad idea.  When I read the instructions to set them up, I thought the red light that comes on when the unit is plugged in should turn white, which it didn&#x27;t of course.  There is a red dot on the roller which turns white when hot.  Admittedly, I&#x27;m not great with instructions, but it could have simply said:  When the red dot on the ROLLER turns white the rollers are ready. What the instructions say is \\&quot;when the red ready dots turns white\\&quot;.  The red dot turns white pretty fast, but the rollers are definitely not hot enough to use, so you have to wait5 minutes more before they are hot enough.  That being said, they work great, producing soft, shiny curls.</li>
    <li> My wife loved them.  She had a set and lost the clips.  This was great now she can curl more of her hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> works well except the clips do not hold very well</li>
    <li> I have an old version that I used for 10 years, went to China with it and was short fuzed due to the different voltage.  So happy the new one comes with dual voltage.  Got a lot of compliments about my hair all the time, from strangers too. Just love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to use on a recent trip to China because of its size and the dual voltage....it performed wonderfully and I find myself using it quite often now that I am home.  The only reason for the 4 star rating is the fact that the clips cannot be stored in with rollers and are somewhat fragile.....You would think that the designer of a travel hairsetter would have thought of this!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this hairsetter because I actually wore the first one out! I also have the full sized model. It heats up quickly and makes either a smooth finish if you leave them in for just a brief minute or two, or if you leave them in until they cool they make a lovely curl to my thick, long and wirey hair. I&#x27;ve tried lots of hairsetter models over the years and this one is definitely the best. It has the largest rollers of all the setters and never tangles your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my upcoming cruise.  I&#x27;ve tried them out several times already, and they heat up fast and provide a nice, smooth curl.  They are lightweight, and fit great in my suitcase.  After researching several other brands I felt these appeared to be the safest enclosed unit, and had the large curler I was looking for.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Rollers don&#x27;t get hot enough so curls don&#x27;t last.  Clips that come with product aren&#x27;t easy to travel with, big, bulky and feel like they would break easily.  Product should include smaller clips instead.  Ones that you can stow inside the unit.  Only good thing is rollers heat up fast.</li>
    <li> Works well, heats up fast, and the flocking helps the curlers to stay in your hair.</li>
    <li> Five rollers isn&#x27;t enough for me and I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair. Two more rollers would have been perfect. Also the clips that come with this left weird marks in my hair. I plan to order some of the wire u-shaped curler holders since these don&#x27;t work very well. The rollers heat up really fast which is nice since I had to put a few back in to reheat and use again.</li>
    <li> This does the job and is certainly compact enough to pack. My only complaint is that like most other sets, the rollers are not large enough. I can&#x27;t find any that are. Why doesn&#x27;t a manufacturer make a hot curler with real Jumbo curlers that slightly curl for us girls that have more curl than we want.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful compact hair volumizer! I take it everywhere! Heats up very fast. I wish it had metal clips, but still very good.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 sets of these curlers because its hard to find curlers this size. Neither one of them got hot enough to use in my hair. Would not order these, would not suggest anyone orders them because of the heating problem. Size of curlers are just right. I even ordered the metal clips to use from Conair, wont be using those when they arrive. The set comes with those claw like clips which leaves a mark in your hair if you do happen to have one curler that heats up.</li>
    <li> Use these everyday they don&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space. Take the frizz out and leave a nice wave. Great for busy mornings. Received so many compliments a co-worker went out and bought the same set and she loves them too!</li>
    <li> This works well for my annoyingly straight, long hair.  Adds body without wacky curls.  Heats up in 5 minutes, rollers get extremely hot if you let it heat longer.  The velvet on the rollers makes it easy to smooth a section of hair around this big JUMBO rollers. The hair clips that secure them are much easier to use then the pin like things that come with other sets.</li>
    <li> these are great.did not burn fingers and curled my hair the way i wanted it..i am happy with these rollers.</li>
    <li> These heat very quickly!  They are so nice and hot I can barely roll them fast enough!  I only leave them in for a few minutes and my hair turns out perfect every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second set of these rollers.  I bought my first set in 1997 or 1998.</li>
    <li> Just the thing for travel: comfortable, relatively small, reliable. Replaces one of those older types with a ceramic/plastic roller and metal wire clips (which I hate).</li>
    <li> I have another Conair that I use at home. I liked it so much I decided to buy one so I can use it when I travel. I don&#x27;t like it as much as my other one. It takes too long to heat up. I have to plug it before I take shower so it will be ready by the time I get out of shower. Other than that, it works fine. If heat up time is important to you, I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought these were jumbo rollers but are actually medium size. Would not recommend them unless you want tighter curls.</li>
    <li> These were a major disappointment. First of all, they barely heated after 15 minutes. I would have felt comfortable letting my 2 year old grandson carry them around after heating because they were just barely warm. Secondly, five rollers is not going to roll your whole head of hair unless you have extremely thin hair. So, for me, I had to roll 1/3 of my head (yes, I have lots of thick shoulder-length hair), wait to roll the next third, and wait again to roll the final third. The result of all this was a very limp, ever so slightly turned up curl which promptly fell flat in about 15 minutes even with hair spray. I saw right away that this was not going to work for me, so I returned it immediately. On the plus side, I will say that even though it didn&#x27;t curl my thick frizzy hair, it did straighten it nicely and get rid of the frizz which is great if  you wanted straightened hair. I did not.</li>
    <li> Does not get as hot as desired, but I guess you get what you pay for with these.  As far as curling, I would stick to a regular curling iron over using these.</li>
    <li> My criteria for hair rollers was that it would be easy to transport and not take up too much room in my luggage and also be easy to use.  I debated much higher end rollers to minimize any damage to my hair, but after reading the reviews for teh TS7NR, decided to go for it and am happy that I did, for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and was concerned that the 5 rollers would not be enough for all of my hair, it works just fine, I usually use two on the lower section of my hair, and the three for the top section.  I&#x27;m not super impressed with the hair clips but my solution is to use a shower cap like hair thing that helps contain the rollers as sometimes the rollers get floppy.  They stay in the hair but I just feel like a huge weight hanging onto the root, so a shower cap in essence helps contain this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Quick to heat up&lt;br /&gt;Small, easy to transport&lt;br /&gt;5 rollers really are enough even for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Hair clips made of brittle plastic, I hope these hold up</li>
    <li> The hairsetter heats very fast and curls stay for hours. The duo voltage will be good for traveling to Europe and Asia. It&#x27;s better than blow dryer to me because it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair and requires much less effort.</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t get hot enough.  It just added a little bit of volume and very little curl.</li>
    <li> I do love these rollers.... so easy to use!  They heat up quickly as promised.  With longer hair though, should order a larger set.</li>
    <li> They heat up fast and are a convenient size.  The suede-like texture of the rollers grab hair so they don&#x27;t slip.  I really like this set.</li>
    <li> I recently went on a week long business trip and purchased the product just prior to leaving. With the new airline restrictions on weight, I was unable to take my regular hairsetter. The Conair TS7N more that fit the bill for my needs. It&#x27;s lightweight, compact, and heats quickly for those early morning meetings. In business, it&#x27;s important to look good and feel good as well. This product is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time. Between business trips, I plan to use the Conair in my recreational vehicle. It&#x27;s become a permanent part of my travel. [[ASIN:B000NUCQFY Conair TS7N Jumbo Rollers Instant Heat Travel Hairsetter]]</li>
    <li> If you want to add volume not curl this compact set is perfect. The rollers are large and for my medium length hair, it&#x27;s adds some easy volume and wave. It&#x27;s compact enough to travel with, but the clips are too fragile and bulky to pack. I took some metal clips from an old Clairol hot roller set and put them in the little slot in the front for travel. The unit won&#x27;t hold up for constant packing, since it has a hard plastic top. But for occasional travelers like me, it is great.</li>
    <li> Nice size for travel.</li>
    <li> super easy to use, get nice and hot but the curlers have cover-y things that keep me from burning my hands.  It&#x27;s pretty small so it didn&#x27;t take up a lot of space when i packed it in a carry on last week.  They give nice curl or good volume depending on what you are looking for.  The only thing I wish is that there was an on/off switch instead of it just turning on when plugged in.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. For one, it fried my hair- maybe I let them heat up too long or kept them in too long? Second, it left my hair looking crimped at the top so I had to go over it with a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;It does add volume though which lasts for a few hours.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t get very hot, therefore they don&#x27;t really curl hair.  They do curl the very ends - temporarily - but the curl does not last.</li>
    <li> A little lift at the hairline is all I need for a polished look on the go, and these five jumbo instant heat rollers do the trick! They are the perfect size to pack for a cruise vacation, where sightseeing along the Caribbean or Mediterranean whips my naturally curly hair into a frenzy! Sometimes that look works. But, more often I enjoy a straighter look on top with more bounce using these jumbo Conair rollers. Five tames my hair enough to match the chic, sophisticated ambience of dining aboard my favorite cruise line.</li>
    <li> Heats rapidly, gets really hot, and the perfect size roller for just the right amount of body and style.  I have two sets and heat them simultaneously for ease and speed at  home and use one for travel . Perfect compact size and dual charge for international travel- these are fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Clips get caught in slots when putting them on and don&#x27;t hold great. It heated up quickly.</li>
    <li> They are smooth and don&#x27;t grab the hair or stay in place.  Don&#x27;t like them at all. Gave them to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> Compact and efficient.  I already have one but wanted another to travel with.  Just enough to meet my needs that gives me the right amount of curl for my long hair.</li>
    <li> They heat up fast and create great curl and body...I have a lot of hair so I am wishing that I had bought the full set.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed and should have returned. I have shoulder length hair fine thin hair and there are still not nearly enough rollers. Never even heated enough to put the slightest wave to my hair. Perhaps I just rec a faulty one. Either way, it was a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This is the third and now final set of hot rollers I&#x27;ve tried, and this one is the best by far. I get nice full curls that I can then brush out into soft waves or full volume straightness. And I&#x27;ve never complimented a product on its design and functionality before, but every day I&#x27;m impressed that the places I instinctually grab (on the curlers and the heating unit) are always cool to the touch and easy to handle. A+!</li>
    <li> Gives my hair lots of body</li>
    <li> Nice to have a travel size set of curlers.  Wish there were 6 in here, though.</li>
    <li> I have used it once and didn&#x27;t like it. Now its just sitting there in my closet. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this purchase, have taken on several overseas trips already.  would have preferred to have the metal pins to secure rollers rather than plastic clips but luckily I had some from previous set which I find are much more secure than the plastic clips</li>
    <li> Just as good as the bigger set but I wish it had 3 more rollers! lol  I would buy it again and it worked well on my trip to Russia.</li>
    <li> I need huge rollers for this hair!</li>
    <li> This works great, wish it had some more rollers for my large amount of hair.  They heat up fast and it a good way to get your hair ready while your getting ready.</li>
    <li> Great find. I needed something small for my trip and I bought two of them. They are really bulky. Not sure how they will hold up in my travel. I also bought other ones but the rollers are too small..</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT AND EASY TO TRAVEL WITH</li>
    <li> I only need five rollers and they must be large.  This is the set.  This is actually my second set.  The first one was purchased in a store years ago and the felt had rubbed off so it was time for a new set.  My go to rollers.</li>
    <li> I tried my daughter&#x27;s rollers and loved what they did to my fine, thin hair.  It takes about 5 minutes to turn my limp locks into a voluminous head of hair!  And the styling stays - does not drop when I walk out the door.  Have received many compliments on my new look!</li>
    <li> These rollers are small &amp; convenient but can only be held by the clips that come in a separate bag</li>
    <li> This is truly an awesome gem for people who don&#x27;t have time to waste on putting rollers in at night or spending 30 - 60 minutes under the dryer with rollers in their hair.. I only wished you could buy one with 7 rollers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for traveling . Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and roller size was just right for me</li>
    <li> The rollers are smaller than the large rollers in the mixed set but larger than the small rollers in the mixed set.  Like some of the other customers, I wish it had pins rather than the new-fangled plastic things to hold the rollers in place. However, I expect I can get the pins at a beauty supply store.  Unlike the mixed set, this set does not have an on and off switch and automatically goes on when you plug it in.  The rollers heat up more slowly than in the mixed set - not sure why.  It is a little annoying to have to wait for them to heat up since the larger mixed set rollers heat up so quickly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet and I already hate them; they came with plastic clips instead of wire clips and someone in the answers sections said they came with wire clips.</li>
    <li> These are perfect, they heat up very fast, have the large rollers only, and they are easy to take on a trip.</li>
    <li> These things barely got hot. I have medium thickness hair, if not on the finer side, ...below shoulder length, these did not heat up , the wave lasted about an hour. No on off switch. I realize cheap in price, but I&#x27;d rather spend a bit more to get more quality curls.</li>
    <li> Love the compact size of these rollers and they made my hair look beautiful, without frying it like other hairsetters do. Can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> They are decent.  Thought they would be a little larger.</li>
    <li> The curlers heat in good time and the size is good for my hair, however, the plastic clips provided leave a crease in my hair that looks odd.  There is a small space on the unit for the old fashioned metal clips but none are provided.  I knew this when I bought but it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me! I will buy a more full size for home use with extra curlers that I need, but this one is sufficient for travel.</li>
    <li> I love this set of rollers. This is my 2nd set. I have had my original set for nearly 10 years and they still work great. I just needed a additional set for traveling.</li>
    <li> I used to own a newer version of these curlers, and those were fantastic.  When mine broke, I bought these.  What a mistake!  These do NOT get hot no matter how long you leave them plugged, and they still come with the terrible clips instead of normal metal holders.  The clips leave marks on your hair, hold the curlers poorly, and were replaced by Conair in later models of this product.  Do NOT buy these!  Oh, and they&#x27;re also terrible for travel.  The size is good for a sink, not a suitcase.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find travel curlers I really like and these are the same. The bulky design takes up way too much space for travel curlers and I have to clip the claw clips to a tube and they still broke.  I do not like the claw clips as they leave lumps in my hair no matter which way I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just used them on a recent trip and spent way too much time trying to fix my hair. Done with these.</li>
    <li> I like this set of rollers.  They heat up pretty quickly and have that soft, spongy surround so your hair does not get caught in them.  I do wish they had pins rather than the clips to keep them on.  The clips can cause a crease in your hair that you may not want.</li>
    <li> If you have alot of hair or super long hair this is not the way to go. My hair is not even that thick and I still need 2 sets. I know it sucks when you want a bargain but just spend the money on some decent curlers.</li>
    <li> Great rollers. Heat up really fast.  This is my second set. I keep one at my parents&#x27; house out of state so I&#x27;ll have them there :) The clips that come with it don&#x27;t hold for me, but I knew that when I purchased it. I use the metal clips/pins from my old hot rollers. These are great!</li>
    <li> This works great for traveling.  I only wish it had 6 rollers.  Heats quickly and works well for my fine longer hair.</li>
    <li> Tips: If you dislike the white clips that come with this like I do (they make weird dents and don&#x27;t support the hair well) then I recommend buying claw clips from your local dollar store. I get mine for 2 for $1 at Dollar Tree and they support the hair much better, don&#x27;t make weird dents in the hair and insulate the curl from the outside. Also, use a shower cap after you&#x27;ve rolled your hair to help support the rollers&#x27; weight and insulate the curls even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a picture of the claw clips I use instead of the white clips the rollers come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had become too lazy to fix my hair everyday but really missed the body and smoothness that heat styling would provide. I have waist-length hair with medium thickness and was surprised that I can roll all of my hair with these rollers. It literally takes me 5 minutes to roll my hair and I get to have Victoria Secret hair and then Kate Middleton-esque hair by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;1) Heat rollers for about 5 minutes (anything more will burn my hair and fingers).&lt;br /&gt;2) Roll and clip dry hair (I do three on top of my head through the center and then one on each side).&lt;br /&gt;3) Put a shower cap on top of the rollers. This helps keep them out of your face so you can get ready.&lt;br /&gt;4) Leave on until the rollers are cool. I leave them on for about 20 minutes, but 30 are ideal for me. I don&#x27;t use hairspray though, so if you do, you will probably only need them in for about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;5) Remove rollers and don&#x27;t touch them for a few minutes. After, gently scrunch the roots and fluff the ends as little as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can do my whole head in 5 minutes and taking them out takes less than 2. It is so easy I find myself doing it daily (although my hair still has body and curled ends on the second day I prefer to refresh the curls) when I would normally only fix my hair for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this does have many design flaws if you want to use it for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is a small tub for pins to go in, but they only come with these white plastic clips that they gave no bag for and that will take up unnecessary room in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;- The unit has a pedestal that takes up valuable luggage space.&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t think the plastic lid or clips will last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does have a converter on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at Target for around $20. These are great for people who don&#x27;t like to spend time to fix their hair but DO like the results.</li>
    <li> These are MUCH smaller than I had expected. I love hot rollers, but I have a lot of hair and it is really long, so I often have issues finding the right sized rollers. It was packaged nicely and came in one piece, but I feel like they should not be labeled &amp;#34;Jumbo&amp;#34; as it is misleading and I have seen real jumbo rollers that are much larger than this.</li>
    <li> My family travels extensively and I needed a good set of rollers that wouldn&#x27;t take up a ton of room in my suitcase. These work perfectly for that purpose!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Small compact design&lt;br /&gt;*Great clips that hold rollers in place well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough. I let them warm up for 20 minutes just to be sure it got to full heat. I think my hair is fine, medium thickness and is about 5 inches below my shoulders. If my hair were really long or super thick I could see why these wouldn&#x27;t work well but I would expect them to work well on my type of hair. They don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;*No off and on switch. You have to unplug the device to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to return these rollers and I don&#x27;t recommend them mostly because they don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
    <li> The jumbo size is perfect for my hair.  It takes a few minutes to heat up and they are very easy to put in.  I wish I had bought a full set - because I need about three more to do my hair - I just use a curling iron to finish the job.</li>
    <li> I have used these rollers in my bathroom at home almost every single day. It has taken me A LOT of trial and error to find the perfect roller set. I have very long, thick hair that is usually tough to place in rollers. I would say this is the BEST set of rollers that I own....I have four sets of hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also a great value and heat up extremely quickly.</li>
    <li> The heating rollers worked fine, they heated quickly, and the clips held my long hair without any problem.  The issue is - this is NOT travel size - case is way too large and delicate plastic.  There is no storage for the clips.  To call this a Travel Hairsetter is a joke.  If you want to use this for normal everyday home use, should not be a problem.  If you want this for travel (as advertised), forget it.</li>
    <li> i really like these rollers and have a larger set for home use.  purchased these for travel -- i travel for work several times a month and despite a good suitcase, the base, the lid, and most parts of the exterior break, crack, etc.  this product needs a redesign for travel.</li>
    <li> Okay, I am so lovin&#x27; that I bought these. I did my compared shopping on Amazon and saw these had the best reviews. I have NEVER in my 35 years of life, used curlers. I have always had a short hairdo or some kind of bob-do that didn&#x27;t need any kind of curling. Now, I have long layered hair and it usually ends up in a pony-tail. Well, I am tired of the easy pull-back look. Thank goodness a friend suggested rollers/curlers. All I can say is &#x27;WoW&#x27;, these have made my hair-life easy. They are easy and fast, really fast. Once they arrived in the mail, I wanted to try them out, however I am a busy mom, so I decided I would start dinner, then plug the curlers in. While I was cooking, I ran into the bathroom to set my hair and after about 5 minutes of heat-up, I began to roll my hair. The rollers grasp on smooth, the clips are effective. After I clipped each one, I went back to the kitchen to finish making dinner. While at the stove, I set the timer for 10 minutes, to let the curlers set and cool. After the buzzer went off, I went back to take them out. The style and curls were amazing. However, I do need to point out that my hair was styled from earlier in the day, so I did have some product in my hair.  All-in-all, it only took me a few minutes of prep-time. Since I have longer hair, the 5 curlers had to be set on two sections of my hair, at different times. Only takes 2-5 minutes to warm in the warmer and about 2-5 minutes to roll hair, then 10 minutes to sit and cool. During the ten minutes of setting/cooling, you can run around the house and get chores done. EASY!! My only complaint would be, I wish there were 10 curlers, instead of 5.</li>
    <li> This product has great-sized rollers for long hair and average heat-up time (slower than advertised). But what happened to the ability to order extra rollers at Conair? You can order clips or clamps, but no extra rollers.  I have substituted a similar size and style roller from another unit, in order to get the number I need.  Extra rollers take up less room to pack.   I have been using Conair products for 20 years, and as a Flight Attendant, I have had rollers and hair dryers with me on the go.  The base electrical portion of the unit always outlasts the inadequate lids.  I live with the lids until they crack, but they eventually fall off.  Do you get the message Conair? Develop a hard plastic top or use something else.     I am glad to have the dual voltage, now just fix that top and let us order extra rollers.</li>
    <li> I just wish there was one more curler in it but now I just take along a few rollers from my larger set when I travel and put them in as I take out the hot ones.</li>
    <li> They fall out of my hair easily</li>
    <li> It was not as big as I thought other than that, it works great! If you have a lot of hair you might want to buy one that has more than 5.</li>
    <li> My hair is relatively fine but I&#x27;ve got a lot of it, and down to my mid-back.  It is naturally quite straight.&lt;br /&gt;I have to do at least 3 rounds with these curlers (3 or 4 rounds x 5 curlers) of 20 minutes each, in order to have any body around the ends.  &#x3D; over an hour for hot roller style !!!!&lt;br /&gt;The whole reason I got these was because I wanted a quick, easy hairstyle, the reviews were mostly glowing (and I loved that I could travel with them).&lt;br /&gt;That said, they&#x27;re easy to put in.&lt;br /&gt;I think they might work better if your hair was (at the longest) around your shoulder blades.&lt;br /&gt;NOT for long straight hair!</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers to compliment my full Conair set that I use all the time.  I thought these were the big daddy&#x27;s that would give me full wavy volume.  However, these are the same size as my OTHER rollers.  So, now I have several of the same size, and another container to store.  I&#x27;ll keep them, maybe use them when I&#x27;m traveling, but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of these curlers.  I travel for a living and they are perfect size for my luggage.  My last set lasted nearly a year before I cracked the cover beyond repair/use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine hair and these give my hair volume.</li>
    <li> This unit has a built in pin holder, yet no pins are included. There are only clamping clips that crimp your hair. They are awful if you hate having a crimp in the top of your head (which you should)</li>
    <li> These hot rollers are intended to give extra long hair body. They heat up in 5 min. and hold the heat for 15 min., enough time to put your make-up on.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the clips.  The curlers are fine.  Clips don&#x27;t store.</li>
    <li> I wanted just volume, which it does.</li>
    <li> I EXPECTED THEM TO BE LARGER, LIKE 2&amp;#34; AT LEAST.  I HAVE LONG HAIR.  I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY WERE ADVERTIZED AS JUMBO AND WEREN&#x27;T.  YOU SHOULD ADVERTIZE THEM AS 1.5 &amp;#34; IN DIAMETER, NOT&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;JUMBO&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These rollers are 1.5\\&quot; thick and are too large for my thin, straight, long hair. They don&#x27;t curl my hair enough. They do add volume and make my ends curly but I wanted a bit more curl. The deal-breaker is the clips though. They hold the hair well, but the creases look horrible. I end up throwing my hair up into a ponytail just to hide the creases...what is the point of that!? I will be returning these.</li>
    <li> Yes my conair heat rollers are great &amp; something I have used for many years &amp; love them!  Also their compact size makes them great for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old set of rollers because I wanted something that would heat up quickly.  In that respect, it did not disappoint.  I usually let it heat up for about 15 minutes and let the curlers sit in my hair for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and long - it goes down to the middle of my back.  So, this set is barely big enough to curl all of my hair.  It took a bit of practice to figure out how to section out my hair.  I like the full, loose curls it creates!  If your hair is longer or REALLY thick, you will probably want a set with more curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t traveled with this set, so I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the case cracking.  Though, based on past experience, the lids on curlers ALWAYS break eventually.  I think because they are exposed to heat so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An auto-off feature or on/off switch would be a great addition.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  Rollers do not burn your hands.  Bear in mind that these are jumbo rollers so they will give you a little bounce and wave, not tight curls.  Good for shoulder length or longer hair for a natural, yet polished, look.</li>
    <li> This is a great roller set.  They heat up quickly and the clips hold well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally I couldn&#x27;t imagine how 5 rollers would cover my entire head, but this does.  I have long, fine hair (past my bra line) and this is how I wind up doing it:  I use 1 roller for the top section, and then 2 rollers on each side.  I leave them in until they cool down, put on makeup or other stuff, and then a few minutes before I pull the rollers out I spray my head with a light hairspray.  Once I pull them out I flip my hair over and run my fingers through to loosen it up a bit. Spray a bit more hairspray to hold it all in place, and off I go!  The end result is a nice head of loose curls that seem to last me all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you need to watch is there is a slit that runs about halfway up each roller, which is where it sits in the heating section to heat.  I&#x27;ve read reviews where folks had their hair caught in this section.  I found that if you make sure when you roll your hair you stay &#x27;inside&#x27; the edges of the roller (and not let any of your hair travel loose over the edges) you should be fine. I&#x27;ve never caught my hair in there (yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure this would be a set for travel, however, as it may take up quite a bit of room in a suitcase.  I&#x27;ve seen different units where you steam just 1 roller at a time and if I needed a smaller set, that might be a better way to go, but this one works for my everyday set and so far has held up well.</li>
    <li> This will be perfect to take on quick trips and is just the amount of rollers needed for soft curls.</li>
    <li> I was looking for volume, not curls.  I have long, fine hair and it just gave it a weird curl and using the &#x27;claws&#x27; to hold them in made kinks in my hair.  Not in love.</li>
    <li> Nice little set, perfect for travel, I have the larger version as well and have used it for years with no complaints :)</li>
    <li> Not a fan of it. Curls dont stay.</li>
    <li> These curlers are perfect for quickly giving a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; to my shoulder length hair.  The smaller curlers make it too curly and tight.  If you still want a smooth, loose look and aren&#x27;t looking for &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; curls, these are for you!</li>
    <li> These rollers are a good size for producing body for my medium-length, fine hair. They heat up quickly and the curl lasts. However, as many have complained before me, the clips leave a ridge in the hair that either must be un-kinked with another implement (e.g. flatiron), or hidden under top layers. And I find that five curlers is just not enough for a good job. Even with my fine hair, I would like a minimum of seven or eight rollers of this same size. I am going to try these for a while longer and may just get another set to supplement. Also, it would be nice if there were some way to store the clips, which make a rather unwieldy pile. The picture doesn&#x27;t show it, but there is a stand on the bottom which makes a convenient way to wrap and store the cord.</li>
    <li> I bought it and never used it. however It gives a nice volume. But if you are looking for curls or waves, this is not the tool. It just gives a slight wave and if you want that then it&#x27;s a good tool.its good for traveling but i never take it with me when i travel</li>
    <li> love it, but it&#x27;s for girl who doesn&#x27;t have that many hair. I usually need 10+ roller.</li>
    <li> As previous users stated, the clips make ugly lines in your hair and using pins is better, but they do not keep all the straggly pieces on the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, it depends on how much hair you have, but for me with shoulder length, reasonably thin hair the 5 were not quite enough. It is ok. Certainly not as well made as my older Clairol Kindness set.</li>
    <li> Excellent set of rollers for travel - just the right amount and they heat up quickly!</li>
    <li> I bought this travel hair curler set but when it arrived I found that it is much to big to travel with especially when all you have is a carry on. It takes to much room in the suitcase. I decided to use it at home for my morning ritual before I leave for work. The curlers are nice but they never heat up enough to give a nice curl. Tried heating it longer but still the same result. They do have a nice feature though, they&#x27;re a good size for long hair and they have a soft cloth cover over the curlers so it doesn&#x27;t break your hair.</li>
    <li> Good and cheap hair styling product! I tried it today after I blow-dried my hair. It was frizzy and hard to handle at the tips, as always. I looked like a troll. I turned this on and let it warm for a few minutes. I put 2 on each side and one on the crown. After a couple minutes I took them off and voila! Loose, sexy, and effortless Victoria&#x27;s secret curls (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone, unless you&#x27;re looking for a genuine curl.</li>
    <li> I purchased this small set to take when travelling.  It is light weight and just enough to get my hair looking better in the morning or after a long day.  Only thing I was disappointed with was the clips to hold the rollers in place.  They are thin plastic and look as though they would break very easily.  To solve this, I used the clips from my old full set of rollers.  Good solution, but the company should consider better clips.</li>
    <li> I purchased these rollers based on the great reviews that were given.   I had been using a set of Clairol rollers which worked well; however I wanted a set with larger rods.  These seemed to be the perfect set since I travel quite a bit.  Even though I overheat the rollers, they won&#x27;t hold curl the way my other set would.  I have tried leaving the rollers in much longer than I should and I still can&#x27;t get the curls to last.  The clips also leave crimp marks in my hair.  I am back on Amazon searching for an alternative!</li>
    <li> I have used Conair curler for years and this is a great product for traveling.  I have thick hair so it takes more than 5 curlers, so I don&#x27;t recommend this for everyday use, you may need two.  This creates a nice curl in long hair and adds lots of body that last all day!</li>
    <li> I travel with this everywhere because this has dual voltage. Unfortunately, these big rollers only come in a set of 5 rollers. I wish Conair or some other company makes one with at least 10 big rollers. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;But my solution is, when I travel with the TS7NR, I bring along 5 more rollers from my other set (the U.S. voltage set that has 12 rollers). That way, I have 10 rollers and I do my hair in 2 phases.</li>
    <li> I bought these with high hopes to have bouncy waves with volume. However, these did not heat up as much as they should. Other than that, they&#x27;re good but not great. The clips didn&#x27;t leave marks in them like other reviewers said.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, great for travel!</li>
    <li> These did not work in my hair. I have fine strands of curly hair and the felt on these slipped right off. Regardless of the types of clips I used, these just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> The only drawback is there is no automatic shut off, otherwise I&#x27;m very pleased with this.  As soon as I use the last roller, I remove the first one and put it back on the post.  They heat up so fast I don&#x27;t have to wait for them to reheat.</li>
    <li> Work well.  Be careful to change voltage slide over to 240 when in Europe.</li>
    <li> These rollers do the job.  I purchased a very expensive brand  before finding these.  I sent the expensive one back.  It did nothing for my  hair. These rollers give me the perfect curl that lasts all day.  Which is a feat for my dry thinning hair.  They also give my hear a youthful shine.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers. Easy to use and good for travel. Only negative is sometimes there is a ridge in your hair if you don&#x27;t place the clip properly.</li>
    <li> LOVE these rollers. I&#x27;ve been using them for over 30 years and I have to have these in my arsenal.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it and love it.  The size of the rulers are large just for my hair!!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> came in very handy during our travels. easy to pack and will work out well when we pack on motorcycle also.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I have used these only a handful of times since I purchased them and now they do not seem to heat at all.  Will try and contact Conair for a refund.</li>
    <li> After all these years, still my favorite!</li>
    <li> Great product, use it daily.  Compact does not need much space on counter &amp; easy to travel.</li>
    <li> Need one more roller for this to be great!</li>
    <li> I bought this to take with me when we traveled and found myself actually using this more than the bigger set I purchased.  Heats up fast and works great!</li>
    <li> I have bought 3-4 of these for myself over the years and have also given one to my sister.  I use these curlers every morning and leave them in my hair while I get ready.  Then I take them out and, with a little brushing and styling, my hair looks the way I want it to.  It is very compact, has dual voltage, can be easily slipped into the corner of a suitcase so I travel with it all over the world.  Has NEVER failed me.  Don&#x27;t know what I would do if Conair stops making it.  I know I should just stockpile them (lol)!</li>
    <li> All jumbo rollers works much better than my regular set a home. Suprisingly it was durable and did not break in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> Love this set of travel rollers.  Heats up fast and curls long lasting.  Easy to use and easy for travel.</li>
    <li> I have been using hot rollers for 15 years. This one works well. The felt rollers produce a nice soft curl. It heats up within 2 or 3 minutes. I love that there are only 5 rollers since that is all i need anyways, and it takes up a lot less room on my counter and in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> I own the full size version of these rollers as well, and the travel size does not get even half as hot as the full size set, even if you let it heat up longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, there aren&#x27;t any other travel size roller sets out there that provide jumbo size rollers, so if you don&#x27;t mind just getting a wave, rather than curl, then this is your best bet.</li>
    <li> The add said the rollers had a 2 inch diameter, which was what I needed.  The diameter was only 1 1/2 inch.  The curlers curl my hair into a curl that is too tight.</li>
    <li> Works well, but need more than five rollers</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up enough.  My waves go flat very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great hot rollers. They heat up so fast!</li>
    <li> Love this setter! It&#x27;s a classic, with modern yet retro feel. Rollers are flocked, and makes smooth big curls. I would say it is bulky for travel. I consider it more of a compact, stay home set. The last two times I took curlers on vacation, I didn&#x27;t use them anyway. I was in the pool/shower at least twice a day and my hair was still wet by the time we were going out to dinner. So, my style was a slicked back ponytail, chignon, or French twist. But I love these for home!</li>
    <li> There were not Jumbo.  I sent them back</li>
    <li> this work pretty good. wished i would have gotten the bigger set of rollers/quantity wise. i have medium hair and five rollers are not enough:(</li>
    <li> It gets hot really fast, easy to use, great product, the turn off is now my hair is too short to use this bigger size roll..&lt;br /&gt;First I thought of buying this to save space, I don&#x27;t really travel that much, so better to buy the normal one because you get more rolls.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement of one I had just like it . . ..  after years of use, the top cracked from being smushed in my suitcase--but definately a good buy!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe they let these on the market. After only about six uses, two of the five curlers have melted, one to the point that the side rim came off completely. It was a horrible smell, and now they are so misshapen they won&#x27;t fit into the heater even if I wanted them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> I already had a set of these at home but recently went on a trip to China where the electricity is 220V. I noticed this newer set of curlers has dual voltage so I purchased them.  Curlers get very hot both here in the U.S. and in China.  What&#x27;s nice is that I just had to move a small switch on the bottom of the heating unit to change the voltage.  These curlers give great long-lasting curls and I love the more secure clips that come with the set.  Only negative is that you have to be careful with the lid since I&#x27;ve had many of their lids break on me. That is why I usually bring them in my carry-on.  They are small so don&#x27;t take up much room in your luggage.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric hairsetter.  It is sturdy, heats up very quickly, and gets the job done - just what you want.  A great product for a reasonable amount of money.</li>
    <li> These rollers are great! They get just hot enough-I only leave them in for about 7 minutes. I wouldn&#x27;t want them to get too hot because these will style my hair without the damage of very high heat.You never burn your fingers. The velvet covering keeps a lot of heat damage from happening to your hair. You CAN order the wire clips, they work fine. My hair is almost to the middle of my back and the curls are a perfect size.</li>
    <li> This hair setter is great! The plastic rollers grip the hair better than my other hair setter with smooth rollers. The rollers stay in the hair and the curls are long lasting...even in humid weather. Heats up fast. Love these hot rollers for quick and curly styles...with lots of body! This will be great for traveling as it&#x27;s dual voltage. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick hair.  I love this set.  5 is just enough to do the front, sides, and back in one step.  The curls are soft and really gives my hair a ton of shine!!!  The unit is small and takes up hardly any space on my counter or in luggage.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Great for international travel</li>
    <li> Great for travel. Work well.</li>
    <li> Took this to Europe and it worked really well</li>
    <li> The only problem I found with this curlers is that only 5 come in each package. I still wish they could be bigger. I like the clippers because they stay in place. I wish they could heat up a bit more but I guess I need to take care of my hair and the velvet does protect it. I think if I buy 3 more packages it would be just fine for all the hair I have. The box is well designed since it&#x27;s not that big and doesn&#x27;t take that much space. I prefer this curlers than the Remington ones.</li>
    <li> Adds just the right amount of volume for a nicer look. If there were more rollers, I&#x27;d want to use more, and I&#x27;d end up with too much curl. These provide a quick and easy way to dress up your look a little.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace my hot rollers from 1994, which were still working, but took up too much room on my bathroom vanity.  I expected an improved product considering the age of my previous rollers, and I truly believe my previous rollers (circa 1994) work better.  It seems like I need to leave these in longer, maybe because of the spongy material on the roller (my previous ones were plastic).  the butterfly clips don&#x27;t work.  I still had metal pins from my previous set so I can use those.  The only thing I like about these is the size.  I will likely look for others....</li>
    <li> Wish it were a tad smaller, but works great.</li>
    <li> Works great, clip leaves marks if not careful!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
    <li> Small compact, easy to travel with. Does the job right! Rollers heat up very hot.&lt;br /&gt;Styling with this product is easy.</li>
    <li> Nice small package for dealing with frizz quickly. Gets hot fast.</li>
    <li> Not as happy with these as I expected to be.. they really do stink when heated up and take a bit long to heat up.  But I know that they will be great for travel and I am hoping the smell will burn off eventually...</li>
    <li> Love this little curler.  I needed a replacement for the one I&#x27;ve had for over 10 years but couldn&#x27;t find one in &amp;#34;all of mortar land&amp;#34;.  I searched high and low, up and down, to and fro….sad sad sad.  THEN, with a click on the Amazon site, THERE IT WAS, new and ready  to buy.  With another click I bought it, it was delivered in 2 days with my Prime subscription and ….PRAISE the hair gods, it works beautifully.  If you want a small set of curlers that heat up fast and just chug along for years to come, this is it.  Perfect price too.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, so I was hoping these would add some much needed body.  Most likely, if you do not have fine hair, they will work well for you, but they did nothing for my hair.  The rollers made some curl, but it fell out as I brushed it - even when I added a little hairspray.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Sets the curls quickly.  The only complaint I have is how hot the roller do get.  The temperature is a little uncomfortable against my head.</li>
    <li> The rollers are difficult to get to stay in your hair.  The clips that come with are are flimsy and don&#x27;t hold them.  The rollers don&#x27;t seem to get hot enough either.  Good for a back up set or in case of a hair emergency!</li>
    <li> I bought the curlers because of their larger size because I wanted my hair to be smooth with body instead of curly. They heat up very quickly and I am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> These are quite handy: I plug in before my shower then put in rollers. Fifteen minutes later, I have nice bouncy curls before I walk out the door.</li>
    <li> This set heats quickly and is very easy to travel with.  I have thick hair and it curls it fast!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair wavy and is ready quick but you may need to reheat rollers to finish.  Recommend this travel set.  The hair clips are nice and quick but do not store in the unit.</li>
    <li> These  are simple, quick and effective! What more do you need from them? Am tempted to get another set and not bother with the curling iron for the rest of my head!</li>
    <li> The clips need to be improved, but the rollers are great.  Just what I need for my straight, medium length hair.  These are not meant to curl your hair, but they give the look of a blow out without the hassle of using a round brush.</li>
    <li> I have been looking a long time for a small amount of rollers that are all the same size - big!  These are perfect and I love how it holds in place.</li>
    <li> I have long hair (about past my shoulder blades) cut with long layers.  After playing around with it a bit, I figured out a way to use only these five rollers to grab/curl all of my hair; the result is my layers come out and my hair has a nice bounce. I let the curlers cool completely before taking them out (basically the time it takes to put on my makeup).  It is quick and easy.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the reviews. Clips too flimsy, can&#x27;t keep the rollers in place and the rollers tend to overheat. I thought I could make 5 rollers work with my hair, I was wrong. I have thin hair so cannot imagine how someone with thick hair could use this product. I am giving the product two stars only because i do not like the &#x27;hate&#x27; reference when you select 1 star.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, gives large bouncy curls &amp; perfect size for throwing (cushioned between clothes) in a suitcase.  I have to use them 3-4 times to curl all my long hair but because they heat up almost instantly it doesn&#x27;t take much time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs. Heats quickly and gives my shoulder length bob volume. I am 53 and the hair isn&#x27;t what it used to be....not as thick....but I&#x27;ve recieved many compliments since using this.</li>
    <li> I love this size and so easy to pack for a trip. The lid did not break for me as some as stated. Love them!</li>
    <li> Great quick-heating rollers, but smaller than they used to be.</li>
    <li> Great, huge rollers.  Gives thin hair volume.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers. Taken them on vacation 3 times already. Much easier than taking a full set of hot rollers, since I only use 5 of them. I don&#x27;t use the roller clips that came with it though I have the Conair clamp roller clips. The other ones work fine but the clamps work better.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s review:  I have naturally curly hair and getting it to look smooth after blow drying it straight has always been an issue. Now I shower the night before, wake up plug my rollers in for a few minutes, then let them sit in my hair while I finish getting ready. My hair looks so smooth and healthy now! My hair is just past my shoulders and the 5 rollers are plenty for my hair. They don&#x27;t put a ton of curl in my hair, but nice smooth waves which is exactly what I wanted. At $20 you really can&#x27;t beat the value.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have a set that I have used and travel with for years.  I purchased another set to have on hand because I need to leave my original set at my boyfriend&#x27;s home.  These curlers produce enough heat without being too hot and are a good value.</li>
    <li> I really liked these hot rollers, but I have more hair than I thought and need more, so rather than buying extra rollers and clips and having them stored in different places, I returned it to find a larger set of these size.  They really make your hair smooth with nice body for those times when you don&#x27;t want a lot of curl and not stick straight either.  It&#x27;s too bad there&#x27;s only 5 rollers :(</li>
    <li> Very good curlers - they give my long hair a lot of body.  I recommend buying a pack of extra clips; these can sometimes bend.</li>
    <li> I love these very quick heating rollers.  I only wish there was at least one more roller in the set to do my whole head of hair at one time.</li>
    <li> Quick turn around and excellent product for the money.  I did expect that the rollers would be bigger as it said jumbo, so that was disappointing, but that may have been my fault.  Is there a size larger than jumbo?</li>
    <li> So you can compare to your hair type to my review, I have long, thick, and soft hair with a slight wave that typically curls easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is hard to put these rollers in your hair.  There is a slit in the roller where it straddles a metal bar to heat up.  When you try to put a u-shaped clip in, it often gets stuck in the slit.  I tried the clamps at 3 different angles and they kink my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, these don&#x27;t curl your hair well.  I let them heat up longer, left them in longer, tried using hairspray while they were in, but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is they don&#x27;t stay in your hair well once you finally get them in.  I tried rolling up with less hair to make my hair curl better, but then the rollers just slide out of my hair.  The last straw was when one of the rollers slid out of my hair and fell in the toilet at a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done with this set, and they went to the trash!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to find some of the plastic kind in at least 1.5\\&quot; size.  I will take burning my fingers over the problems I had with this set.</li>
    <li> however, I wish there were six or seven rollers instead of just five.  Loved the outcome, but because my hair is cut in layers,  I always needed ONE or TWO extra rollers. SO if your hair is one length great....but layers, not so sure unless you can work it out.  Either way, great product.  I&#x27;m thinking about giving these to my daughter and going back and ordering the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Jumbo And Super Jumbo Hair Setter with Super Clips, 12 Count (2 Sizes) for my layered cut. :-)</li>
    <li> Nice hairsetter, works well. As for travel, it could be more compact. It is fine for travel where suitcase space is not at a premium.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these.  The old one she used to have was huge, with 12 or so rollers.  This is the perfect size and they get hot pretty quickly.  The best part is that the entire unit is so small, it can be put in a drawer instead of sitting out.</li>
    <li> Great idea for traveling.</li>
    <li> Just what my hair needed</li>
    <li> worked great but wish they came in x large rollers</li>
    <li> These are my all time go-to hot rollers for home.  But I would never use these for travel as this is advertised.  It would be far too cumbersome.  That being said, these Conair rollers are terrific.  I&#x27;ve had this exact same set for YEARS so even though they were still ok I upgraded to a new clean set. Love them!</li>
    <li> If you have thick and curly hair, these are the rollers for you. There is no better way to give your hair bounce without the frizz. They stay in place and are easy to store.</li>
    <li> I plugged them in , they heated briefly , then that was it.......they didn&#x27;t heat at all.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t even be bothered with the hassle of returning them , so I threw them away....very disappointed</li>
    <li> I rated this high because I got just what I hoped for and everything went smoothly as far as shipping and timing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an airline pilot, and these rollers travel perfectly for me. I have had these rollers for over 15 years and I finally just ordered new ones for myself and my mother.  My old rollers still work perfectly, but I&#x27;ve used them every single day that I&#x27;ve owned them and are were well worn. This is the cheapest I have found these Conair Jumbo Rollers.  I have taken these rollers all over Europe, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Africa, and across Central America and Mexico.  With the dual voltage they are easy to use anywhere in the world.  Also, they heat up very quickly and can be used after 2 minutes.  There may not be enough rollers for some people, but they heat up so quick that it shouldn&#x27;t matter.  Conair does make a larger version to keep at home that my mom loves. These are not for tight curls, they fix the frizz and create a nice soft wave to your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my daughter. She really liked them. They seem to work well... but I think you need a few more rollers, if you have a lot of hair..they do warm up quickly</li>
    <li> These are the best. I have long very thick straight hair, and I truly enjoy the set. It is quick and easy. All I do is wait 2-5 minutes for the rollers to heat and have them in my hair between 5-15 depending on how much i want the curls to last me, and I am off to work.  I would definetely recommended to people.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent set of jumbo rollers. It heats up very quickly and is effective without damaging the hair. Just a minute or two with the rollers helps eliminate the frizz and give the hair body. Most jumbo rollers aren&#x27;t as big as these and I find that quarter of an inch makes a difference for longer hair. I&#x27;ve used the rollers on my overseas trips; the set is portable and convenient. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because there is one problem with the product -- the hinge on the plastic cover breaks within weeks. (My daughter and I each have a set, so a I am familiar with the problem.) It&#x27;s not a terrible design flaw but it is annoying. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great set of rollers. And if you need more than five rollers you can easily buy an extra set from Conair for around $5.</li>
    <li> Quick to heat up (with obvious indicator), lightweight and easy to use.  Produces nice, big smooth curls.  I used the dual-voltage option with no problem. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had never really used any rollers in the past.  I found these super easy to use.  They heat up instantly and create great results.  My only issue was that its too big to travel with.  I just use them every day at home.</li>
    <li> Yikes! This is the first thing I have ever sent back to Amazon. The rollers get so hot you can&#x27;t touch them anywhere. The clips to hold them in place are really weak. I have medium-thick hair. Perhaps people with thinner hair would have less trouble. The plastic top broke off the second time I tried to use them. This is the second Conair hair appliance I have owned. They don&#x27;t impress me much. I can&#x27;t imagine I would ever buy a Conair product again.</li>
    <li> size easy for travel and the size of curlers are perfect for casual curl.  Jumbo size it is and it works great!</li>
    <li> The rolls are really big, but the first time I used them, the curlers broke and some of my hair melted to the melting plastic end piece. Thanks for the haircut Conair! :(</li>
    <li> they were kind of hard to use, but that could be because I&#x27;m new at this. they heated up quickly which was great! took a while to do all hair</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t get very hot, so you don&#x27;t get a wavy hair, and my hair is not straight. I have try it several times and I just have gotten frustrated. Just get an hair curlier or learn how to make the curls with a hair straightener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to see a picture of these 5 rollers on a more than 20 strands of hair. no way can I roll my entire head with FIVE rollers! Why do people like these? Only bought to extend the large sizes in another.set of three sizes.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in these hot rollers.  I have used several Conair hot roller sets over the years that were good- heated in less than 5min with ends that were not too hot to hold. To get these curlers warm enough to curl my hair they needed to heat for over 10minutes, then I needed gloves to handle them.</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T GET HOT ENOUGH TO CURL THE HAIR.</li>
    <li> probably on my 10th one. I use it everyday, and five is all you need.</li>
    <li> you can make your hair very easy in a short time.</li>
    <li> heats fast and 5 rollers are big and clips work well</li>
    <li> Worked great on my europe trip! No problems with using an adapter to heat up.  Only con is the clips, I used my clips from another Conair hot rollers I have that didn&#x27;t have a dual voltage option.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not nearly as happy with these curlers as I thought I&#x27;d be after reading the really good reviews.  Unlike the old school curlers, nothing there to &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; your hair -- when you have very long hair as I do, you need this.  Also, short hair could benefit from that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering how darn hot they get, I was shocked to see the curl didn&#x27;t take well like trad&#x27;l hot rollers.  I do like the clip idea for comfort, but they are pain to store separately - - there would be NO WAY I&#x27;d take this travelling; the clips would get destroyed because there&#x27;s no compartment in the travel set to put them in and the lid as everyone has mentioned is to fragile for travelling.</li>
    <li> Curlers came only with the plastic clamps while the electric container had a built in compartment for wire clips. I had to purchase the wire clips separately.  Also the overall size of container could be smaller for travel use. Otherwise, the rollers performered well and were of good quality.</li>
    <li> I use these every day and they seem to be holding up well. Time will tell if they actually hold up.</li>
    <li> terrible, does not heat up enough to do anything. instead it crimps your hair and you look like a lion.</li>
    <li> Works great small enough for travel took on cruise and my hair was always perfect  Have larger set for home</li>
    <li> The size is perfect for my shoulder-length hair; producing a natural looking wave with minimal time. The butterfly clips, or claws, however; fall out of my hair so easily. I have to do a little balancing act (frustrating but kind of comedic) to TRY to keep them in place. I am always left with a crimp mark on my front top section. I tried those U-shaped clips and they didn&#x27;t hold either. I would be very happy with these curlers if this problem was corrected. Also, my outlet is behind my vanity, so, because there is no On/off switch, I have to crawl under the vanity to unplug the curlers both before and after using them (again, frustrating but kind of comedic). An extension cord helps but is not preferable.</li>
    <li> I like the Conair Rollers.  I didn&#x27;t realize they came with the clips so that was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;They are inexpensively made, but they didn&#x27;t cost that much, so you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;They heat up instantly and the red dot turns white to let you know when they are ready.  I usually leave them a little longer than after the dot disappears.  They get plenty hot and curl the hair nicely.  They are exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I have used these rollers previously as part of a larger set and wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have thought of them as &amp;#34;Jumbo&amp;#34;.  So, I thought I was getting larger rollers.  These only curl about 3/4 of my hair so I have to break out the curling iron to finish up.  Not sure if I&#x27;m going to buy another mini set or give these away and buy a full set.</li>
    <li> LOVE the curlers..... heats up&lt;br /&gt;Quickly and great for traveling</li>
    <li> I gave four stars per no on/off switch you will have to unplug from the outlet. Heating plate gets hot quickly be careful. My first use the rollers was to hot to be on my scalp. I like the wave and fullness these rollers give me but would like extra five. I had this product for four months. Tip make sure to add heating product to your hair. I use pure Argan oil.</li>
    <li> Bought these curler billed as Travel Curlers. They&#x27;re great for travel as long as you don&#x27;t try to use them outside the US. Even with a power adapter to account for the difference in voltage, they overheat and start to smoke (and STINK) if they&#x27;re plugged in for more than about 30 seconds. This is not the first time I&#x27;ve had trouble with Conair brand hot rollers overseas. For the record, the problem was not the adapter. I used it for charging my phone and laptop and for my curling iron.</li>
    <li> Created a strong odor of burning plastic that could be smelled rooms away when I turned it on. Didn&#x27;t use it on my hair. Returned it.</li>
    <li> I have thin, medium length hair. This product does not get hot enough hold curls, regardless of the amount of time I let it heat up. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, small container that is easy to take in a suitcase. 5 curlers just does it for a bouncy look. I&#x27;m very happy with this set.</li>
    <li> I love these jumbo rollers.  They are big enough to get a soft curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I don&#x27;t love the &amp;#34;super clips&amp;#34; that come with it.  In fact, I hate them.  They make marks in my soft hair.  I use regular clips that I had from another set of rollers.  The other thing that I should mention is that, after a while, the felt comes off the rollers and they are very hot to handle. But for these two things, I would give them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for travel, however I remove the plastic lid (to save space and because it will break during travel). I wish the makers would remove the base to make it even more compact, but still is the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product at home too. It is a full size set of &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; rollers and I find I like it better than other types I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love these -- usually, the \\&quot;large\\&quot; rollers in a hot set are too small and will curl your hair.  These are big enough to just give some body and shape. Theyre exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have the set of 12 Conair purple rollers for everyday use but they take up a lot of room in my suit case.  This 5 roller set has the same heating element as my  purple full sized set so I take 5 rollers from my purple set and throw them in my suitcase so I have 10 rollers to work with. The second set of 5 curlers takes maybe 5 minutes to heat. Don&#x27;t forget to take extra clips too. Protect the plastic lid by wrapping something around it when packing. These arrived from Amazon in just two days!</li>
    <li> Was apprehensive about the other reviews, but I took a chance and I have had no complaints.  I have very thick hair so I need to do two rounds if the rollers to get all my hair curled, but it is not a problem while I am getting ready.  Heat is fine.  I like to leave them heating more then suggested to get a good hot heat on the roller.  Some might not like that and get a better set, but I love the size and convenience of this set and work with in its limitations.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend and she likes the small size for portability but she would rather have the metal clips instead of the plastic clamps.</li>
    <li> Granted, I have very thick, straight hair so it&#x27;s difficult to curl. But these curlers did nothing. Even with mousse and hairspray, the curls would not hold. I went back to using my Remington ceramic curlers.</li>
    <li> The rollers heat up very quickly and the carrier is light weight. I had expected the rollers to be larger since they are advertised as “jumbo” but they are basically like the large rollers from a standard set. I have too much hair for these rollers to actually be very useful, since they aren’t very large and there are only five of them, but the product works well.</li>
    <li> Very fast heating device and helped to add volume to medium length fine hair.  I added some large metal clips which helps save space if using this for travel.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this! It&#x27;s cute and compact. I let it heat up a little longer then 2 min. and let it get nice and hot. It&#x27;s easy to use and the curls it makes holds better then my old one. Even though the picture doesn&#x27;t show it, it does come with the clips to hold the curlers. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for travel - they fit nicely into my carry on suitcase. I prefer the metal pins over the plastic clips because they clips tend to leave a line in my hair.  It comes with 5 pins but you can always order additional.  I even use it internationally but make sure you get a high voltage converter or they will melt.</li>
    <li> I was looking for dual voltage rollers so that I don&#x27;t need to pack a converter (my rollers are my only electronic item that need one).  I have no idea why these rollers are considered for &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; other than the dual voltage...the rollers would take up 1/3 of my suitcase.  Had to return them and will just go back to packing a converter...</li>
    <li> I never travled with this product but yet the cover cracked after about 8 months. Poor quailty. Great size rollers though.</li>
    <li> Great product. Heats quickly, nice size rollers. Wish it had carrying case for travel, but good value overall for the price.</li>
    <li> Literally scorched and melted on the the third use overseas.  I bought this set specifically because it was dual voltage for an extended trip to Europe.  I used them twice without incident and then on the third use, I smelled a burning plastic smell within 2 minutes of plugging them in.  When I unplugged them and took out the rollers, the rollers had scorch marks on them and plastic was literally oozing out from the bottom of the rollers.  Needless to say, they were completely unusable after that.  I used the same plug adapter for numerous other items so I know the problem was not with the plug adapter, nor with the electrical current in the home I was using.  Be very careful if you are buying these for use overseas.  I wish I had just bought a cheap after arriving in Europe.</li>
    <li> These are great and fit well on the counter. I have thick wavy shoulder length hair and these add enough volume without me having to  use a round brush all over to dry my hair for an hour. I only wish I got a bigger size (or extra ones) since 5 is not enough for my whole head. They heat up quickly enough (I plug them in as i&#x27;m drying my hair) and the wave stayed in my hair overnight.</li>
    <li> These are a staple for me. I&#x27;ve had a set of these that I bought at a garage sale for 20 years!  These appear the same and I have no reason to believe they will not last equally well.  When they wear out, I&#x27;ll buy another set just like them.  Jumbo is the large size curler that comes in the other larger curler sets.  Since I never used the little ones, I like this set.  I have never liked the plastic claw clips that come with this set, so I use the metal ones that come with it. (this set came with both metal and plastic clips).  The unit heats up pretty fast while I&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
    <li> Curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough, No on/off switch. Flimsy cover and overall construction as mentioned in other reviews.    I have straight, medium-fine hair down to my lower back. I have used 1.5\\&quot; hot curlers and they make just the right amount of curl for when I want a more relaxed or serious professional as opposed to dressy or fru-fru look. This size roller gives my hair more than body, they give large, long-haired curls. I was dubious about trying foam ones but some people are getting good results with these and my hair is not thick. Five rollers was enough to do my whole head. I let them heat up a good 45 minutes - they were not that hot - the results were just okay (my hair takes a curl well despite being straight). The set is compact, yet it requires extra storage for the clips for which there is no case or compartment. The clips themselves are very flimsy and I&#x27;m sure would need replacing over time. I know the metal clips don&#x27;t hold a curler in place any better, but they aren&#x27;t any worse and they do fit in the slots provided, plus they are almost indestructible. Add to this the flimsy construction of the casing  (I can just see how the top would break with a minor pull or flip), and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lock into closed position, it&#x27;s not real practical for any sort of travel. If I were going to keep it on a shelf in one place, and had room for the clips there (maybe find a little box for them), they&#x27;d be okay.</li>
    <li> I use these every day.  Love it. Adds just enough body to flat hair.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and it just doesn&#x27;t keep my hair curled. I have thicker hair but I tried only a small section and that didn&#x27;t stay either. :( I would love to use hot rollers instead of a curling iron but they don&#x27;t ever seem to work!</li>
    <li> Daughter in law loved this...works really well.</li>
    <li> Its very easy to use and carry with me when i travel. It heats up really quickly.</li>
    <li> They did not get hot enough to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers.  They heat instantly and the rollers are huge.  I love the clippies that hold the roller in.  I can leave them in for a few seconds for a smooth wave or let them heat longer and leave them in for a longer time for a more defined wave.  I get lots of compliments when I use them and would highly recommend them.  I have medium long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> The product is great. Would have benifited though by including the wire clip versus the plastic. This would allow for better transport Shen traveling.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; version but it&#x27;s the only one I use at home - five jumbo curlers are exactly what you want for some wave, body, and curl but NOT Shirley Temple-style ringlets.  They used to come with metal hooks, but now they come with white plastic jaw clips which are much easier to use.</li>
    <li> The clips did not hold the curlers in my hair.  I had to return them.  I was very sad that they did not work out for me.</li>
    <li> Heats up lickety split. I only wish it had a few more rollers. The five aren&#x27;t enough to hold all of my hair.</li>
    <li> These rollers heat up within minutes!!! By the time I get dressed, they are hot and ready to go!! Makes styling a breeze:)</li>
    <li> Very good curlers.  Work great and my hair holds this curl.</li>
    <li> The rollers are exactly as advertised!  I love &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wearing my gray hair in a longer style and just want body and less frizz. These are perfect for what I want them to do! I&#x27;ve had flocked hot rollers before, but they were in three sizes. I just need the jumbo size now. I put three across the top of my head and one on each side to get the exact look I want. I love the clips that hold them in place. They can be positioned underneath the rollers to keep your scalp from feeling the heat. Yay!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom to replace some of the curlers in her 12-curler set. She uses them every day, and after a few years, the flocking on the rollers started to come off. She probably won&#x27;t use this for traveling since she uses more than 6 rollers in her hair.</li>
    <li> Just five rollers in this hair setter. I have shoulder length thick hair and it works out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly, easy to roll and pin then just forget about it for a few minutes. Big, soft&lt;br /&gt;curls.</li>
    <li> These work great! They were smaller than I expected but are really good rollers. They&#x27;re not too hot to handle and they&#x27;re soft so it doesnt ruin your hair!</li>
    <li> Good price, they heat up fast, nice and compact container for putting in a suitcase for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;good product. very pleased.</li>
    <li> These work pretty good for the price and will be handy to travel, but not enough rollers to cover my whole head, meaning I need to let them get warm again and have another go-round.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand/size of curlers for about 10 years now.  Normally, with 6-day-a-week use, it will last about 1 year.  I always keep one in reserve and this current one that I ordered is in my closet as reserve.  However, I will need to take out to use soon, because after only 6 months of 2-3-day-a-week use, the current rollers (same brand/product) that I&#x27;ve been using no longer heats up.  Bummer, because this is the PERFECT amount of curlers to quickly throw my hair into for the perfect size curl, but it looks like I am going to find a new brand soon to have in reserve.</li>
    <li> Just used them in UK and Ireland and they worked great.  But important to click the switch on bottom to 250 from 120 (continental) or it will burn out.  The switch is not so obvious so I did just that with an earlier set.</li>
    <li> It was compact and small. It&#x27;s really nice to carry around when you go on trips!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really fast!</li>
    <li> I wish the curlers were bigger. All in all its just fine but I was looking for something a little different.</li>
    <li> The edges of the rollers stay cool so they&#x27;re much more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I have had the full set for so many years it is in 2 pieces. Got this one specifically for travel as I usually don&#x27;t use more than 5 rollers anyway. It is fine. Just like the one I got so many years ago, only fewer rollers this time.</li>
    <li> Love this roller set.  My hair is half way down my back and I&#x27;ve been using a curling iron.  Takes forever!!  Now, I put my 5 rollers in, go about my business, and 10 minutes later beautiful hair with body and a light loose curl at the ends.  A must have for longer hair, and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the style.  Saves so much time, these work wonders!</li>
    <li> SO HAPPY, had my first set for 10 years, they stopped heating-- so to amazon i went:  SO HAPPY they had a &amp;#34;updated&amp;#34; Conair travel set and the Jumbo rollers, i was SO HAPPY....they arrived very quickly and I was SO HAPPY with my purchase!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have a ton of fine hair that has a natural wave.  It did not curl my hair and i left them in until they were completely cool.  Disappointment.  I gave it 2/5 stars because maybe it&#x27;s my hair type that&#x27;s the problem, not the product.  I just would not recommend it since I did not have success. :(</li>
    <li> Great product when used with the hot roller super clips</li>
    <li> Size is perfect for suitcase. Did not get as hot as other rollers I have.</li>
    <li> Okay for the price. Does it&#x27;s job. Nothing too special. I personally don&#x27;t think it gets as hot but not a biggie.</li>
    <li> I already had a 12-roller version of this hairsetter, but it is a bit large for travel and requires a clumsy voltage converter for international travel. I bought the 5-roller, dual voltage version mainly for international travel. I need 10 rollers, so I just take 5 additional rollers and clips from my larger set when I travel. I used the travel version for a trip to Germany. It worked fine on the 240 volt setting. As I used a roller, I replaced it with one of the extra rollers. I found I needed to allow the additional rollers to heat for a couple of extra minutes, but this process worked quite well. It would have been better if the rollers heated a bit more quickly, but overall, the system performed well with only a small plug adaptor required for 240 volts.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers in June, and I have used them roughly two or three times a month since then. Today I put switched them on - and the rollers burned out, melting the surrounding plastic and singeing the lid. They were on for no more than 5 minutes. Three of the rollers were literally molten - and I have now chucked the set away. One of the reasons I used them so infrequently was that the curlers got so hot that I found it hard to handle them without burning myself. I am hoping these were just duds, because I have just bought the larger Conair jumbo roller set.</li>
    <li> They work well, if you know how to use them. I have very thin, fine hair, so I thought 5 rollers would be enough, I could still use 3-4 more, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone looking to have a head of curls. I would not consider these a travel item either, as there is no where to store the clips that must be used with the rollers.</li>
    <li> The product works well and the curlers heat up quickly. They make your hair look great, but the design is dumb. The curlers come with clips to secure them to your hair. The clips are easy to use, but take up a lot of room. The container for the curlers are similar to the standard full size sets, but with about half the curlers. That is fine, except the container is simultaneously bulky and fragile. The plastic dome extends up a few extra inches and the base has a foot on it that extends down a few extra inches. This set takes up a ton of space in a suitcase. Hopefully you are packing a back because this will take up all the room in a roller board suitcase and you mist likely will break some part of the set off if you pack it with anything else. Totally impractical.</li>
    <li> I use them often - they are perfect for my thick hair.  Five is just the right amount, they heat up quickly and stay hot, then heat up again - quickly! Plus, they are reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend :)!</li>
    <li> I have thick, shoulder length hair.  Surprisingly, I was able to put all of my hair on the five rollers in this set..ideally I could have used one or two more, but this will be a good size for travel.  I&#x27;m concerned about the thinness of the cheaply made &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34;??? clips and how long before the plastic starts breaking.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Heats up fast.  There are only 5 curlers.  Not enough to do all of your hair.</li>
    <li> Love the rollers,  HATE the clips.  Wish it had the old wire ones</li>
    <li> Dual voltage is one of the best part of this item. I&#x27;m from Sg, so usually I have difficulty to buy things from US coz of the voltage issue. But this item has a dual and easy to travel with. The fact that the curls So huge, made my hair really voluminous.</li>
    <li> these curlers are great for travel or anytime you just want volume without a lot of curl. Five curlers often isn&#x27;t enough, so after I curl one section, I stick a Velcro curler in that section to cool and hold and then reheat the curler for another section. They beat up very quickly. I have also purchased the Jilbere Pro Jumbo Replacement Rollers, which I will heat as I take one curler off the heating rod. They aren&#x27;t as big as the Volume rollers but work and fit on the heating rod. My only complaint is that the clips don&#x27;t hold. I&#x27;m not sure if they aren&#x27;t big enough or if they are too weak. It&#x27;s a big problem for me and one I&#x27;ve had with other jumbo curlers too. I tried to substitute the wire clip mind but they aren&#x27;t big enough for these curlers. In fairness to Conair, my hair is fine. Maybe if I had a big thick section of hair they would hold better. But many other reviewers complain about this, too. I t seems no one can make a clip that holds tight. Why is it so difficult? This is a great, compact set of curlers. I would give 5 stars except for the clip problem.</li>
    <li> My wife uses these daily and it works great for her long hair. The longer she keeps them in her hair, the longer the curls last. They heat up fast and easy to roll and clip on.</li>
