      <li>The heads come with a moisturizer all around the razor which helps keep the legs moist and soft and reduces the likelihood of knicks!</li>
      <li>I can only get 3-4 shaves from a single attachment as the lotion wears off quickly.  </li>
      <li>They also seemed to shave the exact same for me as the ones I buy at my local CVS or Target.</li>
      <li>(I usually get uneven wear on mine and the moisturizing block disappears where I want it the most).</li>
      <li>The refills are thick, but I feel like they disintegrate too quickly</li>

<li> /&gt;Though the razor seems fancy with the large surface, it is just a mediocre razor ensconced in a large bulk of shaving gel.</li>
<li> but they sadly don&#x27;t last very long for the price</li>
<li> I try to use other shaving products, but this is my fall back.</li>
<li> What I love about it is that it gets the hair off no problem and quickly in the shower without the need of shaving cream or pain, or a nasty smell or a mess or cuts.</li>
<li> Really protects my skin in delicate areas without the mess of shaving cream.</li>
<li> I bought these a few years ago and recently couldn&#x27;t remember why I stopped buying them and decided to give them another shot.</li>
<li> I have not even used the other 2</li>
<li> It was hard to find in my local drug store or grocery market.</li>
<li> Then, once the gel is partially used up, it won&#x27;t lather up well anymore and just goes to waste.</li>
<li> I may have to go back to a regular single blade with shave cream as these are very expensive, even on Amazon.</li>
<li> The razor quickly gets bad and leaves nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Order came on time, was complete and not too expensive.  </li>
<li> BUT this is the first time that I have bought online and am very disappointed.  </li>
<li> It always surprises me how expensive razor blades are !</li>
<li> I was shocked when I saw the price for this 3 pack of razor refills.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been spoiled on these, they just get the closest, smoothest shave, and I can&#x27;t shave with anything else anymore!  They make my legs very smooth and no nicks, plus I have very sensitive skin so these are all I will use anymore.  They&#x27;re worth the price.  I really like this new, tropical Splash scent.  It&#x27;s very refreshing and summery!</li>
    <li> I have bought these before so I am familiar with the product.  The package was intact and arrived in a timely manner. It always surprises me how expensive razor blades are !</li>
    <li> This is a great all-in-one razor. You don&#x27;t need any shaving cream, lotion or gel, and you get a close a shave as if you waxed. Closer, even. It was hard to find in my local drug store or grocery market. But Amazon had it, and I hope they keep selling it through the website.</li>
    <li> Great price and wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have bought these in the store and loved them. I bought on amazon because of the good price. The package said its tropical splash but thats not what was inside. They&#x27;re usable, just not the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; I ordered.</li>
    <li> I was shocked when I saw the price for this 3 pack of razor refills. I had never seen this tropical scent in the store so I figured I would give them a try. The smell was not overwhelming ad was actually quite pleasant. They also seemed to shave the exact same for me as the ones I buy at my local CVS or Target. I have been waiting to see if they will be available again because I am planning in stocking up on them for the future. I would recommend this product to all of my friends that are looking for this specific type of razor refill.</li>
    <li> This schick razor has and great smell I just love the way it smell and it does do the job it is required to do.</li>
    <li> I can only get 3-4 shaves from a single attachment as the lotion wears off quickly.  I may have to go back to a regular single blade with shave cream as these are very expensive, even on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for many, many years. Always able to shave and not have gashes on my legs and underarms.</li>
    <li> Intuition is the only brand I buy.  It gives the best shave without needing shaving cream and smells great no matter which scent.</li>
    <li> Love getting this auto deliv</li>
    <li> I love Schlick intuition. I try to use other shaving products, but this is my fall back. What I love about it is that it gets the hair off no problem and quickly in the shower without the need of shaving cream or pain, or a nasty smell or a mess or cuts. The refills are thick, but I feel like they disintegrate too quickly and I go through the refills quickly. I wish there was more than three in a pack. I had to take a star away for how fast the refills dissolve, but I love this shaver.</li>
    <li> Really protects my skin in delicate areas without the mess of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is the most practical razor I have ever had the pleasure of using. The heads come with a moisturizer all around the razor which helps keep the legs moist and soft and reduces the likelihood of knicks!</li>
    <li> i have been using intuition for over 4 years. I love this product BUT this is the first time that I have bought online and am very disappointed.  The razor dulled fast and the bar of soap around it shrunk real fast. I will never buy online again for this product. I have not even used the other 2 and I went to the store and bought and am happy with that product. I do not know why these 2 products with the same name is completely different quality. I rated this as 1 b/c I would not recommend and will never buy again and will not even use the remaining 2.</li>
    <li> As a busy mom of 4, I love anything that can simplify my life.  This product is one of them.  Fast easy shaving that makes life simple.  Order came on time, was complete and not too expensive.  Who could ask for more!</li>
    <li> I love these razors because they don&#x27;t require shaving cream (making them extremely convenient for those days when you are just too lazy to shave, one less step&#x3D;smooth legs showing under that skirt). I would give them 5 stars but they sadly don&#x27;t last very long for the price (I usually get uneven wear on mine and the moisturizing block disappears where I want it the most).</li>
    <li> I got it fast and cheap</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed.  Fast shipper!</li>
    <li> I bought these a few years ago and recently couldn&#x27;t remember why I stopped buying them and decided to give them another shot. I am hoping by typing out why I am not buying them again, I will remember when the urge to try them again comes up next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the razor seems fancy with the large surface, it is just a mediocre razor ensconced in a large bulk of shaving gel. At the beginning it over-lathers and uses us the shaving gel quickly and you have to go over areas several times to get a good shave, something that usually isn&#x27;t the case for me with Venus razors. Then, once the gel is partially used up, it won&#x27;t lather up well anymore and just goes to waste. The razor quickly gets bad and leaves nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I&#x27;m going back to Venus.</li>
    <li> excellent price for an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Schick Intuition for several years now and this is the best scent I have come across. Love it.</li>
