      <li>I have been looking for this mascara everywhere because it was my favorite until they discontinued it</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and have used it for years until it was no longer available in my area.</li>
      <li>and it comes off easily with washing of wipes.</li>

      <li>Been using these Maybeline Mascara a few year now and they are great.</li>

      <li>So glad that Amazon offers it.</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands, even other dual app products, but this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It creates great volume, and thick lashes that look very real.</li>
      <li>It arrived promptly and exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>Also, once I got the makeup they both looked pretty beaten up.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what is says it does: Lengthens and volume.</li>
      <li>Making application very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>Applies way to much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really does make your eyelashes look so much longer and fuller.  </li>
      <li>The mascara was expired and very clumpy.</li>
      <li>They should not advertise as new product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, I expected a lot more than what I actually got.</li>
      <li>She loves it and it is becoming hard to get hold of.  </li>
      <li>I use the white end more than the black, and pair it with other mascaras frequently</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to be able to order a few online, however the items I recieved were dried out and useless.</li>
      <li>&quot; they sent me two mascaras that Looked used and dried out like they just dug up old mascara people threw out and resold them very upset and unpleased.</li>
      <li>The wands are not long.</li>

<li> The mascara seems like it is old and a bit dried out.  </li>

<li> The white portion of it is not really whitish yet yellow-tinged and dry.</li>
<li> it makes my eyelashes look twice as long!</li>
<li> My lashes definitely looked fuller, but that was due the excess amount of product that I could not control when applying.</li>
<li> I may go to sephora&#x27;s and buy all sorts of other big brands.</li>
<li> Mascara was totally dry.  </li>
<li> But when it comes down to mascara, there is only one for me..</li>
<li> I am not certain that it is new or if it is outdated</li>
<li> Extra length (at least I saw it in my lashes)&lt;br</li>
<li> instead it kinda makes them droop down</li>
<li> so i&#x27;d have a little stash.</li>
<li> It makes my thin, short lashes look long and thick.</li>
<li> White product thinly coats lash, but allows the black mascara to cover &amp; coat.</li>
<li> There is dried up product around the rims of the tube.</li>
<li> so i bought a few</li>
<li> Now, I am unable to find it at any of my local stores.  </li>
<li> The mascara I received was not even close to what I had used in the past.</li>
<li> I was so sad when the local stores discontinued carrying this mascara.</li>
<li> Sorry, but this product did not live up to my expectations.  </li>
<li> The regular stickers on the makeup were torn off and replaced with stickers saying \\&quot;%50 off\\&quot; and they were a bit dirty.</li>
<li> Applying this product was messy and difficult.</li>
<li> There was a thin layer of dust on the mascara package when I took it out of the shipping package as well.</li>
<li> Have used product before, but never experienced it in this condition</li>
<li> Base coat was yellow and sticky.  </li>
<li> Am disappointed in this mascara</li>

    <li> I may go to sephora&#x27;s and buy all sorts of other big brands. But when it comes down to mascara, there is only one for me.. This mascara is by far the best mascara that I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried mac, revelon, covergirl, clinique you name it.  This one is the absolute best.  It does exactly what is says it does: Lengthens and volume.</li>
    <li> There are more cons than pros for this product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Extra length (at least I saw it in my lashes)&lt;br /&gt;2. A primer and mascara in one tube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Lots of clumps!&lt;br /&gt;2. The wands are not long. I cannot do my bottom or inner lashes with the short wands without getting mascara everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;3. The brushes are huge, which are not proportionate to the wand length. Making application very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;4. Extra time applying the primer and mascara.&lt;br /&gt;5. Applies way to much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I expected a lot more than what I actually got. Applying this product was messy and difficult. My lashes definitely looked fuller, but that was due the excess amount of product that I could not control when applying. Save your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It creates great volume, and thick lashes that look very real. I use the white end more than the black, and pair it with other mascaras frequently</li>
    <li> Love this product, was saddened to see it discontinued. I was thrilled to be able to order a few online, however the items I recieved were dried out and useless. Saddened once again.</li>
    <li> The mascara was expired and very clumpy.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this mascara everywhere because it was my favorite until they discontinued it and I bought it from this seller \\&quot;beautytime\\&quot; they sent me two mascaras that Looked used and dried out like they just dug up old mascara people threw out and resold them very upset and unpleased. Never again will I buy from them still looking for this mascara though</li>
    <li> The mascara is a good mascara however it does not hold my eyelashes instead it kinda makes them droop down but i still like the length it gives them.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and have used it for years until it was no longer available in my area. The mascara I received was not even close to what I had used in the past. It was similar to old mascara nearly dried out. The white portion of it is not really whitish yet yellow-tinged and dry. There is dried up product around the rims of the tube. I have to apply coat after coat after coat just to get it to look somewhat &amp;#34;there&amp;#34;. There was a thin layer of dust on the mascara package when I took it out of the shipping package as well. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in this product.  I thought I had ordered the waterproof type but got the standard instead so thought I&#x27;d try it.  Does not wear well and smudges.  The waterproof product was fabulous.  Am disappointed in this mascara</li>
    <li> I had bought one of these previously and just started using it and realized it&#x27;s the best mascara on the face of the earth. i&#x27;m a 60 year old beauty, and trust me, i&#x27;ve used every kind of mascara there is. When i went searching in stores for more of this, i was unable to find it. So glad to find it at amazon.com(i knew i would!) so i bought a few so i&#x27;d have a little stash. This mascara makes your lashes LONGER than anything else. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> They should not advertise as new product.  Base coat was yellow and sticky.  Mascara was totally dry.  Have used product before, but never experienced it in this condition</li>
    <li> The mascara seems like it is old and a bit dried out.  I am not certain that it is new or if it is outdated</li>
    <li> i love this mascara it makes my eyelashes look twice as long!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product which I have used for years.  Unfortunately it is not offered in my area any more.  So glad that Amazon offers it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my Mum.  She loves it and it is becoming hard to get hold of.  It arrived promptly and exactly as described.  Very happy :)</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. No longer available in stores. Found it on Amazon, YEAH! Hoping to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but this product did not live up to my expectations.  I have used it before, but this must have been old, as the white fiber part did not stiffen my eyelashes, as previously used same product.</li>
    <li> While I love this mascara, my review isnt on that. Its on the company Belagio Exports. I ordered 2 items of makeup from them. I got 1 within 3 wks and the mascara came 2 weeks after that. I never recieved an email informing as to why 1 product took so long to ship. Also, once I got the makeup they both looked pretty beaten up. The regular stickers on the makeup were torn off and replaced with stickers saying \\&quot;%50 off\\&quot; and they were a bit dirty. Its still a good price for the make up but just saying, unless you have enough make up to get you through for a while, dont order from them!</li>
    <li> The worst garbage ever.  I always used this product when it was available in the store. I got this product last week. And it is horrible. The mascara does not stay on. The white primer does nothing.  I wish I could give this a zero rating.</li>
    <li> Been using these Maybeline Mascara a few year now and they are great. You will get about 4-6 months use and it comes off easily with washing of wipes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give the volume as advertised</li>
    <li> I DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS IS NO LONGER SOLD IN STORES. PROVIDES A PERFECT FOUNDATION FOR APPLYING ANY MASCARA.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time and was REALLY disappointed when it was taken off the market. White product thinly coats lash, but allows the black mascara to cover &amp; coat. Results quite satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I was so sad when the local stores discontinued carrying this mascara. I have tried many brands, even other dual app products, but this is my favorite. It makes my thin, short lashes look long and thick. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and now find the stores have everything but this.  I checked Amazon and of course they had it.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find it.  It really does make your eyelashes look so much longer and fuller.  This is the best product.</li>
    <li> The 2 steps are the perfect way to achieve that extra effect for longer lashes that last all day. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Maybelline&#x27;s XXL mascara for years.  Now, I am unable to find it at any of my local stores.  I immediately went to the internet and ordered a couple year&#x27;s worth.  My eyelids are starting to sag.  This product makes my lashes thicker and helps to hold up my eyelids.  It is a miraculous product.</li>
