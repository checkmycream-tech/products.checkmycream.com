      <li>This is a really nice, easy to use product.  </li>
      <li>Nice color, easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butttttt</li>
      <li>Even my mom who knew I was asked me what I was using as it looked a more believable light brown!</li>
      <li>lOvE lOVE</li>
      <li>To the reviewer with the irritation from the tanner, I think it is more a condition relating to your skin, not the product.</li>
      <li>I have had friends tell me how much better I look than when I was fake-baking.</li>

      <li>I love this tanner.</li>
      <li>Im glad I can buy it off here for cheaper because it goes for $10</li>
      <li>Most stuff I&#x27;ve tried came up a couple days shorter than that.  </li>
      <li>I love the look of the more sparkly ones that are tinted, but can&#x27;t deal with the way they get on my clothes.  </li>
      <li>Mostly my ankle area.  </li>
      <li>The fading was even (but that owes more to exfoliation), and it didn&#x27;t make me break out from heaviness even though it did feel a bit tacky drying.</li>
      <li>The results are satisfying and it lasts longer than a lot of products out there.</li>
      <li>Have gifted it to co-worker and will include it in gift box to another friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, make sure it is thoroughly and evenly rubbed in or you will have streaking or spots.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Make sure to put sun screen on though....</li>
      <li>I had many co-workers commenting on how tan</li>
      <li>I see it&#x27;s available for like 30 bucks on here?!</li>
      <li>It works 100 times better than lotion does.</li>
      <li>The color is great; I wish it could be slightly more brownish, though much better than most self tanners, which can leave you looking very orange.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with caveats.</li>
      <li>Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, though I think it smells pretty good, and the smell wears off overnight&lt;</li>
      <li>first I loved it...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and have the hardest time getting a good tan that will last.</li>
      <li>Okay this stuff is cheap and it works pretty darn good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like most of the others.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I put coconut oil (or lotion) on my elbows, knees, and around my ankles before applying this product.  Then I let it dry for several minutes before getting dressed.  I apply this at night after a shower and then by morning - I&#x27;m a shade tanner!  It&#x27;s not an orange glow at all - and it&#x27;s not so drastic that someone would think it looks fake.  I&#x27;ve also applied this in the late afternoon and had it effective for a late evening date.</li>
    <li> Natural color. Does not bother skin. Just rub in well</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t find this product in the stores . . . this was a life saver to find it on Amazon!!!  My very favorite self-tanner/moisturizer; I use it year round . . .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time fan of L&#x27;Oreal makeup products, which I&#x27;ve been using for years, so I was optimistic about their self-tanning gel.  Having now tried it, I&#x27;m very sorry to say that it isn&#x27;t up to the high standards of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s makeup.  I only used it on my legs to be safe, figuring I could wear long pants for awhile if it didn&#x27;t work out.  Well, thank goodness I took that precaution because within a few hours my legs were a very mottled dark orange-bronze that kept getting darker and darker.  I&#x27;ll continue to use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s makeup products, but I won&#x27;t be trying their self-tanning gel again anytime soon.  Definitely needs some work!</li>
    <li> Lord help me! This stuff is a mess. It looks good inside, but when I walk outside my legs are Orange. I applied it just like it says. Definitely didn&#x27;t get the color that a lot of people were bragging about.</li>
    <li> Okay this stuff is cheap and it works pretty darn good. i will admit if you use it ALL the time you may get a slightly orange look, but its not as bad as some other self tanners that make you look wicked orange. anyways, this stuff is pretty easy to apply, it goes on clear, but i have never gotten any streaks, even when i do my own back. it dries pretty quickly, and then i cam dress. i have never gotten a bad tan out of this stuff, always looks good :) you just cant beat it. i remember a few summers ago i bought this and i went back to the store i bought it at and they only had lotion! NOOO! i went to every store looking for the gel! i eventually found it, thank goodness! i would have been kicking myself if i couldnt get any! this stuff is worth a try :) im pretty light skinned, and i go for the medium-deep. one time is usually good for me, then i will use it again in a week( sometimes less, depends how dark i want to be).    after i posted this at amazon i noticed that it says something odd above my review, it says that my review was form their site or soemthing? i just want you to know that i posted this here at amazon.</li>
    <li> I stopped using self tanners a couple of years ago because I was tired of all the trouble you have to go through, and then usually end up with streaks or looking incredibly orange. A friend of mine recommended this after I commented on her natural looking tan. I use it 1 to 2 times a week and it really does work pretty well. The \\&quot;gelee\\&quot; form goes on easily and absorbs within minutes. It feels slightly greasy when I apply it to my face, but it did eventually absorb and so far no breakouts. The color is great; I wish it could be slightly more brownish, though much better than most self tanners, which can leave you looking very orange. My boyfriend said I look \\&quot;bronzed\\&quot;. I haven&#x27;t had any streaking or patches whatsoever, however I do blend it in very well, applying shortly after showering (exfoliating while in the shower), and I wash my hands thoroughly after use. I then gently pat the back of my hands against my thighs and rub my hands together a bit. I don&#x27;t apply lotion to typical problem spots (knees, elbows, feet, etc.) prior to applying, however I do take a dry washcloth and rub these areas afterwards to remove some of the product. This seems to work fine. It does have a light odor, which I&#x27;m not too crazy about, that lingers for several hours after applying, but I&#x27;ve yet to find a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t. I will continue to use this product since it&#x27;s easy to use and the price is right. I would recommend giving it a shot. Good luck :)</li>
    <li> I am very pale and was skeptical about using self tanner i have gotten spray tans and gone tanning in beds 100&#x27;s of times i would get the monthly membership to sunset tan and have done the spray tan there this works just as good only tired this because u no how pricey it gets but its so worth it i used it all year round i would just get out of the shower and use this as my lotion i just slapped it on i didn&#x27;t even put it only whole body sometimes if i was running out. I LOVE THIS STUFF! trust  me i have tried the self spray tan that u do at home the lotion the wipes EVERYTHING this is the best i love love love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this self tanner for about 3 or 4 yrs now, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to buy anything else. I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena, Coppertone and a few very expensive brands and none of them have a color that&#x27;s as good as this one is. I&#x27;ve tried the deep color, and that&#x27;s too deep. The medium comes out too unnatural, and this one is perfect.    I have relatively dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. I put this on sparingly, wait about 10 min, put a small amount of Cetaphil on, wait and then dress. Then I can moisturize as normal later.    To the reviewer with the irritation from the tanner, I think it is more a condition relating to your skin, not the product. You might want to put a little less on at a time, and use a little moisturizer soon after applying.</li>
    <li> Does not deliver the awesome results gotten from the sunless L&#x27;Oreal lotion. Some rusty spots and streaking. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  I can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores anymore so I&#x27;m happy to purchase it through Amazon.  If you use it as directed, you get a beautiful even tan.</li>
    <li> This tanning gelee works as fast as it says it does: two days and you can go from being see-through like me to having a beautiful tan. The only problem is the upkeep and if it is not rubbed in completely (i.e. around ankles, under arms, between toes,etc.) it dries up and looks flaky. It in fact will flake off too.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m not the type of person to write reviews. So, the fact that I&#x27;m writing this really says something about this product! I&#x27;m fair skinned and have the hardest time getting a good tan that will last. I get some color but nothing special. Sadly, a few months ago I started going to the tanning bed with a friend. Not only was it a waste of my money...but after looking at things on skin cancer I decided to stop. Still wanting to be tan, I saw a review for this product and decided to try it.     When I first tried it I did NOT follow the directions at all...I didn&#x27;t do it after a shower and did not exfoliate at all. I also did it at night and must not of let it fully dry considering the brownish/tan colored spots I now have on my sheets. In the morning the color was NOT even at all. However, this wasn&#x27;t the products fault, it was mine. Basically, you need to follow the directions.    With that being said, about two days later I followed the directions, exfoliating and then applying after the shower. I&#x27;m so happy with the results. It looks so natural! Just make sure you rub it in really well and wash you hands! I saw a friend today I haven&#x27;t seen in two years and one of the first things they said to me was that I looked tan! :) Seriously, this stuff is good for that instant tan glow. JUST MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!</li>
    <li> this is for the very pale.  I have a light to medium complexion.  figuring I would use this lotion 2 - 3 times a week it would add layers, becoming an even medium tan where the sun does not reach on a daily basis.    Application is very easy. I am an aesthetican and am used to using Sun Labs at work with gloves.  Sun Labs is considered the best \\&quot;professional\\&quot; brand.  However, you need gloves and experience in applying.  Don&#x27;t worry about streaks, let it dry, then shower.    L&#x27;Oreal Sublime lotion is great for at-home use: easy to apply, no streaks and quick drying.  The only set-back not mentioned in any of the reviews I read is that it gives your skin a cheesy, golden-glittery coating:(  I&#x27;m more metallic than tan!    While I have not tried it myself, I recommend the Deep lotion if you want to look tan.  The disco-queen look is up to the user.</li>
    <li> The best.  Takes a while to dry, though.  No streaks when applied properly.  Its perfume is a little manly, but fine.  Washes easily out of clothes and linens.  Even my white shorts without bleach.</li>
    <li> I am very pale and after two days of using this stuff I look like I have been tanning for weeks. I apply a gradual tanner (Lotion with a little bit of tanner in it) that I bought fron a drug store and I re apply the Sublime Bronze gelee every 3-4 days. It is comparable to  [[ASIN:B00025H3JY Clarins Self Tanning Instant Gel, 4.4-Ounce Box]] but is less than half the price. A bottle lasts about a month.</li>
    <li> I love this tanner. I use the scrub, and also the mosturizer. I dont know why people say its a waste cuz it doesnt stick or leave streak marks. I would say the darker you are naturally, the better it works. Im glad I can buy it off here for cheaper because it goes for $10+ in department stores.</li>
    <li> Love,love,love this stuff!  I have NEVER found a self-tanner that produced such a natural looking tan.  The gel makes it easy to apply without running or streaking.  I use it about 3 times a week to keep the same level of colour.  No perfume or medicine smell.  Just light clean fragance that my asthma easily tolerates.  Usually dries within 30 after application that I perform at night.  Waking up with a \\&quot;sun kissed\\&quot; look is esp. nice.  Even better, no need to apply makeup base. Saves some money that way and price on Amazon is over 2 dollars cheaper than grocery store. Have gifted it to co-worker and will include it in gift box to another friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the natural, sun-kissed look!</li>
    <li> Best self tanner I have used.  I even mix it with lotion and it still doesnt leave streaks.  Looks great.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and I liked the way it looked. It only took a few hours to start seeing results. However, be very careful with how it gets on your hands.  I ended up with tanning mom hands because I failed to wash the product off the palms of my hands. I&#x27;d recommend wearing some type of gloves while applying the product. Also, make sure it is thoroughly and evenly rubbed in or you will have streaking or spots.</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave white spots when it wears off.  I normally apply it 3 times within a 2 hour period and I&#x27;m able to get a really nice even tan that lasts nearly 2 weeks. As with most self-tanning gels, you need to rub it in really well or you&#x27;ll get streaks.  You may also get red bumps if you apply it immediately after shaving. The product is sticky and smells like self-tanner so I would recommend you jumping in the shower before going out.  Overall, the end results are well-worth it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. Being a former, HEAVY tanner, I can say this gives absolutely awesome results. I actually apply at night time after I use regular lotion (Aveeno is my favorite!). The smell can be a bit iffy, but def. not as horrible as Jergens or other products. I use it about twice a week. I even use it on my face and LOVE the results. Use lightly on knees/elbows, you know the drill. Don&#x27;t over-use, this may cause a weird color. I have had friends tell me how much better I look than when I was fake-baking. A much healthier, CHEAPER alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to ANYONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t streak at all. IDK how people have this complaint. They must be gobbing it on.&lt;br /&gt;Dries quick, but not so fast that you can&#x27;t control what you&#x27;re putting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LoVe lOvE lOVE it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and dare say I swear by it now! I found it last year when I decided to try out the sunless approach again, after giving up on it years before due to some \\&quot;deep\\&quot; tanners at the drug store making me look like a streaky, orange fraggle. I am half Sicilian and tan a nice bronze in the summer... buuut I&#x27;m getting older and wiser, and I know I should be minimizing my sun bathing if not cutting it out completely. Because of my natural turn-out via sun, I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with products that give a \\&quot;light healthy glow\\&quot;. Just not enough.  I went to the store and bought a spray this last spring and passed on this one because of the price. That spray was ok but not noticeable enough or long-lasting enough so when I went back after it ran out, I took the plunge and spent 8 bucks and some change on this tube of gel in \\&quot;Medium-Natural\\&quot;. I&#x27;m glad I did because even though it didn&#x27;t give me the deep medium tan I get naturally after bathing all summer, it gave me a very nice close to medium bronzed color that blew me away considering how pasty I was at that time from staying mostly indoors the last couple years. It was never orange or unnatural looking (it did look more amberish on my pasty white legs when I did a double application one night but even that wasn&#x27;t noticeably fake or orange looking) and lasted a good 4-5 days before I had to reapply. On my face, 3 days because I have an oily complexion and also scrub it good in the shower, but I could make that last just as long by using a gradual tanner between applications. Most stuff I&#x27;ve tried came up a couple days shorter than that.  The fading was even (but that owes more to exfoliation), and it didn&#x27;t make me break out from heaviness even though it did feel a bit tacky drying. This develops a more bronze shade with slight yellowish undertones as opposed to orange-ish and mimics my natural tan tone well. I had many co-workers commenting on how tan I was and ask if I&#x27;d been visiting a tanning salon over the weekend. (funny how they assumed I was baking in a bed as opposed to faking) Even my mom who knew I was asked me what I was using as it looked a more believable light brown! This was outside in natural light too. Major plus! Even when I gave in and frolicked around at the lake the last half of summer, this product gave me so much more depth to what I already had that I looked like I&#x27;d been outdoors a lot more than I actually was, and because my legs always end up a couple shades lighter than the rest of me, I could use this to \\&quot;match\\&quot; them perfectly. (I don&#x27;t recommend that though. Sun is damaging, causes aging, bad for scars, doesn&#x27;t hide stretch marks, and can make them all worse)  I highly recommend this self tanner if you&#x27;re experienced enough to ditch the \\&quot;light glow\\&quot; products and want something more noticeable. The results are satisfying and it lasts longer than a lot of products out there. Very worth the price. Just don&#x27;t use your bare hands. I bought a cheap pair of purple dish washing gloves with roll-up cuffs and they blend it much better anyway, though this gel is easy to blend as it is. Worth the money. I will be buying this for a good while until I work up the guts to play with airbrush solution.</li>
    <li> I bought this tanner a few months ago. Decent price, and I read a few reviews saying they liked it.&lt;br /&gt;At first I loved it... Nice color, easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butttttt.... after about a week, I noticed the inside of my arms became pale. It was like a big diamond patch. So I applied more all over and especially in that spot, the next day everywhere else was dark EXCEPT that spot! no matter how much I put on, it wouldn&#x27;t hold the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews where they didn&#x27;t like it, and they all said because of the same patch, and some on the back of the kneed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said its a nice color and easy to apply, but pale inside arms just doesn&#x27;t sound attractive to me.</li>
    <li> This is a great little devise it does its job. Warm my milk in the morning froth it and add my coffee. Voilà.</li>
    <li> Nice stuff!  I read a lot of reviews of self-tanners, and chose this one because it sounded like the best, and is very affordable.  it really IS easy to use.  I seem to have a knack for applying it, or else it&#x27;s just really easy.  I am NOT an experienced self-tanner.  So, I followed some advice about applying moisturizer first, just to the areas you DON&#x27;T want to take up the tanner as much (like elbows, knees, ankles and dry skin over the achilles tendon) and then, go for it!  It spreads easily, and dries quickly, and I don&#x27;t mind the odor at all.  My skin took it up quickly, as far as the tan goes.  The very next day I thought I looked like I&#x27;d been out in the sun.  It looks very natural, and I don&#x27;t notice lines where I stopped applying the stuff.  For example, I like to put it on my neck, shoulders, upper arms, and chest.  It doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s an obvious line where I didn&#x27;t apply it to my forearms.    The first time I applied it to everything (well, like hands, wrists, feet and toes) I did notice extra tan between fingers and toes, and I think it&#x27;s nearly impossible to apply the stuff to the hands, and then somehow use soap and water to get it OFF your hands, and still end up with natural looking tan on your hands.  Good luck with that.  The best I did was to finish up applying around my wrists, and then, after I was all done, including washing with soap, I rubbed the backs of my hands over my thighs in order to get a little self-tanner there.  That was good, but now that the sun is out and my hands have a little more color, I don&#x27;t bother with the self tanner there anymore.      Have fun!  This is a really nice, easy to use product.  Looks GOOD.  Very natural.  I look good, and my husband hasn&#x27;t noticed I&#x27;ve been getting a tan.  I think that&#x27;s good.  He notices artificial things (like a little make-up).</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve been able to find. I totally recommend it to all skin types. Make sure to put sun screen on though....</li>
    <li> I use it for my recently shaved bald head.  Where I used to have hair, it was white as a sheet.  I put it on in a very light application and spread it evenly.  It does not look exactly like the rest of my head, but it keeps it from looking shockingly white.  Very pleased with the product. The smell is not unpleasant but it is strong.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a pretty good alternative to high cost spraying systems, or visiting a spray tan salon.  It works pretty well with a few caveats.  After the first application I had to wait overnight to see the full effects, and today I&#x27;m on my second application, so I should have the full effect today/tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;+ Bronzes and nourishes the skin (vitamin E enriched)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, though I think it smells pretty good, and the smell wears off overnight&lt;br /&gt;- It bronzes the palm of your hands...  Mine are almost orange, I guess that&#x27;s one of the downsides of applying something by hand.  If I had it to do over again, and next time I apply, I will probably use latex/rubber gloves to apply to my body, then just a light coat on the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with caveats.</li>
    <li> This is horrible. You end up with a splotchy orange dark brown \\&quot;tan\\&quot;. The bottle says Medium Natural Tan \\&quot;quick dry, streak free\\&quot; but this is NOT a gradual or medium tan at all. It&#x27;s way to dark and uneven with just one application.  So I tried a 2nd application.  It just made things worse.  It is splotchy with all kinds of streaks everywhere, I look like I have some sort of skin disorder.  Everyone is asking me if I am sick/ill.  I look like I have a horrendous skin disease.  I tried to get it off with bleach and nothing helps.  It&#x27;s sooo humiliating.  Use another product or something else.  The different brown/black colors on my skin look hideous.  Unbelievable! Never again.  Followed directions and everything, with really bad results.  My best friend looked at me and exclaimed, \\&quot;My gosh, what&#x27;s wrong with your legs?!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Best i have ever tried and i have tried a lot!  Makes me look like i was in the tanning salon--which i dont do anymore for obvious reasons!</li>
    <li> I am not pleased with this product. The most offensive characteristic being the smell. This product has a strong odor like a men&#x27;s shaving product. I also found it to be difficult to apply correctly. I shaved and exfoliated before application and followed the instructions.  I still got streaking and random brown spots on my toes/heels/feet. The tint looks orange, especially on the tops of my feet. I also found the product to be stick after \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It took a few times before I got the feel of how to use this product without getting streaky or blotchy or have it sink into the ankle and knee crevices.  I only need to use on my legs because they&#x27;re the ones that rarely get to see sunlight.    At first, I applied it all over my legs, and getting to my knees and ankles last, but I still had too much product in my hands resulting in dark \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; on knees and ankles.  Mostly my ankle area.  Also, it could have also been because we were just getting out of a very cool spring season that my skin was probably dryer than the humid weather we have now.    Second time I tried it, I was in a hurry and it left a dark streak behind my right calf that took about a week to become barely noticeable.    Now, although I&#x27;m really horrible about the exfoliation process before applying, I apply immediately after I shower while my skin is still moist, and I use a very thin layer making sure I use it on my knees and ankles last, but really it&#x27;s barely anything except what is left over in my hands.    If someone was to take a very good, close look, it&#x27;s not perfect, but for my everyday look, it&#x27;s perfect!!!  :-)</li>
    <li> Just one application, and it was almost perfect...takes a long time to dry thoroughly,&lt;br /&gt;and be careful you don&#x27;t put too much in one area.</li>
    <li> This gel is not the same as the other self-tanning lotion I have used in the past.  It does NOT dry in five minutes, I see NO color change, and the odor remains for hours, even after I tried to wash it off.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this product, even though it&#x27;s hard to find. When applied correctly, this self tanner gives you the most natural bronze glow and it lasts at least a week!! I have gotten the application of this product down to a science so I&#x27;ll share it with you. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re using it to apply to your legs. Squeeze product onto hands and then tackle one part at a time (ie thighs) - rub the product in a circular motion, then up and down, and then around constantly until the product is fully absorbed. You want to make sure that you are rubbing in every direction to the point where it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin. Then do the leg. Once you&#x27;re done, take the little residue that&#x27;s left on your hands and use it on your feet, and make sure to rub every toe as well. Don&#x27;t add product, just use whatever residue you have left on your hands so that there is no streaking and so that you don&#x27;t have extra dark feet (dead giveaway).</li>
    <li> This is my replacement product for the dicontinued Lancome self tanning gel for face and I have to say I&#x27;m VERY satisfied!  It goes on as smooth, only takes a little bit, and offers a bit of a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; even during the drab winter months!  Thank you, L&#x27;Oreal for a great product and at a much more reasonable price than Lancome&#x27;s smaller version!</li>
    <li> The best ever tanning GEL in the world......I have people ask me if I&#x27;ve been to the beach,...lay out all the time,...go to a tanning bed. NONE of the above - I use this ONE and ONLY gelee&#x27; about every 3 days and my skin not only feels revewed and soft and moisturized......it&#x27;s the most natural looking tan without damaging your skin!  YEAR ROUND!</li>
    <li> I love this self-tanner &amp; it&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult to find in stores. It goes on smoothly without looking streaky or orange.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my natural looking tan. I just wish it were a little less expensive on Amazon,  as it&#x27;s a better price when I am able to find it in the store.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this sunless tanner, because it is easy to apply and gives a nice, natural tan.   The problem is that after a couple weeks of use, it sometimes starts to streak if you shave your legs and press harder or lighter in certain sections. Like most sunless tanners, it rubs and sweats off, so be careful where you bend.   I really liked this tanner, but it caused my face to slowly break out in acne after about a week and get worse after a couple weeks (when I stopped using it).  I recommend this product to anyone who does not have sensitive skin.   I am naturally very pale, but when I wore this people at work thought I got a tan from my hour-long walks home.</li>
    <li> Gelee is easier to apply, has pleasant smell, and looks natural.  I bought L&#x27;oreal Tanning Lotion, thinking it was the gelee (it was the ONLY L&#x27;Oreal self-tanner on the shelf).  I thought the &#x27;gelee&#x27; has gone bad as it was very dark, so I returned it.  (The lotion just did not go on as smoothly and it had sparkles in it.)  My fave is their tanning towelettes by far!  I use them alternately with the gelee for cost reasons.</li>
    <li> My husband called me &amp;#34;snake belly white&amp;#34; so I had to do something!  I tried the lotion, but because I am old and have crepey skin, it didn&#x27;t apply smoothly.  The Gelee works perfectly.  Really great!.</li>
    <li> They must have changed the formula, it doesn&#x27;t work like it used to.  Product manufacturers: If it isn&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it, you usually end up wrecking it.</li>
    <li> I have tried alot of other types of bronzers, but this is the best! It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like most of the others.  Most importantly, it looks very natural.  It&#x27;s now my favorite!</li>
    <li> So I just tried this stuff last night and well I really  really like it! I put this on before I went to bed and I  liked the consistency of the product and you don&#x27;t have to use much.It is really easy to rub in and is kinda just like putting lotion on. The smell was not bad at all, it smells pretty good for a self tanner. When its on your skin you can fell it but it wasn&#x27;t bothersome at all it felt a tad sticky but wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. Then I went to sleep and woke up to see how it looked and the color is really nice, not orange at all. And to my surprise I didn&#x27;t smell awful. You could smell the self tanner scent but it was very faint. I didn&#x27;t use that much product just a thin layer and it gave a nice tan, it probably made me like 3 shades darker. I&#x27;m sure if you used a lot of product it will be much darker and the bottle says keep applying until desired color. I did not have streaks or anything either, I don&#x27;t think you should get streaks from this stuff if you rub it in really good. I am fair skinned so probably one more use and it will be the color I want then I will just maintain it.Also I worked out and took a shower and the tan did not come off at all. I will definitely keep buying this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time, after using the Sublime tinted lotion for years.  I hate this gel, it has such a sticky feeling for the first few hours after applying it.  I wish they would make a non-tinted lotion.  For me, the lotion goes on much smoother and dries with very little sticky feeling.  I just don&#x27;t always want the tint, since it sweats off if you work out and gets all over your clothes.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly scented, this self tanner is my new fave! The color lasts for days and so far I have found no streaks. My only gripe is that the gel takes a little longer than other self tanners to dry, but honestly it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner at a great price</li>
    <li> This was given to a good friend who uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> After applying once, I noticed that my face looked a little redder, not really tan.&lt;br /&gt;I tried another application the next day and after 10 minutes, my face was burnt. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, but I definitely had a mild chemical burn.&lt;br /&gt;It did smell nice though!</li>
    <li> This product is just as described.  It works great if you use it as the directions say.  Summer is gone and my legs are still tan.  No pantyhose for me now.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Being one that can not tan this product offers what I need, a nice tan without the smell. It goes on even and does not streak, dries fast and does not have have that heavy sunless tanner smell. I would recommend this to anyone who isn&#x27;t able to tan. I am very light skinned and I love the glow this gives me and even use it on my face!</li>
    <li> Works nicely , scent pleasing, important to use skin defoliate before use</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it. It leaves streaks and goes on unevenly. Then you can&#x27;t remove the streaks. I&#x27;m going to see if I can sell it.</li>
    <li> BAsed on the great reviews I purchase this product . It comes out clear and to my surprise did not feel like gelee and was not sticky, it also developed an ok tan over night, very light, definitely buildable. I therefor did give it 3 stars, but the smell, omg, it will overpower anything else you are wearing . It did was off in the shower, but as it is a buildable tan I can not stand to smell like this. It says it is some fresh citrus scent, when indeed for me and those around me referred to it as smell of a mans lotion, kind of like the vaseline products for men. Which I love to smell but not on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would say give it a try if you find it at a good price, if the smell is ok for you , this is a good gradual tanner</li>
    <li> I like this because it doesn&#x27;t get on my clothing, dries fast, goes on easily and barely has any scent.  I love the look of the more sparkly ones that are tinted, but can&#x27;t deal with the way they get on my clothes.  Very practical and good for regular use.</li>
    <li> On a recent trip I forgot my usual tanning lotion so in a pinch borrowed my mom&#x27;s L&#x27;Oreal Sumblime Bronze gelee. I had stayed away from it for fear it would be like N&#x27;trogena&#x27;s oompa loompa-inducing Build a Tan, but now I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gelee goes on like a baby oil (without the greasy heaviness) and leaves your skin feeling powdery soft. It has a pleasant fragrance and the natural,sun-kissed color developed within the hour. I feel bad for other reviewers who turned orange (always horrifying...), but my color was completely un-carroty and believable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being fair skinned and genetically vulnerable to skin cancer, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of self tanners over the years; the L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze Gelee is my new favorite. I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The fabulous, natural sun-kissed color; the fresh scent; the way it leaves your skin feeling so soft.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It seems to be getting harder to find in store; it seems to take a little longer to dry than some lotions.</li>
    <li> I like fake tanning my legs in the summer, especially before going on vacation. My husband always think it looks strange, but I thought the results with this brand were pretty good.  I try to apply it carefully but I can never make it look right around the ankles. The thing about it, other than the nasty smell, was that it was really watery. It could barely be called a gel. Still, worth a try at this price point.  I don&#x27;t believe the expensive brands work any better.</li>
    <li> This is a great self tanner. I&#x27;ve been using it since mystic tan stopped making their lotion. I see it&#x27;s available for like 30 bucks on here?! You can get this at cvs, rite aid or Walgreens for 11 bucks</li>
    <li> This product is very good! I can&#x27;t find it at the store anymore and am wondering why. It works 100 times better than lotion does. i look tan after 2 applicaitons.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as the Kiehls product it was meant to replace.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell,  but it works great.</li>
    <li> Lóreal Sublime Bronze is a very good product for people that can´t take sun... the color in our skin is very natural... so I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have VERY VERY white glow in the dark legs.  This product works great. I read lots of reviews on other self tanners but this one was rated high and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed either. I&#x27;ve users other self tanners too and always ended up with a line, streak or a very dark area.  Not with this Gelee.  Remember to get the Gelee!  That is the important part.</li>
    <li> I use this self_tanning Gel several years. It&#x27;s hard to get it on the market lately, This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> This product is awful! It took several applications to produce desired color, the color faded within a day or two, and multiple applications led to tight itchy skin for days. A far superior product is Loreal&#x27;s clear spray on tanner which is also being sold on Amazon (though harder to find in stores).</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Unlike the instant action sublime, this doesn&#x27;t have any glitter in it, also lasts a lot longer.  This one doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why L&#x27;Oreal discontinued this version and added sparkles to their new product with the same name. I&#x27;m too old to look like a stripper. Does anyone really want sparkly legs anyway?</li>
    <li> This sunless tanner works great. I get really pale in the winter and don&#x27;t want to use the tanning bed anymore so I gave this a try because jessie james decker suggested it to her fans. I put it on at night after exfoliating in the shower and woke up looking like a weeks worth of tanning in a tanning bed. Not orange either. I had no streaky problems except around my forearms and wrists so I suggest use it sparingly around your wrists.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since June. I have tried 3 other products and was not happy with the look longterm.&lt;br /&gt;I get many compliments on the color of this product as many people have said I must be having a wonderful summer as my skin looks so tanned. I put it on 2x a week full body. I just use what is leftover on my hands to apply to my face as I did find if you are of a more mature age it did darken some up and coming age spots I didn&#x27;t know I had. I just stopped using as much on my face and it is fine now.&lt;br /&gt;This product looks great under office flourescent lighting but I have noticed it can glow a bit orange in direct sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am starting to wear socks/shoes the odd time, I&#x27;m noticing it rubbing off of my feet so that would be noticable if suddenly you found yourself shoeless.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it colors your hands or gel nails like some of the other products did. Just make sure to wash with soap and water directly after applying.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this info helps. I will continue to use it and I was a diehard sunbed tanner for 7 years.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage.  Very little odor and it stays on for approximately a week.  Definitely would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
