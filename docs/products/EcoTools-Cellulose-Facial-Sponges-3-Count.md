      <li>Easy way to clean my face every morning and night.  </li>

      <li>sponges are soft and kind to facial skin, without any sense of abrasive or rough material, as they are cellulose, and not synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Additionally, you should not use a sponge like this on your face more than a few weeks before replacing it with a new one.</li>
      <li>and you can feel how they clear up your skin pores.</li>
      <li>I pack a few when I travel, even though one lasts quite a while, through a number of uses, while retaining the original unused quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a little small, but then that&#x27;s good to hold</li>
      <li>I really hoped they would be big enough and expand to thicker than they do, but they are truly for the face, not for the shower as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>Consistent, proper use of this product will contribute to that &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; complexion that you know pursuing in the long run....</li>

    <li> I ordered the sponges for my night time face cleansing ritual and they work beautifully! They remove the dirt/oil from throughout the day and slightly exfoliate as well.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges for taking off my pumpkin peel and masks. I used to be able to find them at Target but I have not seen them recently. So glad I found them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I like the small size and recommend it to all my friends especially the ones that use facial cleaner on their face.</li>
    <li> Good cleansing sponges are not always easy to find. I&#x27;ve been looking for them for a while. Nicer to skin than a &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34;.  Received very quickly.</li>
    <li> cleans very deep and lasts long. love it. they are not slippery on your skin and you can feel how they clear up your skin pores.</li>
    <li> Product is Ecotools, quality is good. Product is not as advertised, because only 3 were sent when 6 were ordered. Beware of this, otherwise go ecotools!</li>
    <li> I have purchased these EcoTools sponges for the past few years and have found that I absolutely HAVE to have them - everywhere. I pack a few when I travel, even though one lasts quite a while, through a number of uses, while retaining the original unused quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are soft and kind to facial skin, without any sense of abrasive or rough material, as they are cellulose, and not synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are ideal for makeup removal, including eye makeup removal, around the tender skin surrounding the eyes, as well as on the eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but praise for these sponges, and am so delighted to find them here on Amazon when I could no longer find them in any retail stores where I routinely previously purchase them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several years. The best product I&#x27;ve found for cleaning my face.</li>
    <li> Nice sponges great for cleaning the face...it&#x27;s a little small, but then that&#x27;s good to hold n clean my face without damaging my skin. No odor or smell at all, as some sponges have very rubbery odors. Last very long time.</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the review they got well sorry but these sponges are like dish wash sponges HATE THEM!</li>
    <li> Easy way to clean my face every morning and night.  I have used these for years but could NOT find them anywhere except Slovakia.  I now have this company and I am happy, happy, happy!  Dries fast.  Not too big and not too small.  Perfect size!</li>
    <li> I love those facial sponges.  Great buy and very good quality.</li>
    <li> Love this product but i thought there were 6 per package...</li>
    <li> What a joke...these are so small and from the picture I assumed I was getting 6...;..not loofa.</li>
    <li> I got these because I wanted something that would add a bit of manual exfoliation when I washed my face and I didn&#x27;t want to use a wash rag. I always make sure to remove my makeup first because dirt + sponge &#x3D; bacteria. You don&#x27;t want that on your face. I remove my make up with oil, rinse it off, and then cleanse with these and my cleanser. They work great! As a make up artist and skin care nut, I have to add that you should always make sure to thoroughly rinse the sponge after each use with hot water to avoid bacteria build up. Additionally, you should not use a sponge like this on your face more than a few weeks before replacing it with a new one. These are disposable sponges. Not wash-your-face-until-they-fall-apart sponges. Dig?</li>
    <li> I love these. I hate using a big soggy wash cloth! I</li>
    <li> I really hoped they would be big enough and expand to thicker than they do, but they are truly for the face, not for the shower as I had hoped.  I will, however, keep them for face cleaning as they said they were.  Hey, made a mistake, oh well!</li>
    <li> Great sponges and good find on Amazon, but this picture is misleading.  The order only comes with a package of three, not the six shown.  Beware.</li>
    <li> FINALLY a facial loofah that actually works without being too harsh on the skin.  Does a perfect job at what it was designed to do- gently remove dead skin cells/residue.  Consistent, proper use of this product will contribute to that &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; complexion that you know pursuing in the long run....</li>
    <li> I do love these but was shocked to find them at ULTA for $1 :(&lt;br /&gt;They feel so good onmy face and excatly what they use for facials at the spa !</li>
    <li> These are the best facial cleansing sponges on the market.  The size is more then adequate, they hold up to sterilizing and rinse out well.</li>
    <li> These are great. Nice n soft yet does their job. Id buy again</li>
