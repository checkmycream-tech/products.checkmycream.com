    <li> Edit: the seller of this product contacted me after my review with an offer for a full refund.  I find that both extremely generous and unnecessary, but shows a real dedication to customer satisfaction.  Knowing that this company reads reviews, and cares about their consumer&#x27;s experience with the product, is really quite impressive and noteworthy.  If you&#x27;re considering this serum, know that you&#x27;re going to get great service should you have any issues.    Original review:  I cannot use this product - it caused a severe breakout.  Vitamin C is an important part of an antiaging skin care routine, and the price for this is average so if it works for your skin, great! I found this product a bit sticky and it left a tacky film on my face.  I have since changed brands and the new serum also feels tacky, so that may just be the norm for vit c products.  But my new serum does not cause irritation or breakout, so I will be sticking with it.</li>
    <li> Loved the Vitamin C product!!  It&#x27;s priced so well, I don&#x27;t have to skimp on using it!!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am 86 years old and have used every product on the market from very expensive to drugstore cheapies. Nothing has made my skin as smooth and as young looking as this product..

I love Vitamin C Serums in Generals because they really seem to help my skin to look Younger and Supple! The price point for this product is so terrific as well and it really tightens my skin up as well aided and removed a few blemishes! I can NOT tell you enough about How fantastic this product works. I usually wash my face with a cream cleanser, then apply this awesome Serum and after that my day cream and in the eve my night atop! I am certain that this Particular Vitamin C Serum is superior than the Most out there as its 20% Vitamin C. My last Serum was only 5% and then 10%. This is the HIGHEST dose I have ever seen! This was the BEST gift ever. I can not stress to you enough how amazing of a product this is!</li>
    <li> Loved the product.  Makes my skin feel soft without the itching or burning.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I Would recommend this product to many many others . I have been using The Vitamin C Serum line on my face at night for the past 8 months and i can honestly say this stuff is amazing . My brown spots/sun damage have been demising . Im 36 and we all know that Elasticity leaves us after a while so this is also amazing for that. Friends and Family have noticed a difference and thats HUGE!!I Do understand there are lots of skin line products out there but this is a must TRY. Cant wait to tell you about the Retinol Repair Serum :)</li>
    <li> I got this Vitamin C serum as a gift and i absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;Having always had problems with an uneven skin tone, and trying lots of different and also expensive skin care products, i was exited to notice a major improvement after as little as 3 weeks. My skin tone is much brighter and the longer i use this product, the more even it becomes. It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, which has been a big problem in other products i tried.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy as i look years younger and people have complimented me on my fresh looks and beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> I have used many products and this is the best one yet. I saw a difference in sun damaged areas. My skin looks and feels firmer and brighter. Love this product and at the perfect price point it&#x27;s affordable compared to many other brands that are on the market.</li>
    <li> I have used C serums for 12 years, spent $100 on average for those products in the past.  I ordered Marquee C Serum for myself and my Sister, We Love this product!!!  As good or better as the $100.00 products. My skin feels Firm, Fabulous and Glowing.  Awesome for Birthday or Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> After having used the Retinol Serum for a while, that totally cleared up all my pimples, i was curious to try the Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after applying it, my face felt fresh and dewy, which was such a nice relief for my dried out winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now after using it for a bit more than two months my skin looks more bright, youthful and plump. Even fine lines have disappeared and my skin is never dry anymore. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free and leaves no residue on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Even my boyfriend commented and said i look so fresh lately and that i am glowing!

They made a huge positive change in my life and i can only recomend it to everybody, who is looking for perfect skin even though they have a low budget.</li>
    <li> When it comes to my skin, I am very low maintenance, if it&#x27;s too involved, I won&#x27;t use it, if it&#x27;s too smelly, I won&#x27;t used it, but that&#x27;s what I love about these products is that they aren&#x27;t any of those things. Quick and easy and they work well. I hate products that leave your skin feeling greasy or oily or leave any kind of residue feeling, but I don&#x27;t experience that with this. My skin just feels moisturized and fresh. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes it : )&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of the Vitamin C products earlier for my wife. She tried it, likes it, and says it&#x27;s as good as a similar product she was using before that cost her over 70 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;And I love Amazon. I&#x27;m new to it, but it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift again to a friend, she absolutely loves it!  It&#x27;s helping to rejuvenate her face and make it appear more&lt;br /&gt;youthful.</li>
    <li> i got this vitamin c serum as a present, and i absolutely love it.  The texture is very light and i love the fact that it has no perfum.  It made my skintone more even and my facial skin looks overall more healthy and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I can only recommend it to everybody!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this serum to anyone. As a young woman, I try and stay on top of my skin so that, I only have to maintain as I get older and I have tried many different creams and lotions. My mom who uses Marquee told me about this and I have loved the results. I noticed just a couple of days after starting the serum that my skin looked smoother and fuller. My lines reduced and even old scars that I have had forever have faded. I love this Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> polishes without tightening. And three people said I was glowing...</li>
    <li> I love the serum,&lt;br /&gt;it changed my skin to the better after just a few days! I would recommand it to anyone!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love Love this Serum!! I got this and the retinol face serum as a gift  2 months ago.. they seem to compliment each other... I ordered myself more based on my results.. it&#x27;s not greasy and my skin feels and looks so much smoother... I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I got this fabulous Vitamin C Serum as a present from one of the owners of the company.&lt;br /&gt;After trying so many different skincare products over the years, and never really being satisfied, i finally found product i am really happy about.

    <li> I&#x27;d just like to say that I received this for my birthday about a month ago and have seen MAJOR results in that time. I&#x27;ve used countless brightening products in attempts to make my skin look radiant and scar removal serums to lighten my spots. None have done the job that the Marquee Vitamin C Facial Serum has! Most of my scars have lifted, which has been a point of much import for me ever since I was a teenager. If you&#x27;re reading this, know you&#x27;re in good hands when you put your trust in Marquee! Thank you, Marquee!</li>
