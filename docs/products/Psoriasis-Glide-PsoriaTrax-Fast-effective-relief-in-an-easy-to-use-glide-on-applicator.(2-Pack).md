      <li>/&gt;I was fortunate to receive this product at a promotional cost in exchange for my HONEST &amp; UNBIASED opinion.</li>
      <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to apply the product with my hands.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>When I opened it there was some on the side of the applicator and the top was bubbly looking.  </li>
      <li>it smells more like a tire store or how your hands smell after holding or touching a tire.</li>
      <li>it glides on nice and smooth like deodorant kinda.</li>
      <li>you are well aware of the fact that most of the stuff does NOT smell good.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;I will NOT be without this wonderful product long, though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I am spot free at the moment thanks to this great stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received my product at a reduced rate to test in my home</li>
      <li>He is very particular about looking good.</li>
      <li>what makes this PsoriaTrax so great, is it a no mess application!</li>
      <li>I did receive this complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>The feel glides on easily</li>
      <li>It comes in stick, so it&#x27;s easy to take with you.</li>
      <li>Once applied the smell is not as strong, but it still exists.  </li>

      <li>This product is great for relieving the itching related with psoraisis, but its too pricey for the amount of product</li>
      <li>He has loved it so far and said there is no greasy feeling to it and that it absorbs nicely and gives him a fast relief to his itches.</li>
      <li>Application was super easy.</li>
      <li>Over all this is a nice product and we highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This is great for those areas of really dry itchy skin that just wont ever go away or stop itching.</li>
      <li>so I use baby wipes to clean my hands and then wash them in about thirty minutes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and glides right onto his legs.  </li>
      <li>She has not complained any more about her arms itching.  </li>
      <li>Psoriasis Glide was the first relief I&#x27;ve found for my Psoriasis!</li>
      <li>As with most psoriasis treatments and even some eczema treatments, be careful inthe sun because the gel can make you more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
      <li>He tried it out right after it arrived.</li>
      <li>Nothing I have ever used previously has ever done ANY good on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful that I don&#x27;t have to get my fingers all messy applying anything to the back of my neck where I have a spot of eczema.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth gel and it instantly soothed my skin.</li>
      <li>I am completely baffled at how quickly this worked for me I seen results within hours!</li>
      <li>I just glide it over the area and it literally takes the itch away pretty instantly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then I rub it in because it spreads pretty well.  </li>
      <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve tried this type of treatment for my skin problem.</li>
      <li>First of all out of the box.</li>
      <li>After having this yucky skin disorder for many years,I have finally found a product that does help my Psoriasis.</li>
      <li>love how it dispenses with out getting my hands messy and it is a good size quantity of product that will last a while.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I can carry right in my purse in case he  wants to use it.  </li>
      <li>When I touch it it is softer and the redness is pretty much gone.  </li>
      <li>Within a week of using it, her arms were pretty much cleared up.  </li>
      <li>That just seems to dry it out more and make it redder.  </li>
      <li>We did notice a bit of a smell, but it wasn&#x27;t too awfully strong and wasn&#x27;t really noticeable once he had his shirt back on.</li>
      <li>and it has already started to smooth the red scaly skin on my knuckles.  </li>
      <li>I really doubt you will believe me until you try the Psoriasis Glide from PsoriaTrax</li>
      <li>and it is really bothers her.</li>
      <li>It does burn a bit when initially applying, but that sensation fades after seconds and honestly feels like it heals the skin almost instantly.  </li>
      <li>I have psoriasis near my elbow on my right arm.  </li>
      <li>I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative.</li>
      <li>Definitely very useful if you have severe dry and cracking skin as it does not burn the way lotions do.</li>
      <li>I was very excited when I was offered a discount coupon to try this product at a slightly lower price if I reviewed the product.  </li>
      <li>I highly suggest this to take some of the discomfort away from you.</li>
      <li>Since we live in Alabama it is currently muggy most days and warm.  </li>
      <li>Since using his legs are looking a little better.  </li>
      <li>and you can smell the tires from the front door, but it&#x27;s not as strong as in the back of the store in the middle of all the tire racks.  </li>
      <li>I got it for my guy who is very sensitive about his psoriasis and doesn&#x27;t like people to know about it.</li>
      <li>I know when you first see it you think oh its smaller than I thought.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s virtually mess free.</li>
      <li>My dad, his dad, and my uncle all had psoriasis with the white scaly large patches on their elbows and knees.  </li>
      <li>and he thinks the spots on his chest are almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>Thankfully I don&#x27;t have to use this near my face.  </li>
      <li>Since first using the product I have continued to use it on an almost daily basis and the skin on my hand is ALMOST back to normal.  </li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t smell any weird smells with this glide either which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>It worked really well and cleared up my psoriasis much faster than any of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Coal tar has helped my skin to clear up fast,even when no other products have even touched</li>
      <li>I do not have Psoriasis or any major skin problems; however I do have sensitive skin and my skin tends to get a bit itchy from time to time which is why I got this glide.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use other tar products and was hoping this was less messy. Its still gooey. They all smell bad,so no biggie. This has a lower % of tar than other similar products and is more expensive</li>
    <li> My skin is so annoyingly dry and unfortunately I suffer from a few skin conditions that leave my skin in horrible condition. This is a lot smaller in person that what it appears in the photo. But that is a good thing for me because I can take it with me to work or anywhere. It does offer fast effective relief. I love that I don&#x27;t have to apply the product with my hands. I can just roll it on the affected areas and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> This is great for those areas of really dry itchy skin that just wont ever go away or stop itching. Psoriasis Glide works great.. it glides on nice and smooth like deodorant kinda. the smell isn&#x27;t too bad but I usually only apply it at night unless the itch is just unbearable. I was happy to receive this at a lower rate to give my honest opinion in a review. I will recommend it to others as well.</li>
    <li> very small but easy for golf course</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of how this feels but I will say that I am amazed by the results and for that I really could care less about anything else. I am completely baffled at how quickly this worked for me I seen results within hours!</li>
    <li> I have been fighting psoriasis for a few years now, and have never tried a product with Coal Tar in it until now.  It does burn a bit when initially applying, but that sensation fades after seconds and honestly feels like it heals the skin almost instantly.  Since first using the product I have continued to use it on an almost daily basis and the skin on my hand is ALMOST back to normal.  I look forward to seeing additional benefits of this product over continued use.</li>
    <li> I was able to purchase Psoriasis Glide at a reduced price for my husband to test and review. He has Psoriasis and we have trouble finding things that work. He tried it out right after it arrived. We did notice a bit of a smell, but it wasn&#x27;t too awfully strong and wasn&#x27;t really noticeable once he had his shirt back on. Application was super easy. When I read coal tar I imagined it would be sticky. At the end of the day I asked him what he thought and he said he liked it. We checked his skin and noticed a reduction in redness. With more time we&#x27;re hoping to see continued results! Over all this is a nice product and we highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Psoriasis Glide was the first relief I&#x27;ve found for my Psoriasis!</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis near my elbow on my right arm.  Sadly it is not in a good place to get a photo.  Since we live in Alabama it is currently muggy most days and warm.  That just seems to dry it out more and make it redder.  I was very excited when I was offered a discount coupon to try this product at a slightly lower price if I reviewed the product.  First of all out of the box. Its a good sized product.  I know when you first see it you think oh its smaller than I thought. But you don&#x27;t need a lot.  The word glide is perfect for this product because it literally does just glide right on.  Initially I was not convinced but in a couple of days my psoriasis is barely even noticeable and my friend who didn&#x27;t know where it was couldn&#x27;t find it. When I touch it it is softer and the redness is pretty much gone.  Tonight I had to look to find what was there.  I highly suggest this to take some of the discomfort away from you.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I really doubt you will believe me until you try the Psoriasis Glide from PsoriaTrax yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because it said it was for Psoriasis. I didn&#x27;t realize until I received it that it is not only for Psoriasis but it is also for Eczema &amp; Seborrheic Dermatitis. I have all three of these skin conditions and have found products that help but none that work as well as the Psoriasis Glide. It does smell like tar or to me it smells more like a tire store or how your hands smell after holding or touching a tire. In the past I would have said that I don&#x27;t like the product because of the smell but WAIT! listen to me THIS STUFF WORKS! It really works and at this point, I don&#x27;t mind the slight smell because I-T-W-O-R-K-S!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spread it on my flaky forehead &amp; eyebrows. By the NEXT DAY! I could see a definite difference. I spread it on the red &amp;#34;rash-like&amp;#34; stuff on the back of my neck. By the NEXT DAY! I it was almost gone. I then spread it on bumps that I get all over my body. These bumps are like skin tags but they hold close to my skin instead of hanging. Within TWO DAYS! I could see a remarkable difference! Nothing I have ever used previously has ever done ANY good on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that by now, if I had continued to use it, I could say these problems were all gone... but alas I can&#x27;t. WHY? lol because I was using it one night before I went to sleep. I thought I had put it on my nightstand but the next morning when I awoke it wasn&#x27;t there. When I turned off my electric blanket and made my bed, I found it wrapped up in the bedding. Notice I said... electric blanket.... yes, you guessed it, I had accidentally melted everything in the container. The strange thing is that I haven&#x27;t found any evidence of an oily mark or wet mark or anything on my sheets or blanket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT be without this wonderful product long, though. I have reordered it and another container is on it&#x27;s way. In my opinion, that isthe best recommendation that can be given for a product. It is so good and works so well and is so easy to use that I don&#x27;t want to be without it. I will be sure to order more before I run out of this one. I will NOT be using it in my heated bed again, though. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate to receive this product at a promotional cost in exchange for my HONEST &amp; UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion</li>
    <li> After having this yucky skin disorder for many years,I have finally found a product that does help my Psoriasis.

    <li> Works as stated.  It stops all flaking and hasn&#x27;t stained anything!  Wish it came in larger quantity(ozs.) but it works well!</li>
    <li> I do not have Psoriasis or any major skin problems; however I do have sensitive skin and my skin tends to get a bit itchy from time to time which is why I got this glide. I am very happy that I did because when I start to feel like I&#x27;m having a sensitivity issue I just glide it over the area and it literally takes the itch away pretty instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that you don&#x27;t have to actually rub anything in with your hands and all you have to do is run it over the area that you&#x27;re having problems with. It makes it less messy and so much easier. I also don&#x27;t smell any weird smells with this glide either which is a good thing. I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> Psoriasis glide on works really good.  My husband has very dry skin on his legs especially in the winter.  It&#x27;s smooth and glides right onto his legs.  It also helps the itch too.  Since using his legs are looking a little better.  It&#x27;s a nice size and I can carry right in my purse in case he  wants to use it.  He will keep using.  I did receive this complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have Psoriasis on my elbows and have used tons of different creams to get it to go away. And many of them do work, but what makes this PsoriaTrax so great, is it a no mess application! It comes in stick, so it&#x27;s easy to take with you. it has an applicator that provides awesome coverage! I was really thrilled to try this product when I was given the opportunity to review it! It worked really well and cleared up my psoriasis much faster than any of the other products I&#x27;ve tried. This is the one!</li>
    <li> My daughter always gets Eczema every winter in the elbow area.  It would get really red and itchy for her, so when the opportunity came about to give Psoriasis Glide a try I jumped on the opportunity to get some for her.  Within a week of using it, her arms were pretty much cleared up.  She has not complained any more about her arms itching.  Thanks for a wonderful product and I will definitely purchase in the future when the need arises.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and was hoping this would help. It doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product is great for relieving the itching related with psoraisis, but its too pricey for the amount of product</li>
    <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve tried this type of treatment for my skin problem. The feel glides on easily and it&#x27;s virtually mess free. It&#x27;s a very smooth gel and it instantly soothed my skin. I put it on overnight and it made a very dramatic impact on how my skin looks and feels!! Definitely very useful if you have severe dry and cracking skin as it does not burn the way lotions do. It was the first night that I didn&#x27;t go to bed without my hands and arms hurting terribly since winter started.</li>
    <li> I suffer from eczema horribly, especially on my arms and hands. Red blotchy scaley skin is embarrassing for anyone with my condition. After reading product reviews I thought I would give this product a try since every lotion out there just wasn&#x27;t cutting it and prescription creams add up. After a few days of using this product even my husband could tell a difference in the feel of my skin and the reduction of redness. It helps with the itching and moisturizes at the same time. Great product</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister to try as she has psoriasis and it is really bothers her. She said that when she used it, it had a tingling sensation. She told me that it did relieve the symptoms somewhat but it did not  clear them up totally. She her itching and hurting did ease off for a few hours at the time when she used it. She said it was a nice product except you could smell the tar, but she said she used it at night and would wash her hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> Soooooo....you are all thinking &amp;#34;coal tar glide&amp;#34;?????  Yes, and it does have a tar smell.  This has been used in psoriasis treatments for quite a while now.  If you&#x27;ve every had prescription medication for psoriasis you are well aware of the fact that most of the stuff does NOT smell good.  If you haven&#x27;t, then take my word for it, they don&#x27;t make that stuff smell good!  This is no exception to the rule.  Once applied the smell is not as strong, but it still exists.  Kind of like walking into a Pep Boys and you can smell the tires from the front door, but it&#x27;s not as strong as in the back of the store in the middle of all the tire racks.  (you can thank my husband for that analogy, his automotive side has rubbed off on me)  My eczema/psoriasis areas are my knuckles, back of my thumbs, and I get a few patches on my upper arms.  Thankfully I don&#x27;t have to use this near my face.  My dad, his dad, and my uncle all had psoriasis with the white scaly large patches on their elbows and knees.  So I&#x27;m no stranger to multiple psoriasis treatments and creams, even UV treatment.  I just started using this and it has already started to smooth the red scaly skin on my knuckles.  It is a little greasy going on and takes a few minutes to absorb into your skin.  Since I don&#x27;t have extremely large areas to cover I just swipe the stick across the back of my hand once, only about an inch and a half streak.  Then I rub it in because it spreads pretty well.  I want to wash my hands immediately, but I don&#x27;t want to wash off the gel I just put on so I use baby wipes to clean my hands and then wash them in about thirty minutes.  I would keep this out of the heat because I think mine melted a little while it was being shipped.  When I opened it there was some on the side of the applicator and the top was bubbly looking.  I will include pics of what it looked like when I opened it and after I&#x27;ve used it.  As with most psoriasis treatments and even some eczema treatments, be careful inthe sun because the gel can make you more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This is great. I got it for my guy who is very sensitive about his psoriasis and doesn&#x27;t like people to know about it. He is very particular about looking good. With this his spots are starting to clear up and areas are not looking as badly. He said he isn&#x27;t as itchy and he thinks the spots on his chest are almost completely gone. He has loved it so far and said there is no greasy feeling to it and that it absorbs nicely and gives him a fast relief to his itches. I received this for product testing purposes to share my experiences with the product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work as well as it has!  It&#x27;s wonderful that I don&#x27;t have to get my fingers all messy applying anything to the back of my neck where I have a spot of eczema.  All I have to do is rub the stick on it and I am good to go.  It goes on as smooth as deodorant with no funky smell or noticeable residue. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review.

    <li> This works well for my skin with flare ups!!</li>
