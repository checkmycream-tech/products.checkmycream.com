      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to swallow it in my sleep.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, it keeps my teeth from grinding at night.</li>
      <li>These are really good.  </li>
      <li>They are good but...</li>
      <li>The first night I wore it, I had the best sleep I&#x27;d ever experienced</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to having one made up by a dentist for a lot more money.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty good and the price on here was the best I could find.</li>
      <li>But after a month of use, I must say I am very pleased.  </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied by the quality of this product.</li>
      <li>Right Dental Guard because the price was excellent considering the custom made night guard.</li>
      <li>The guard is also easier to clean than others, and it&#x27;s a very good value.</li>
      <li>... love this!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>Great, durable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Also, it has never come out of my mouth on its own.</li>
      <li>and it comes with its own case to store it in.</li>
      <li>So I just buy 5 or more when I find a good deal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought it anyways to make my own opinion.</li>
      <li>They are very easy to adjust (or readjust, if desired).</li>
      <li>guard is very good, it does its job very well</li>
      <li>After trying others this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>Since my own bruxism was probably caused by wearing a retainer, I&#x27;m sure my advice won&#x27;t apply to everyone.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this guard to anyone who wants a hassle free guard that work&#x27;s flawlessly!</li>
      <li>first night was great.  </li>
      <li>I find it great that you can change the size of the guard and its super easy.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable, stays in place.</li>
      <li>Not bulky very comfortable and durable</li>
      <li>and I sleep very comfortably with it in.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and feels malleable.  </li>
      <li>Very happy to report that my new one is just as effective and easy to get used to as my original one.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you keep the box and receipt.</li>
      <li>so it probably works well for most people but</li>
      <li>I am pleased a peaches with this purchase.</li>
      <li>but this one is built of better material.  </li>
      <li>and it will lasts for about a year or more.</li>
      <li>Within a week or two, I stopped noticing it after I put it in, and I was able to relax my mouth.</li>
      <li>This one is better.  </li>
      <li>I even took it to my dentist to be sure it was OK to use.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have a bite with the power of a T-Rex (as I have), you may not need the most durable guard.</li>
      <li>I found these Sleepright guards and they work a lot better.</li>
      <li>I also love the jawline it gives me.  </li>
      <li>My dentist once warned me that dogs love dental night guards</li>
      <li>Love this one.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t ask for better service than that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m much more</li>
      <li>How many companies consider customer well-being at the expense of product sales?</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Glad I went with this one.</li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love this...</li>
      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t cause pressure issues with the gums like most.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this mouth guard, I haven&#x27;t had any migraines due to grinding at night. It&#x27;s amazing! The seller was very cooperative about replacement since I broke mine (100% not due to the guard). I am pleased a peaches with this purchase.</li>
    <li> a little uncomfortable</li>
    <li> I had a very expensive custom fit nightguard  broke during a nightmare.  I was hoping for protection against grinding away the tops of my teeth.  This may do that, but it is not comfortable to wear and makes my CPAP mask slip around.  Probably a good product for someone with less specific needs, just not me.</li>
    <li> This thing is awful. Unless you sleep on your back this thing slides around and pinches your cheeks and gums.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t sleep with this device at all. Was kind of big and bulky. I just drooled and no way could fall asleep.</li>
    <li> Why spend $600 on a custom night guard when you can spend $30 or less?  I figured, before I invest in a dentist&#x27;s night guard, I may as well try every one on the market.  I tried the kind that you boil and mold to your teeth – it started moving my teeth the first night! Forget that. This night guard does not need to be fitted to your teeth. I actually cut it in half, and only wear one side of it – it stays in my mouth because it has pretty high plastic pieces on the sides. I find it incredibly comfortable and 100% effective. I can see why it is the number one night guard on the market.</li>
    <li> Works to eliminate my husband from grinding his teeth at night.  Sorta seems to help his snoring, as well....added bonus!</li>
    <li> I tried for a week, it was very uncomfortable and can not sleep with it on. The product is well made.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected. Doesn&#x27;t fit your teeth. That is why you don&#x27;t heat it up.</li>
    <li> This night guard sort of floats in a person&#x27;s mouth.  It did not attach to the bottom part of my gum line on my lower jaw as it shows in the picture.  I may try the smaller , slimmer version next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product touts its strength with its extra hard biting surface.  It actually was too hard and when I ground down hard on it, there was no &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; in the material.  I woke up with my lower molar hurting like I had bit down hard on plastic all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I would recommend this product to a man with a large mouth?</li>
    <li> It is durable and easy to use. It is stable in the mouth during the night and biting pad is strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the biting pad is a bit small. This causes a curve shape of the set of teeth when waking up in the morning.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a huge fan of the concept of night guards, in general.  Seems counter productive to put a &amp;#34;gummy-like&amp;#34; object in your mouth to prevent chomping and grinding.  Plus, I tend to spit it out halfway thru the night, without even knowing I&#x27;m doing it.  However, this is the best construction I&#x27;ve experienced. It hasn&#x27;t worn out with months of use. Even the professional, full mouth version from the dentist didn&#x27;t hold up very long compared to this design.  It feels as comfortable as it possibly can and prevent teeth from making contact.  A bit on the pricy side but, does work</li>
    <li> I did not like this night guard at all.  To me, it was very uncomfortable.  It does not stay in place at night when you fall asleep.</li>
    <li> TRried a few.... this one&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> This has been helping me with my TMJ, the only issue is I have dry mouth when I wake up in the morning!</li>
    <li> These things ruin your bite. Don&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> This thing is very flimsy in the sense that it is not a fixed shape. When you pick it up it just hangs and flops around. I had a very hard time keeping this in my mouth while awake, and because of this I was afraid to sleep with it since I have a past history of spitting out mouth guards. Due to how flimsy this is, I think this is a serious choking hazard. Unlike mouth guards which are a fixed shape, this can become long in your mouth and get lodged in your throat. Also it makes you produce an excessive amount of saliva and I breathed some of that excess saliva into my airway. Overall I&#x27;d say this is a fail.</li>
    <li> At first you just grind on this but I guess that is what it about. Wound up with worse pain for a few days but I guess I am saving my teeth...until I guess I took it out in the night and my dog chewed it up. It was my first time use of a product like this.</li>
    <li> This thing works, but you have to kind of keep your mouth closed and not move around at all for it to stay in place. Takes a bit of getting used to, but it does do the job.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mouth guard. It is made of very resistant material. Even though you can regulate the size, this specific model is for people with bigger mouth (usually men).</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable. Doesn&#x27;t fit well at all. Falls out and moves around in your mouth. Impossible to sleep with this in. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> It is quicker to use than the &amp;#34;hot water molding&amp;#34; method. It is easy to adjust to a reasonable comfort. It does prevent clinching and my jaw is not tense when waking during the night or in the morning. It has fallen out during sleep on a couple of occasions. After several days in a row of use, there is a bit of tenderness on the gum where it has rested or &amp;#34;bumped&amp;#34;, but not painful.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend trying.</li>
    <li> I clench my teeth at night -- not from stress, it&#x27;s just a lifelong habit. Anyway, I have used Sleep Right mouth guards for several years. They are very easy to adjust (or readjust, if desired). I tried other mouth guards, but my tongue would push them out while I was sleeping. The crosspiece for this guard goes in front of the lower teeth, so my tongue has nothing to push against. I have tried several different Sleep Right guards, and prefer the Dura Comfort. If you don&#x27;t have a bite with the power of a T-Rex (as I have), you may not need the most durable guard. I do manage to bite through this guard, but it takes several months. Recommended.</li>
    <li> No matter what size I make it, there is not a snug fit.  Keeps coming out at night.  Better to purchase a full mouth piece.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, it keeps my teeth from grinding at night.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sleepright nightguards for 8 years.  My dentist said my fillings were coming out from grinding my teeth in my sleep.  Instead of having an expensive guard made that i might leave in a hotel, accidentally throw away, or get eaten by my dogs, I tried this. My fillings stayed in and did not protrude anymore.  I buy one every 3-6 months. They are fairly comfortable, especially the one that is the lowest profile.  You dont boil to fit, but the design keeps them between your teeth. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I started dealing with a constant throbbing discomfort in my jaw about 6 months ago. I thought it was my wisdom teeth coming in, but after an xray and noticing that I was clenching my teeth throughout the day unconsciously, my dentist had me get a nightguard. It helped but still allowed for my jaw to clench, since it only added a small padding around my upper teeth. After my dog chewed up that one, I didn&#x27;t have the money for another dentist - ordered one. I got this one and after only a few nights I have felt a huge difference! The only problem I had was that the outer wings on the left side were too tall and scraped against the top of my outer gums. I trimmed a little off with scissors and now it is perfect!</li>
    <li> Big, uncomfortable.  Only lasted 2 months.  I&#x27;ve had many over the counter guards and I finally ponied up the dough and bought a prescription one-which was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Just right for what we were looking for</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every night to avoid grinding his teeth. It last a long time (5 months or so with daily use.) It&#x27;s soft and adjustable which makes it comfortable. I&#x27;d recommend it for the price for sure. The ones that they sell at the dentist are hundreds of dollars and their hard as a rock.</li>
    <li> Had no problems with the seller.  The product itself was way too uncomfortable for my husband and he was never able to sleep with it in his mouth for a full night.</li>
    <li> These work very well for me...and are cost effective as they last 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> I experienced vertigo all the time.  My ENT said to ask the dentist about TMJ and they may have to form a dental guard.  Instead I bought the SleepRight dental guard that is 4x stronger and alot cheaper than the dentist guard.  It really works.  I no longer take an antihistamine daily and wear this every night.  So far, I have had good results.  No more vertigo.</li>
    <li> Solid product that works</li>
    <li> this was too large for me, &amp; I had a difficult time sleeping with it in my mouth. I was hoping it would be more adjustable and more comfortable</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested I try a cheap nighttime dental guard for my teeth grinding before paying for a more permanent solution. I had been having headaches/migraines, tooth pain, jaw pain, restlessness,and  insomnia. I&#x27;ve been using Dura Comfort about three months and all my issues have cleared up. The first few weeks I wore it, I could feel I was wearing it and it was a bit uncomfortable. It doesn&#x27;t mold to fit the teeth, but it can be adjusted for a slightly smaller or larger mouth. Within a week or two, I stopped noticing it after I put it in, and I was able to relax my mouth. It took a few months, but my sleep and sleep issues have drastically improved.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 3 years now and it never started breaking like the ones I bought from the store and they are the same ones as this one</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this night guard . It&#x27;s floppy and awkward. I lost the night guard I got from my dentist and this was cheaper. At first I thought I&#x27;d swallow it in my sleep and choke,then I realized rhat I clamp my teeth down so hard at night, that won&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t know why people are complaining about customer service. My previous Dura Comfort Night Guard broke last night, and I e-mailed them today. Within 30 minutes of the original e-mail, I got a detailed reply back. I followed up and received a second e-mail that answered all questions and concerns quickly. Within the same 1 hour window, I had immediate answers to return/warranty information and an address to send my broken guard for a new one- free of charge. You can&#x27;t ask for better service than that. On top of that, the rep included a link and some information about how to break free from the neuromascular chains of bruxism. How many companies consider customer well-being at the expense of product sales? I can think of very few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background information: I&#x27;ve had bruxism for as long as I could remember. When I was a child, I would recall having wiggly and sore teeth when I woke up, but never learned the cause until some 20 years later. In December 2013, I woke up with severe pain in a tooth I previously had root canal work done. The pain was so intense, the only thing I could focus on was holding my jaw in my hand and pacing around the house. I scheduled an appointment to have the tooth yanked just to bring myself relief. Feeling a little hasty, I went to CVS and found the Dura Comfort Dental Night Guard ($50.28 at CVS!!!!!). I slept with it in that night, and my tooth pain was reduced by 50% the following morning. Within 3 days, I was pain free and my life had returned to normal. I&#x27;ve tried many night guards and all have felt like I was sucking on a spatula or drowning in saliva. This one was actually comfortable, and easy to forget about so I could sleep. I did have very slight sore gums the first morning, but beyond the first night soreness never returned. My night guard broke after only two months (SleepRight claims 6 month durability) so I e-mailed them and they offered to replace my guard free of charge, all I have to do is sendin the broken one and proof of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cleanliness: I keep a small bowl next to my sink full of Listerine, and I soak my guard in it while I brush my teeth. Run the guard under water once you&#x27;re done, and it will always taste clean and minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few bad eggs to lead me here, but I know what brand I will be buying from now on for my bruxism needs. SleepRight is a business that not only stands behind its product, but has excellent customer service to boot.</li>
    <li> I paid a LOT of money for a custom fitted guard at my dentist&#x27;s office that has since worn out.  I decided to try this product as an alternative until I can afford a new one from the dentist.  I did not believe that it would work very well, but thought that it would be better than nothing.  I was quite surprised.  The fit and feel take a little getting used to, but this product is very effective.  I think that I&#x27;m going to stick with this one.</li>
    <li> uct is very durable and good, it doe prevent me from grinding my 2 bottom teeth and has slowed down snoring.</li>
    <li> I use this at night now. I used to use The Doctor&#x27;s night guard, but I&#x27;m not a fan on the boiling and it was difficult to clean. I&#x27;m obsessive about brushing my teeth and it seemed counter productive to put a not completely clean night guard in close contact with the teeth I just brushed. What I like about the SleepRight night guard is that it is flat, you don&#x27;t boil it, it&#x27;s extremely easy to clean, and that you can easily put it in and take it out. It was always a concern with The Doctor&#x27;s (and other boil to fit night guards) that I would pop a crown off because sometimes the suction was too good. The SleepRight guard is kind of bulky in your mouth and it rubs on your cheeks and lower back gums, but if you&#x27;ve had braces or a retainer, you won&#x27;t mind it. It seems too big to just swallow or choke on if you use it correctly by putting the flat pieces between your back teeth and the connecter in the front. It isn&#x27;t a very tight fight in my mouth but it fits and doesn&#x27;t float around. Much cheaper than the night guard option at the dentist&#x27;s office which was $450. Personally, I like it better than a boil to fit option. The flat pieces are harder than the rubbery connecter piece, but they aren&#x27;t hard plastic and can absorb the impact with no apparent effect on your teeth if you are a clincher or grinder.</li>
    <li> My dentist says I grind my teeth when I sleep. She would like me to have some very expensive surgery to reposition my jaw. She has also mentioned fitting me with a special appliance, but keeps changing what she tells me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if there might be something over the counter and found this in a drug store. My wife says I snore much less now. I notice I no longer need a nap during the day. And, my blood pressure had begun to climb in recent months for no explainable reason. Now I think that was due to some mild sleep apnea. (I do not use a C-Pap machine.) I tried bringing it down with exercise, etc. But, it has come down nicely after using this for about a month, even without daily exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This forces me to breathe through my nose when I sleep. The device felt a little strange in my mouth and irritated my gums on one side. I moved the adjustable part back one notch on that side and that problem disappeared. After a few weeks, I barely notice it in my mouth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never felt as if I might swallow this device. It stays in place very nicely during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are having any sleep problems, try this device and see if those improve.</li>
    <li> Very durable product. Probably it will last half a year.  Buy the Dura confort to last long.</li>
    <li> It did take a while to get here but it really is a great product. I don&#x27;t grind my teeth anymore and my jaw stopped hurting. If you&#x27;re looking for comfort this is it.</li>
    <li> The dental guard ist what it´s made it for.. the biggest con is to get comfortable with  the guard by sleeping..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but I&#x27;ll just spell out what I like and don&#x27;t like and leave the rest up to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;More comfortable and adjustable than most guards&lt;br /&gt;Easier to talk in than most bite guard&lt;br /&gt;No need to boil, no risk of fitting wrong&lt;br /&gt;Minimalist design, but very effective&lt;br /&gt;East to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Has cut the inside of my mouth and pinched causing blood blisters on my inner cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Seems less durable due to the minimalistic design. My last one lasted a month before it started to crack and split, and I became afraid of it becoming a choking hazard due to degradation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I bought a second one, because It is comfortable and easier to talk without having to constantly pop out and back in every time i need to say something. The biggest problem is that, because of the the way the device is designed, there are moving components that seem likely to pinch or snag sensitive mouth skin. Was not severe enough to prevent me from trying a second replacement unit after the first was finished.</li>
    <li> it is great.  i grind my teeth at night, so i need one.  i dont want my teeth to be grinded, so have to get dentures.</li>
    <li> Guard was not comfortable for me, it dug into my gums and disturbed my sleep.  I did better with the moldable type that fits over the entire upper teeth.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, much less expensive that a bit from the dentist, however it&#x27;s a little tough on the mouth.</li>
    <li> More comfortable than full mouth nightguards, works as expected. Durability still not known, so far so good, time will tell.</li>
    <li> great for teeth grinders. it has lasted for almost a year. stays in the mouth easily and keep jaw form hurting.</li>
    <li> i like it but down fall is it is a little thick as well as it doesn&#x27;t fit snug on your teeth.  It says it has an adjustable piece but I tried the biggest and smallest level and it still didn&#x27;t fit.  Other than that it was a great price and does the job.</li>
    <li> I have had this dental guard about a month now.  I was told by my doctor I needed one because I went in for severe ear/neck pain and apparently I was grinding or clenching my teeth at night which caused nerve irritation.  I did not want to go to a dentist to make a custom one for $500 so I chose the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, it does it&#x27;s job, plain and simple.  My pain has gone away from clenching and grinding.. HOWEVER...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like how it is so flexible that it does not stay in place.  I expected it to be a harder plastic to shape around your mouth and hold in place like a retainer sort of, but it is not like that at all. It is a flexible, silicone feeling material.  Any type of movement, or if my mouth opens, it makes the dental guard slip out of place.  There is nothing to secure it unless I am biting down with force, which is the reason I got it in the first place.. to stop the biting. The bottom part that goes under the bottom teeth doesn&#x27;t stay... it comes up over my teeth and it&#x27;s really bothersome. If you need to talk or anything, it will come out of place and on top of your tongue like you are trying to swallow it.  I have noticed I have been getting more interrupted sleep than I had before I used it, just because it doesn&#x27;t stay in place so it wakes me up when it needs to be adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things I DO like as well that I don&#x27;t think many other over the counter mouth guards offer.  For one, it is very slim and light, so you don&#x27;t feel like you have much in your mouth.  No one can really tell you are wearing it unless you pull your cheeks open to show off your molars, so if you are afraid to look goofy in front of a significant other, no worries. lol.  Also, I do like that I am still able to wear my essex retainer as I am wearing the dental guard.. I don&#x27;t always wear it because gets a little bulky when you combine the two, but if you want to wear it to keep your teeth from shifting, you can.</li>
    <li> Had purchased a $300 guard from dentist that fit poorly.  This night guard is made well and is extremely comfortable.  It is very flexible and allows for easy adjustments.  I highly recommend!!!!  Will definately re-order when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Great Price -  Product as described.</li>
    <li> First time using an form of mouth guard but it wasn&#x27;t bad my cheeks were sore at first but that was expected however it fit fine, stays in mouth the whole night and I didn&#x27;t even drool! I have to admit the pads are a lot thicker than I anticipated but it stopped me from grinding so it&#x27;s an alright product</li>
    <li> The mouth piece falls out at night while sleeping. I have reverted to traditional at this point. Disappointed with merchandise</li>
    <li> Horrible! either I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to insert it or something else was wrong.  Will probably not try to use it again.</li>
    <li> I have to replace these every 3-4 months. They keep my teeth from grinding, but they wear out fast (pieces start to break away). They are also rather uncomfortable for the first couple nights on a new guard. They discolor and retain an odor, even when rinsing, soaking in mouth wash, brushing, etc..</li>
    <li> I have bought other dental night guards, but always come back to the sleep right. No worries about fit, boiling it or comfort. Sleep right conforms from the first use and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> There is nothing to hold it in your mouth. It presses into your tongue, so that unless you hold your tongue in the back of your mouth or clench your teeth, the thing comes out. It is impossible to hold in place no matter what you do. Biggest waste of money ever.</li>
    <li> Cant live without this. Use it every night. It works</li>
    <li> It did great things for my tooth grinding. The first night I wore it, I had the best sleep I&#x27;d ever experienced, I hadn&#x27;t realized I&#x27;d been waking myself up so much! In addition, this set came with a free nose opening thingy (sorry, I don&#x27;t remember what it was called) to help with snoring which I gave to my roommate. Her partner was really excited because apparently it helped a ton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, on really bad nights, or if you don&#x27;t size it according to the directions, the mouth guard will leave sore spots in your mouth. Also, my roommate said the nose thing was incredibly uncomfortable and she kept waking up in to take it off.</li>
    <li> This is an &#x27;okay&#x27; alternative to a &#x27;professional&#x27; grade tooth guard. It was bought as a substitute while I was waiting for my &#x27;real&#x27; guard to be finished by the dentist. As I used it there was a tendency for it to become dislodged and half would be hanging out of my mouth in the morning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not comfortable and hurts my gum and cheek</li>
    <li> I love this night guard because it stays in easily (it&#x27;s pretty gross when you wake up with your night guard not in your mouth and you have to figure out where in your bed it ended up), there is no boiling and it&#x27;s not too big. I&#x27;ve definitely chewed through two of these things so far, but they usually last me around 9 months. My jaw definitely feels better after using this mouth guard consistently at night.</li>
    <li> This guard supposed to save my teeth, but it&#x27;s bulky and make me gag at times. That seems to be me, not the device.</li>
    <li> I had tried those mouth guards that you had to boil and then form to your mouth, but I did not have much luck with those, and they were very uncomfortable for sleeping.  This guard was easy to get used to (within a few nights) and so much more comfortable.  I even took it to my dentist to be sure it was OK to use.  He said he hadn&#x27;t seen one like this before, but he had me put the guard in my mouth and he said that it looked like it should work as good as the $300 ones that he sells!</li>
    <li> Another goodnight sleep for the rest of the house.  Ordered these for my husband when he chew the Comfort model to bits,  but even those  lasted almost a year even it promises only 3 months. Says these are good!  He has less headaches than he use to.</li>
    <li> Horrible. I tried it but sometimes I would wake up at night chewing it like a piece of steak.</li>
    <li> Best dental appliance for teeth grinding that I have encountered. Great value ($40 instead of $800 at dentist). It fits well and does not fall out. Durable plastic and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> fits ok the adjustment buttons on side could be uncomfortable at times.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal for your money when it comes to dental guards.  Before you spend $300 or more for a custom guard from your dentist, try one of these.  You don&#x27;t have to mold them; they&#x27;re good to go right out of the box.  They&#x27;re also much more comfortable than other guards.  You&#x27;ll have to replace them every few months because you&#x27;ll chew the hell out of them, but it&#x27;s still a relatively cheap purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually don&#x27;t use bite guards anymore, though.  I cured my bruxism, and I wanted to write a review mainly to tell you how I did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I started grinding my teeth when I was using a retainer, because I&#x27;d had braces for years.  My dentist never cared to look into WHY I started grinding, though.  It seemed like that just wasn&#x27;t important (typical of American doctors and dentists alike.  I don&#x27;t blame him, it&#x27;s just how they&#x27;re taught).  They tend to treat the symptoms, not the root of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took his advice and started wearing dental guards.  I wore this particular one for years, and chalked it up to caffeine as the culprit.  I stopped consuming all caffeine for an entire year and still found myself grinding.  Then something so embarrassingly simple clicked in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;What if I&#x27;m grinding my teeth because there&#x27;s something in my mouth?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a concept!  I decided to stop using bite guards altogether, and sure enough that solved my problem.  I haven&#x27;t worn a guard in months now, and haven&#x27;t caught myself grinding at all.  Though, during the first week or two without using a guard I did grind a bit, but that&#x27;s because my mouth was so used to having a huge piece of plastic in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things I did before bed that helped my jaw relax:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Applied a hot/warm washcloth to my jaw for a couple minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Put my legs up against the wall at a 90 degree angle and did yogic breathing for 10-20 minutes in bed.  The point is to relax.  Whatever works bestfor you.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Made a conscious effort to keep my teeth from touching.  This should be an all-day thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you relieve yourself of this condition!  It&#x27;s no fun.  And if you do consume a lot of caffeine, don&#x27;t rule that out either.  It can definitely have an impact.  Since my own bruxism was probably caused by wearing a retainer, I&#x27;m sure my advice won&#x27;t apply to everyone.  Some of you may just really need to un-stress yourselves.  This condition is heavily stress related.  I recommend yoga :)</li>
    <li> I have had several guards made by dentists, but I tend to lose or damage them, they are expensive and the process to make them is kind of annoying and needs three or four visits to the dentist to get them well fitted.&lt;br /&gt;This guard is very good, it does its job very well, I feel it comfortable, the material is more soft than the dentist&#x27;s. It has a simple adjustment for small, medium and large mouths, in two seconds you are done with the size.&lt;br /&gt;I use the guard for sleeping, though I found other use for the product too, I have a motorcycle and ride often, like to push my adrenaline high, I used gum to relieve the tension (as some other bikers do), now I use the guard for that.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s costly, but if you think that it&#x27;s 1/10th of the cost of a professional one, it is worth the price, moreover if you lose them often as I do.</li>
    <li> I tried to use it but I couldn&#x27;t stop gagging.</li>
    <li> The first one I received was too large for my mouth;  then second one was too small.  It was too bulky for my tastes.</li>
    <li> It is larger, thicker and tougher than the same brand lighter version and they took a moment to get used to.  My other lasted around 3 years so I expect this one will last at least five years.  A great investment to protect you teeth from grinding when sleeping.  My dentist recommended this brand as a quality affordable alternative to a custom made one that costs well over $150.00.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other over the counter guards and this is by far the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 years and the dentist has not seen any additional wear and tear on my teeth from grinding. The guard lasts for about 4-5 months. I&#x27;ve looked into getting a professional molded guard but they are expensive and I&#x27;ve heard from more than one person that they wear down as quickly as this one does. Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many night guards, and even concocted a few of my own.  The problem as a side sleeper is that there is sometimes not enough space to breathe through them properly. Also the cheek pressed against the pillow can become sore around the gums from the mouth guard.  This dental guard works better for me because of the design, breathing is not a problem.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t cause pressure issues with the gums like most.  Sometimes I just use one side of it so I don&#x27;t grind my teeth and leave the other side hanging.  Sounds funny but works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I do have a small mouth,but this thing gags me.  I can&#x27;t wear it at all.  I haven&#x27;t tried any others, but unless you have a large mouth I would look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> You can pay $28 through Amazon, or $48 for the exact same item at CVS. CVS also offers their own brand for $38.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product if you clench your teeth at night</li>
    <li> This is the best dental guard I have used, and I have used many. It is easier to customize and fit than other mouth guards -- no boiling. The guard is also easier to clean than others, and it&#x27;s a very good value.</li>
    <li> We have to admit that sleeping with something in our mouths will always be uncomfortable. I clench my teeth when I sleep and unfortunately has ruined many of my teeth and I always wake up with pain in my TMJ and my face feels heavy. Since dentist in the USA are so expensive every treatment will be expensive as well. My dentist wanted to charge me $850.00 for custom made night guards and I did consider it because eventually I was going to loose my molars if I didn&#x27;t take action. I decided to try Sleep Right Dental Guard because the price was excellent considering the custom made night guard. Like I said before everything in your mouth will be uncomfortable but this night guard has helped me amazingly and I got use to it, so, I sleep without discomfort. I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 month and  even my face has changed since all the stress of clenching has stopped. I look better, feel better and the process of ruining my teeth has stopped.  Clenching and grinding changes your face, you will age faster because of the stress put into your face. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great product! Best guard I&#x27;ve used so far. I took it out of the box, rinsed it well and just started using it. Very comfortable, stays in place. It has adjustments but I didn&#x27;t need to adjust it at all. I used to grind my teeth while sleeping and bite my cheek&#x27;s which is not good. This thing stopped all of that! It&#x27;s cost&#x27;s a little more than some of the other type&#x27;s, but is well worth the money. I recommend this guard to anyone who wants a hassle free guard that work&#x27;s flawlessly!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for the guard I have had for two years (same style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to use a dentist-made one ($500) and the boil ones from the drugstore simply because they are so confining.  Rather than grabbing onto your teeth, this sits comfortably in the mouth.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and I had no problems with wear. After two years, mine started to show signs of wear (cracks on the biting surface). I will buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> My husband grinds his teeth while he sleeps. He found that the traditional mouth guards ended up full of spit and he was just making slurping noises and couldn&#x27;t fall asleep with it in. This is much better because it leaves the roof of your mouth open, allowing for adequate spit drainage. We first got one about 5 years ago, he&#x27;s been using them ever since and he doesn&#x27;t wake up with a sore jaw or a headache any more. We have to replace it about every 4 months, though it should probably be more frequently (for hygiene reasons). Only once has he actually chewed through it, but that was after extended use.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the fit Of this mouth guard. I did not expect it to be so comfortable throughout the night. I can&#x27;t imagine sleeping without it anymore. Really has reduced the amount of morning headaches.</li>
    <li> stopped using after one night.  plastic was harder than similar dental guard purchased elsewhere -- as if the plastic in this one was old or something.  Not a great product for me.</li>
    <li> The mouthguard is as advertised.  There is no need to boil it.  You adjust the size based on the notcheces inside the mouthguard accordingly.  Easy yo wash and it last 6 months or your moneyback.  Just make sure you keep the box and receipt.</li>
    <li> This solved a lot of my migraine, neck, and back issues.  I clench at night and this has helped me to relax my jaw.  I can even feel a difference in the tension during the day.  This is the best night guard at a great price on Amazon.  I paid $49. at the drugstore for my 1st one, and my daughter misplaced it so I am getting another here for much less.</li>
    <li> very uncomfortable to wear at night</li>
    <li> Works as expected!  Seems to be made of a durable material.</li>
    <li> It works great. It is true to size and a easy fit. Not a lot of adjusting and easy to clean</li>
    <li> Better than the mouth guard from your dentist.  It has little flappers making it fir perfectly and it is lightweight and thin.  Would recumbent you try this one before the others/</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this mouth guard.  It is thicker than ones I&#x27;ve been using, which has been good because I clench very hard at night so the more thickness there is from the guard, the more space is between my jaws.  However, it caused a canker sore on my left top gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night was great.  My jaws felt great in the morning and I didn&#x27;t have the usual migraine that came with clenching.  On the second night I noticed that it felt a little sore when touching my gums so I adjusted the size but it still touched that area.  By the 3rd and 4th night, the sore got bigger and noticeable so on the 5th night, I went back to using a thinner over the counter night guard I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product got great reviews so it probably works well for most people but for me, the left side of my mouth is not the same as my right so it rubbed up against the gum more causing a canker sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be exchanging this through the 30 day warranty program to try the slim-comfort design, which is ideal for small mouths and does not have the stability wings (the part that rubbed against my gums).</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I was not pleased with the device that my dentist had provided (customized and at a much higher cost).  I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I first received it and looked at it (looked flimsy and like it would not stay in mouth).  But after a month of use, I must say I am very pleased.  It fits well and I do believe it makes my sleep much more comfortable, and I am not waking up with the pain/discomfort in my teeth and gum area.  I will continue to use.  Thank you for this product!</li>
    <li> The Dura Comfort is a GODSEND. They stay in all night (unlike the slim model) and are still small enough to not be bothersome (I forget its in my mouth after 10 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;If you have any suspicion you may grind your teeth at night, GET THIS MOUTH PIECE for your teeth and health.&lt;br /&gt;The only other option is going to the dentist and getting a custom mouth piece which will both cost you greatly (upwards of 600 dollars) and will be more uncomfortable than this ~20 dollar miracle of a mouth piece.</li>
    <li> This was the first dental guard I had ever tried and my first one lasted at least 6 months.  When I realized it was time to get a new one, I figured I&#x27;d try another type of night guard since I had no basis for comparison.  I tried two other guards by different brands, both of which required molding. I quickly realized that the fit of those tooth-encapsulating mouth guards drove me absolutely nuts. So, I went back to this one and when I have eventually gnawed it to death, I will be purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used a night guard before, you should expect some mild discomfort for about a week- by which I mean an annoyance, not pain. After that period, you most likely won&#x27;t even notice it.  Also, it has never come out of my mouth on its own.</li>
    <li> I tried a bigger brand (Sleep Aid Mouth Guard) and was not a fan.  Love this one.  Comfy, small and effective.</li>
    <li> I had purchased an earlier version of this SleepRight Dura dentail night guard at a local drugstore and felt it worked well as long as I switched back to my custom bite guard every 3 nights to bring my upper teeth back into alignment.  I lost my first Dura night guard and so ordered this one as a replacement.  It came with two night guards - one with the larger wings and a weird minty flavor and the other was the &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; version with smaller wings that hug your upper molars to help stabilize the guard.  My problem with both of these newer versions are that the rectangular flat surface that keeps your upper and lower molars apart is thicker that the old version.  I tend to clench and not grind so I don&#x27;t need the extra durability of the thicker guard.  I have a harder time wearing the thicker guards all night long, they seem to keep my jaws farther apart and then my mouth has a tendency to fall open.</li>
    <li> I wish that these had been available 20 plus years ago, when my childhood amalgam fillings were popping out right and left due to tooth grinding.  I have tried a number of brands, but I prefer this design and the durability of the plastic.  Although I got the thickest mouthguard, the manufacturer also sells thinner guards, depending on need.  I need the thick ones, because I have two of my back molars extracted, and I need the extra &amp;#34;loft&amp;#34; of my palate to accommodate for the missing teeth.  I originally had this recommended by a medical doctor because he detected arthritis in my TMJ joint--likely due to a lifetime of grinding/gritting. But, my dentist also recommended it, as well.  Since I&#x27;ve been using dental guards, I no longer have headaches and my fillings seem to be staying put.  Yippeeee!</li>
    <li> Stays in place.  Does not need to placed in hot water to mold it.  Easy to adjust.  Adjusted once and all set.  This is my third one.  They last for months, longer than most others. I grind my teeth badly, so this has been a god send for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this guard all that much. It works for its purpose but it feels flimsy despite the wings and is stiff so it still is uncomfortable to sleep with since I clench. I am not a grinder so I guess I need more cushion and less durability. Should work for others better</li>
    <li> UPDATE in NOVEMBER 2014: My dentist once warned me that dogs love dental night guards and he was correct! Be warned! Earlier, I did find I had totally expelled my SLEEP RIGHT night guard in my sleep - and sure enough, one time our new dog found it and chewed it up. So I had to order another one from Amazon.    Also, do feel free to experiment with the \\&quot;sizing\\&quot; adjustments. Also, the gums on my lower front teeth did not like where the band rested when adjusted per manufacturer&#x27;s directions. I have a very small mouth. I ended up adjusting it to the largest size and wearing it UPSIDE-DOWN. The gums above my upper teeth do not seem to \\&quot;notice\\&quot; the band - and \\&quot;Mr. Tongue\\&quot; does not seem to feel the need to play with it anymore.     NOTE: I am not a bruxer (I don&#x27;t grind my teeth), but after several months of using this SLEEP RIGHT night guard I am inclined to believe that it may move around too easily for bruxers. BUT, for CLENCHERS I believe this may work out well for you as it has for me. Aside from the fact that I am wearing it upside down - and not adjusted to the size that was suggested, it still took a while before it was a comfortable solution for my clenching. It seemed too hard - although now it seems softer (and it is not dented, etc.). Please remember you did not just start clenching (or bruxing). It is something you have probably done for nearly as long as you&#x27;ve had teeth. It is only logical that you will find this device alien in all ways! You are leaving something in your mouth instead sof chewing it up and swallowing it. I read some of the one star reviews, and I have not experienced any of the change in occlusion problems that some reviewers mentioned. I am not sure if they were bruxers or clenchers. I can on say to be patient. I never wake up with the jaw pain (\\&quot;toothaches\\&quot; in several teeth at once) that I used to experience. I was also in a car accident in 1969 and my jaw was broken and many of my teeth were damaged. Because of the hairline cracks in myteeth, clenching hard seemed to open those cracks to anaerobic bacteria. Several times I had really, really bad abscesses. Several times my dentist said I needed a root canal - but I did not believe that that was the problem - especially since the abscesses were never in the same place. I was taking antibiotics over and over - a bad thing to do. Since I&#x27;ve worn this SLEEP RIGHT device since getting this Spring I have not had a single root abscess and now my Dentist is a believer that the clenching plus the cracks in my teeth were the problem. What the SLEEP RIGHT device seems to have done is make my subconscious quit clenching because \\&quot;something is in the way\\&quot;. I know this may sound strange, but it is my experience!  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  ORIGINAL REVIEW    My first SLEEP RIGHT Dental Guard said on the package that it was 2X stronger than bitepad material in any other night guard. It was heavenly soft - but I chewed it up in weeks. In the meantime I had purchased and received this one from Amazon - which said it is 4X stronger, etc. So, when I got the 2X version replaced under warranty I asked the manufacturer for one of this model instead.    This product WORKS, WONDERFULLY. I am a clencher - a hard, hard, hard clencher. I have paid buku bucks through the years for night guards through my dentist. I have always complained that they do not help with the clenching - but they might for bruxing - which I don&#x27;t do. Somehow I always got guilted into getting them (I assume as opposed to buying something \\&quot;inferior\\&quot; OTC). Then, with my last \\&quot;Dentist&#x27;s\\&quot; $200+ night guard I experimented with hot glue - adding \\&quot;pads\\&quot; onto it, and voila, that worked. Previously I had been only replacing one hard surface (my teeth) for another hard surface - the \\&quot;bruxing proof\\&quot; Dentist&#x27;s night guard. The soft surface proved to me that there was a better answer for my clenching problem.    The only problem I am having (and I think I can break the habit) is with \\&quot;Mr. Tongue\\&quot;. I have one of those inquisitive and helpful tongues that drives dentists nuts! One good thing about the \\&quot;Dentist&#x27;s\\&quot; night guards is that there were a tight enough fit that \\&quot;Mr. Tongue\\&quot; could not dislodge them. With the SLEEP RIGHT dental guard I have awakened more than once with it out of place (one end hanging out of my mouth) and the other end firmly clenched between some of my teeth. The SLEEP RIGHT device is soft enough, that even with it relocated to suit \\&quot;Mr. Tongue&#x27;s\\&quot; peculiar desires, it is more restful for my jaw than either no night guard or the hard plastic ones (supposedly with a soft outer layer) from the Dentist. As I said, I think \\&quot;Mr. Tongue\\&quot; will eventually lose interest in playing with it and I will find it where I left it on more occasions than not. Oh, and did I mention, I can TALK with it in my mouth (far more understandably than with a conventional Dentist&#x27;s custom guard?).    I cannot speak for bruxers, but clenching I know, and this was a lucky find for me and may be a lucky find for you too. One additional benefit from wearing this night guard as opposed to the \\&quot;molded to your teeth\\&quot; models (professional or at home types) is that there is nothing in close contact with your teeth to trap germs, etc., against your tooth surfaces for many hours at a time. Even if you brush, etc., before bedtime, and brush your molded night guard, I have often wondered if some harm might not be coming from the germs trapped against the teeth with those tight fitting \\&quot;Dentist&#x27;s\\&quot; night guards that cover such a sizeable area of the teeth.    Today, after less than a week with my SLEEP RIGHT night guard, I am today ordering a spare from Amazon. (I am always afraid I&#x27;ll leave a night guard where it can be tampered with by a dog - of which we have a newish one - the older dog knows that my night guard is a big NO-NO.)</li>
    <li> this purchase enabled me to save 50% off the retail price. i have used one before and needed a replacement, great purchase</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear it everyday (it takes some getting used to). But it works like a charm, my mouth has always been small (experience at dentists) and this thing works just fine. Adjustable size, and doesn&#x27;t move around too much in mouth when I try to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear a retainer before I put this on, and it still does its job without messing with the retainer&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and buy a boil guard that you can fit snug to your upper teeth. This thing is uncomfortable and has too much going on. If you grind, you&#x27;ll just end up chewing through all the bulky hardware. Within a week, I&#x27;d chewed through the plastic on the sides and the holes/slots for the sliders were ruined. I woke up one morning with one of the sliders separated from the device, which could&#x27;ve caused me to choke. Again, that wouldn&#x27;t happen with a boil guard that&#x27;s all one piece. The sliders sit midway between your upper and lowers on the side so if you grind, there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll grind on the slider pieces. When it comes to teeth, \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; just doesn&#x27;t cut it; teeth are too unique.</li>
    <li> It does the work, its not so obtrusive and invasive, if fits any mouth sice the parts swivel and adjust to mouth and bite.&lt;br /&gt;i dont use it every day, i forget to put it on sometimes, but it works 100% . It says this lasts 6 months at least, i cannot assure that, but so far so good, i think it can even last much more, tie will tell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little uncomfortable at first, but I have a small mouth. Will try the smaller version next time. It is adjustable and I did not have any trouble sleeping. Hopefully this will save my teeth!</li>
    <li> I got this within a couple days of ordering it and I sleep very comfortably with it in. I can tell a major difference in the morning because my jaw doesn&#x27;t feel sore from grinding my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is pretty much the only over the counter night guard I buy these days.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last the 6 months the manufacturer claims it will (at least nowadays for me), but I&#x27;m okay with that seeing as I can usually find a good deal on it online.  I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s one of the better no-boil type of night mouth guards, although it&#x27;s so thick it may take a little time to get used to at first.</li>
    <li> Short story short: Give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for 8-10 months. For about half a year, it was like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable&lt;br /&gt;-Comfortable (after getting used to it)&lt;br /&gt;-Didn&#x27;t wake up in ear/jaw pain&lt;br /&gt;-Did not experience my teeth \\&quot;move\\&quot; (my $300 custom fit guard actually gave me an open bite. This didn&#x27;t do anything to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Bad taste for the first week&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to spit out while asleep (doesn&#x27;t fall out as much if on the largest adjustment)&lt;br /&gt;-Uncomfortable on larger settings if you have jaw soreness (double-edged sword here. If you can keep in all night, no problem)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But NOW...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it wasn&#x27;t working anymore. I was waking up with jaw/ear pain and migraines. So I got a second one, thinking that the first one should have been replaced after 6 months. Nope. I still have terrible jaw/ear pain and migraines. I think my brusixm has worsened. It makes sense. This is my first year of college and working. I&#x27;m much more stressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I waste my money? No... This was well worth the 8-10 months of comfort. Even if it fell out sometimes. I&#x27;d rather have a comfortable guard and a few days of headaches than discomfort every day and discomfort wearing it. I highly recommend trying it. Even if it turns out it wasn&#x27;t for you. Even though it only worked for me initially, that&#x27;s 10 times better than nothing. Though sadly, I have to look for something else now ):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, someone in the bad reviews mentioned this scratching their cheeks/gums. It didn&#x27;t do anything like that to mine. I wonder if that was a defect in the machine/lasers/etc. cutting the guard imperfectly. Think about cheap plastic toys with tabs of plastic sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Edit 5/28/14--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news! I didn&#x27;t have to look for another guard. My bruxism leveled back down to what it usually is! (Which is still painful without a guard. But with, not so much!)</li>
    <li> Best adjustable night guard.  Comfortable fit that adjusts to fit your mouth.  Lasts months longer than others on the market.  I have severe TMJ and need a night guard to prevent further damage to my joints.  Cheaper than getting one made by the dentist!  They say it lasts 6 months.  The last one I had lasted over 10 months.  I will continue to use this night guard.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good as it gets if you have to wear one of these darn things!</li>
    <li> This dental guard is sturdy, comfortable and really works well for me.  It&#x27;s a great alternative to having one made up by a dentist for a lot more money.  I&#x27;ve tried others and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> It took a couple of nights to get use to, but i didnt fall out very much, and no drooling like i  had with other ones. The only down fall was that i have had it for like a month or two and the pads are already chewed or rubbed through.. so i have to get another one, but out of all the ones i have tried, this one is the best.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable. Do not wear if you are grinding your front teeth it does not protect them.</li>
    <li> I bought this back in March (almost 5 months ago) and have really liked this guard. I don&#x27;t use it every night (I can be forgetful), but have not had any comfort issues aside from the first night or two. It was different to have something in my mouth while sleeping initially, but I got used to that eventually. I saw somewhere that some people have needed to replace theirs after 6 months, but I am not at that point yet but also am not too terribly bad when it comes to grinding my teeth in my sleep. When I do need a replacement though, I will be buying this one again!</li>
    <li> This mouth guard did not fit well at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like it, very uncomfortable and wouldn&#x27;t stay in my  mouth.</li>
    <li> This item did not work for me it did not fit and was uncomfortable I only used it for about 3 weeks and gave up.</li>
    <li> This is third or fourth one I have bought for my boyfriend.  His teeth grinding keep me from sleeping and now he used it every night with no grinding.  Yeah!</li>
    <li> love this thing, its the ONLY mouth guard i can sleep with&amp;#62; FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> Seems to do a fine job and at a price that is well below the best I can find in discount big box stores locally.</li>
    <li> This product is better than I thought it would be.  It is fairly loose in my mouth but stays where it needs to be throughout the night.  It does take some getting use to if you have used the custom trays previously. I have not had any headaches since I began using it, so I believe it is doing its job.  It seems well made and durable.</li>
    <li> This is not the right night guard for me, felt like it actually was moving my teeth around and making them hurt so after three days I threw it away.. Expensive not to work out.</li>
    <li> At first I liked this mouthguard, but as time wore on, I started to notice that my teeth felt sore after wearing it. I&#x27;m a little worried now that it has changed my bite (and possibly shifted a crowned molar in the back of my mouth) but I can&#x27;t know that for sure.</li>
    <li> Awkward. Was very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I use this to help prevent me from grinding my teeth.  It&#x27;s a great product and I notice that my jaw isn&#x27;t tight in the morning.</li>
    <li> Works as described, and does its intended job.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the way it props your mouth open when you sleep, but my $500 version from my dentist did the same thing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but is hard to fit a small mouth. The front band is way to big.</li>
    <li> For openers, there&#x27;s no such thing as a Night Guard that you genuinely enjoy, or that feels really good. It&#x27;s a necessity if you grind your teeth, and you&#x27;re looking for a guard that will prevent damage from grinding, while causing the least discomfort. The Dura Comfort Guard accomplishes that for me, and does it better than any other similar device I&#x27;ve tried. The only negative is that the &amp;#34;stability wings&amp;#34; dig into my gums, which are sensitive to begin with. So it took a while to get used to; once I made it through the initial three weeks, it worked fine for me.</li>
    <li> My first Sleep Right night guard lasted over 4 years, and I just received a new one yesterday, three days after I ordered it.  Very happy to report that my new one is just as effective and easy to get used to as my original one.  No more clenched jaw pain, no more filing my teeth down by grinding.  I had been grinding my teeth at night since I was in my 20&#x27;s, (now 66 years old), and I think I&#x27;ve tried every night guard ever invented, including some in the $200 range supplied by dentists.  Nothing has ever worked until this until I tried Dura Comfort.  In my opinion, this is a &amp;#34;miracle invention&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and fits surprisingly well for an off-the-shelf product.  I&#x27;ll buy this again and save myself the $600 cost of custom-made.</li>
    <li> Dura Comfort Dental Night Guard has met my expectations</li>
    <li> works very good and can last up to a year with routine cleanings. I would recommend before going to a CPAP machine.</li>
    <li> My dog chewed my $500 mouth guard from the dentist.  This was the first over the counter product I found that was comfortable and would do the job of keeping bruxism at bay.  Unfortunately, my dog still gets a hold of these and eats them.  I go through about a dozen or more of these a year.  Ask me to write a review about my dog, I dare you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately I&#x27;ve been using a cheaper alternative - Stressgard II.  I prefer the SleepRight but, well, with the dog and all, it adds up.</li>
    <li> It works, and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m choking like the other one I tried.  It&#x27;s a lot better than having to keep going to the dentist for chipped teeth.</li>
    <li> Definitely improved my TMJ within 2 weeks of nightly use. The decrease in headaches and jaw pain is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I sure made a mistake in buying this one, since the last one I had broke, I got this because it was &amp;#34;4x more durable&amp;#34;, it didn&#x27;t dawn on me until my first night using it, that this meant the pad under the teach is really thick and hard as a rock, which makes it terribly uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate how expensive these things are, it likely cost them .50 cents to make and yet they sell them for an arm and leg.</li>
    <li> This is the first dental guard I have used that stays in all night.  That said, they are still not as comfortable as not wearing them at all.</li>
    <li> I liked this more durable than the ones you boil, stays in mouth nicely not as durable as the ones you get from the dentist but does the trick if you cant spend that much money</li>
    <li> I have gone through a lot of mouth guards, including ones custom made from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one lasts way longer.  Maybe not the 6 months as it states on the package, but definately longer than any other .</li>
    <li> It is not easy finding the right night guard for grinding.  I had one made for 400.00 by a dentist and hated it.  This one is better.  I used to use the smaller version but it fell out of my mouth at night.  Using the regular size solved the problem and now it does the job.</li>
    <li> Really good, but I have bitten through it already in about two months.&lt;br /&gt;So ordering another one. It&#x27;s good because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to swallow it in my sleep.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these, both came reasonably fast and have had better sleeps since using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can take a bit of getting used to, but worth it. Way fewer jaw/tooth pains already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really cheap too compared to some companies...there is a website who I won&#x27;t name selling this product for 88 euros!</li>
    <li> I ordered this dental guard to try out and it didn&#x27;t work for me.  It felt loose in my mouth and uncomfortable.  I used it one full night (woke up probably 50 times) and threw it across the room 1/2 thru the second night.  My dentist recommended trying one (his was $300+) to rule out night grinding as the source of mysterious tooth pain.  I have no signs of grinding so I didn&#x27;t think this was my problem and didn&#x27;t want to waste $300+  The unit also created a lot of saliva in my mouth.  Again, it didn&#x27;t work for me and I threw it out after night #2.</li>
    <li> I got this as a cheap &amp;#34;let&#x27;s see if it works&amp;#34; solution in lieu of the ridiculously expensive night guard my dentist was pushing.  It seems to help, but took a few nights to get used to in order to fall asleep comfortably.  It is easy to clean, and the storage case is handy for when you wake up.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Doesn&#x27;t fit at all in my mouth. Don&#x27;t waist your money like I did</li>
    <li> They do what they claim but they don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought about 20 of this exact model In the last 3 years, because of all the others I&#x27;ve tried, these are the best and most comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;But like all that I have tried, they last about two or three months, then they break apart and don&#x27;t work right.  Don&#x27;t work at all and too dangerous to use that way.&lt;br /&gt;I never got anywhere with returning them. So I just buy 5 or more when I find a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;They feel better than the three I had built by different dentists over the years.</li>
    <li> Fit great and actually stays in my mouth while I sleep. Glad I went with this one. After trying others this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a week now and it has helped my teeth! I dont wake up anymore with my teeth and jaws in pain. The first  night it was a little hard to get used to, but now its fine. (On the first night, I wore it for about 20 minutes before I acutally went to bed to help get used to it). It is a tad bulky in the cheeksuntil you get used to it. I can itleast close my mouth all the way. I find it great that you can change the size of the guard and its super easy. Its easy to clean and it comes with its own case to store it in. But this is a great product!</li>
    <li> For the price it is great. Just clean it with toothpaste every morning and it will lasts for about a year or more.</li>
    <li> This is of higher quality than your average night guard.  I typically will start wearing out night guards after 3 months because of teeth grinding but this one is built of better material.  The only negative is actually a major one - it&#x27;s bigger and therefore I can see that it can be uncomfortable for people with smaller mouths.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant because people were saying they bit through theirs within a week. I bought it anyways to make my own opinion. I only recently started grinding my teeth at night (and its more of clenching that grinding) and I have to say I really enjoy this mouth guard. First off, they offered a 6 month replacement guard if you bite through it. So that was a + for me. Also, its very low key and discreet not like a bulky sports guard. I was afraid I was going to have problems falling asleep with this weird object in my mouth but it doesn&#x27;t affect me falling asleep at all! Also I would like to note since wearing this particular sleep guard I (and my partner who uses the same one) have had more random dreams about chewing bubble gum than we ever had before. ha!</li>
    <li> This is my second Sleep Right Dental guard. I have tried several other brands and this is the most comfortable and also easiest to fit. Have recommended to many.</li>
    <li> Does not fit the best and has a tendency to irritate the upper jaw. Actually gave me a sore on the upper jaw</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I clinch my teeth while I sleep and was fitted with a very expensive mouth guard by my dentist.  But I couldn&#x27;t use it because it was so uncomfortable and felt like I had hard glass in my mouth.  I tried this Sleep Right dental guard and I love it!  It&#x27;s soft in my mouth and took very little time to get used to.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and feels malleable.  And it comes with a nifty case!  No mess no boiling and easy to adjust!</li>
    <li> We use that brand for the last 4 years.  They are good but... we need to replace them 3 times a year!!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this night guard is way too bulky. Even though it can be adjusted with sliders, I ex not able to set it to a comfortable position. The guard irritated the outside of my gums &amp; also fell out during the night.</li>
    <li> This is a much more inexpensive alternative to a custom made night guard/retainer from the dentist. The way this guard works is pretty simple, and works pretty well for a clencher like me. It works pretty simply--you bite down on flat strips with your back molars while side wings sit between your teeth and cheeks. A front strap that goes over and in front of your bottom teeth/gum line ensures the guard doesn&#x27;t slip back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to stress, I clench hard in my sleep. Days I&#x27;m under severe stress I clench so hard my jaws sometimes get lockjaw. I&#x27;ve had to see my physician a few times for this, and while I haven&#x27;t had as much stress lately, I can say this night guard does protect my teeth from further wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m due to get new crowns on my front teeth that I&#x27;ve ground down to see-through opacity, and with this night guard, I feel better about being protected in the future. At this price, it&#x27;s affordable enough to lose when traveling (this is a major consideration to take into account if you travel a lot or lose things frequently, because custom dental retainers costs thousands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this product is two of the wing flaps on the sides that sit between the cheeks and the gums/teeth can be a bit uncomfortable at first. It takes some getting used to, and even after a few days it still feels kind of weird to me. I have a medium sized mouth and the front strap that helps hold the guard in place barely reaches my bottom front gum line. Because this strap limits the length the guard sits back in your mouth, if you have a larger mouth your bicuspids instead of your back molars may be biting down and holding the guard in place, which may feel really weird.</li>
    <li> Apparently I have a big mouth because I about chocked on it. It just floated around in my mouth and I think I chewed and clenched worse because it wouldn&#x27;t stay in place. They did howeve take it back. :)</li>
    <li> These seems to work okay. Had some issues with it falling out, but I have gotten used to it. I think I will upgrade to something a little more sturdy soon, but I&#x27;ve been able to use it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband. Did not work.</li>
    <li> Too bulky and not at all comfortable for me.  Can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not comfortable and does not stay in place</li>
    <li> GREAT SET UP however to big for my daughters mouth so I tried to use it and one again to big.&lt;br /&gt;Would be great if they made a mini version.</li>
    <li> A good simple product once you get used to it.  I was suspicious of the product at first glance since there was not much to look at.  But it is comfortable and effective.</li>
    <li> No matter what size I make it, there is not a snug fit. Keeps coming out at night. Better to purchase a full mouth piece. I had a full mouth guard, that I unfortunately threw out thinking I would never use it again - wish I had kept it. The SleepRight guard is a piece of junk - the tiny strip that connects to two &amp;#34;silders&amp;#34; should have been wider as this tiny strip works its way up the front of your teeth. Be aware that it WILL change your bite - it is outrageously expensive - How they came up with $40 retail is beyond comprehension - there is no &amp;#34;money back guarantee&amp;#34; which should have been a red flag to me - Save your money. Wish I could give it a negative rating.</li>
    <li> There are ridges on the outside of the guard, I think they are supposed to be the temperature control part of the guard, but instead, they dig into my gums, making it unconfortable. After a month I have learned to ignore it, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this mouth guard. It also sometimes falls out of my mouth during the night. On the positive side, I have stopped waking up with migraines, so I am giving this 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Got this at the local pharmacy and tried it for a week.  I constantly woke up with my mouth open and horrible dry mouth so I returned it.  It seems like a durable, well-made product but the bite pads are too thick for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the SleepRight Secure Comfort version for several years and decided to replace it with the Dura Comfort version because of its longer claimed life. While it works, I find it significantly less comfortable because the material is thicker and harder than the previous version. This version also doesn&#x27;t seem to fit as well, perhaps because of its lower flexibility. I do not have any problems with my gums or mouth and will continue using it, but will return to the Secure Comfort model when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> These are really good.  The ones you get and have to boil only last a few days for me but these can last a month or more.  The only issue is that there is a small line that rubs my gums but I shaved it off with an Exacto knife.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied by the quality of this product. I have had night guards made at the dentist&#x27;s office, but they do not compare to Sleep Right. Sleep Right Dental Guards are easy to adjust and clean. And, they are a lot less expensive. The night guard that was made by my dentist cost $200.00 and did not last as long and was hard to keep clean. I recommend the Dura Comfort Dental Night Guards to anyone I know who grinds their teeth at night.</li>
    <li> If your dentist has told you that you have a grinding or clenching problem, don&#x27;t wait. Buy this now. This model is extra hardy and will last very long even for the worst clenchers. I&#x27;ve been using these for two years. You get used to sleeping with them after a couple nights. Then it becomes habit and you will automatically throw them in before bed. I initially bought a fancy custom dental guard from my dentist office for around $400. That was a mistake. I destroyed that thing with my clenching. Money down the drain. I found these Sleepright guards and they work a lot better. The best part is the warranty. SAVE THE PACKAGING! If you chew through it before a year is up (Mine last me usually 3 or 4 months) you can send them the destroyed guard and your reciept (easily accessible if you bought it on Amazon, just print a copy of your order invoice) and send it in. They will send you a brand new one in about two weeks. I love the customer service. Some people have complained about mouth sores, but I&#x27;ve never experienced that. Maybe they should clean their dental guard. Cleaning is easy. Just use your toothbrush and some mouthwash. It also comes with a handy little case to store it in. You adjust it to fit by moving the bite piece from four different positions. It&#x27;s easy to discern which notch it should rest on depending on the size of your mouth. No boiling is a plus. The boil mouthguards never would form right for me. This product has everything you need in a dental guard. So, if you clench or grind give this a try.</li>
    <li> One of the better mouth guards. Much better than the expensive ones made by dentist.&lt;br /&gt;It adjusts to fit bite.</li>
    <li> This is working out fine for me.  It arrived quickly and is very easy and comfortable to use.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good and the price on here was the best I could find.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this night guard... I have issues with my bite and am also a bruxism sufferer and also a snorer... this little guard has solved ALL my problems.  Love, Love, Love this... it is pretty comfortable (I mean really, what guard is super comfortable?)... it easy to clean, it is long lasting (I switch out every year or so and I grind pretty hard, lol...)... love this!  I also love the jawline it gives me.  When I don&#x27;t wear it, I notice my jaw pushes back in once again.. so definitely helps with that somewhat as well.  I don&#x27;t feel pain on the movement of my jaw either.</li>
    <li> without sleep right I would have broken teeth from clinching my jaw so hard at night. Also it is comfortable to wear</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouth guard for over a year now, but this was way cheaper than the Walgreens price. When I opened the box, all I could smell was mouthwash and could see yellow stains (which is normal after daily use). I was so disgusted, I returned it ASAP. I will not buy a mouth guard online again.</li>
    <li> It gave me dental problems because the silicone that keeps your teeth separated idoes not continue to separate all teeth.  It only separates the teeth at either end of the mouth.  Not separating all teeth created an uneven bite, and over a period of three or four years grinding the underside of my bridge damaged my lower teeth and walso ended up exposing more root nerves. That created pain.  My dentist told me that instead of the hard dental nightguard I could use the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard Advanced Comfort brand of night guard sold in drug stores. It is actually quite easy to fit, and since the inside is soft it does not give me a headache from grinding.  She also said the root exposure damage could possibly be repaired by using a product called MI Paste.  If SleepRight were to change the product so that the silicone separated top and bottom teeth all around your mouth this might be a viable product.</li>
    <li> This is definitely more durable than the regular night guards from this brand. I chewed through the regular one. But this was so hard I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> This sure beats those boil and mold types of night guards.  I tried a couple of brands and they just don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too small even adjust it to the max size and the guard is difficult to secure firmly in the mouth.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt my mouth. Thick plastic. This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand.</li>
    <li> This thing actually changed my bite. I started having a serious under bite. I bought it because I grind my teeth something fierce when I sleep and was hoping this would fix the problem. Not only did it retrain my bite, but I would wake up with a seriously sore jaw. I tried keeping with it for two months, hoping that the problems would remedy themselves and telling myself that this was the &amp;#34;breaking in&amp;#34; period, but I think 60 days is long enough. I couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore. It&#x27;s taken more than 6 months to get my bite back to normal and I STILL have a ways to go.</li>
    <li> My mouth is smaller and the pads to prevent the grinding are to thick, almost to the point where I can&#x27;t sleep with it. If you are a &amp;#34;Super Grinder&amp;#34;, this is the product for you. If you are just an average grinder, I would suggest trying to find a Sleep Right grinder that is thinner.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few brands and this one is the best value.  it does what it promises and it is significantly cheaper than having your dentist make you one.</li>
    <li> Bulky in the mouth.  I am made fun of (at first) by my fiance for having &amp;#34;chipmunk&amp;#34; cheeks.  She&#x27;s a sweetie... I ordered these after 3+ months of tooth pain.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well, is very comfortable &amp; doesnt come out while your sleeping.</li>
    <li> lucky ibought two one of them broke don&#x27;t know why but woke up must chew it or bite it btoke in two pieces</li>
    <li> I wore for six months or sometime longer as long as you take care of it like rinse and use mouthwash to clean it.  Always put in the case prevent temperature expose (it may crack).  I love it.  At first it will feel little pinch your inside skins but you have to keep readjusting until it fits right.  Better than ever than any other stores.</li>
    <li> For me, this works the best. Not bulky very comfortable and durable</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s overly bulky and can&#x27;t seem to get past the gag reflex. Not something I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> These help prevent me from grinding my teeth at night. I bring these wherever I go, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty hardcore grinder and this is a must have for me.  I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make me drool and it&#x27;s so easy to fit. Two thumbs up</li>
    <li> My first couple of Sleep Right Dental Guards came from my chiropractor who suggested I try  them for teeth clenching during the night which was causing horrible headaches the next day.  These have worked well and I never have the headaches anymore.  Each one lasts about 6-9 months before replacement is needed.  They have been a lifesaver for me.</li>
    <li> Uncomfortable and fell out the first night I used them.</li>
    <li> I have had several mouth guards.  From 80- 500.00.  This one works and the company does warranty it.  I am purchasing again because I have worn it (had for over 2 years) out but it does a great job</li>
    <li> Works well. It&#x27;s adjustable.</li>
    <li> I have tried many night guards and this one is the best. It was a little uncomfortable at first but hands down is the best all of the other ones I had chewed through within a month. This one has lasted me two years or so and only have a few teeth indents. Definitely recomend for people who are heavy grinders like me.</li>
    <li> People dont waste your money , it doesnt stay in your mouth falls out . Try somthing else its scary because is so small and you can choke on it . I had to tie  a string on it so i wouldn&#x27;t swallow it . Not worth the $25 dollars . Retail $40 Crazy  . JUNK!!</li>
    <li> Good product.  The TMJ type feeling has only happened twice with several years in between.  I used this both times and it has provided instant relief.  I think I wear mine upside down. If it works don&#x27;t fix it....</li>
    <li> This is a good mouthguard, but the first one I bought broke within a week of using. This has lasted a bit longer. It does feel like you arent wearing anything at all.</li>
    <li> First few nights the guard is a little stiff but once it molds to teeth it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> These teeth guards are designed to take up very little room in your mouth and protect your teeth from grinding while you sleep. I have tried a lot of different types of guards (from ones designed for basketball players to similar, but smaller ones designed for teeth grinding) and these are by far the most comfortable. There are several different sizes of SleepRight guards, so make sure you check them out online first. The sizes are: Dura-Comfort, Secure-Comfort, Slim-Comfort and Select. The ones in this package are the Dura-Comfort. They are made of soft plastic, you can wash them in soap and water. They will NOT last forever. I replace them about once a year. They come with a carrying case. No boiling is required to make them fit. They are somewhat adjustable. The price varies so shop around.</li>
    <li> It protects my teeth without being obtrusive to my sleep.  I&#x27;ve had three.  They last at least 4 years on average.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I replace it about once every three months and I&#x27;ve been using it for maybe 9. I experience less jaw tension during the day even and wake up feeling overall better. My partner is thrilled about not having to massage my jaw so that she can get back to sleep, too! ^_^</li>
    <li> I use these mouth guards every night. They work very well, and I am pleased with my purchase!! Great mouth guards.</li>
    <li> This needs to be a little softer for me to use it everyday. The sides are too hard for me to keep in for me to keep it in my mouth all night, it irritates my gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years to prevent me from grinding my teeth to powder, and they are much cheaper online than at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> These are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guards have been great for a number of years.  Comfortable, and ready to wear right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint had been that they didn&#x27;t last long enough, but a few months ago this manufacturer changed the material used for the bite piece, and now they last for several months.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great, durable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple mouth guards now for night grinding and by far this is the worst. It seems like a simple but effective design save one major problem and that is, a bit ironically comfort. Dura Comfort is the most uncomfortable mouth guard I&#x27;ve experienced. I&#x27;ve given it a full week and I still wake up uncomfortable. The guards and adjustable parts rub against sensitive areas on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll head back to Dentek professional fit. They don&#x27;t last more than a few months but I sleep well in them.</li>
    <li> I found it very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t stay in my mouth all night.</li>
    <li> This thing is horribly uncomfortable and does not stay in place. I have tried adjusting it several different ways but it still falls out of my mouth while I&#x27;m sleeping. I thought one of these might work for my teeth grinding but looks like I will have to break down and get a real one from the dentist.</li>
    <li> This product works for me and had no problems with the fit.  I have used this product for approximately 6 months before I ordered new ones. Found it cheaper at Amazon as compared to the big name drug store.</li>
