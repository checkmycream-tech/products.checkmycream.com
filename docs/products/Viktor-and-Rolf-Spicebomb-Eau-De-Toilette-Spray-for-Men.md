<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is officially a men&#x27;s fragrance but I love it and wear it anyway!</li>
    <li> This is not the real cologne. It smells like a cheap knock-off. The smell does not last long and it is faintly resembles the real Spice Bomb.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Maybe&amp;#34; not real, but super close. I have a bottle of real stuff from a dept store so I did a shoot out. The cheap stuff has more a tiny tiny bit more alcohol to the finish or something. That said, it&#x27;s pretty darn close. For all intents and purposes, it&#x27;s the same stuff.</li>
    <li> I first smelled it walking through a department store in Mexico City on a business trip and fell in love.  I don&#x27;t wear it everyday but when I do it gives me a whole different attitude for the day.  It just has a really great scent - it&#x27;s a sweet, spicy musk - very unique and like no other.  It is the kind of scent that throughout the day makes people turn their heads to see where it is coming from.  I swear people come into my office just to breath the air!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really the bomb!</li>
    <li> Came in authentic box and smells just like the bottles I&#x27;ve purchased over the last two years.</li>
    <li> I love the spice scent of this fragrance. My second order of this brand and most importantly my wife loves it....</li>
    <li> Great and the bottling is neat.</li>
    <li> My boyfrined just loved this perfum and i did it too !!!!!</li>
    <li> Items arrived on time, and smells amazing on my man</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> This smells pretty good, and is a fresh summer scent that is not overpowering. I personally would like it a little less fruity smelling, since I am not a woman, but the girls that I have asked seemed to like it.</li>
    <li> Smells so good on my hubby. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.. My favorite!!</li>
    <li> Nice smell that stands out.</li>
    <li> My son commented that Everytime he wears this , he gets multiple compliments. So I decided to get my grandson a bottle for a gift. Guess what!!! Yep- same reaction , he said &amp;#34; Wow,Gram I got girls all day saying , you smell so good. So for the men in my life this is a winner.</li>
    <li> This is a fake knock-off that Amazon is now reimbursing me on.  Smells great when you first put it on... Then it evaporates and the smell is COMPLETELY gone.  Moreover, it takes about 10 sprays to equate to the same intensity of ONE pump of Spice Bomb dispensed from a genuine bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> One of the best colognes out there.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I will provide an excellent review of this fragrance only because it is the best smelling fragrance I have had, and I have had some good ones. This is definitely a winter fragrance. It has a very sweet smell, but a hint of musk underneath which knocks down the sweetness a bit. The bottle alone is the bomb (no pun) and the little pull pin also acts as a safety mechanism against accidental pumps.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome Mens fragrance, doesnt smell like any fragrance out there</li>
    <li> This has a cedar based scent and I LOVE it. Bought it for a boyfriend and I just cant get over the scent. Love it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Either you like it or not</li>
    <li> this is a really great smelling fragrance one of my top 5 favorites.I highly recommend this.it reminds me a little bit of apple pie.</li>
    <li> The package was destroyed but the cologne was in great condition. Love it</li>
    <li> The scent is very weak and it doesn&#x27;t last very long on my skin. The color is also a little lighter than the ones in the store which leads me to question its authenticity.</li>
    <li> After smelling this fragrance at Macy&#x27;s I decided to check out Amazon and see if I could find it at a better price. I&#x27;ve always purchased cologne from Macys, Dillards, etc etc and was a bit leery about buying something like this online but I figured I&#x27;d take a chance. The package was just as it should be and it simply smells amazing. If you&#x27;re looking for something a bit different you can&#x27;t go wrong with Spicebomb!</li>
    <li> Spicebomb came out in January 2012 from the perfume lab of Olivier Polge, working in the division of Viktor &amp; Rolf of l&#x27;Oreal.  It is a woodsy, sweet and spicy explosion of scents; a mixture of fire and ice. The heat is provided by pepper, tobacco, white leather, saffron and cinnamon. The chill includes a fragrant burst of bergamot, elemi, grapefruit and pink pepper.  This blend gives it substantial longevity and a robust sillage, therefore minimal application is advised and it is best used in cool to cold weather; it is a winter fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The top notes are bergamot, grapefruit, pink pepper and elemi. Mid notes are cinnamon, saffron and paprika. Base are tobacco, vetiver and white leather. It may be similar in composition to some other fragrances but the proportions of its blend makes it unique. At first the spice and citrus manifest vibrantly with a touch of sweetness from cinnamon and elemi; after a few minutes it dissipates and a spicy aroma with fresh sweet tobacco envelops your nose. As it settles on the skin within the first four hours, cinnamon diluted with tobacco and pink pepper dominate.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers liken SB to Paco Rabanne&#x27;s \\&quot;One Million\\&quot;, Thierry Mugler&#x27;s \\&quot;Pure Havane\\&quot; or \\&quot;London Burberry\\&quot;; it maybe be so but I disagree, it reminds me somewhat of \\&quot;Hermessence\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabien Baron designed the grenade-shaped bottle to emphasis the explosive motif.&lt;br /&gt;Olivier Polge (Dior Homme!, Kenzo Power, Midnight in Paris) has since been hired by Chanel, in July 2013, to work in the perfume lab with his father Jacques and Christopher Sheldrake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spicebomb won 2 FiFi awards (the Oscars of the fragrance industry) as People&#x27;s Choice for Men and Reader&#x27;s Choice for Men, for 2013.&lt;br /&gt;Spicebomb is an exotic extrovert, oriental spicy, sweet, and aromatic fragrance for men that is most suitable for individuals over the age of maturity.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is available as 50 and 90 ml Eau de Toilette with 200 ml shower gel and 100 ml after shave balm.balm.</li>
    <li> Smells like a dream. I get compliments every where I go. Delicious.</li>
    <li> ladies love it by the way guys so I would be buying another bottle once mines gets low.not that common yet so get it while its fresh</li>
    <li> The smell is not what i though but my wife seems not to mind it. It smells like you have been cooking or backing something sweet more then a cologne.</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne I have ever worn. I have been through a lot of different scents, but this is the only one that is a consistent winner.</li>
    <li> This is just about the best scent I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and I love the scent!!!  Very manly.  I would definitely buy it again and recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and it smells so good! It makes me super attracted to him and sometimes I even spray it on because its a sexy scent. It is such good quality that you can spray it one time and it lingers (in a positive way). This scent is a total turn-on so good gift for that special guy!</li>
    <li> Came on time, and appears to be real.  It came in what appeared to be original packaging, plastic wrap, had all the appropriate stickers and identification/bar codes, and most importantly smells real.  Been wearing it for a few hours now and the smell is still very strong.  Amazing scent.  I took pictures of the unboxing along with the bar codes and stickers but I am unable to post them here for some reason.  I got it shipped directly from Amazon, so I guess that hopefully ensures quality control.  If you were like me and hesitant about spending this kind of money for cologne and being ripped off with a fake, you shouldn&#x27;t be.  I would just advise to get it from Amazon, as I believe they go through a brief verification process before it ships.  Overall it has to be my favorite cologne - or at least on par with Prada Amber (another great one).  Hope this helps people!</li>
    <li> ORIGINAL FRAGRANCE&lt;br /&gt;VERY PLEASED</li>
    <li> Just got the package today and already spread it on :)  this is going the legitimate package that comes in plastic wrap it is official not a knockoff.!</li>
    <li> This is a chic magnet and the best fragrance money can buy in my opinion. I have gotten tons of compliments from women of all works of life. This fragrance has a distinct and peculiar aroma that distinguishes it from the others and it can be worn on both night and day. It has a lasting projection and the scent becomes irresistible.</li>
    <li> Great deal! $45 less than Lord &amp; Taylor. Smell&#x27;s great. The &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; loves it.</li>
    <li> Great scent .. Matched description perfectly</li>
    <li> I got it on time in a sealed box.  Everything how it suppose to.  It smells great.  Definitively a must have. It&#x27;s spicy in a good way.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff and was the best price we found. People who have had issues, I would recommend making sure it&#x27;s being sold directly from amazon. Ours arrived in its package with no evidence of tampering.</li>
    <li> I love spicebomb and my husband does too. I bought it for his birthday;  he practically wears it all the time now.</li>
    <li> This was a good deal!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great product. My husband loves it and I do too :-)</li>
    <li> Makes my fianc&amp;eacute; smell AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, unforgettable fragrance. All the women love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome husband loves it. Cash shipping</li>
    <li> I love this item!! One of the best in my closest today. Great gift for any man looking to get that special lady.</li>
    <li> Girls love this stuff. I have gotten laid at least a dozen times because of it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love when my honey wears this scent!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this from Amazon. It is the genuine product, sealed and came with code under the cover. My girlfriend loves the way it smells. This is the same product sold in stores. Make sure it&#x27;s sold by Amazon when you purchase and you should be good to go. Huge cost savings compared to some other stores. Isn&#x27;t dilluted, lasts all day!!</li>
    <li> It was a fake. The outer box did have clear wrapping. But the inside of the box was tampered with. Also the smell only lasts about an hour.</li>
    <li> I am a big cologne guy, own about 28 active colognes currently all top tier name brands and smells, a friend had this spicebomb which I never heard of and I immediately knew I had to have it, smells extremely expensive, masculine and will be sure to grab attention.</li>
    <li> BRAND NEW! It was a fair price, received earlier than promised.</li>
    <li> Viktor &amp; Rolf have another hit with Spicebomb only this time it&#x27;s for men! It&#x27;s hard to find a great fragrance for men but this one hit&#x27;s the mark!</li>
    <li> The scent of this fragrance is warm and welcoming. I like to smell good, but many fragrances give me a headache. Spicebomb covers me on both of those fronts.</li>
    <li> Great smell lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> I have always worn cologne and I have never had more women asking what I was wearing than they have since I started using Spicebomb.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!!!</li>
    <li> The scent is perfect and lasts.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes a nice gift.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Real nice,  top flight cologne every man should have one, love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this second bottle for a friend who loved  the decent on me. This is marketed as a men&#x27;s cologne but it is a great woman&#x27;s cologne also. Everyone loves the scent. The price is great too considering what department stores are selling this for (about $40.00 a bottle more). I would highly recommend this. One friend is ordering it for herself but to share with her teenage son.</li>
    <li> This stuff smell amazing. I now have my go-to cologne.</li>
