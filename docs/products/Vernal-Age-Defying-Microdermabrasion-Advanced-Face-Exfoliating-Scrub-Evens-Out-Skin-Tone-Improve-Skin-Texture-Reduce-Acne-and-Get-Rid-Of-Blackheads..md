      <li>Honestly I misread the price of $48 thought it was $28.</li>
      <li>A lot of people don&#x27;t know that when you turn 20 your body doesn&#x27;t make collagen on its own so now</li>
      <li>I find it it be a highly effective skin care product and will make this part of my regiment from now on.</li>
      <li>This exfoliator is a perfect addition to any regimen since it has greatly reduced my redness and overall evened out my skintone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so impressive, I&#x27;m going to sign up for monthly deliveries of this product to ensure I have a steady supply---and that&#x27;s something I never do.</li>
      <li>The exfoliant is very fine but effective.</li>
      <li>is by far the BEST at home microdermabrasion scrub that I have come across.</li>
      <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin, but for others who have problematic skin like me, this stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best exfoliator in my opinion for its price.</li>
      <li>Anyway using this microdermabrasion scrub does feel great though, I love being able to lightly exfoliate every time I shower and then once or twice a week per the instructions.</li>
      <li>When you rinse it off it leaves the most amazing tingling sensation on your skin.</li>
      <li>I am a 47 year old who is in the great outdoors a good deal of the time.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is great - very gentle but still leaves my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is so wonderful that it takes off my eye makeup, all while being super gentle and cleansing out my pores!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good product.just used it and was awesome.it leave the skin soft.will try to use further and put my reviews.got this product in exchange of review.</li>
    <li> Whenever I order a product online, especially anything beauty related, I typically try not to get myself too excited for the product until I use it.  This microdermabrasion scrub exceeded any expectation I had.  I had the expectations that this product was going to be maybe just ok but I was wrong it was great!  The scent makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a high end spa in my own bathroom.  I love it.  As for the performance of the product, it does everything a good scrub should do.  I have had my friends try a little and they went home and ordered it right away.  This scrub is the only scrub I use now and plan on using in the future.</li>
    <li> This is truly a product that does what it says! I usually go for the foaming face washes because I feel they &#x27;clean&#x27; better, so I was hesitant this would do anything for taking my makeup off. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll do much when you put it on your face but after the first wash I was a believer. I always have a hard time removing eye makeup. This cleanser is so wonderful that it takes off my eye makeup, all while being super gentle and cleansing out my pores! Leaves my skin super soft and doesn&#x27;t strip it from its natural oils. GREAT product.</li>
    <li> it makes my face so smooth and it took out some small grains l had.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product!!  My skin looks amazing!!  I will keep buying this.</li>
    <li> So far I love it! Def tingles/burns a little but did not leave my face red at all. Noticing the difference it&#x27;s making on my pores. Using at least 3xs a week.</li>
    <li> This scrub is good for a once a day use in my opinion because it feels so gentle on the skin but gets the results. I’ve used so many scrubs over the years that feel like I’m ripping off multiple layers of my skin when using them but with this scrub I feel that it gives me a comfortable, healthy result. My normally flakey skin is no longer flakey and my skin looks great overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous facial scrubbers and microdermabrasion. Vernal is a very gentle scrub, moisturizing and great for sensitive skin but if u need a real scrub, this isn&#x27;t for u.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I read them extensively before purchasing (not really fair, now is it).  I REALLY love this stuff, so much so that out of the ridiculous number of things I buy off Amazon(the ups guy probably thinks its xmas at my house everyday) it was only fair to write a review.  I have terrible skin from acne scars, smoking, tanning, etc.  I took a chance on this, after all it isn&#x27;t cheap.  The first time I used it was the best, I can&#x27;t even describe the feeling but as I massaged the scrub on my face it was the best tingle I&#x27;ve ever felt from a cleanser.  There is no denying my skin was smoother after that very first use.  There is no magic anything out there and my gross skin will never look like that of a Precious Moments doll but I can say that this has helped improve my skin.  The dark spots have lessened and I don&#x27;t seem to be getting as many cystic breakouts like before.  If I wasn&#x27;t so vain I would have taken before and after pictures.  I use it everyday despite what the instructions say.  I also use the hydraulic serum but I&#x27;m not as committed to the brand and the serum as I am with this scrub.  If you&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing works, you probably have crappy skin just like me... bottom line, just try it.</li>
    <li> Gentle. Great service.</li>
    <li> 5/21/2015 5/28/2015 I am not at all clear as to why I still have a few large white heads on my chin. I have opened them with a sterilize needle applied hot water COMPRESSES  to open the pores, and still they persist. SO, I assume your product isn&#x27;t working. I will continue using the rest of this product , i will let you know if the white heads disappear if they do. AT THIS POINT I&#x27;M GUESSING THEY WILL NOT.. I DID NOT HAVE THIS BAD A PROBLEM AS A TEEN AGER..</li>
    <li> Nice facial scrub can&#x27;t see any changes in my skin; I&#x27;m sure it is doing what is it suppose to do.  A little on the pricey side though.  A little goes a long way.  Most likely this jar will last for six months or more; time will tell if I reorder. Honestly I misread the price of $48 thought it was $28. As a Prime Member and a Prime Product I didn&#x27;t pay shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle but thorough cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using this line for several months and have visible changes. My skin is clearer, brighter and tighter.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything special for my skin.  will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product free. It works awesome. It makes my completion smooth and skin soft. My daughter tried the microdermabrasion creme also and feel in love with it.  Looks like I&#x27;ll reordering it sooner than i expected:)</li>
    <li> You can feel a difference after the first use.  My skin feels so soft like baby skin every time I use it.  According to Vernal, the micro beads are organic, made from jojoba seeds. Also there are no parabens or sulfates in it&#x27;s formula.  It smells great. It is not too abrasive, in other words the beads feel smooth and &amp;#34;rounded&amp;#34; not rough and scratchy. With my sensitive skin I can use it even with my Olay Pro-X cleansing brush with feeling like I&#x27;m shredding my skin with broken glass. Afterward my skin feels so clean, smooth, and taut creating the optimum surface and condition for my serums and moisturizers. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> i received this product a little over a week ago. I have used it as my every other night face wash regimine. I love the way my skin looks and feels as well my husband said he noticed a difference in the over all health of my skin. Just looks brighter. thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an exfoliating cleanser regularly because of my dry, sensitive, aging skin, but this is gentle and leaves the skin feeling quite smooth and soft without irritation. I started with a sample and just bought the full size product.</li>
    <li> After using, the skin has a very clean and radiant feelings.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this scrub! It&#x27;s truly one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used at a medimum price. The consistency is like very fine and when you rub it in you actually feel it working, grinding away all the dead skin cells on your face. When you rinse it off it leaves the most amazing tingling sensation on your skin. Yes, the cost is a factor - and I wish there was more of it for the price, but I only use it twice a week as it is suggested and to me, the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> Let me say when I first saw the name of this product, I was worried because of the word &amp;#34;Microdermabrasion&amp;#34; Traditionally when I do microdermabrasion treatments at the spa, its pretty painful and my skin stays red for a week when its trying to recover from the treatment. This exfoliate did not do that. I was so happy about this product because the exfoliant isn&#x27;t too hard on my skin and helps remove the little dirt with out the pain that comes from a traditional facial. The fragrance also isn&#x27;t too strong and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on my skin like other exfoliates when I was it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****I received this product free as part of a promotion*****</li>
    <li> The lotion container I received was cracked in the inside (it&#x27;s like a container within a container) and had a little leakage, but I was able to return for a full refund without any issues.</li>
    <li> I am 25 years old and I love this product. It helps with the most of the blemishes that I tend to get about a few times a month and it also leaves my skin smooth and very refreshed. I must tell you even though I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or have any sun spots/age spots, I love the fact that it is Anti-Aging. A lot of people don&#x27;t know that when you turn 20 your body doesn&#x27;t make collagen on its own so now is a good time to start with skin replenishing and anti-aging products. I am not saying go crazy but it is time to start really taking care of you skin especially if you are one of those individuals who worry about wrinkles and all the other stuff that happens with your skin because of aging. Also, always follow up with a moisturizer.The product size is good, it lasts. Price fits tight budget too. Only downside to this product, usually have to buy this product online.</li>
    <li> i love this product, skin feels great after use, wish it wasnt so expensive so i could use it every day</li>
    <li> This product will work magic unlike any other you have ever witnessed. Upon application you simply need to sit back and watch, the age disappears instantly before your eyes at a rather steady rate. If you are an expert at timing and fancy yourself as an opportunist, you can apply this product to an individual and simply wait until they are at the perfect age that turns you on the most and then have lots of ravenous sex. The caveat is to not act upon your instincts once the individual you are having your way with gets below the legal age. Then of course, you must apply this to yourself to keep things moral and stay out of the pokey.</li>
    <li> This scrub helped me a lot with balancing my skin. It&#x27;s a small jar so I use just a little bit at a time. I like the smell and the fragrance isn&#x27;t over-powering. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day if needed. This exfoliator is a perfect addition to any regimen since it has greatly reduced my redness and overall evened out my skintone.</li>
    <li> Well priced microdermabrasion. Made my 64 year old mom try it today and she actually loves it too. Made my skin feel like babys butt! I have oily skin but im also sensitive and im fine with the product. The crystals are tiny so they dont irritate my face whatsoever. It might make it a tiny tiny bit red but thats the virgin skin coming through. Im staying loyal to this one my hunt has finally ended for the right exfoliator. Love ittttt!</li>
    <li> This product truly does provide results almost as great as an in-office micro. I am a 47 year old who is in the great outdoors a good deal of the time. After usage, your skin will feel like you went to the spa.....for a fraction of the cost. Be careful not to rub too hard, the granules are very fine. You will notice that your skin is softer and smoother with a nice natural glow after the first use. Only downfall is that is is pricey. It is a luxury product with a price tag to match. This is THE top item in my beauty routine, and I will never give it up!</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a jar with the top shattered in many pieces.  The product is oozing out. I want to return it but don’t know what to put it in.</li>
    <li> Great product for controlling adult acne. Really cleans the skin and unclog the pours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vendor does not know its customers. Although I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for a year, I continue to get correspondence as if it was my first purchase; even a request for &amp;#34;a picture of my display!!&amp;#34;.  I will no longer be a customer.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I stopped getting dermatologist peels to save and put some money in my pocket, and then invested in Copper Peels. I really did not see any results in the Copper Peel and feeling a mixture of disappointment and curiosity, I then invested in Vernal Microdermabrasion Skin Exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I knew I made the right decision in purchasing this wonderful product! The smell is incredible and my skin is soft and smooth. Nothing beats a real peel from a dermatologist, but this product is very close.</li>
    <li> I am 33 and never  had skin issues until after the birth of my second son. I have also been into preventative skin care and now that I am over 30 and I have been stepping it up a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;I used an exfoliant (similar to this one) twice weekly.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the BEST at home microdermabrasion scrub that I have come across. First time I used I thought it felt and smelled a lot like other products I have tried but when I rinsed off I could immediately tell a difference...I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face because it was THAT soft. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> loved it! works amazing and you dont need to use alot!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best exfoliator in my opinion for its price. I have mildly sensitive skin, but this isn&#x27;t harsh for me at all. I use it in between facials. It is pricey but worth every penny.. All that I have to say is that I used it ONCE and received compliments on my skin the very next day. Incredible!</li>
    <li> I just bought this today and I am in love! It cleared all the pores on my nose, which is a trouble area for me. My skin looks brighter and my black heads were nonexistant after three uses. This one does exactly what it says. Did not dry out my skin, made it soft. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and this product works wonders, exfoliates deeply but softly at the same time. . I typically use this 2-3 times a week &amp; I&#x27;ll tell you, nothing else I&#x27;ve tried quite exfoliates my pores out like this scrub does. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin, but for others who have problematic skin like me, this stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Got this as a sample with my order and then purchased the full size and I Love,love,love this product !! I have very sensitive skin and this product does not upset it. Smells &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and pleasant. After only three uses it already cleared up my back and cheek area some. I can&#x27;t usually use scrubs more than once per week but this one I can. A little goes a LONG way. This will last you ages. I hope this product never discontinues. So far, my skin LOVES this stuff! I wish it was in a squeeze tube instead of the tub because it does get a little messy. BUT I can live with that! :-) It has helped immensely.</li>
    <li> This facial exfoliant smells nice and moisturizes as it scrubs. Exfoliator is mild sandy sort of grit, but careful not to overscrub. Slow small circles worked around face for minute or 2 is all you need if you have sensitive skin. Worth the priced I paid? Sure - compare to most of the others out there in the high $70&#x27;s. Well priced.</li>
    <li> Its ok and works as expected</li>
    <li> I like this product. Within the first day of me using this my face had begun to clear up and now today I have minimum break out and no bumps at all. I have noticed also my skin complexion is more even and less irritated.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth again.  Since I started using it a week ago, at least once a day someone tells me I am glowing!  Great product!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t that I dislike the smell of this scrub, I just would like something maybe a little more citrus i.e. grapefruit, tangerine, but that&#x27;s where body lotion comes in. Anyway using this microdermabrasion scrub does feel great though, I love being able to lightly exfoliate every time I shower and then once or twice a week per the instructions. It does a great job and clearing my pores and exfoliates like a dream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this many weeks now. I love how it works. Do not let the price scare you, this lasts a good month or two if used sparingly. I am a 37 year old who is in the outside a good deal of the time. My skin tends to have some dry patches where exposed and then the rest of my skin is combination. It works well on all areas. I&#x27;ve never experienced breakouts from usage and I have somewhat sensitive skin. I used as directed and after rinsing my skin was glowing and smooth, not at all red or irritated as it sometimes gets after using these types of products. The tiny micro seed beads feel amazing and after you wash them away with warm water, your face feels icy cool, though I don&#x27;t think there is any menthol in the ingredients. I will definitely be repurchasing again.</li>
    <li> I really love this exfoliant. It leaves my skin so soft and has reduced the black heads on my nose by a lot. It smells very nice too. Of course it has the little beads that help to exfoliate your skin. You should use it at least twice a week to get the best results. It&#x27;s an amazing product. I did receive it to review</li>
    <li> I just got it and used it for the first time!  It shipped fast and was packaged well. It&#x27;s in a smaller container then what I expected but still there is plenty enough to use and it goes on easily as long as your face is damp. It has a pretty strong smell to it but its not necessarily a bad smell and I think is pretty common to other types of face washes I&#x27;ve used. It made my skin feel fresh and clean and so far I like it. I&#x27;ll leave more feedback/(update this post) on it after a few days to make sure my feedback helps people.</li>
    <li> I have noticed no difference except in wrinkles, discoloration, etc. but it did make my skin a little smoother. I did noticed that there is a burning sensation and it leaves my skin dry so I may be too sensitive for it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an exfoliator that didn&#x27;t feel like it was removing way more of my skin than an exfoliator should, and actually improved my skin at the same time. This one does that, leaving soft, smooth skin that looks healthier over time. I&#x27;m not sure how much less visible my pores are, but my skin does otherwise feel better after using this for awhile. It also has a pleasant scent and is gentle on the skin. A little goes a long way, too, which is great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! It makes your skin feel completely fresh. This product just replaced my long-time love, Laura Mercier exfoliator. I was a bit hesitant, as it&#x27;s pricey... a whole $15 more than the Laura Mercier, but decided to try it anyway. This is the finest grained microdermabrasion scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. It exfoliates wonderfully but it was still gentle! And in the end, my skin looked amazing and felt soft and smooth. Since then I&#x27;ve been using it every other morning as recommended!.</li>
    <li> This product works good on my chin area. It does whiten the area of the acne. I will recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I like it but not worth the price!</li>
    <li> I really, really love this product. I feel 20 times prettier after using it! My skin literally looks like it&#x27;s glowing. I used it last night on my acne scar-filled face. There is one large, bright red scar in particular that has lead me to consider getting laser resurfacing (for god knows how much). When I woke up this morning and looked in the mirror, all of my scars, and the large one in particular were MUCH lighter. My face is so smooth, and my complexion is glowing! I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> My new favorite exfoliator. The texture feels like very tiny sand particles which leave my skin feel polished and clean. I only use maybe a pea size of product so even though it&#x27;s very expensive I would say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub.  It is not too harsh and my skin is so smooth when I get done.  I use it 2-3 times a week as it says and it really does make a difference.  The whole line when used together has given me great results in reduction of lines and a more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> Started seeing results in a week. It really works</li>
    <li> This product is great! I have sensitive skin (rosacea) and it exfoliates without irritating. I love how soft it gets my face, how fresh I feel after I use it, and the fact that it does not dry out my skin! Best face microdermabrasion I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve tried everything...from very expensive brands all the way to the cheap stuff. This is the best!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I followed the directions, and I thought at first it felt like tiny little pieces of grain. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I rinsed my face and noticed that all the little blackheads on my nose and AROUND my nose are almost gone! It&#x27;s like the exfoliant cleared out all the dead skin on top allowing new skin to be exposed. I was even able to squeeze out all the gunk (whiteheads) out of the corner of my mouth and under my chin where I find it most difficult to remove. For the first time in forever (ha!), I was able to finally squeeze out those stubborn whiteheads without much effort. Being that this is such a powerful exfoliant, I allowed 7 days in between usage. The direction says to allow 3 days. I will continue to use this and alternate with my Ole Walnut Scrub. Great product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this purchase.  It was quite expensive compared to other microderm-abrasion products on the market and doesn&#x27;t have the scrubbing properties that I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> After a full two weeks of constant usage at 3 times a week I can say that this product truly does provide results almost as great as an in-office micro. After application my skin always feels amazing afterwards. You will notice that your skin is softer and smoother with a nice natural glow after the first use. Also, the jar  is a fantastic upgrade to the packaging; it is even more convenient to use now!</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff i recommend it to everyone and company is great to deal with shipped earlier than expected thank you a customer for life</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s worth so much money, it works just like other scrubs.</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical because this was the first Vernal product I&#x27;ve tried. It definitely feels like my skin is cleaner after using this.It&#x27;s way better than the Kate Somerville that I&#x27;ve used. A little bit goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or skin feeling stripped. The price is a bit much, but if it lasts for a while it&#x27;s good with me.</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO DO MUCH AS FOR THE AGE DEFYING STUFF</li>
    <li> Feels so good to the skin. I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> The best exfoliator, in my opinion. Although the price is high, this jar will last a long time. I have found this to be the best when it comes to those little flaky places that pop up periodically to terrorize us for whatever reason. I use it on these little irritating spots, and my foundation immediately goes on smoothly. My pores are smaller and my skin looks bright, clear, and I even have a glow going! My skin is far less oily, although I can get a little shiny at the end of the day, but this cream has made a HUGE difference in the way my skin looks and feels. I love it and I&#x27;m not trying to hide under makeup, which is monumental for me!</li>
    <li> One of my friends recommended this product and I was truly impressed. I use this once a week, mostly because it&#x27;s a little pricey. My complexion is pink toned and lots of skincare products make my face red but this actually calms the redness down some. It leaves my face feeling smooth and rejuvenated. If there is am annoying itch on my face or small blemishes they usually go away after I use this product. Good Buy.</li>
    <li> I use this product once a week for the last few months. It leaves my face feeling smooth and rejuvenated. If there is am annoying itch on my face or small blemishes they usually go away after I use this product. It has decreased my acne scars, made my pores smaller, and made my skin radiant and smooth. I highly recommend it. Good Buy.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff and Just ordered my second jar. Not much there, but the results I see makes it worth the price. I have found that it works best if I apply it to my face without water and work it around using circular motions. I then add water to rinse it off. My skin feels cool and tingly, refreshed and soft. Sometimes I use it with my Clarisonic brush. I wish I could use it daily, and I would if the price was less.</li>
    <li> It had a decent smell, but quite honestly it didn&#x27;t do a SINGLE thing to heal my acne! It also didn&#x27;t even come with much at all!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I followed the directions, and I thought at first it felt like tiny little pieces of grain. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I rinsed my face and noticed that all the little blackheads on my nose and AROUND my nose are almost gone! It&#x27;s like the exfoliant cleared out all the dead skin on top allowing new skin to be exposed. I was even able to squeeze out all the gunk (whiteheads) out of the corner of my mouth and under my chin where I find it most difficult to remove. For the first time in forever (ha!), I was able to finally squeeze out those stubborn whiteheads without much effort. Being that this is such a powerful exfoliant, I allowed 7 days in between usage. The direction says to allow 3 days. I will continue to use this and alternate with my Ole Walnut Scrub. Great product</li>
    <li> So I got this product nearly a week ago to help clear my pores on my face and remove blackheads and whiteheads in my T-zone area, especially my nose. This honestly worked great for me! It&#x27;s a coarse scrub but I didn&#x27;t find it abrasive, because the scrub particles are more like tiny little pearls, and less like shards. My skin gets very dry when it&#x27;s cold out like now, but I think it&#x27;s moisturizing enough for my combo to normal skin. So it&#x27;s okay in my book!</li>
    <li> This is a great Non-drying, creamy, exfoliating granules (that don&#x27;t dissolve), leaves face supple &amp; polished. I was hesitant to buy this because over time exfoliators usually are too harsh for me and I breakout after. Surprisingly this is gentle and very effective! My skin was very smooth and i didn&#x27;t break out at all. I will definitely buy this again but it will probably last me a good 2 months as suggested use.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional exfoliant. The first thing I noticed was the great scent. Then the scrubbing power was gentle but good enough that I could see a difference in my skin. Because I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of it I think its well worth the price as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Been Purchasing From Amazon For A Long Time And Read Reviews Before Purchasing Something New. Most Of These Reviews Are Not From People Who Actually Bought The Product HeRe. When I Filter For Items With 4 Star Rating, I Expect It To Be Real Ratings From Real Customers. For This, I WILL NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.</li>
    <li> As someone else mentioned in a review, I also got this as a sample and it is truly very, very nice. The crystal beads are so tiny that they don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. It smells great and it&#x27;s gentle on your skin. No need to scrub harshly--nice and slow exfoliation for just a few minutes will do the trick. Worth every penny of this product. I really feel like my face looks brighter when I use it.</li>
    <li> Product does exactly what it says it will do. My face feels softer and I can see an improvement in the overall condition of my skin. Ill definitely keep using this product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff! It has a good amount of grit to it and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I thought the crystals would be a lot more pronounced than they are. They are extremely fine.  So, if your face is very wet in the shower, you might have a tendency to wash them away. However, that said, I have noticed a difference. Though I am using the cream every other day and also in conjunction with a glycolic wash that also exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to appreciate &amp;#34;gentle exfoliation&amp;#34; more since I think a lot of harsh exfoliation in the past has exacerbated acne scars rather than get rid of them, but it&#x27;s tough.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vernal scrub for about 2 weeks (about 3 times a week). I noticed an improvement in my skin texture in just one use. Not a instant fix but I am seeing continued improvement in my skin texture including tightening my pores. Too short of a time frame to determine if it reduces the appearance of fine lines, acne marks &amp; skin discoloration. Leaves skin feeling clean without residue. I do wish it came with a vitamin or collagen enriched serum to apply after use since the skin is more able to absorb better after exfoiliating. I currently use a hydrating gel from another brand after use. I&#x27;m pleased with the results so far &amp; look forward to continued improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the difference I&#x27;ve seen! I have bad skin, some scarring and discoloration. This helps my skin look at least 5 years younger! I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks now and my skin keeps improving!</li>
    <li> So I am definitely sure this was not worth the cash and saw no real difference after a jar. You could get drug store products more reasonably priced and work the same. Had nice smell though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have blackheads so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying this it&#x27;s too expensive, just need a face wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks. The exfoliant is very fine but effective. It does not leave the skin feeling dry or stripped but baby smooth and fresh. Feels a tad grainy when applied but didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. Yes, this may be a little pricey, but a tiny amount goes a long long way and you get fantastic results! Well worth the investment. So glad I discovered this.</li>
    <li> This was ok, nothing more than what I could have paid for for less!!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great - very gentle but still leaves my skin feeling refreshed. It gives my entire face a rejuvenated and smooth feeling. As an added bonus, it does a great job on its own removing waterproof eye makeup. A little bit goes a long way. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have replaced my first jar of this product, because I love it and it seems to be working on the fine lines and evening out my skin tone. I would highly recommend this to anyone, who would like to try a dermabrasion treatment at home.</li>
    <li> One of the best scrubs out there! gentle yet effective.I can totally see the difference in my skin. It immediately feels softer after using this stuff and I have not been having breakouts at all whereas before this product I would get random pimples here and there. I rub this in small circles for about 2mins then rinse, skin feels so much softer and clearer! I will definitely repurchase! also a little bit goes a looong way I use less than a dime sized amount.</li>
    <li> Although delivery was made 1 item short ,stuff do happens. I contacted the seller and they made good on everything. The additional item was promptly delivered , in what appeared to be overnight shipment.  They apologized, overall their service was just excellent.  I am very very please with their service.  I don&#x27;t really write reviews, but have to mention the efficient service and great experience from this seller.  Well I have said so much about the&lt;br /&gt;seller and nothing about the product. I have had very bad acne growing up and nothing seemed to work for me.  Well, today I am looking 10 years younger with radiant skin  I started using this product 3 months now.</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliant I have used. I had various bumps, like milia, under the skin for literally years. They were so deep no aesthetician could remove them safely - I would have had to go to a dermatologist. This stuff, after a few weeks, has gotten rid of most of them and the others are on their way out. It&#x27;s really good for overall tone and texture too. I never write reviews but for my fellow skin care aficionados, I thought I would add this. If you have really delicate skin, I would start cautiously, but my skin is sensitive and I can use it. Great stuff and just as good as some of the ridiculously expensive other skin care lines I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> BOGUS REVIEW ALERT!&lt;br /&gt;Just look at these reviews and see if you can spot the pattern. Such sad marketing techniques being done these days.</li>
    <li> I bought this after doing some research on how to get rid of my blackheads. I came across this skin care line and decided to buy this product from their site. After 2 weeks of using this product, three times a week I&#x27;ve seen a great reduction in the blackheads around my cheeks and nose. It has made a huge difference in my skin and my overall complexion looks more even. I use this in the shower and it goes on really smooth, love the smell. The exfoliating beads are also not harsh but get the job done. I recommend this to anyone who wants to get their blackheads under control but does not want to visit the deem doctor for an expensive facial.</li>
    <li> The name of this product does not describe what it does.  After using it for about a month I saw no difference in my skin.  The term &amp;#34;dermabrasion&amp;#34; made me think it was going to have a more clinical effect rather than just being a high priced skin cleanser.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, just buy an inexpensive exfoliant with microbeads from a well known brand you know and trust, you will get the same results and save your money.</li>
    <li> I was given this product as a gift in January. I been using it as directed 3 times a week for the last few months (the jar really last a while) I&#x27;ve noticed that it got rid of my blackheads as well as prevented new ones. I&#x27;ve been complemented on my face complexion a few times and that is a good feeling. I just put in my 2nd order with the Vernal serum. Can&#x27;t wait. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. It is very pricey for my standards but a little does go a very long way as I mentioned. If you&#x27;re on the edge about this just take the plunge. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay only because it&#x27;s not to harsh but I really don&#x27;t know if it is helping or a benefit to my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for two weeks no. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. This product truly does provide results as close as possible results to an in-office micro. I use it every three days as recommended, and my skin always feels amazing afterwards. Cleansers the pores around my Tline. You will notice that your skin is softer and smoother with a nice natural glow after the first use.</li>
    <li> Smooth, not too gritty, and after you wash it , it doesn&#x27;t leave your face sticky</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! I have really sensitive skin so I use it every three days and it makes my skin soft and looking great. I also love the smell. I&#x27;ve started using it on my hands too to keep them soft. I think it makes my old age spots less noticeable.</li>
    <li> most effective facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. I can feel it working while I&#x27;m using it and can see/feel the results afterward. It&#x27;s so impressive, I&#x27;m going to sign up for monthly deliveries of this product to ensure I have a steady supply---and that&#x27;s something I never do.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product and used it last night with a facial scrubber and There was absolutely no makeup left behind. After one use I can tell it&#x27;s going to be great. My moisturizers and makeup looked so much better today.</li>
    <li> I thought my face was smooth - but turns out, it can be so much smoother! This skin exfoliant feels like it&#x27;s taken years off of my face without leaving it raw or red. My cheeks are so soft that it&#x27;s hard to keep my hands off of them! I love how surprisingly gentle it is for the results it provides - normally any kind of exfoliation leaves me a bit pink for an hour afterwards, but I looked good as new after using Vernal&#x27;s formula! As a bonus, the jar looks gorgeous and very luxurious on my counter. I did receive this product for free but price doesn&#x27;t change how soft my skin is, nor does it effect my review!</li>
    <li> I just got this a couple of weeks ago and its working out great for me so far. It does say to use once or twice a week but I wish I could use it every day because it&#x27;s so refreshing and I feel like my face just glows. The exfoliating scrub is a mild microdermabrasion. The exfoliating pumice is very fine and there is enough grains to exfoliate. It smells like fresh mint leaf and it has a cooling effect. The texture is like a gel mixed with fine sugar. This made my face slightly red for a day but after it was smoother softer and brighter. For sensitive skin I would say use it once a week. Great for combination oily skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is basically heaven in a jar! I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week for 4 weeks and have noticed huge changes in my skin tone starting around week 2. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne as a teen and as an adult and have scars from it. I also have large pores, redness, and some brown spots. My pores are noticeably smaller, my skin is more even, and it is all around softer. I never expected results like this so quickly. I am not sure how I ever survived without this, but I know I won&#x27;t have to anymore! This will be a staple in my skin care routine for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I use this product 2-3 times per week as recommended. It leaves my skin soft, toned and clear with a healthy glow after every wash. The effect of which lasts a few days days. I was hesitant at first about applying a cream to exfoliate rather than using the traditional scrubbing type of exfoliating, but this works so well! There is a very slight tingle to my skin which is normal and it may cost a little more but is so worth it!!</li>
    <li> This is the best for me</li>
    <li> this didn&#x27;t do anything for me but its smells good.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this product for 2 weeks as directed (2-3 times a week) and I really like it. Within the first day of me using this my face had begun to clear up and now today I have minimum break out and no bumps at all. I have noticed also my skin complexion is more even and less irritated. This product is great. I always recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely hands down what it says it will do.  Pores?  What Pores?  It&#x27;s like a miracle in a jar!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves face soft</li>
    <li> This is by far the best exfoliator It smells great and it&#x27;s gentle on your skin. I really feel like my face looks brighter when I use it. I even had my mom try it because she was skeptical but was very impressed with the results! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> First time I used this product, noticed skin felt and looked good but I wasn&#x27;t completely convinced. But, the 2nd time I used it a week later the change was noticeable - smooth and glowing skin! This was reinforced by compliment from boyfriend who didn&#x27;t know I had used the mask but commented that I looked really great. Def worth the price, especially since you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliation. Face feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom. The small grains beads exfoliated off dead skin and left my face really soft. It also cleared up my acne, oiliness, and minimized my pores. I A little pricey if you ask me, but if you want good results it&#x27;s worth the price. I would recommend it for any skin type.</li>
    <li> Tried this and am not impressed... I don&#x27;t like it at all.  The texture of the scrub is not nice and the scrub particles are too big.  This scrub was not effective for me.</li>
    <li> Feels great and makes my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> amazing product ordered another bottle</li>
    <li> This is the first exfoliant I&#x27;ve used and it works exactly as described! My face feels much cleaner and softer after using this product, and my complexion has cleared up after only around 2 weeks of use. I feel it&#x27;s a fair price for the results I&#x27;ve gotten thus far and would recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel so soft after using and it&#x27;s gentle for sensitive skin like mine. I find it it be a highly effective skin care product and will make this part of my regiment from now on.</li>
    <li> I was recently sent &#x27;Vernal Age -Defying Microdermabrasion&#x27; Advanced Skin Exfoliatiant&lt;br /&gt;for free in exchange for my honest review.I was so ready to wash away the dull,blotchy,uneven appearance that my face was currently harboring.The bitter winter wind outside and the dry,static filled,heated air inside had really taken it&#x27;s toll on my&lt;br /&gt;fair ,combination type complection.I&#x27;ve only indulged in a few Salon Microdermabrasions in my day but Im experienced enough to know that Microdermabrasion is an exfoliating procedure that gets rid of the dull,dead skin cells on the face/neck revealing new healthy  cells.These new cells provide a brighter,younger looking complection,in part,because they are now able to better absorb the beneficial properties of the  products we apply to our face,every day.Those products that we spend so much money on(because we are hoping they will actually do what they say they do).&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving my jar of &#x27;Vernal Age Defying Microdermabrasion,Advanced Skin Exfolliant&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I rushed right in to start the cell renewal process.The very 1st thing I notice and loved was the cooling sensation of the cream.It was refreshing,invigorating.So far,so good.Next was the naturally abrasive exfoliating beads.The combination of the cream&#x27;s tingly,abrasive consistency along with the soothing moisturizing ingredients really had me loving this product from the very first use! I have since used the Vernal Age Defying Microdermabrasion exfoliant several times.Each time I am pleasantly surprised by the initial cooling sensation.The natural exfoliant is invigorating and the moisturizers leave my skin feeling amazing.My complection is looking noticeably healthier after just a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the serums and lotions I&#x27;ve been using  actually appear to be delivering better results than ever.I really enjoy this product,and am excited to share the results with my closest friends!</li>
    <li> Love it! My face is better with every use, will purchase again! So happy I found this product.</li>
    <li> This product is really good. I recommend it to all</li>
    <li> Yes it makes my skin feel silky smooth immediately after using.  But it does nothing for the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This product does what it is suppose to do! Love it! I have very sensitive, fair skin and it makes it feel so smooth and wonderful after each use! The texture of my skin has been amazing! Plus this seller is great!</li>
    <li> I have received a sample and I love it!I have never reviewed any product, although there were plenty of good ones. But this one just blew my mind. It was easy to use, good smelling scrub that feels like you actually get a microdermabrasion. I will order the full size one. It is good as long as you use it properly. Once a week!!!</li>
    <li> This exfoliant does not mess around. The tiny crystals in it are amazing and it leaves your skin feeling smooth, clean, and glowing. It did break out my skin after the first use but I think that is due to the fact that is truly was deep cleansing and purging all my pores of dirty, oil, and makeup. After the second use, my skin was back to normal again. Definitely would recommend this to someone who is acne prone, oily, or combination skin. Definitely not for sensitive in my opinion. Best exfoliant I have ever purchased!</li>
