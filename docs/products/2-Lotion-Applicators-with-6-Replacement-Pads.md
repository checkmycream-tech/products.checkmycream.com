### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This applicator is the best I have found for use with amalactin and lubriderm lotions.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s length and design makes it perfect for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The applicator itself is wonderful and suits my purposes perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Now I thought the replacement pad would  never be very good.</li>
      <li>What a great idea, I wish I&#x27;d invented it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This concept is great.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Great value in that way.</li>
      <li>For the price, this was a great deal.</li>
      <li>The design is great for applying lotions and medicated creams that you may not want to mix on one applicator pad.</li>
      <li>Very nice product.  </li>
      <li>I am having the dangest time finding a good lotion applicator.  </li>
      <li>The price is good</li>
      <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be as pleased as I am!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of adhesive they use, but it is strong.</li>
      <li>Glad I found them here.</li>
      <li>Love these applicators!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But it is better than the roll-on applicators.</li>
      <li>When I run out of replacement pads, if I can&#x27;t find more, I&#x27;ll just buy another set.</li>
      <li>foot health person will be glad to hear that I can get between the toes with it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>The wand looks kind of cheap &amp; like it could snap easily, but it flexes a bit when a lot of pressure is applied.</li>
      <li>The wand is quite strong too.</li>
      <li>the pads work fine</li>
      <li>Great for the winter months to get the lotion on your back.</li>
      <li>The applicator comes out clean.  </li>
      <li>Cool, right?  </li>
      <li>However, this is a great product for half the price</li>
      <li>Good for those with limited mobility.</li>
      <li>I am applying lotion daily so, am able to reuse the foam pad and haven&#x27;t tried to replace it.</li>
      <li>I was able to use it daily for two weeks before changing pads.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise they are very usefull.</li>
      <li>I chose the one that appeared to have been more carefully thought out.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect and is awkward to use in some positions.</li>
      <li>I had been concerned that it would not be very sturdy, and that the replacement pads wouldn&#x27;t adhere well.</li>
      <li>have some mobility challenges and cannot reach much of my feet.  </li>
      <li>It looked reasonably well put together and came with 2 applicators and 6 refill pads.  </li>
      <li>finally got the pad off, by pulling off tufts of foam, and finally scraping the adhesive off after soaking in warm soapy water for a while.  </li>
      <li>When the jar with the acetone gets too much \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; or stops working, discard and get new jar with acetone.</li>
      <li>These come in handy to reach those hard to get to places that cry out for lotion.  </li>
      <li>Before attaching new pad, I was careful to clean wand with soap &amp; water and pad lasted longer.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, than these are the the way to go!</li>
      <li>It wasted a good half hour of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
      <li>/&gt;Replacing the pads is another thing completely.  </li>
      <li>Pads last a reasonable time with some handling care.  </li>
      <li>Like fact that I can use and eventually discard old pads.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>Actually, I thought that the original pad would lose adhesion when oils , alcohol and other ingredients from medicated lotions got saturated into the pad.</li>
      <li>I thought this would work, and it is better than nothing, but the wands are so small, it takes a while to get your back moisturized.</li>
      <li>These applicators are much better and easier to use than the larger ones with the hard plastic applicator.</li>
      <li>Small enough, easy to use, not bulky.  </li>
      <li>First pad came partially loose after only a week or so; since rubbing lotion into skin is involved, there is some sideways stress on the adhesive.  </li>
      <li>Wash &amp; dry applicator and apply new pad.  </li>
      <li>it makes it so much easier to reach the center of my back with tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>The Bass brand applicator was much higher quality at about the same price and it and the 3 refill pads lasted me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> did not meet my needs...handle too short.  Otherwise was a little dissapointed in this particular item.&lt;br /&gt;First time that ever happened to me with an Amazon order,.</li>
    <li> This concept is great. I have another that I give 5 of 5 stars rather than 4. However, this is a great product for half the price and you get two applicator handles with extra pads. Great value in that way. The design is great for applying lotions and medicated creams that you may not want to mix on one applicator pad. The downside in the quality is in the foam pads. These are stiffer with larger pours in the foam than the premium applicator and it&#x27;s pads. These pads are also a little smaller than those others. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, than these are the the way to go!</li>
    <li> Love these applicators!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some mobility challenges and cannot reach much of my feet.  These applicators allow me to use cream on them as recommended by my doctor.  These applicators are much better and easier to use than the larger ones with the hard plastic applicator.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I had been looking for this for sometime.  Like fact that I can use and eventually discard old pads.</li>
    <li> At last. There&#x27;s help for an arthritic geriatric. No more itchy dry back because I&#x27;m not as limber as I used to be.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Have used for several months to apply lotion to places I cannot reach on my back.  Pads last a reasonable time with some handling care.  First pad came partially loose after only a week or so; since rubbing lotion into skin is involved, there is some sideways stress on the adhesive.  Before attaching new pad, I was careful to clean wand with soap &amp; water and pad lasted longer.  I always wrap pad end in a plastic snack bag to store.  For the price, this was a great deal.</li>
    <li> IFound that the disk type handle somewhat awkward to use with my artheritic fingers.Otherwise they are very usefull.Would recommend with that reservation</li>
    <li> Small enough, easy to use, not bulky.  Good for those with limited mobility.</li>
    <li> The applicator seems well designed and allows me to reach my back. I gave it 2 stars because the applicator pad disintegrated after a couple of uses. Not only does the adhesive loosen but the plastic foam it self degrades and comes apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if the pads lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I have permanent dryness of my ankles. This applicator is the best I have found for use with amalactin and lubriderm lotions.  It isn&#x27;t perfect and is awkward to use in some positions. But it is better than the roll-on applicators.</li>
    <li> I bought this applicator several  months ago. I had been concerned that it would not be very sturdy, and that the replacement pads wouldn&#x27;t adhere well. Actually, I thought that the original pad would lose adhesion when oils , alcohol and other ingredients from medicated lotions got saturated into the pad. I was very pleasantly surprised when the applicator pad stuck tight for two months. It finally lost it&#x27;s grip &amp; needed changing. Now I thought the replacement pad would  never be very good. I sure was wrong! I don&#x27;t know what kind of adhesive they use, but it is strong. The wand is quite strong too. The wand looks kind of cheap &amp; like it could snap easily, but it flexes a bit when a lot of pressure is applied. When I run out of replacement pads, if I can&#x27;t find more, I&#x27;ll just buy another set. The price is good and I think you&#x27;ll be as pleased as I am!</li>
    <li> you don&#x27;t have to replace the sponge after every use. i get a few uses out of each sponge. it makes it so much easier to reach the center of my back with tanning lotion. Especially when you are using the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> the handle is hard to hold so tho the pads work fine it is hard to apply the lotion - the applicator keeps twisting</li>
    <li> This is a horrible &amp; cheep lotion applicator. Do not waste your money. If I could give it no stats I would</li>
    <li> Very hard to find except at Amazon, works for me due to limitations on reaching</li>
    <li> What a great idea, I wish I&#x27;d invented it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator works well. I have MS and have lost the ability to lift my feet or cross my legs. I&#x27;m also stubborn so asking my husband to put on lotion is a last resort, I want to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the applicators for a week. I am applying lotion daily so, am able to reuse the foam pad and haven&#x27;t tried to replace it. This should help keep the costs down on replacement pads. [edit: I was able to use it daily for two weeks before changing pads.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My foot health person will be glad to hear that I can get between the toes with it. I was going to share my second one, but will keep it (without lotion) to dry between my toes after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;m finding it works well for the center of my back, too.</li>
    <li> Great for the winter months to get the lotion on your back. Always hard to reach&lt;br /&gt;that area. Works great. Love it.</li>
    <li> I had difficulty initially choosing which of the several styles of applicator to choose, having never used any of them bafore. I chose the one that appeared to have been more carefully thought out. However, when I tried to use it I found that was not the case, at least for me. It was difficult to get the applicator f;at against the center of my back. A straighter handle waou,d have been batter.</li>
    <li> Very very disappointed in the size of this product.  Too small to apply tanning lotion to back area.  They need to be about 3-4 times larger than what they are now.</li>
    <li> very bad quality. the replacement wont stick properly. the foam quality is bad and coarse.&lt;br /&gt;the size is quite small compared to other ones. not good.</li>
    <li> The applicator itself is wonderful and suits my purposes perfectly.  I use it to put lotion on my feet.  It&#x27;s length and design makes it perfect for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this, I would give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the pads is another thing completely.  I know they need to be sticky to stay in place, but removing a used pad is problematic.  As I write this, I have two applicators sitting in acetone, attempting to get off the sticky &amp; pad residue from before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this, I give it 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So averaging it out, the entire package gets 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/16/13 Update:  I have bumped this up to 4 stars.  I have a small, glass jar (with lid) that has Acetone Nail Polish remover.  I set the applicators with old pads into this jar and let them sit for at least 5 minutes.  A glass jar is heavy enough that it doesn&#x27;t tip with the weight of the applicators.  The acetone totally removes the pad AND excess glue.  The applicator comes out clean.  Wash &amp; dry applicator and apply new pad.  Place lid on jar and store until needed again.  When the jar with the acetone gets too much \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; or stops working, discard and get new jar with acetone.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Bass lotion applicator I bought at a health food store a few years ago, which I cannot find now.  It looked reasonably well put together and came with 2 applicators and 6 refill pads.  Cool, right?  Wrong.  The pads are trashed after about 2 weeks, and are nearly impossible to peel off again.  The Bass brand applicator was much higher quality at about the same price and it and the 3 refill pads lasted me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will do in a pinch, but is overpriced for something that doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got the pad off, by pulling off tufts of foam, and finally scraping the adhesive off after soaking in warm soapy water for a while.  The adhesive did not remove entirely, but enough that I could get another one to stick.  It wasted a good half hour of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try another brand.</li>
    <li> This hit the spot!  These come in handy to reach those hard to get to places that cry out for lotion.  Glad I found them here.</li>
    <li> I am having the dangest time finding a good lotion applicator.  I thought this would work, and it is better than nothing, but the wands are so small, it takes a while to get your back moisturized.</li>
