      <li>BEST FIRMING GEL EVER, PERIOD&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
      <li>You have the best price on this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it feels great when I do put it on.</li>
      <li>I thought this was a great skin toning lotion,  then Nivea came out with a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This product smells great, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s effective at all.</li>
      <li>be fair</li>
      <li>To be fair, the tube never said it was for arms.  </li>
      <li>so I give them a good rating.  </li>
      <li>and it got good reviews and results.</li>
      <li>I like it and good smell</li>
      <li>had this b/4 very satisfied</li>
      <li>I havent tried many but this item was great</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>As compared to others cellulite cream/gel that sell for $75.00/bottle.....this Nivea smells nice, applies evenly and soaks in good.  </li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Nothing amazing</li>
      <li>I did not buy this from Amazon, however, I think it is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>The smell was amazing, the gel felt nice on my skin, and I put the stuff everywhere...</li>
      <li>Creates a nice cooling sensation.</li>
      <li>Of course you have to do your own part also.</li>
      <li>It also smells nice.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a difference although it felt nice</li>
      <li>The smell is great and refreshing and the consistency is smooth.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now as far as the Q10 firming gel cream, I have seen a considerable difference in my buttocks and thighs!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>no turkey neck for me any more</li>
      <li>Love the product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be better then nothing</li>
      <li>most times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This lotion plus some exercise, healthy diet and plenty of water</li>
      <li>This product works a lot better with the patches.  </li>
      <li>and I swear the mirror says my skin is more toned.  </li>
      <li>The longer you use it, the better the skin looks.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product on and off for years and am impressed that it actually works and drastically reduces the appearance of cellulite.</li>
      <li>Love this product as always.</li>
      <li>Works well, smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>I notice my partner strokes my skin a lot more when I use this gel-cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than five years.</li>
      <li>I love Nivea products, and this one is another must have.  </li>
      <li>love the feel the hydration and smell.</li>
      <li>and I love receiving it every two month at my door.</li>
      <li>In the AM after a shower - massage into neck - and nighttime after toning - one more application.</li>
      <li>I had better results with DERMAdoctor Shrinking Beauty cream.</li>
      <li>..when i would stop wearing it, I&#x27;d notice more cellulite.</li>
      <li>I love this product I could really see a great improvement in my skin</li>
      <li>If I stop using it for awhile, I think I look more dimply.</li>
      <li>It works best after a hot shower or bath, when your skin is most susceptible to absorbing the cream.</li>
      <li>I CAN SEE a huge difference in photographs (I model for my husband</li>
      <li>but I did enjoy feeling my skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works on my butt and thighs.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this with a light layer to my thighs up to my rear and use a Cellulite hand massager and manually massage the gel cream in til it soaks</li>
      <li>So far this cream has the best results when it comes to smoothness, no other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used it</li>
      <li>I like them both a lot; light,  lightly scented and quick drying.  </li>
      <li>the results were great, my cellulite is gone, my skin is firm and if you didn&#x27;t know I had children, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to notice unless I had them with me.</li>
      <li>great product- works very quickly- notice a change right away on loose skin-</li>
      <li>Does a decent job smells great and makes your skin soft with no harshness</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really good product, I mean, don&#x27;t expect to have your cellulite gone just from using it, there is more to be done to get rid of that, but the cream does make your skin way firmer, softer and very very smooth.</li>
      <li>and you should be bikini ready by summer:)</li>
      <li>It smells nice and makes your skin feel soft</li>
      <li>The price is great compared to other creams out there.</li>
      <li>I would place in warm water while you are in the shower for it to warm up a little</li>
      <li>Seems like a conspiracy to get us all to buy more and more bottles until we all become big, fat, broke, \\&quot;Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I like the way this feels on my skin, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Just like advertised it absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
      <li>But then I start again, and it quickly shows results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels great once it dries but the initial slime factor is a bit much</li>
      <li>If you have this time to dedicate every day, its definitely worth trying.  </li>
      <li>And honestly speaking I use this on my neck, boobs, stomach thighs upper arms and buttocks.</li>
      <li>Worth a shot to try, but</li>
      <li>Every time I get pregnant I am sure to stock up until I&#x27;m back to my pre-pregnancy size.</li>
      <li>Generally, I eat well most of the week, and when I use this product I see a difference.  </li>
      <li>And I am impressed because I am not currently exercising nor am I using it 2x a day everyday.</li>
      <li>This product was said to help firm up your skin to help you not bruise as easily and also helps the purpura to heal/disappear more quickly.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it helps with cellulite very much.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m on my second bottle because I love it.  </li>
      <li>To apply properly to get the most results, you need to take your time to work the product in, massaging the skin well.  </li>
      <li>If I would remember to use this regularly, maybe I&#x27;d be able to tell you whether it works or not.</li>
      <li>but really I think the act of massaging your skin no matter what you are using in the real reason there is a difference!</li>
      <li>Sometime i wonder if they PAY people to leave \\&quot;good reviews\\&quot; on s***ty products :/</li>
      <li>And I think it has some slimming effect, cause my jeans fit a little bit different, like looser and more comfortable.</li>
      <li>but I can definitely say it&#x27;s a soothing gel-cream and am excited to notice the changes as I begin to use it more regularly</li>
      <li>I will say, however, that it leaves you skin super soft but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much change</li>
      <li>haha, I have no scientific proof though.  </li>
      <li>I would rub it on my whole leg sometimes because of access gel...</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any toning or firming.</li>
      <li>I really think it makes a difference.</li>
      <li>This hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me.i really wanted it to work, but there isn&#x27;t any miracle cures out there.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think this does anything for my cellulite.  </li>
      <li>other than that it s a good buy for a price it doesn&#x27;t do miracles but with daily use and massage it smoothes the problem areas!</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t attest to the reduction in cellulite, but I do feel more toned and moisturized with this product in comparison to other toning lotions.</li>
      <li>Have noticed significant improvement in my skin after just a couple weeks of daily use.</li>
      <li>the past made my skin feel so nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And if u are wondering why the 3 stars is simply because I have yet to see the product&#x27;s full capability...</li>
      <li>There are more pothole sized dimples on the side and back of my left thigh.</li>
      <li>It is a decent product.  </li>
      <li>Decent, but unimpressed.</li>
      <li>but it is key to not wrinkling as much or as quickly....</li>
      <li>Tried this for over 6 months with my normal routine of diet and exercise.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this cream since it came out in the market. It has always worked for me. Of course you have to do your own part also. I do treadmill and weights, my diet is no carbs, no sugars. When I apply the cream the cellulite diminishes and the skin feels tighter and smoother. The price is great compared to other creams out there. I will keep using it. Oh, and BTW I am 52 years old</li>
    <li> This hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me.i really wanted it to work, but there isn&#x27;t any miracle cures out there.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great skin toning lotion,  then Nivea came out with a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34;. I like them both a lot; light,  lightly scented and quick drying.  Nothing heavy about this lotion but I feel it smoothes and tones my skin when used twice a day.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference although it felt nice</li>
    <li> great product- works very quickly- notice a change right away on loose skin- be fair warned it is freezing when you put it o. I would place in warm water while you are in the shower for it to warm up a little</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels on my skin, and it absorbs quickly. I just purchased another tube, and I think I will keep this as a staple.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t attest to the reduction in cellulite, but I do feel more toned and moisturized with this product in comparison to other toning lotions. It also smells nice.</li>
    <li> no toning, but skin becomes soft and prepared</li>
    <li> Works well, smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> I still have a lot of cellulite even though I&#x27;m normal weight and work out, but I do think this helps minimize the look and the feel of cellulite.</li>
    <li> This is not a miracle cream by any means. I didn&#x27;t see results like I wanted. Decent, but unimpressed. My legs got a little irritated, but I&#x27;m not completely sure if it was because of this product. Worth a shot to try, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a while now but I haven&#x27;t seen any effects on my body</li>
    <li> Does a decent job smells great and makes your skin soft with no harshness</li>
    <li> BEST FIRMING GEL EVER, PERIOD&lt;br /&gt;all my celebrity friends use it</li>
    <li> I am a 20 year old female who bought this product after seeing it on the Tyra Show. I was definitely skeptical at first, but I did my research and found the price was right, so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product to help firm up my thighs after losing 60-something pounds. This did the trick. The smell was amazing, the gel felt nice on my skin, and I put the stuff everywhere... my stomach, hips, thighs, and upper arms. It definitely did what it claims to do. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a SKIN FIRMING gel. Notbinenace does it say removes cellulite like most the reviews on here are complaint about. This isn&#x27;t the old stuff that claimed that! I&#x27;ve found this to be better then nothing but really I think the act of massaging your skin no matter what you are using in the real reason there is a difference!</li>
    <li> If you use this product religiously at least once a day, every day, it actually does work.  It works best after a hot shower or bath, when your skin is most susceptible to absorbing the cream. Also, if you put the cream on at a different time as you shower, the cream will roll and cake up, like little balls of dirt. But the skin looks tighter, and more even within a few weeks.  The longer you use it, the better the skin looks.  If you use it for a while and then stop, skin doesn&#x27;t revert back completely, and not right away.  Also depends on your eating habits.  Generally, I eat well most of the week, and when I use this product I see a difference.  I start to notice less tone if I don&#x27;t use it for several months. But then I start again, and it quickly shows results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It requires dedication though.  To apply properly to get the most results, you need to take your time to work the product in, massaging the skin well.  If you do the usual problem areas (butt, thighs, stomach and arms), the process would take about 15-20 minutes.  If you have this time to dedicate every day, its definitely worth trying.  If not done on almost daily bases, don&#x27;t expect much results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think this does anything for my cellulite.  I had better results with DERMAdoctor Shrinking Beauty cream.</li>
    <li> I trusted the reviews, but i shouldn&#x27;t have. This did nothing for me.  I don&#x27;t know who said this was on the Tyra Banks show as a project  and it got good reviews and results. FALSE!!  Sometime i wonder if they PAY people to leave \\&quot;good reviews\\&quot; on s***ty products :/</li>
    <li> It is a decent product.  Nothing amazing</li>
    <li> I just purchased this gem. Not sure how to apply. Do you use this igel nstead of regular lotion? Or do you put the gel on first, then regular lotion?</li>
    <li> I like it and good smell</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product, but have been disappointed with the results.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and I have seen very little results.  I will say, however, that it leaves you skin super soft but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. I really think it makes a difference. If I stop using it for awhile, I think I look more dimply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a couple of months and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  Try again.</li>
    <li> I think I need to use it for a couple of months to see maximum results.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this from Amazon, however, I think it is an amazing product. I saw this mentioned on another website as something that can help purpura, which is when blood pools under the skin after you bump into something.  Mother Nature has a cruel sense of humor and menopause is not any fun.  A simple little bump of the hand turns into a big ugly purple mark that lasts for weeks.  This product was said to help firm up your skin to help you not bruise as easily and also helps the purpura to heal/disappear more quickly.  I was skeptical but figured it was worth $10 to give it a try.  Ive only used it for a week but I can already see a difference AND, a bruise/purpura that had just appeared 6 days ago is now GONE after treating it with this gel cream. Usually the marks would last at least two weeks, maybe longer.  I applied it twice a day and it is completely gone. I do notice a difference in the overall texture of my skin as well.</li>
    <li> Tried this for over 6 months with my normal routine of diet and exercise. Did not see any improvement. Will have to search for alternative methods to get rid of the cellulite look.</li>
    <li> I m giving one star because I ordered good-bye cellulite smoothing gel cream but I unf.i received Nivea firming cream and unf.i don&#x27;t have time to run to the post office to return it !other than that it s a good buy for a price it doesn&#x27;t do miracles but with daily use and massage it smoothes the problem areas!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big girl. I&#x27;m 18, 125 lbs, 5&#x27;6. I got major cellulite passed down through genetics from my mom, who is the same size as me and suffers from it as well. This product works so well. I&#x27;ve tried everything, from expensive creams to wrapping my legs with plastic wrap and coffee grinds. This is the only thing that works. It really helps give me the confidence to wear shorts or a swim suit and not feel insecure!</li>
    <li> Yep, it works, and I&#x27;m a skeptic. Use it daily now.</li>
    <li> If the firming and toning effects are there, it&#x27;s very subtle - I think it&#x27;s there at least.  But why I gave it 5 stars is the fact that it makes my skin feel silky-soft to the touch.  I notice my partner strokes my skin a lot more when I use this gel-cream. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this because a young friend said it did wonders for her stomach after she had babies.  I wanted to see if it would firm my old and crepey arms.  I rubbed it on my arms twice a day for a month and now I&#x27;m on my second tube.  I think maybe it helped a little bit, but probably not enough to buy anymore.  To be fair, the tube never said it was for arms.  I bought the Nivea firming lotion at the same time and used it on my chest and legs.  My chest broke out in big itchy red bumps that lasted about 12 days.  The company sent my money back and gave me forms in case I had to go to a doctor (I didn&#x27;t) so I give them a good rating.  Whatever I was allergic to in the lotion is evidently not in the gel-cream.</li>
    <li> I used this after the birth of my son for help with cellulite behind my thighs. I also had a wiggly mommy pouch that although isn&#x27;t the intended use of this product, I decided to try it there too since I had it...the results were great, my cellulite is gone, my skin is firm and if you didn&#x27;t know I had children, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to notice unless I had them with me. The results lasted even when I stopped using the lotion. Every time I get pregnant I am sure to stock up until I&#x27;m back to my pre-pregnancy size. My grandmother swore by Nivea products and they just continue to improve their product line. I recommend this to all of my mommy friends.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any toning or firming. And it is not moisturizing  either so I found this product to be useless :/</li>
    <li> My thigh and butt can be removed orange peel and firmer. No good for fat cells, my special is Lidocaine toxincity as accepting facial plastic surgeon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already to order 2-tube Nivea Firm Gel-Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent enough cream, not by much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I am extremely vain. And as a woman who&#x27;s touching 40 (in 2 years) my focus has been on keep my skin hydrated and firm. I have been utilizing anti aging and (on another topic) tooth whitening products for atleast 15 years. So I picked up thia product as wrll as the Skin Renewal Exfoliation Wash and Touch of Smoothness body wash as well ad Nivea Soft creme. I just completely overdosed on Nivea and I think this brand might be my staple from now own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as far as the Q10 firming gel cream, I have seen a considerable difference in my buttocks and thighs!!!!!!!!!! And I am impressed because I am not currently exercising nor am I using it 2x a day everyday. But I am convinced to keep it in my disposal as to see how far I can go when I start exercising and changing my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if u are wondering why the 3 stars is simply because I have yet to see the product&#x27;s full capability...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel the hydration and smell. And honestly speaking I use this on my neck, boobs, stomach thighs upper arms and buttocks. I am a very young looking 38 year olf but my motto in life is Prevention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ladies I know sometimes we get lazy and dont want to moisturize our whole bodies but it is key to not wrinkling as much or as quickly.... and this product on your hands and neck can be the trick as those are our telling points to our age most times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why not give this product a try....</li>
    <li> This product smells great, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s effective at all. I purchased it under the mistaken impression that it is designed to help combat the appearance of cellulite, but this is not in Nivea&#x27;s anti-cellulite line. The ingredients are not listed on the bottle. Basically, this is an expensive moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Bought this to hide my cellulite when i go to the beach. Only had a little bit of cellulite on the back of my thighs.. I would rub it on my whole leg sometimes because of access gel...wore this stuff for a month or so..when i would stop wearing it, I&#x27;d notice more cellulite. noticed I&#x27;ve got cellulite on my calf&#x27;s now...idk how that&#x27;s even possible. call me crazy but i didn&#x27;t notice any cellulite there before. Seems like a conspiracy to get us all to buy more and more bottles until we all become big, fat, broke, \\&quot;Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s\\&quot;. I&#x27;m never using this crap again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good product, I mean, don&#x27;t expect to have your cellulite gone just from using it, there is more to be done to get rid of that, but the cream does make your skin way firmer, softer and very very smooth. So far this cream has the best results when it comes to smoothness, no other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used it the past made my skin feel so nice. And I think it has some slimming effect, cause my jeans fit a little bit different, like looser and more comfortable. This lotion plus some exercise, healthy diet and plenty of water and you should be bikini ready by summer:)</li>
    <li> I noticed they took off that it was for cellulite, but I believe it helps with cellulite.  I am 62 and I think my cellulite is no where near where it could be for my age.  It doesn&#x27;t eliminate it completely, but I will continue to use ut.</li>
    <li> Omg! All I can say is this stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;I am on DAY 3 and I apply this twice daily and I&#x27;m already seeing the cellulite tone down!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wowwwwww.&lt;br /&gt;I was always so hesitant to try this, based on reviews and not knowing if it would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am 23, 150pounds, 5&#x27;2, exercise maybe 3 times weekly, I dry brush daily before showers, and barely added this into my routine!&lt;br /&gt;And I know it&#x27;s the product because I woke up seeing my thighs tighter!&lt;br /&gt;Works on my butt and thighs.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this with a light layer to my thighs up to my rear and use a Cellulite hand massager and manually massage the gel cream in til it soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using and repurchasing!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just upset I didn&#x27;t get this sooner!!!!!</li>
    <li> This cream makes your skin smooth and tightens it a little bit too. Doesn&#x27;t do any wonders but then no cream does.</li>
    <li> As compared to others cellulite cream/gel that sell for $75.00/bottle.....this Nivea smells nice, applies evenly and soaks in good.  Seems to maintain, so cellulite doesn&#x27;t expand.</li>
    <li> This product works a lot better with the patches.  I used the combination of both years ago, and I noticed an improvement.  If I buy this product again, then I will also buy the patches as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on and off for years and am impressed that it actually works and drastically reduces the appearance of cellulite.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about a month since I started using this gel. I didn&#x27;t want to purchase it because of the price. I bought two of them, I used it twice daily because I started seeing cellulite on my left thigh. I don&#x27;t understand how one thigh is bigger than the other. I noticed after two weeks my thigh looked worse. There are more pothole sized dimples on the side and back of my left thigh. I now have to do uneven amounts of repetitions of thigh exercises when I workout now to correct it.</li>
    <li> Love this product as always. I&#x27;ve been using this for more than five years. It works for me and make my skin looks tight and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this 2 days ago and the only reason I did was because I watched reviews on YouTube and everyone raved about it! I&#x27;ve applied this 3x&#x27;s on my stomach, hips, thighs, and butt. The smell is great and refreshing and the consistency is smooth. The product is not too oily, not too thick, and rubbed right in. As far as stating whether it works or not, I can&#x27;t say yet, but I am going to come back on here to update you all on the results. Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> Used it on my breasts after second pregnancy and this made em very firm, in a few weeks. This is my second purchase of this item, works!</li>
    <li> had this b/4 very satisfied</li>
    <li> I saw Tyra Bnaks show and bought it together with patches and pills. I do not have that much cellulite to begin with but this system didn&#x27;t help me get rid of even my minimal cellulite. It&#x27;s a sham.</li>
    <li> Love this! Have noticed significant improvement in my skin after just a couple weeks of daily use. Will continue to use!!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working but I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s hard for me to tell since I work out constantly and even with that I do have some cellulite here and there but I can definitely say it&#x27;s a soothing gel-cream and am excited to notice the changes as I begin to use it more regularly I admit I only use it every now an then so that may be my problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim without reading any reviews. I just wanted something that would help &#x27;plump and firm&#x27; my NECK. At age 42, I&#x27;ve noticed things are starting to get a little weird (sagging skin, thinning out? Not sure, but it was getting darn ugly in pictures!!)...... I cannot believe the DIFFERENCE after just a few weeks of using this! In the AM after a shower - massage into neck - and nighttime after toning - one more application. I CAN SEE a huge difference in photographs (I model for my husband so I am a majorly harsh judge of that darn neck of mine)!!!  I&#x27;m guessing this lotion would have the same effect on other body parts, such as - buttocks and belly, thighs? I (so far, knock on wood) don&#x27;t have issues in those areas, but the dang neck.... yeah... no turkey neck for me any more, I&#x27;m addicted to this bottle of Nivea lotion!</li>
    <li> I do notice that my skin looks firmer if I use this on a regular basis. I don&#x27;t think it helps with cellulite very much.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well.</li>
    <li> If I would remember to use this regularly, maybe I&#x27;d be able to tell you whether it works or not. Otherwise, it feels great when I do put it on. Creates a nice cooling sensation. I&#x27;m sure it works, because at least my thighs look a little smoother. I just gotta apply it daily from now on. Try it out!</li>
    <li> Just like advertised it absorbs into skin quickly. I didn&#x27;t see much change but I did enjoy feeling my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it always works wonders.</li>
    <li> Why there isn&#x27;t an option for &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; stars?  I think these products need to specify what ethnicity or skin types these products work on.  I&#x27;ve been using this since June and there is absolutely NO CHANGE to the appearance of my skin and my skin is not even in bad shape.  Total waste of money. I think Amazon and these companies need to be held accountable for false advertisement.</li>
    <li> I love this product I could really see a great improvement in my skin and I love receiving it every two month at my door. Elder Esther Lewis</li>
    <li> I love Nivea products, and this one is another must have.  I apply it morning and night and I keep it out on my sink so when I use the bathroom throughout the day, I apply it when I think about it.  Especially before I work out.  I don&#x27;t know, I feel like it seeps in when I sweat.  I don&#x27;t know if its a placebo effect or what, but I&#x27;m on my second bottle because I love it.  It smells nice and makes your skin feel soft and I swear the mirror says my skin is more toned.  haha, I have no scientific proof though.  Love the product.  Def a purchase I will continue to make.</li>
    <li> Smells good takes awhile to dry which is irritating</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It does what it states--firms &amp; tones.  It doesn&#x27;t promise to rid cellulite--no cream can do that.  I just needed&lt;br /&gt;a little toning.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kendall Malloy</li>
    <li> One of my favorites!! You have the best price on this. Keep it up and I will keep buying!!!</li>
    <li> I have noticed my skin looking firmer so I can look past the super slimy texture.  It feels great once it dries but the initial slime factor is a bit much</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It works.!</li>
    <li> Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
    <li> I am not interesting to buy again it Nivea Skin Firming &amp; Toning Gel-Cream.</li>
    <li> I havent tried many but this item was great i will continue to use ★★★★★i saw a difference within a week when i begin using.</li>
