<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Glass nail files work great, and keep their surface for a very long time. I had several of these in the past, and they worked great, but my kids have sat or stepped on them which causes them to break. So I ordered these as a replacement. Not only are they great files, but are so pretty. Just be sure to keep them away from children (or clumsy people).</li>
    <li> Great files!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> these files are great. they won&#x27;t damage your nails even if you file back and forth. my nails stopped pelling almost emmidiately. great price too since they will last forever. i keep the small one in my purse and the large one is great for toes. a must have for sure.</li>
    <li> Perfect and forever lasting.</li>
    <li> These files are so much easier on my nails from the metal file I used to use. I have experienced less chipping, peeling, and breakage. These are very well made, and I like having multiple sizes. They make the edges of your nails smooth and rounded instead of sharp. My only complaint is the tip of the file is too large to really get under my nails. I think it is just a bit too thick to do an adequate job of cleaning out from under them but are still excellent nail files.</li>
    <li> This set has 3 files, one large for at home, one medium for the car, and one small for a purse (even an evening bag). I hate being without a nail file when I snag a nail, and these files are so smooth, that they&#x27;re even good for evening out a rough cuticle. They&#x27;re beautiful and look like they&#x27;ll last forever -- unless friends steal them first! )</li>
    <li> Love these especially since you can wash and reuse them</li>
    <li> This is the first crystal file that I have purchased that does NOT work well.  It takes forever to file the nail.  These files do eventually lose their effectiveness, but usually after years of use.  This one came ineffective.  Will not purchase this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I have had these previously. One dropped and was broken after years of use.  I was delighted to find a source.  They are absolutely fantastic! Once one uses them, nothing else is desirable.  They eliminate split nails and all other problems.  Thank you for making them available.</li>
    <li> Love them. Love the colors. They&#x27;ve worked very well and the quality has not deteriorated over time.</li>
    <li> I finally found files which do their job! I tried so many and none of them worked. I have thick finger and toe nails and after I use regular files 3-4 times they become useless bc sand comes off and I get bold lines. I do not even mention that some paper files bend and are useless if get wet. So, long story short. These three files come in different sizes each with different grits. Work perfect on thick nails. Don&#x27;t bend, do not wear off, water resistant and desinfectable. Thank you!</li>
    <li> These glass nail files are the best! They leave a smooth finish, with none of that emery board grit.  If you try these, you&#x27;ll never go back.  Try them.</li>
    <li> I ordered the purple and tealish green nail files and I got purple pink ones. But they work wonderful.</li>
    <li> Excellent, just as expected.  They were gifts and everyone was happy.  Genuine Czech is the only way to go for crystal files.</li>
    <li> These are great!  They never dull.  They don&#x27;t damage my nails.  They&#x27;re easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Not for my use, gift for my mother. She seemed to like them I can&#x27;t comment on the use of them. Color is great. Poor package. Only bubblewrapped. Would have given more stars if they were better presented in a retail package.</li>
    <li> Great file! Loved the 3 different sizes. Would order again.</li>
    <li> these things are amazing, and such good quality!! Especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased these crystal nail files.  I have had them well over a  year and I used them often.  I am just sorry I did not know about them long ago.  A good buy.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I had a set of files (only 2) like these, lost one, and broke one. I couldn&#x27;t find them again at a reasonable price, so I looked on Amazon, and these seemed exactly like the ones I had, in a set of 3! These are even better because they are usable on both sides, not just one side. Many files that look like these can be found in stores, but when you use them the abrasiveness just wears away. These remain functional, plus they can be washed. Just remember, though - they do break! I have thin delicate nails, and ONLY these files work for me.</li>
    <li> I had a set o similar nail files, but no longer shop with QVC - the quality of their vendors has diminished.  So I choose to look on Amazon and found these.  Great value, terrific quality!</li>
    <li> Love these. Too bad nail salons don&#x27;t use these.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I tried these, so I was trusting the positive reviews.  They are so nice because they don&#x27;t break down like the cardboard files and they are easy to keep clean.  They do remove a lot of nail material, so one has to be careful not to file too aggressively.</li>
    <li> Great product as I expected. I&#x27;ve purchased one of these before about 8 years ago and I still use it but the tip broke a little so I wanted a new one. These files last forever (as long as you don&#x27;t break the glass).</li>
    <li> good product for the price</li>
    <li> Just received these today. So far so good. They are pretty and work very smoothly. Just be aware that the largest file is pretty large and heavy. I think I will get the least use out of that one. The largest file is also significantly thicker than the other 2. I will keep the small file in my purse and use the medium for everyday. I&#x27;ve already noticed that these files do not leave rough edges like other emery boards I have used. Major plus!</li>
    <li> GREAT for nails!  Also helps with difficult heels.</li>
    <li> LOVE these files. Also bought the &amp;#34;Cheeky&amp;#34; brand ones to compare, and these are way better, hands down. The grain on them is perfect---fine enough to be smooth, but rough enough so that manicure can be quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Love these nail files!  I bought three sets: one for myself, and the other two for stocking stuffers for my daughter and granddaughter.  We all are very happy with them.  Be aware that you may not like them at first.  They sort of look like they won&#x27;t be abrasive enough, but once you use them once, you will love them!</li>
    <li> I love my glass nail files!</li>
    <li> These are the best finger nail files ever. I have a dislike for the hard paper Emory boards. Using them makes my skin crawl (the same as fingernails scratching a chalk board). These glass files do not affect me the same way. I have purchased many for gifts. To a person everyone loves them. An added bonus is that they are very pretty!!</li>
    <li> These are amazing! My nails grow better since I switched to glass files.  These are nice quality and don&#x27;t seem to break as easily as the last set I tried.  They do an amazing job of smoothing the ends of my nails leaving them snag-free.  I like the larger size for my toes. I&#x27;ve bought a few to give as gifts and I always hear back about how great they are.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought my first crystal nail file in Maui and when I lost it I was devastated.  These were exactly like the one I had, and the 3 sizes are great!</li>
    <li> Really wonderful nail files. Better than anything I have ever used. You will get perfect file shape with very little effort. Love it.</li>
    <li> These tear my nails up and leave them more rough than when I started. Good for filing down, but not for smoothing out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other glass files -- they are not all created equal. I&#x27;ve purchased these for my mom, also, and she agrees. Wish they were a little more durable or came in a more durable case, but otherwise, they&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> these are the best files you can use on your nails!! Hands down...no pun intended....They get the job done but don&#x27;t damage the nail. I give these sets as gifts!</li>
    <li> I recently ordered these to replace the glass file I had that went missing. And these are much better than that one! Very smooth and effective for creating a final snag-free finish on my Jamberry wraps. Pretty color too! I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had crystal files before, but they are so much better than regular emery boards.  The fact that they never get dull is pretty impressive.  They took a while to receive, but that was stated when I ordered, so overall I&#x27;m quite happy with them.</li>
    <li> These are great and seem like they will not wear out.  Be careful though because they can crack.</li>
    <li> These are amazing but it would be nice to actually receive the color I purchased. I got pink/purple instead of blue.</li>
    <li> Not the quality I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I will always use this type of file. The round tip on the pedicure file has a purpose,&lt;br /&gt;it won&#x27;t prick your feet.</li>
    <li> Really cool, I like the idea that they won&#x27;t wear out - the 3 different sizes are good, too. The largest one is a trifle thick for getting under short nails, but I knew that before ordering, and it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite files! Makes such a difference!</li>
    <li> Not much to say, but I needed a new glass file, and the multisized set lets me easily keep the little one in my purse for fixing any snags or chips during the day, and the medium one lives at home. Not quite sure yet what to do with the huge one, but the price on the set was great, and grit is fine and even.</li>
    <li> perfect, came on time and quality was as expected</li>
    <li> Beautiful, but feels like finger nails on a chalk board. Ick</li>
    <li> These Czech glass nail files are super! I love them! I have very thin, flimsy finger nails and very thick, strong toe nails. Thes files take care of both types of nails perfectly! Extremely good at removing the tiny micro-snags on edges of nails that the regular emery boards can never seem to remove. These seem to last forever with just a rinse under the sink to clean them. But, do NOT drop them in the sink or on tile floors or they WILL break!</li>
    <li> Uh - I have been filing my nails all wrong my entire life. Crystal nail files are AMAZING. They feel so much better and are so much smoother on your nails. The large size is perfect for feet and love the medium size for my fingers.</li>
    <li> Best nail files ever.  These are good ones, not cheap ones that wear out.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, works perfectly. I doubt I will ever need to replace. Much cleaner filing than emery boards, and doesn&#x27;t tear at nails.</li>
    <li> I wear Jamberry nails and needed a file that would hold up to me doing them every week.  These files do &amp;exactly what I needed them to! 3 different grits for $11. Couldn&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one month now and will never go back to normal emory boards again! I have very weak nails that break easily - and, while they will still break even with this product, they have not been splitting or peeling at all since I switched from emory boards to glass.  The files are strong - I have accidentally dropped them a couple of times without having them break. I like the fact that I can easily wash and steralize them. They are a bit thick (hard to get underneath the nail if it is short) so I reduced one star for that, but I really like the product and highly recommend it - if you have nails that need a little more gentleness and TLC, give these files a try.</li>
    <li> This set was for my daughter. When the package arrived I could see the value of these immediately. It seems like a lifetime investment, plus these crystals are simply beautiful and if left on a nite stand instead of back with your manicure items -- it would seem like art instead of a grooming utensils. Plus, the obvious thing is how sanitary they are,,,,,,,,,, I am getting a set NOW!</li>
    <li> Nice. Very fine grit. These are my first glass files and I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Any other kind of nail file is useless compared to these glass files.  We find that the large one is the most practical and now have three around the house. Not only useful for nails, but rough skin and small sanding projects.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
    <li> Update on 9-18-14: Still LOVE these files, but careful carrying it in a purse/tote without adequate protection. My tiny one shattered (due the abuse I put my purse through, heavy keys and stuff) but I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t leave too many shards.     These are so much better than the other emery board/disposable type files including the steel ones. I like all three sizes and carry the smallest one in my purse. Very effective and gentle filers, I also use it to file my toddler&#x27;s nails and it&#x27;s super gentle.    The quality is good and just one wash restores them to a like-new state.</li>
    <li> definitely worth the price...does wonders for your nails...can be cleaned with alcohol...I take them along to my nail salon...less chance of catching some type of fungus!...would recommend to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I like the feel of it a lot better than the sand paper type you find in drug store.  It does not roughen the skin around your nails like the stuff you get in the store. The only thing I do not care for is the thickness.</li>
    <li> I have been using these nail files for 3 or 4 years.  Wanted another set.  Much better than other type of nail files.</li>
    <li> These files are worth every penny I paid for them.  They work great on your nails as well as calluses.  So far no problems and I am sure they will last much longer than a regular file.</li>
    <li> So pretty and they work much much better than regular files.</li>
    <li> My wife received a ceramic file some time ago.  Unfortunately it broke in half.  Searched Amazon and she said order the set.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for &amp; fast delivery.</li>
    <li> So I am not the type of girl that files her nails… in fact before trying these nail files I would never file my nails. I hated the feeling of typical files grating my nails (set my teeth on edge), so I would just clip them or wait until they broke or tore. Trying these changed my whole relationship with my nails and nail files. Not only do I actually take care of my nails now, but I like to file them. I have had them for a little over a year now and they show no signs of wear and tear, chipping, or breaking. Not to mention that they are just as gorgeous as the day they arrived. These file are also super easy to clean with warm water and some soap.  They are much nicer files than something that you might buy at CVS and will last much, much longer. The blue/green/purple colors of the files reminds me of sea glass. Everyone who has seen them has commented on how pretty they are, and using them makes me feel very sophisticated and fancy. I loved them so much I ordered sets for my mom and grandmother. The only thing I wish is that they would come with a hard protective case of some sort instead of/ or in addition to the little sleeves. Overall all this product is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> These files seem to be good quality.  The only thing that I would have liked better is if the biggest file were wider, like the other set that I have.  I bought this one for a gift.</li>
    <li> Love these files, although the description is not accurate. The grit numbers are not &#x27;etched&#x27; into the glass nor are they even on the back of the plastic sleeves. I can tell you right now that the big file is no where near 180 grit. I have made metal jewelry using sand paper in different grits to smooth and shape, and I can tell you by the feel of the grit it is more like 400. The small file feels around 800. I gave the medium one away to my mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do file quite nice, however. The large file claiming to be for callous seems to me like scrubbing a kitchen floor with a toothbrush: only a small area gets the work. If you have rougher, drier feet like me then the big file will just make your foot smooth for a day until the skin peels later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of expensive for what you pay for, because you have no way of knowing if this product is authentic Czech glass other than a sticker on the back of the large file claiming &amp;#34;Product of Czech Republic&amp;#34;. Nice files, but not appreciate of them claiming to have extra grits.</li>
    <li> These files are frickin&#x27; MAGIC for your nails! They leave the edges super smooth, and the travel sized file is a must for keeping in your bag in case of whatever tragedy may befall your nails at any given time. As I don&#x27;t really have issues with rough feet, the large sized file is a bit unnecessary for me, but you never know when that may change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is an excellent value, and I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ll shun all previous styles of nail files once you get your hands on these puppies. Give &#x27;em a shot - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a set of these for a while, and when I finally got them, I was SO excited! They work great for fingernails, but as a jewelry artisan, I find that they are FANTASTIC for filing sharp points off of copper wire!!!! WOOHOOO! Double duty! These are definitely worth the money, my husband now owns the smaller one, I have the other two. I&#x27;ve used them in my whole family, including our Hahn&#x27;s macaw Jack! I filed down his beak so easily... I don&#x27;t recommend that you do that with your own parrot unless they a) trust you completely and b) don&#x27;t mind you trimming their beak and toenails! Lol! I couldn&#x27;t use it on my husband&#x27;s Green cheek conure, Mango. She let me do her toes,  but her beak was off limits!!! Great purchase, will gladly get another if I ever drop/break them! Cali, The Bead Muse Artisan and pet owner!! Hehehe</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at a good price. Received quickly.</li>
    <li> I saw this item on a YouTube video and decided to order a set.  I LOVE them!!! they are beautiful and file so nice.  No rough edges left on the nail!  I highly recommend this product.  I love them so much I just bough 6 sets for gifts!!!</li>
    <li> Love these! I rinse them off sometimes. Love the different sizes, for purse,&lt;br /&gt;drawer, etc. Just don&#x27;t DROP them!!!  lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had them for maybe ~3 months and my nails look and feel amazing! I have tried to purchase cheaper alternatives to glass nail files that turned out to be not etched into the glass. Those wore out so quickly and I just couldn&#x27;t use them anymore. This is a steal! It&#x27;s only around 5$ per nail file and I have one in my dorm, in my house and in my bag! It&#x27;s so convenient and easy to use. I definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> REAL crystal here.. not glass.. LOVE them will buy again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have several sets, one fore me, and another set for my pets, the parrots love getting their toes filed! There is no stress for the dogs or birds anymore!!</li>
    <li> I have never tried a crystal nail files before but I decided to give them a try. I am glad I did because my nails are now perfectly smooth. The files are well made and good looking. After filing all of my nails the file still had the rough texture and looks like it will last much longer compared to standard nail files. The three sizes are convenient to have one for my purse, one for my nails, and one for my heels. I would definitely recommend these nail files to anyone with natural nails.</li>
    <li> Seemed very nice, really nice color and texture. Two actually broke as I was filing, I didn&#x27;t get injured or anything, I may have just been pressing too hard? Maybe faulty, don&#x27;t know. Probably a rare situation.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a small gift.</li>
    <li> Very good nail files and will last a long time!!! My nails hardly break anymore.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use anything other than these anymore. They are the absolute best!!!</li>
    <li> Great, just as described. Of course they don&#x27;t last forever but I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months and after a lot of use they&#x27;re still great. If they break I&#x27;ll likely buy from them again, the price is great.</li>
    <li> This little set is awesome and the protective sleeves are perfect. Great for baby&#x27;s nails too! Note: Glass files are much thicker than metal files. You will not be able to get under the corners or down the sides of a nail with these. They DO reduce splitting and peeling of the nail nicely though.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. These files really help with keeping my nails in shape and healthy!  You won&#x27;t regret buying crystal nail files.</li>
    <li> The nail files are very gentle on my nails. They came in a small box so there is no real need to buy a nail case unless you really want to. I am a happy and I will recomend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought these in set of 3 and I like it.  The file work is done perfectly on my nails.</li>
    <li> If you file your nails, do not deprive yourself of these files. I never would have imagined they are so far superior to metal files and emery boards.  If the world knew, there would be no more emery boards. My nails are smoothed and shaped to perfection and I did not have to saw on them forever and change emery boards before the job was completed.</li>
    <li> These are pretty awesome so far, but I worry that they seem... odd. Like one end starts rough and then by the time you get to the end of the file it&#x27;s totally smooth. It&#x27;s hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coloration is very nice and vibrant like the photo. There&#x27;s also a smooth section on each file (the green area) for holding it comfortably without having the grit on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do file quite smoothly and clean easily.</li>
    <li> Fabulous Files!!  Forget emery boards, diamond files, dremel bits or whatever.  From now on, we&#x27;re using only these Genuine Czech, Crystal Glass Nail Files for perfectly polished nails.  This set is for our granddaughter who saw Gram&#x27;s set and said, &amp;#34;please, may I have one too?&amp;#34;  No wonder, they are functional and yet beautiful.  Treat yourself, your daughter, your granddaughter or a friend and buy these Genuine Czech files!!</li>
    <li> Not only love the color selection, but these czech glass nail and feet files are THE best files on the market!! This was the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought one for my feet, and I was amazed at how great of a job it did removing dead and rough skin from my heels. Personally, I think they&#x27;re way better, and definitely safer, than the traditional metal buffing files. Want a set in every gorgeous color scheme!!!</li>
    <li> Love these glass nail files - had before and ordered for myself and as gifts.</li>
    <li> When I first opened these I was a little worried.  As other reviews had stated, you can&#x27;t really see the grain on the file, it looks very smooth. But, when you run your finger over them, they are not smooth at all.  These are excellent files! They should have no problem holding up to years of wear and tear.  Another huge plus is that they can be sanitized. When I bought this set I also purchased one in another color. They seem to be just as great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember if the description said these were for synthetic nails but they didn&#x27;t work very well on my natural nails.</li>
    <li> Easy on my nails, smooth finish. Love them, and I&#x27;m looking forward to years of service. Would recommend this purchase to others.</li>
    <li> My cousin told me about these files and I can not believe how smooth they are.  They do not hurt and they seem to smooth over rough places and they do not return.  You will love these.  I bought a 2nd set for my Mom because she has an index fingernail that always splits at the same place.  She told me last night that she&#x27;s gone a week now with out it splitting!!</li>
    <li> These are EXACTLY what I needed. Use for professional manicures and pedicures so I needed something that maintains the integrity of the nail and callouses, while still getting the job done and softening callouses without removing them (which can be very painful for clients, and is very unprofessional). Also needed something that can be sanitized. These work like a dream. Love the different sizes, although will probably only use the small one for me personally to have in my purse. The big callous one just has to be washed off periodically while softening callouses to keep the grit you need.</li>
    <li> great nail files since using them for about 2 months my nails look so much better no more splitting will order more for Christmas gifts</li>
    <li> Love these nail files.  Does the job well.  Bought one for mom, too!  She loves the variety of sizes.  We both carry the samll file in our purses for emergencies!</li>
    <li> I use this for nails and rough skin on the bottoms of my feet.  Works great and won&#x27;t wear out!</li>
    <li> Wow! I am a guy and I never loved filing my nails. But at least these look nice and they do a good job of creating a smooth nail edge. I also love that you can run them under water and they are as good as new.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and it does a good job. Just be careful not to press too hard, or it may snap.</li>
    <li> Fine set of glass nail files.</li>
    <li> I love the large file the best! The other companies don&#x27;t seem to carry it.</li>
    <li> I really love this type of nail file. The file has a nice fine grit so you don&#x27;t tear up your nail. They are a nice color in the picture but do not look the same in person. They are actually emerald green and royal blue not teal and purple as they look in the picture. I like the different sizes. My only complaint is that they are really thick even the smaller ones. I really wish they were a little thinner. I have a couple of other sets and they are thinner especially the smaller ones. Otherwise this is a great product. I give them as gifts all the time.</li>
    <li> I have used other crystal nail files with much satisfaction.  These are far more expensive, but supposedly last longer.  I am happy with the purchase, but so far find them no better than the cheaper ones.  That said, I&#x27;ve only had them for two months.  I&#x27;ve used the cheaper ones for a month or two longer and so far, no difference.</li>
    <li> The medium arrived broken, the large was the one I really wanted so no biggie.  Colors are very pretty.  Also files very well,  easy to clean and each file comes with their own individual sleeve.  Rinsed under water and good as new.  Just remember, they are glass, don&#x27;t drop them. xP</li>
    <li> I have used other glass files I bought at a drugstore and flea markets.  These cheap versions never seemed to actually file my nails or it took forever.  Not these!  I suddenly had peeling nails and emory boards just made the peeling worse and I researched that glass nail files are the best to prevent peeling and splitting.  I have used these glass nail files for several weeks and what a difference!  They work quick and leave the edge of nail smooth and best of all, my nails have stopped peeling and splitting.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my 3 piece Genuine Czech, Etched, Crystal Glass Nail File Set.  It is very pretty to look at, I got them in blue, and it works very well.  I have no problems with filing my nails, and can do so in a back and forth motion, not just in one direction like a traditional nail file, because it is so gentle on nails.  I think it works better and faster than a traditional metal nail file.  It definitely makes your nails smoother without damaging them.  The only thing, you have to be careful not to drop these crystal glass nail files, because they will break easily due to the fact that they are crystal glass. I still recommend them over a traditional nail file.  And I received my nail file set in a short time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had thin nails that point upward at the edges. Most nail files are too harsh, but these are amazing! I rarely get snags and the time between filing is reduced. They also work great for dry hangnails.</li>
    <li> It is nice to see a beauty product that is not pink. I am a guy and have not bought things I wanted for that very reason. PINK! Blech! These files are stronger grit than the usual paper files and with a rinse went back to brand new. I have stopped clipping my nails in favor of using this file once a week and it keeps my nails neat and sharp. I bet it would break if I dropped it so for that reason I am a careful. The large File was helpful in filing toenails and callouses on my feet and the large size made it easy to handle. The ends of the pointed files are very precise and a little sharp so cleaning under nails is a snap. All in all a great masculine nail set. (Girls like it too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a year since I purchased these files and I gotta say, they are the BEST files I have ever used. I returned to change my rating from 4 star to 5 and to give a lil update. The paint has worn off the handle a little where my nail comes in contact with it but other than that... perfection. After use I rinse and use a lil soap and a toothbrush and it looks like new. Seriously, after a whole year of heavy use these files show NO wear and tear. (with the exception of the paint that my nails filed off the handle) Go ahead and buy them. You will love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-10-2017&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 5 years since I purchased my set of files and they are still like new. I can see NO wear other than the afore mentioned paint wearing off. If I could give it 10 stars I would. They really are the BEST files EVAH!!!</li>
    <li> Having each file in it&#x27;s own sleeve was a very nice feature. They look nice and did a good job.</li>
    <li> Love these files. 3 sizes. I can keep the smallest one in my purse. They&#x27;re very sturdy and file very smoothly!</li>
    <li> I have very thick nails that cannot be clipped and these files do the job easily without tearing up. The green and blue-purple color is lovely.</li>
    <li> I love the large one.  As they go down in size though, I find they don&#x27;t work as well.  The tiny one doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all (but that could be my tough finger nails).  I bought a set for my daughter and she was delighted.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with glass nail files, so I can&#x27;t compare them to other brands.  I am very pleased with them, though.  They do a wonderful job, file quickly and leave a fine edge.</li>
    <li> The best nail files I&#x27;ve ever used.  My nails are stronger and less prone to peeling/chipping.  Leaves an unbelievably smooth edge.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Loved mine so much I made sure my Birthday list was filled with them.</li>
    <li> good product, good seller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the crystal nail files for years.  They last for a long time and are great to smooth hangnails on the go.  I use gloves at work a lot and a hangnail will catch on them or even break them.  Then largest is also designed for use to remove calluses but can be used for the first pass or two after cutting your nails.  The smallest one is a great size to take with you and they all have protector sleeves to help against breakage. The set of 3 makes a great &amp;#34;small gift&amp;#34; for someone also.</li>
    <li> I purchased some of these a few years ago from a tv shopping channel.  Of course they stopped selling them and mine broke ( they are glass and they will break if you drop them on tile). I was so happy to find them here and I purchased another 2 sets.  They are the same quality files I bought before.  SO happy to find them again. They work just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Work really well, cut quickly.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered these I had a small Crystal Glass nail file but the 3 piece is so much better. I am going to buy more and have them as gifts they make my nails healthy and are so cleaver as a gift.I love this product and know my BF will to .</li>
    <li> Good value and quality!</li>
    <li> I am a guy who plays guitar and unfortunately nails become an issue. If you are a dude and play guitar (classical) you know what I am talking about.  With that said, these 3 little gems are the best for smoothing nails.  Easy to clean.  Worth every dime.  They leave no rough edges.  I do not know much about nail files but these are simply outstanding.</li>
    <li> Will never use a cardboard or metal nail file again.</li>
    <li> These are the best and only nail files you will ever need.  Don&#x27;t get fooled by the ones with grit glued on them. Get these they are the real deal.</li>
    <li> After using regular emery boards for all of my life, I just ordered these and have had them for about a month.  They do a great job, seem very durable and will last a long time.  After a month plus of use, my nails seem in better condition than they did with the regular boards.  Not the slightest bit dull after daily use for the past month plus.  So great that I bought my Mom a set as a stocking stuffer.  She was very excited as she had tried mine a few weeks prior.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i was looking to replace my old crystal file that i lost. i bought the first one at a fair. this one isnt exactly the same but it close and alot better than other files. i would get more</li>
    <li> Who knew. This nail file it&#x27;s the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Gift recipient like these.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite files.  I&#x27;ve purchased them twice.  They don&#x27;t wear out but I&#x27;ve dropped them on tile floor and they will break.</li>
    <li> Love the crystal filing compared to any other.  The price is right.</li>
    <li> These work quite well. They don&#x27;t wear down, and bringing them back to new is as simple as running them under the faucet.</li>
    <li> I love these nail files! I have heard great things about them for a while now, I finally found them and buy them for everyone. Only suggestion get the hard case if you want to put it in your purse.</li>
    <li> This is my second set. My first set is about 4 years old and there isn&#x27;t anything wrong with it, I just wanted to have more files in more rooms of the house and the small one is in my purse. My heels crack in the winter and the big glass file is the best tool I have found for getting the dead skin off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a special woman in my life because normal nail files are a huge pain. She loves them. No wear, easy to clean and the sizes are perfect for having one in your purse and the others elsewhere. Some people said this wasn&#x27;t real glass file but it is. It is worth the purchase especially when considering the price point of the competition.</li>
    <li> Super nice love glass nail filing.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT! They don&#x27;t chew up your nails.</li>
    <li> I already have a set of these files. I purchased 2 more because I know if something happens to the one I have, I&#x27;ll never find them again. I think they are great . They do not destroy your nails.</li>
    <li> Really love these nail files, they don&#x27;t leave and snags hanging from my nails.  I also like the different sizes</li>
    <li> These are great nail files that leave a smooth finish -- and they never need to be replaced.  Yes, they are glass but I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with any of them breaking --- I keep one by my bedside, one in my purse, and one tossed in the center console of my car.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful files for nails. They don&#x27;t cause splitting. Purchased in this set is very inexpensive. Sold separately, if you can find them, costs much more.</li>
    <li> These are better than I expected!  I love them!  Easy to clean, easy to use!</li>
    <li> These are awesome. The best nail files ever. They never wear out.</li>
    <li> No complaints, they work as expected.  I like the price for three.  The first glass nail file I purchased was at a salon years ago and I paid the same price for one file then as I paid for these three now.  I love having a small one for my bag and larger ones for leaving at home.  I&#x27;ll never need to buy another nail file again!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price! Makes filing nails so much easier and faster. I&#x27;ve been using the same one for months and still works like new!</li>
    <li> Great product. Much better quality than a previously-owned nail file made in China.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail files I&#x27;ve ever owned and they happen to be gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate recommending them!</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of files.  I was told to use glass files, as they are easier on thin weak nails.  Like them so far, but I&#x27;ve only had them a month or so.  Hope they don&#x27;t break, as they are made of glass.  They do come in a little plastic protective sleeve.</li>
    <li> The quality of these files is just right and the color is very nice. I am quite pleased with these sets -- I bought three colors.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I have a set of &amp;#34;CZECH&amp;#34; crystal glass nail files &amp; they are much thinner &amp; work so much better than these.  These are thick &amp; rougher than my &amp;#34;Czech&amp;#34; glass nail files &amp; they do not do my nails as smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have TRIED two diff. places on Amazon &amp; have not been happy w/either sets of nail files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the larger file for feet pedicures.  I give up on buying the &amp;#34;Czech&amp;#34; nail files on Amazon.  I bought mine in Arizona &amp; when I get back there, I&#x27;ll buy SEVERAL SETS because THOSE I buy there, are superior to what I have found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> never buy another file set and i swear my nails are thicker and stronger after i switched to glass files.</li>
    <li> these were great.  They were exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Three choices for shaping nails.  Good color for finding in the drawer.  I can bring the small one with me when I travel.  They each come with their own sleeve.</li>
    <li> Quality product, doesn&#x27;t wear out on the first use. Nice that it comes with all three sizes.</li>
    <li> These were given as a gift much to the delight of the recipient.</li>
    <li> This nail file set is so beautiful and blows the traditional emory boards out of the water! It&#x27;s such a bargain for the set of three too. I get complimented all the time and continually questioned as to where I bought them. Who knew you get garner compliments for filing your finger nails?</li>
    <li> Really nice nail files &amp; the big one is great for exfoliating your feet.  The files are pretty &amp; feel good in your hand.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> GF asked me to order her some of these crystal nail files and I did - not expecting to use them.  Yet one night a sharp nail was chappin my fanny and yet, there they were on the coffee table in front of me.  Made short work and much smoother than my mini leatherman nail file I usually have in my pocket.  Now once a week while watching a movie, I just run them over the medium file and actually don&#x27;t even need to clip first.  Every couple weeks, scrub them under warm water with a cheap toothbrush and throw them through the dishwasher just because I can.  They come out like new.  Not sure your supposed to throw them through the dishwasher, but like I said....  I am a man.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed in the quality of this set of crystal nail files.  There is nothing fantastic about them and they are a lot thinner than a set I use to have that were lost . . . I&#x27;ll have to see how long they hold up.  Just okay.</li>
    <li> nothing to write home about, but they work good. they will break, so be careful with them and they will last a long time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative to hard emory boards that tend to make nails more jagged.  I love these.  They are gentle and smooth edges with just a pass or two.  Also while the cost up front may be a bit of a turn off, in the long run, they last so much longer than standard cardboard emory boards.  I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone who wants to save time, energy and in the long run cash.</li>
    <li> I was completely unaware of crystal nail files until I read an article in one of my magazines. The article recommended using crystal files from Czechoslovakia. In comparison to a regular emery board or metal files the crystal file wins hands down! To me metal files are to harsh for my nails which are soft. The crystal file requires very little pressure to file your nails. They are also great for your toe nails. I anticipate that the files will last for a long time. I will recommend these files to any and everyone!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Arrived a day sooner than projected. Will never use any other type of nail file again.</li>
    <li> Like the fact these don&#x27;t wear down like some of this type. Each works well. I like the various sizes to address the need at the time - big for heavy duty and smaller for more finite grinding.</li>
    <li> I have had these for over a year now &amp; they are the best nail filers I have ever owned. I will never go back to regular nail filer in my life!! Great quality &amp; I love the color!!</li>
    <li> These are the best files to use for your natural nails.  They will keep your nails from splitting.  I purchased one set for myself and loved it so much purchased another set for my daughter.</li>
    <li> As you know women take care of their nails and my wife uses these almost everyday. As it turns out I use them too.</li>
    <li> Liked it so much, that I bought these for a gift for my BFF&#x27;s girl&#x27;s graduation present!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these by mistake and I was pleasantly surprised. They offer a smooth and snag free nail edge without irritating delicate skin around the nail. Well worth the price and they last and last. They can be sterilized by dipping them in very very hot water and perform like new. I use the bigger one for pedicure touch-ups and carry the small one in my purse and use the middle one for regular nail touch-ups when changing polish between manicures.. You need to protect them from breakage so don&#x27;t forget your cover case.</li>
    <li> Best. Nail Files. Ever. :)</li>
    <li> Fantastic nail files! The grit doesn&#x27;t wear off of these!</li>
    <li> Love these!  Very nice quality, beautiful colors.  I have weak nails, and these work better than anything else I have tried.  As an added bonus, with these glass files you can file your nails &amp;#34;back and forth&amp;#34; instead of the more time-consuming &amp;#34;file to the middle only&amp;#34; method, with NO damage at all.  I use the super large file for my dog, who despises all things vet related, especially having his nails trimmed.  Works great on him; I just am slow and gentle, and keep his snout busy with treats while I work.  The money I&#x27;ve saved on his nail trims paid for the item the first use.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love crystal nail files and am glad to have this set of various sizes.  Though not mentioned in the description these are bi-directional whereas some of the cheaper &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; files only file properly in one direction.  Probably because some of those others aren&#x27;t really glass/crystal but acrylic instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attention all of my girl friends...this is what you&#x27;ll be getting for your next birthday gift.</li>
    <li> beautiful and well made. I love crystal nail files and get so bummed if I lose or break one.  These are great, it&#x27;s clear that the glass itself is etched, not some coating that is sprayed on and will get rubbed off over time.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this set of glass nail files. I bought these to use with Jamberry nail stickers (which you have to heat up to adhere to your nail and then file off the excess), but I can&#x27;t believe I never owned these before. First, the quality is better than any emery board I&#x27;ve ever had - even the nice ones. They file smoothly, leaving a consistently clean edge. The three sizes are extremely convenient - I keep one with my nail stuff, one in my bag, and one at work. These have also been a huge help with the Jamberry application, and the difference between a regular file and this one is even more stark when filing off nail stickers. I highly, highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these files for over a year now, and they&#x27;re still working as well as day 1 - no issues with paint flaking off or degrading of the file. These seem to have a finer but more effective grit than a lot of other glass nail files out there.  Edit: 2.5 years later, and they&#x27;re still going strong! They&#x27;re missing some paint, but after an occasional wash, they still work like they did when they were new.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and they work so well</li>
    <li> prompt delivery and satisfaction with product</li>
    <li> Really like these. They&#x27;re lovely and do a good job. You really need to be careful, because they can break VERY easily. Subtracted one star because the large file is pretty worthless - supposed to be for pedicures but can&#x27;t file calluses for crap. The nail files are great though and this is a great value.</li>
    <li> It is working out better than I ever dreamed, its a great product and I would recomend it to all of my friends, and i have!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still just using the smallest of the set.  Have had no need to pull out the others.  Oh my soooooo good. Bought these on the recommendation of Youtuber &amp;#34;PINKSOFOXY&amp;#34;.  And she ever was right.  If you have tried other glass files (and I have) and have been repurchasing because they stopped doing the job then please purchase the GENUINE CZECH crystal glass files. You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> a wonderful product! doesn&#x27;t wear away like traditional &#x27;sandpaper&#x27; files.these will last!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different glass files over the years and these are the best.  The abrasive portion of the file is coarse enough to get the job done and yet still good to use on my natural nails.  I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I gave these as presents. Everybody loves them!</li>
    <li> These are perfect. I wash them every time after use and they work perfectly fine!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite nail files, I have two sets so I have one in the car, in my purse, at work, next to the computer, in the living room and one in the night stand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these nail files for 6 months now and I&#x27;m never going back to regular files! These things ROCK. They never wear down, and provide the right smoothness for any nail you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And guys - you&#x27;ll like them too!</li>
    <li> I bought a crystal file 2 years ago at a local street fair.  This has been such a great file that I was so happy to see them on-line! These files never wear out, are easy to clean, work like a charm.  My husband uses mine!  I bought these so I&#x27;d have one in my purse, desk, and car!  I&#x27;ve also stashed some around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I love these! The edges can file as well as the flat face.  The biggest one is the thickest and is rounded on both ends.  The smaller ones have progressively thinner glass and are a bit pointed on the ends which helps a lot.  Beautiful, durable, and you can clean them easily.  the seller messed up and sent me the pink/purple ones instead of the green so it&#x27;s a good thing I like both color options</li>
    <li> Great files. The middle size is the most useful, but all three are worth having. No rusting and easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> Great files I got the set for the large one for my feet I have really bad callouses.</li>
    <li> Best nail files I&#x27;ve EVER used. And you get three - so I have one at the office, one in my purse, and the big one at home. They do a fabulous job of smoothing down rough or broken nails without leaving all those little snags.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve hated nail files forever, but I&#x27;d never tried these before. Way better than emery boards or metal files. The feel is good, files quickly. Pretty, too. Set is a good price. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like these files. I bought them mostly for the big file to smooth out rough feet in the summer. They work well when used in the shower or bath, however they can break easily so watch out! I dropped one, stepped on another! The small one works well on nails.</li>
    <li> Always give me a healthy, polished look after use. Also strengthens my nails.</li>
    <li> Stunning with great quality and vibrant colors.</li>
    <li> Great, love these, the best invention since sliced bread. They do break a little more easily than my original set but still 200% better than emery  boards or the metal nail files. They do NOT shatter.  One is always in purse, one on nightstand, one in bathroom fr my feet after a shower. Best to use on feet after a shower when skin is softer.</li>
    <li> Pretty amazing nail file, and yes they do work better than any other nail file I&#x27;ve used. The only problem is that you have to get used to using them, they have a nails on a chalkboard feel initially; you have to use it at a different angle, so there is an adjustment period where you feel like you might have to break them into little tiny pieces for full satisfaction. Still worth it and I&#x27;ll buy &#x27;em again.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these files about one year ago.  It has been excellent to use on my nails to avoid breaking/ flaking.  It has not become dull and is able to be cleaned with antibacterial soap and water.  The file is very efficient so it is easier to remove more nail than you intend until you get used to this premium file. I elected to purchase this set of three for more versatile uses due to the different sizes.  They are breakable.</li>
    <li> Best files I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> A lady at the art fair was selling these. The pedicure one was 20.00 the large 11.00 the medium 9.00 and small for 6.00 This is all for less than one! These last forever, unlike regular nail files and wont split your nails. Much healthier, durable, and can be sanitized!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality and do a great job of filing nails</li>
    <li> Good quality glass files! I&#x27;ve bought quite a few recently looking for a good one, and these finally fit the bill. I&#x27;ve been using nothing but glass files for years and will never go back to anything else. The only thing I would change on these is for the thin sides to be textured as well as the top and bottom.</li>
    <li> Seem to work well, just wish the large file as a bit smaller.  Is a little awkward for someone with small hands.</li>
    <li> As described, prompty delivered</li>
    <li> If you like filing your nails with a chalkboard- these are for you!</li>
    <li> This a first rate set of nail files. One for every need, from coarse toenails to  delicate smoothing of fingernails.</li>
    <li> Never heard of glass files before.  they are a beautiful set of 3 in different sizes as pictured. Just rinse them under the faucet.  I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
