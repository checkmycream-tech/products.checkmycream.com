<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The fragrance of this lotion is so clean and crisp and as a lotion it is far and away more effective on dry skin.  Most importantly, there is no greasy film left on the skin.  Thank you Crabtree &amp; Evelyn.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent refreshing scent.  But it&#x27;s the way that your hands feel so smooth and silky, not sticky or slimy.  It&#x27;s really the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  A bit on the pricey side but an essential for anyone that washed their hands frequently.</li>
    <li> This smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy and really helps my hands to be soft.  Love it!  I&#x27;m buying this as gifts for my kids teachers this year.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, and yet not overpowering...hands feel like silk with this lotion on...not greasy and slippery like other lotions.  Great generous size tube as well.</li>
    <li> It smells great like all the Citron products.  A little heavy, but perfect before bed and on elbows and knees.</li>
    <li> Works excellent!! Tried other brands and this has been the best!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Crabtree and Evelyn hand lotion.  There are different fragences but Citron and Honey is my favorite. I have tried many hand creams and lotions. This hand lotion really absorbs into my terribly dry hands and makes them smoother. Quick delivery time too.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion as a gift for my mother. I higly recommend this brand I use it myself and have used this particular one. It has a wonderful lemon smell and it makes you&#x27;re hands soft and quenched the thirst of dry hands</li>
    <li> This hand cream is divine.  It is not greasy and the fragrance is wonderful.  It helps dry cuticles, too.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not a bad scent, but alittle goes a long way in my opinon. A scent best for spring/summer. Very &amp;#34;lemony&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love this hand lotion. It&#x27;s perfect for dry skin and the smell is awesome. Got this item within 2 days. Perfect. 5 stars for the product and the shipment.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent.  You never fill grease... and the result is the best.  The delivery is punctual, the packing is OK.The price, here is so good.  The next,  I am going to try with the orange fragance.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it, but I can relay that the person I bought it for loves it.  She said it smells great, and it has really helped heal and moisturize her hands which get overly dry in the winter, without the oily feeling of other brands.</li>
    <li> I got these for my niece for Christmas. I had gotten samples at a hotel, and she fell in love with the scent. I like it too. It&#x27;s very fresh--not too much citrus. The honey smooths it out, if that makes senses. And, this is the best hand care product. Love Crabtree and Evelyn!</li>
    <li> The hand cream does a great job of moisturizing-- but the scent is overpowering and I found that quite irritating. Must be the coriander.</li>
    <li> Crabtree and Evelyn are a well known world re known company, and this hand therapy is the best of the best. I received it in my Christmas stocking and immediately put it on my hands. It is so soothing, non-greasy and is the best hand Creme I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company says :&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;John Evelyn’s Great Orchard, brimming with hundreds of fruit trees gathered on his European excursions, inspired a voyage of discovery along the Mediterranean coast. In this sun-dappled setting, fragrance wafts from zesty lemon groves to weave in with the aroma of sweet honey and peppery, uplifting coriander. Lovingly nurtured in alfresco herb gardens and bountiful orchards, these purifying ingredients shine in our Citron, Honey &amp; Coriander collection. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is perfect, light and lovely. It lingers for awhile. I love this scent so much I have ordered the shower gel and the skin lotion in. Citron, Honey and Corindar. What could be better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended. prisrob 12-27-13</li>
    <li> I used this in a hotel and HAD to buy some for myself when I got home.  I absolutely LOVE the smell and soft feel.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hand lotion that could become part of my nightly ritual, not too greasy, not too fragrant, but kind of light and airy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fits the bill perfectly. Even my husband uses it if his skin is feeling a little dry. Perfect lotion.</li>
    <li> because I love this hand cream! It is like citrus, flowers and summer sunshine all rolled into a tube. It is the essence of what you want in a hand cream that is so fresh and light. The dry heat in the West can be soooo drying that I am always on the look out for a good hand cream.The fact that it makes your hands softer without that greasy feel is an added bonus! My own guilty pleasure every time I use it.</li>
    <li> beautiful product, a lasting moisture therapy with a delicious scent.  I wish it came in a convenient purse sized item</li>
    <li> this is a great product. I love the light fresh smell. It is a great pick me up during my day. I also like the way it soaks into my skin. It never feels greasy. and makes my skin feel amazingly soft. Which is great because I wash my hands often. I am even buying this in several forms for a friend who is a smoker. she stills mine after a smoke break to rub on her arms and hands to make the smell go away.</li>
    <li> I would have given this cream a 5 because it smells amazing and the moisturizing properties are fantastic but it has soy in it, which is not notated on the description, and I broke out in hives upon using it.</li>
    <li> I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy or overpowering in scent.  I love it.  It goes on quickly and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this lotion, and it&#x27;s great to use at work. It absorbs quickly and my hands don&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards. One star removed because the cap is tricky to put back on.</li>
    <li> Great light scent, and leaves hands feeling slky without being greasy❤️</li>
    <li> Pleasant fragrance which can beat any Aqua blue. Plus great if you had to chop onions, garlic, or make fish fillets</li>
    <li> I think they&#x27;ve changed the formula. This lotion used to be so thick, it was almost like a paste. Now it&#x27;s thin and oily. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best hand lotion. Everyone who I share it with, asks what it is and wants it!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, the recipient loved it....</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but worth it.  My favorite hand lotion, smells so wonderful, everyone always comments on the fragrance!  I use the body lotion too.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this hand cream at a hotel my husband and I stayed at.  Every time I used it my husband remarked how much he loved the fragrance.  Well, I was happy to find it available on Amazon.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have tried several Crabtree &amp; Evelyn creams and this is my favorite. The moisturizer goes on non greasy but luxurious and almost instantly soothes and smooths my dry hands. I really like it in those spots around the nails and knuckles where my hands seem to suffer the most. This is my favorite scent, very light and sort of lemony/citrus, it&#x27;s great for using in public because it doesn&#x27;t seem to offend anyone who has a problem with strong or fake odors</li>
    <li> Perfect gift!!  Receiver loved the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the healthcare field ,so I&#x27;m always washing my hands. I learned of this product from a co-worker.  This product work wonders and also smell wonderful. You have to try to believe it</li>
    <li> I usually just use CT&amp;E&#x27;s Gardeners Hand Therapy (and have for almost 15 years) but decided to try this one since it happened to be on sale. The smell is amazing! So crisp and cean! And it softens my hands jst like the Gardeners. My husband also loves the smell of this lotion and how well it helps his chapped hands.</li>
    <li> It smells so good and really works well for dry skin...I like to carry it in my purse... highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This hand cream is really nice and does moisturize well and does make my cuticles look nice and also helps with the stretching that usually comes in a dry office environment.  I use it at work and have to be careful because it is quite greasy and is no good for getting on your keyboard</li>
    <li> This is the best hand lotion I have ever used. It makes my hands incredibly soft without making them greasy, and it has a very subtle pleasant scent. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the only thing I am not satisfied was this product did not contain full quantity. There is a lot air inside and I only got 2/3 amount for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Looking for the ultimate hand moisturizer-then this is it!! The makers of this GREAT hand creamt ook EVRYTHING into consideration when making this. Lasts too. Does not leave your hand oily either.</li>
    <li> My Wife loves it. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> It smells great, BUT it changed from cream into liquid oil couple weeks after I purchased it. I didn&#x27;t noticed that situation, and tried to use it. The oil spilled out on my book bag while opening it. Also, its container was made of metal like other ones I&#x27;ve seen. Instead, it&#x27;s made of plastic, which makes it look very fake!</li>
    <li> It is okay but it does not &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me.  I would not spend that much on this product again though.  I am still searching for the perfect lotion to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand cream changed its scent, very much for the worse. So when my fingertips started to peel and look like I&#x27;d stayed in the tub way too long, I picked this blindly. I&#x27;ve used Crabtree soap and lotion, but never hand therapy. It really did the trick. In a few days, my fingers healed and hands softened. You only need a dab, so the price is perhaps justified. Scent-wise, I didn&#x27;t like this much at first, but it&#x27;s grown on me. Very citrusy and light. Hand therapy feels very greasy when you first put it on, but really rubs in.</li>
    <li> I found this lotion in a casino in AC and happen to look at the label.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen Crabtree in years it keeps my hands soft and it&lt;br /&gt;smells good.</li>
    <li> great product great people and customer service! THANKS!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, not greasy at all, thick consistency.  Overall nice hand cream, but expensive for the way it moisturizers  Would think twice before buying again</li>
    <li> nice consistency, and aroma.  not too sweet smelling.  long lasting conditioning. I buy this product over and over again.  Worth it</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Goes on so nice and smells fantastic!! Great gift for mom or girlfriends  I need more!</li>
    <li> This is a really pleasant scent. I have terrible allergies so most perfumes, lotions irritate my nose, but this is really light so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Leaves your hands super soft too!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my aunt for christmas.  This is her favorite brand.  It was a big hit for her. She really liked the fragrance also.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for this for Christmas after trying a free sample. It is the perfect consistency for a hand cream and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hand cream.  It has a light refreshing fragrance, not overpowering.  It makes my hands soft and smooth especially during this really harsh winter. It really is fantastic</li>
    <li> My sister is undergoing chemo and had lizard skin and my brother has the scaly skin of an uncontrolled diabetic on his feet and ankles. How something that smells this good could work this well for each of them is fantastic.  Smooth and not greasy, it is up to Crabtree &amp; Evelyn standards!</li>
    <li> great product,, smells so clean and frresh</li>
    <li> This hand therapy is my favorite.  It provides great relief from dry, cracked, and chapped skin.  I wash my hands often throughout the day so my hands stay cracked.  Once I started using the hand therapy they immediately began to heal.  This scent is also very clean and light.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing; very good for dry hands. Nothing touches this product. Very therapeutic and the scent is absolutely wonderful. Lasts about 2 months with every day multiple use.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand lotion, hands down. The softening, moisturizing is superb , but it&#x27;s the lemony fragrance that puts it on too. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Citron Ultra Moisturising Hand therapy is rich and thick and leaves my hands very soft. I use it at night before bed then put on white gloves to give my hands a deep moisturising while I sleep. in the morning my hands are soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried any number of different lotions over the years and have found that this is worth the money.  Deeply moisturising, but not greasy.  Rapidly is absorbed, so I can use at work without fear of it leaving residue on my keyboard.  I have one by my kitchen sink, one in my purse, one at work and one in my gym bag :)  It&#x27;s great stuff and the fragrances are very subtle and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this hand lotion, but the consistency is not as thick as the &#x27;Olive and Basil&#x27; kind. I was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream ever.  Terrific smell.</li>
    <li> Love Crabtree &amp; Evelyn hand and body products. My skin looks 15 years younger (am 55 yo). Its a great product.</li>
