    <li> I&#x27;m so glad this product is available on Amazon for so cheap! This product works great on my hair that has been both colored and straightened. The smell is also sublime!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever tried. My hair is naturally curly and the ends tend to be very dry. This conditioner is like a miracle. It removes tangles almost instantly and makes your hair feel wonderful. I would definitely recommend. The best product ever.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to my by my hairdresser for use after a 6 hour color removal and correction process. My hair was very dry and a little stressed from the multiple processes. I have used this two ways: In the shower, leaving on for 2-3 minutes and in the evenings, on wet hair, leaving in for 30-40 minutes under a shower cap. I did not see much of an impact when I washed out in the shower.  The latter works better but the results are short lived.  I would not say it is the best conditioner out there.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is rich and really works to keep my hair manageable.  I use it in the shower everyday, even if I don&#x27;t shampoo.  It keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> strongly recommend this conditioner. my long rough colord hair need this to survive after every wash. its very mild on skin and hair so no hair lossif i compare with other conditioner</li>
    <li> Using all the products (Liss Ultimate) My hair is soo soft, smells good, i will keep using it for sure</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product from last 5 years without any complaints. No need to look further for any product</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Keep your hair soft, bright and healthy.  I will continue ordering this product with Amazon.  I have used this product for long time and will continue use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it always with the same branch shampoo and with the condition &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; to see the good result</li>
    <li> This stuff smells and works amazing. I use it instead of regular conditioner since I have really frizzy curly hair and always makes my hair soft and manageable! Worth it.</li>
    <li> The results were impressive, especially after my hair smoothening treatment. But had to stop using due to excessive hairfall. Now trying SebaMed, hoping to stop - even if not reverse - hairfall.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have ever ever used.  I smooths my corse haif and makes it very soft and managable.  It has improved the health of my hair.  It is great!</li>
    <li> Never even think of these guys as these are the most laziest I have ever seen. &#x27;Test 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10 a 10 second voice message&#x27;- can you imagine this is a voice message on their customer support line? They don&#x27;t answer any call even after holding for 15 minutes every time but keep playing the message &#x27;all our customer service reps are assisting other customers&#x27;. The package I have ordered as returned to them because these guys did not print my complete address. That&#x27;s really awful as the very basics of online shopping and shipping is to have the right address. Anyways, please don&#x27;t the pain I have been through. We deserve a lot better than these guys. Amazon should think of these guys again and its indirectly effecting Amazon&#x27;s fame.</li>
    <li> I only knew this brand to be a drug store but the pro line has turned out to be a real sleeper.  I&#x27;ve tried two of the different pro conditioners, they are AWESOM</li>
    <li> The best conditioner ever!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hairdresser, I love this product and it&#x27;s perfect for my wavy, coarse, thick and color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Really like this product and all the Loreal Expert products I have tried.  They really are great products to try.  This one smells so great too!</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>

    <li> I have long, thick, wavy and coarse hair. I have tried so many different lines and serums and nothing has worked as well as this brand. You can feel the difference when putting it on. It&#x27;s not greasy and oily like so many others. Even when you wash it out, it still feels soft and I love the smell. I find myself not having to use too much products when straightening my hair. I love the shampoo too! Amazons prices are better than the salon. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time and I found it here for 1/2 price, so that was a no brainer.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Nice product..soft silky hair.</li>
    <li> I have become a fan of this product. It leaves my hair so smooth and manageable that it is wonderfully easy to straighten afterwards.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for dry, dull hair- my hair dresser recommended it and I have been very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Something is wrong with this product. I&#x27;ve used Loreal conditioners from the same line and they were far far better.
