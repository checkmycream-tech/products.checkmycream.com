      <li>My skin kept very soft and hydrated not greasy.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I ordered this just to tide me over and WOW...</li>

    <li> I really enjoy this lotion and oil.&lt;br /&gt;First off it smells amazing without that loud smell, ya know? It is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I used the oil right after getting out of a hot shower. It absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves you feeling like you just came out of the spa.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is so great, especially this time of year. My skin is so dry and I have dozens of lotions laying around.. NOT ANYMORE.&lt;br /&gt;I love this lotion because it does not take a lot to cover the dryness and it starts to work quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a nice smell and does not leave you feeling oily which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this lotion and oil to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I totally love this product and will buy more when it runs out.  The oil really goes into my skin, the lotion makes it soft and my dry skin is getting better.  A 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Very nice and silky smooth. So is my skin now. Love it. Has a nice soft, light, fresh fragrance too! A keeper for sure!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! Nice soft clean fragrance...NOT overbearing!!  I usually make my own lotions and potions but ran out of time this season. I ordered this just to tide me over and WOW...I love this. My skin kept very soft and hydrated not greasy. My very picky daughter tried it and  loved it so much I bought more as a Christmas present for her. Defiantly would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> My favorite, worth every penny</li>
    <li> It have taken me a long time to find skin products that fit my dry and sensitive skin. The Argan skin product perfectly answers my needs. Using the body lotion and the body oil products give me a relaxing feeling. Using these two products provide an excellent answer for people like me that are skin allergic and have sensitive skin. I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  My skin feels wonderful. Will purchase again. Only negative -  purchased 2 kits (one for myself and one for a gift) in the kit I opened the body lotion  pump snapped off and broke and the body oil came without a pump.</li>
    <li> I have dry and irritated skin. Lately I&#x27;ve been introduced to the benefits of Argan oil for the skin, and came across this skin treatment kit. I&#x27;ve decided to give it a try and after almost a month of using it I must admit I&#x27;m really satisfied. I use the products regularly and my skin is no longer irritated and feels much better. I also love their subtle smell. I&#x27;m happy to recommend these products.</li>
    <li> Wow! I received this Body Lotion and oil the other day and I am totally in love!  The Argon lotion and oil have a very pleasant smell that is not overwhelming.  I used a small amount of lotion on my callus feet and elbows and already see a big improvement!  The product comes nicely packaged, and would be an great gift idea too!  I also liked that the lotion comes with a screw on cap, but also a pump attachment, which makes it super easy to use. The company also offers 100% money back guarantee if not satisfied so you would have nothing to lose.  I am eager to try other products from their line!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, a friend sent it to me as a gift and it is very good for my dry skin. She must love me :)</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! Not only does this lotion and body oil smell great (a very suddle smell) it makes your skin so soft and smooth.  My son plays football and he has rough skin. He&#x27;s been putting the body oil on at night and lotion whenever and it seems as if it is healing as it has almost smooth out his elbows completely!! I 100% recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for my very dry skin and hair.  This will be a regular in my cosmetics shelf.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail just today. The shipping was very fast. I was so excited to try it out. I opened the box and rubbed the lotion into my hands and arms. It soaked right in (my hands were pretty dry). My skin feels amazing. I love the scent! It&#x27;s not too strong, but smells really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Argan skin care Treatment Kit! Once I opened both the lotion and the body oil I immediately noticed the amazing scent that it had! I am the type of person who does not like strong flowery scents because it will give me massive headaches. This product did not have the very smelly scent! I love the way the lotion feels when using it. When applying it to your skin you feel a nice cool sensation that tells you it is really working for the dry itchy skin. I have also tried the body oil after showering and it just gives you the extra freshness feeling that you are looking for. I want to also note that I do tend to get eczema this time of year (fall here in New England) and it works wonders on it! I also use this on my children who have the same issue and they too find it relaxing and they always say &amp;#34;Mom this smells so good!&amp;#34; So if you are looking for a lotion that will help you with your stubborn dry skin and give you a smoother and softer feel then this is totally worth it! You will not be disappointed when using this product!</li>
    <li> I have an autoimmune disease called scleroderma and I&#x27;ve used so many products for my skin. Thanks to this product my skin feels fantastic. It&#x27;s made my skin so baby like soft. I would recommend these products to everyone. The lotion and oil are the best products on the market. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on skin products now I&#x27;ve found the products that work!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion and body oil! My skin is soft and smooth, no break-outs.. Great smell. I love the way my skin looks &amp; feels</li>
    <li> I just got mine today took it out of the package and tried it. Amazing it smells so good ! !!!  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with that oily feeling like a lot of lotions out there on the market.  So glad I decided to give this a try , Thank you Beauty Naturals for such a great  product! Will be shopping with you again soon . Highly recommend this product to any out there who has dry itchy skin this really works!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works great .. and GREAT aroma as well!!</li>
    <li> Great product, although i was originally disappointed by the broken pumps (both of them), and had so remarked on an earlier review. Without delay, I had brand new set of working pumps in my mailbox, unrequested. I am very grateful to this company&#x27;s mindfulness and customer care, and I will definitely recommend this product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my argon lotion and body oil set. A mild pleasant scent, not heavy or greasy, very moisturizing and easily absorbed into the skin, as well as good ingredients. I will be purchasing more in the future. I&#x27;m a lotion loving lady and I&#x27;m very glad I ordered this!!!</li>
    <li> The product itself is heaven. However, it came with the oil broken and leaking and the pump for the lotion doesn&#x27;t work. It was packaged well, so not sure how that happened. I am hoping to hear back from the seller. We shall see.</li>
    <li> This a great set for anyone with dry skin like myself. The bottle of lotion is a very generous size and will last a while. The oil is also a great size too. They both smell amazing (as do all the products I&#x27;ve tried from this company). The lotion absorbs quickly into my skin and has helped tremendously. My legs especially are no longer dry, flaky, or itchy. I love that if the lotion just isn&#x27;t enough, like in the colder months we are approaching, then I can use the oil for an added boost of moisturization. The oil also absorbs very fast into my skin. Despite it being an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or look real shiny after using it either. This is a high quality set and a great value for the sizes that come in it. Would also make a great gift.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, oil after bath and lotion before bed wonderful!</li>
