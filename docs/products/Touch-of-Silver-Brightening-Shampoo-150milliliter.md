      <li>EXCELLENT OT CARE</li>
      <li>, it looks great!!!!</li>
      <li>I bought 5 shampoos and this one works the best for platinum result.</li>
      <li>but I always thought it was beautiful.  </li>
      <li>It does what it says it does, and that&#x27;s a great thing.</li>
      <li>I wish I could write a good review</li>
      <li>The two products work good together.</li>
      <li>i loved this it turned my hair silver which is what i wanted</li>
      <li>Good luck</li>
      <li>Slather on with a touch of water and rub in good, cover with shower cap.</li>
      <li>so I recommend a good conditioner afterwards.</li>

      <li>And there is more silver throughout my hair!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>

      <li>best silver shampoo i ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m questioning the ingredients for sure.</li>
      <li>I feel like its a more healthier alternative then bleaching</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a purple shampoo (not a toner) there are better ones out there.</li>
      <li>This is purple magic in a bottle, I know it&#x27;s supposed to be used as a shampoo</li>
      <li>and I wanted to get rid of the brassy redness and make it more ashy brown.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Better off going to sallys beauty salon and purchase shimmering lights purple shampoo.</li>
      <li>LOVE ALL YOUR PRODUCTS PUT OUT BY POR-VOKE, it a keeper for me, does what is says...</li>
      <li>If anything it made my hair more brassy every time I used it.  </li>
      <li>I wish amazon had it on Prime :)</li>
      <li>Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I just need to lighten my roots a bit more.</li>
      <li>so dont leave it on longer than 5 minutes its very strong and well worth the money!</li>
      <li>I have those cool silver temple streaks!  </li>
      <li>the purple pigment easily stains the bathroom though it&#x27;s washable...</li>
      <li>This is some really strong stuff.</li>
      <li>great toner, would definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>I have sort of reddish light brown hair</li>
      <li>This is far superior to what you buy in the US.  </li>
      <li>But if you want your hair more blonde or white then its perfect.</li>
      <li>and it smells like grapes, which is pleasant enough</li>
      <li>many thanks, will recommend.</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>It really helped and they showed up a lot more with the contrast.  </li>
      <li>A tiny bit goes a long way and it smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>My hair now is fully white with some silver, I just love it!</li>
      <li>and it was totally worth the 2.5 week</li>
      <li>It came much earlier than I expected which is great!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it locally, so it&#x27;s worth the wait from the UK.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and took out some of the orangey color I had in the back of my head.</li>
      <li>save your hard earned money and spend it on something good!</li>
      <li>deff order if you dont need right away</li>
      <li>I live in the US and this shampoo is still cheaper than the blue shampoos out here, the best one I have ever found and I&#x27;ve been blonde for practically all my life!</li>
      <li>absolutely satisfied I&#x27;m not really fun of ordering thing on line just because their are so many scams thanks for delivering as promise.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair to a very light blonde</li>
      <li>I get the sense that I&#x27;m in a \\&quot;retirement community\\&quot; politely taking visits from relatives interested in my will and patiently waiting to die.</li>
      <li>Sooooo pretty.</li>
      <li>but it made it more white, and</li>
      <li>Well I thought this product would be better than others but its the same .</li>
      <li>for the first time</li>
      <li>Pretty drying</li>
      <li>My hair is very salt and pepper right now.</li>
      <li>fun bright colors (pink or blue things like that).</li>
      <li>The price is right, and even ordering it from the UK (I live in the U.S.)</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also very drying.</li>
      <li>I really like my hair rinsed.</li>
      <li>but my hair was really brassy</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say it did much.</li>
      <li>(I pair it with my regular purple shampoo about once a week), however I worry this is not the original product.</li>
      <li>Until more of my dark brown turns white/grey, I have to keep the white/grey hair very shiny, or my hair looks dingy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true, it gives grey hair a pretty silvery shine, but I get the same result from &#x27;purple&#x27; or &#x27;silver&#x27; hair products that are made right here in the United States.</li>
      <li>(now I use L&#x27;Oreal quick blue)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it,</li>
      <li>well worth the short wait from the UK.</li>
      <li>MY NEW LOOK</li>
      <li>product probably only works for really really light hair only and does not get rid of brassy-ness of brown</li>
      <li>Sadly, all the silver dye soon washed out leaving me with light blonde tips.. which would be okay, but they detracted from my pretty silver.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this stuff (also on a whim)</li>
      <li>Just be careful because your blonde hair will pick up light purple</li>
      <li>Still early to tell.</li>
      <li>I WILL STOPPED USE THIS PRODUCT, BY THE WAY MY HAIR IS A NATURAL HAIR</li>
      <li>It came nearly wrapped up with the lid taped on for secureness and seemed intact.</li>
      <li>and I am utterly completely amazed.  </li>
      <li>And I only use it once a week at most, I did use it everyday for a while</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try if you have dyed your hair blonde and it came out yellow.</li>
      <li>I just love this shampoo, a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>but it barely showed in my not too-dark-to-be-blonde-too-light-to-be-brown hair and it SHOWS!!</li>
      <li>it really made my hair look even blonder and picked out the tonality of the different layers of blonde.</li>
      <li>And it has less product for more money , that is just not worth it.</li>
      <li>It just takes any brassy or yellow tones out and leaves my bleached hair a natural blondish-white.</li>
      <li>This product is definitely akin to a soft bleach or treatment versus a shampoo.</li>
      <li>I had to wait until I was in my early 40&#x27;s until I got my first few threads of silver.</li>
      <li>I had my hair white with some yellow spots near the roots and this thing did miracles!</li>
      <li>It is over priced and  any other brightener shampoo does about as much as this does.</li>
      <li>At least the parts that were light enough.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I just bleached my hair *blonde* for the first time and I have been trying to get the right tone- deliciously cool/grey/purple. After trying unsuccessfully to tone it down with Davines Alchemic conditioner, I picked this up. I lathered it up and left it on for about 10 minutes, and it has definitely cooled down my hair! The price is right, and even ordering it from the UK (I live in the U.S.) it arrived in about 2 weeks. Me gusta!</li>
    <li> Touch of Silver Shine Treatment Helps bring out the gray in my hair and I have had a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I wish I could write a good review but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t do  what it says it will do.  I am growing out my gray hair.  I have bleached blonde on the ends.  I was hoping it would darken or take the gold out of the blonde but it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  It makes my hair feel like straw.  It is over priced and  any other brightener shampoo does about as much as this does.</li>
    <li> Ladies, ladies, if you  just have blonde hair- (I don&#x27;t have silver so I can&#x27;t speak for them), dont do it, you&#x27;ll be sad. If anything it made my hair more brassy every time I used it.  Try a different purple shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely akin to a soft bleach or treatment versus a shampoo. It does lighten/tone my platinum hair a bit, but it&#x27;s also very drying. I also found that if any of the suds or anything gets on my body (like if I use it while in a bath) it causes bad skin irritation in sensitive spots like my thighs and forearms. Be careful with it, use a deep conditioner, and dont overuse it.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and took out some of the orangey color I had in the back of my head. Pretty drying so I recommend a good conditioner afterwards. It came much earlier than I expected which is great!</li>
    <li> Well I thought this product would be better than others but its the same . And it has less product for more money , that is just not worth it. Better off going to sallys beauty salon and purchase shimmering lights purple shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have sort of reddish light brown hair and I wanted to get rid of the brassy redness and make it more ashy brown.&lt;br /&gt;This product probably only works for really really light hair only and does not get rid of brassy-ness of brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;also the purple pigment easily stains the bathroom though it&#x27;s washable...</li>
    <li> this ruined my highlights&lt;br /&gt;does not rid brassiness - it causes it! I threw in trash after figuring it out (2 weeks)</li>
    <li> I think I like this product. Still early to tell.</li>
    <li> This is purple magic in a bottle, I know it&#x27;s supposed to be used as a shampoo but my hair was really brassy so I saturated my hair in it before I showered and left it in for about 20 minutes then conditioned my hair like regular, it looks great!!!! Totally took away all the brassy tones it&#x27;s nice and ashy now. I love it!</li>
    <li> I received the wrong product, I ordered the conditioning treatment. The return label was torn off when I received the package, if I did want to return it.  I am not going to spend more money to return a bottle of shampoo to another country because someone packed the wrong product.</li>
    <li> Brightens the hair for that Snow White effect which is difficult to achieve. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting white hair.</li>
    <li> best silver shampoo i ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> I do think this product works in cutting out any brassy tones to my hair (I pair it with my regular purple shampoo about once a week), however I worry this is not the original product. It came nearly wrapped up with the lid taped on for secureness and seemed intact. However, the product itself is REALLY thin and watery- not like any shampoo I have ever used before- and it smells like grapes, which is pleasant enough but I&#x27;m not sure if it is supposed to or not.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone but I&#x27;m questioning the ingredients for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought 5 shampoos and this one works the best for platinum result. Be careful not to leave it on too long.</li>
    <li> Should use this along with daily shampoo.  The two products work good together. As long as I keep my hair blonde this will be the only shampoo I will use</li>
    <li> This is some really strong stuff. I bleach my hair blonde and always have a yellowish tint after. The Loreal boxed anti brass is so hard to find so I decided to try this product. Its much stronger than the loreal brass banisher product and a little goes a long way. Just be careful because your blonde hair will pick up light purple so dont leave it on longer than 5 minutes its very strong and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> LOVE ALL YOUR PRODUCTS PUT OUT BY POR-VOKE, it a keeper for me, does what is says...many thanks, will recommend.</li>
    <li> This weekly treatment is shipped from England.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true, it gives grey hair a pretty silvery shine, but I get the same result from &#x27;purple&#x27; or &#x27;silver&#x27; hair products that are made right here in the United States.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair to a very light blonde so I can dye it fun bright colors (pink or blue things like that). I heard that this shampoo will help get the orange out of bleached hair and as I naturally have very dark hair that is hard for me to do without just frying my hair. I can&#x27;t say it did much. Some people say it will even turn your hair purple if you leave it on too long, I left it on for 30 minutes and it didn&#x27;t do any thing that I could see. I gave it 4 stars because it is a quality product. A tiny bit goes a long way and it smells wonderful. And it did seem like the combination of using this and switching the bleach I use (now I use L&#x27;Oreal quick blue) seemed to help with my orange tint problem. And I only use it once a week at most, I did use it everyday for a while but it didn&#x27;t make a difference I could see so I stopped that didn&#x27;t want to waste it.  :)</li>
    <li> i loved this it turned my hair silver which is what i wanted but it took way to long to get it from the uk and its quite drying so i give it about 8 out of 10. deff order if you dont need right away</li>
    <li> I really like my hair rinsed.</li>
    <li> This is far superior to what you buy in the US.  It adds a sliver of silver and not purple, and ALSO tones down orange.  Highly recommend it, well worth the short wait from the UK.</li>
    <li> saw where it was recommend for us after bleaching your hair to keep the yellow/brassy coloring out of it. and it was totally worth the 2.5 week wait to get shipped across the pond to the US from england. it really made my hair look even blonder and picked out the tonality of the different layers of blonde. will be buying this again, as long as i decide to stay blonde.</li>
    <li> This was actually a really nice shampoo. It smells like candy, and it made my hair turn to a really nice color. At least the parts that were light enough. It does what it says it does, and that&#x27;s a great thing. I just need to lighten my roots a bit more. I&#x27;ll deff but this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never buy another brand of this ever again. Hooked.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. I live in the US and this shampoo is still cheaper than the blue shampoos out here, the best one I have ever found and I&#x27;ve been blonde for practically all my life! The draw back is that I have to be proactive about buying it and wait. It takes about 2 weeks to get to me. Literally take out all the brassiness AND keeps it out. I wish amazon had it on Prime :) contrary to what a few others have said, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair (you should never shampoo your hair daily anyways). I love it so much I hope amazon never stops carrying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted silver hair since I was sixteen.  Yeah, yeah, I know... but I always thought it was beautiful.  I had to wait until I was in my early 40&#x27;s until I got my first few threads of silver. Sooooo pretty. But not very much of it, it barely showed.  So on a whim, I went and had my hair ombre dyed and had the lighter tips dyed silver, hoping to showcase my threads of silver at my temples.  It really helped and they showed up a lot more with the contrast.  Sadly, all the silver dye soon washed out leaving me with light blonde tips.. which would be okay, but they detracted from my pretty silver.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this stuff (also on a whim) and I am utterly completely amazed.  I don&#x27;t know whether or not it toned down the yellow in my bleached tips, but it made my silver so shiny it almost glows. I have those cool silver temple streaks!  Who knew?? And there is more silver throughout my hair! I knew it was there but it barely showed in my not too-dark-to-be-blonde-too-light-to-be-brown hair and it SHOWS!! FINALLY!!!  I am so tickled!</li>
    <li> Excellent for use as a toner. Slather on with a touch of water and rub in good, cover with shower cap. Fortunately, my blonde hair does not turn purple from leaving this on for over an hour. It just takes any brassy or yellow tones out and leaves my bleached hair a natural blondish-white. Definitely worth a try if you have dyed your hair blonde and it came out yellow. If you leave this on and DO get some purple tones in your hair even after rinsing, don&#x27;t worry, the purple will fade after a couple washes. I don&#x27;t recommend this as a shampoo, though. It&#x27;s a bit drying. If you are looking for a purple shampoo (not a toner) there are better ones out there.</li>
    <li> So I thought i would test this bad boy out on my hair, im trying to go blond but currently my hair is reddish black. I used it twice already and I can see a mayjor change. I feel like its a more healthier alternative then bleaching but it takes a while before that would happen. Good luck u guys ^_^</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT OT CARE MY NEW LOOK I WILL STOPPED USE THIS PRODUCT, BY THE WAY MY HAIR IS A NATURAL HAIR</li>
    <li> absolutely satisfied I&#x27;m not really fun of ordering thing on line just because their are so many scams thanks for delivering as promise.</li>
    <li> great toner, would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> It was alright, I was trying to go for silver hair but it made it more white, and I didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel. But if you want your hair more blonde or white then its perfect.</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to actually look white or silver buy this and nothing else! I had my hair white with some yellow spots near the roots and this thing did miracles! My hair now is fully white with some silver, I just love it!</li>
    <li> Great product that makes grey hair look wonderful.</li>
    <li> save your hard earned money and spend it on something good!</li>
    <li> This shampoo manages to get rid of all the yellow in my gray hair. I can&#x27;t find it locally, so it&#x27;s worth the wait from the UK.</li>
    <li> it does what its says it would, it gets all my red tones from my blonde i do leave it on  with conditioner mixed in it on my dry hair for 15-20 min it will become  pale lavender but it will wash out after some washes . i just hate that it takes so long to receive other than that i love it</li>
    <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
    <li> I just love this shampoo, a little goes a long way and it only arrived in 2 weeks to the U.S!!!</li>
    <li> Even after two 5+ minute treatments, my red left over from my previous (dark blonde) coloring is still very red. I notice just a subtle difference, so I will give it two stars. It did work a tiny bit but nothing like the claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware The Scent. I use a capital T and a capital S because this scent stays. I mean it just...stays. It lingers frighteningly and I have to tell you it is not a good smell, in my opinion. It&#x27;s oddly old-ladyish. Every time I swing my hair I get the sense that I&#x27;m in a \\&quot;retirement community\\&quot; politely taking visits from relatives interested in my will and patiently waiting to die. Not a great association.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not a great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair is very salt and pepper right now. Until more of my dark brown turns white/grey, I have to keep the white/grey hair very shiny, or my hair looks dingy. I use this stuff once a week, mixing it half and half with my regular shampoo. My white/grey hair shines silvery bright--it sparkles!!!!! The other three or four hair washings per week, I use my regular shampoo.  When I went for my latest haircut, my stylist commented on how gorgeous my silver hair was. I told her what I was using, and she told me that if a build up of the product ever made my hair purple/blue, to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of the buildup, but that I could continue to use this Touch of Silver afterwards.</li>
