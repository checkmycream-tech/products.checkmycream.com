      <li>and I LOVE</li>
      <li>I do like this better than ROC.  </li>
      <li>I tried to go a more inexpensive route</li>
      <li>My derm told me recently that besides sunscreen, retinol and vit c oil were the best things I could spend my money on for my 60 year old/young face.  </li>
      <li>Okay, those were two words.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Seems to smoothe fine lines in more oily areas, though.  </li>
      <li>My skin is more even toned and my discoloration has faded significantly.</li>
      <li>Easy fix.</li>
      <li>The level 6 is definitely strong.</li>
      <li>I also noticed my makeup settling in the fine lines under my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t do that anymore</li>
      <li>and it is working on getting rid of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how great of a product this was until I switched to something different.</li>
      <li>Great product  Will definitely reorder.</li>
      <li>Green Cream is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
      <li>and I would always use a light coating of a night cream as my daytime moisturizer (I don&#x27;t know why</li>
      <li>I ordered this product after reading several great reviews.  </li>
      <li>This is such a great product.  </li>
      <li>and I was excited that anti-aging was a bonus.</li>
      <li>Many thanks!</li>
      <li>Have a special occasion coming up, do it 2-3 before.</li>
      <li>my skin would look as great as those who spent a fortune at the doctors.  </li>
      <li>Has really made my skin look so much better.  </li>
      <li>my sense is that if it doesn&#x27;t advertise the concentration of retinol, then it doesn&#x27;t have much), and I am glad I didn&#x27;t start with the level 3.  </li>
      <li>Most of the time, I get too much product, or it spurts out erratically.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been taking prescription meds for it (ortho and spiro) which have helped tremendously with the acne, but didn&#x27;t do anything for the roughness and unevenness of my skin.</li>
      <li>and my skin would be super oily.  </li>
      <li>My forehead lines have diminished tremendously as well.</li>
      <li>After two weeks I did experience some mild peeling for a couple days, so I adjusted my use.  </li>
      <li>so it lasts a while, which is great because it&#x27;s not cheap.  </li>
      <li>I have never used retinols and find this to be extremely powerful.</li>
      <li>GREEN CREAM is by far one of the best retinol creams out there.</li>
      <li>I was right.</li>
      <li>so I jump right in with a 6.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the level 9 must be at least as strong to a strong Retin-A.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It must not be a very shelf stable product, coupled with the fact that it&#x27;s not a well known brand and thus does not move quickly off the shelves.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.  </li>
      <li>Very much a ripoff, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
      <li>Thanks for being all you advertised to be!</li>
      <li>Smooth, seamless transaction.</li>
      <li>At first, I applied the GC by itself, but since my skin&#x27;s gotten drier</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started using a deep moisturizing night cream over top of it.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff and will probably buy level 9 next</li>
      <li>the Vi-Peel and this level 6 cream is pretty darn close in terms of potency.</li>
      <li>Really shrinks the pores!  </li>
      <li>I also use a scrub because while this stuff exfoliates, it&#x27;s still a good idea to slough off the dead skin.</li>
      <li>25 years old with very oily nose and rest of face is pretty fine.</li>
      <li>It peeled back the skin to reveal very smooth and much clearer skin underneath.</li>
      <li>but I am just soooo pleased with this product I had to write to let others with large pores and excess sebum plugs that this is only product I have found that handles this issue.</li>
      <li>and it really keeps my skin clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>It can really irritate your skin when you first start using it.</li>
      <li>This was my first retinol cream (with the exception of a couple drugstore brands that didn&#x27;t seem to do much -</li>
      <li>I thought it was fine at first, but all of a sudden</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had 2 stubborn cysts under my skin for YEARS all the dermatologist has done was give me pills that end up with the cysts coming back once I ran out. Waste of money. This cream is amazing. Only after a week I noticed that these cysts from hell have already gotten noticeably smaller. If I didn&#x27;t know any better I&#x27;d think it was magic. I wish I would have heard about this cream sooner it&#x27;s almost like a secret for some reason. Only con is it dries out one part of my face and I just apply cocoa butter to that area. Easy fix. It has even worked faster than retin A for me. Hope this cream works for you as well</li>
    <li> I have never used retinols and find this to be extremely powerful. That is why I am disappointed that the dispensing system is so all-over-the-place.  They say to use  a pea-sized amount.  This is really hard to control.  Most of the time, I get too much product, or it spurts out erratically.  I asked the company about it, but they just said that that&#x27;s just the way it is. I hope that the pump system could be improved and make the dispensing more even, as it&#x27;s too expensive to waste.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I really notice the difference in my skin (and how my makeup looks) when I run out and have to wait a bit for the next bottle.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products. They all make big claims but ou never see a difference. This one lives up to the claims! My skin is getting better every day! Love it!</li>
    <li> It can really irritate your skin when you first start using it. I only used a very small amount and it was still a problem.  I wish I had started out with Level 3 because Level 6 left my face red and very dried out for days after only one use.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional., I&#x27;m 57, look 30 and  have been using GREEN CREAM off and on since my 30s. I only used Level 3 until the age of 50. I would only do it for a two-three week (as skin could tolerate - even skipping days), until I reached the depth of resurfacing I wanted. I ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS used a good (no toxins) moisturizer with SPF, everyday while using it.  It keeps you from burning with it and drying out. When I would cease my three weeks my skin would look as great as those who spent a fortune at the doctors.  Now that I am in my 50s, I go straight to Level 6, and do the same regimen.  I would never recommend anyone using this everyday.  When your face starts looking dull again, do it then.  Have a special occasion coming up, do it 2-3 before. In between treatments, if I were to get a blemish, I put a dab on it and I would always use a light coating of a night cream as my daytime moisturizer (I don&#x27;t know why, I just did).  GREEN CREAM is by far one of the best retinol creams out there. FYI for you young girls (I started my 15y old daughter now 25).  Always wear sunglasses;,I have no wrinkles on my eyes.  When you moisturize your face; wipe the excess on your elbows.  A great moisturizer that is inexpensive and good to use with this is JASON age Renewal Vitamin E 25,000 IU.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help with my moderate acne and I was excited that anti-aging was a bonus. However, I just ended up breakin out more. It is pretty expensive so choose wisely.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Green Cream several years ago.  Loved it then but more so now. This causes no burning, no redness, no abracadabra.... This little green product, if used properly, can take years off the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began with level 3, now on level 6...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a great product</li>
    <li> I have used this product daily for years. I used to have bad acne and it really keeps my skin clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> I had previously used level 3, and I upgraded to level 6.  First, I mixed the two together to build up my tolerance, and I did not have any difficulty transitioning.  It goes on nice and smooth.  I was contemplating going to level 9, but I decided to give Skinceuticals 1.0 a try, as it is slightly stronger.  The skinceuticals pump produces less product, so maybe it will last longer, making it a cheaper option in the end.</li>
    <li> I used to go to the dermatologist when I was a teenager and got retin A. I have very sensitive skin and it was almost not worth it due to my skin burning and peeling off and my skin would be super oily.  It&#x27;s like what&#x27;s worse? Pimples or the medicine? Although my skin is much better now that I am 30, I still have big pores, lots of black heads and get some monstrous pimples now and again. I have only been using Clean and Clear and Cetaphil moisturizer in the last 10 years or so.  I decided to give this product a try after doing some online research. It&#x27;s been about three weeks and I LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been getting a lot of compliments from people on my complexion.  I notice my blackheads and pimples are disappearing slowly over time and my skin tone seems more even, vibrant and fresh. Because of my super sensitive skin I do get some dry, flaky areas in certain spots but I expected that. If that occurs I usually just take a day off and moisturize instead. And even though it gets dry it doesn&#x27;t BURN like Retin A did. It is about to be \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot; and I did get a couple of very small pimples pop up but to me that is nothing.  I haven&#x27;t had a monster zit since I have been using this product.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Green Cream off and on for quite a few years.  I love it.  Yes, it does cause peeling, but that is how I know it is working.  I have used other over the counter retinol creams and have seen no results.  I don&#x27;t know if I wasted my money or not.  But with Green Cream my face peels when I first begin using it.  I recently used an old bottle of Green Cream that I found when moving.  It did nothing.  I assumed it was too old.  Bought a new bottle of Level 6 and sure enough, old skin began to peel.  If this is a concern or you have sensitive skin you should probably start with Level 3, which is what is recommended.  I have olive combination skin and am impatient for results so I jump right in with a 6.  My derm told me recently that besides sunscreen, retinol and vit c oil were the best things I could spend my money on for my 60 year old/young face.  The prescription retinol was way too expensive for me.  I remembered Green Cream and am again using it.  Do I dare admit this...I may be weird but I actually like peeling off old skin....  reminds me of grade school days and Elmers glue!  :)  I recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months.  I like it very much.  It did sting my skin and cause a some peeling at first, so I would mix with a little oil of Olay and use every other day.  My seems to be a bit plumper and my wrinkles ( of which I didn&#x27;t have much anyway ) seemed to improve. It definitely is making my sun spots less noticeable.  I do like this better than ROC.  I am going up to level 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for information, I use this at night on my décolletage, neck and face.  In the morning, I use a vitamin C powder mixed with sunscreen.  This regimen is working really well for me.  I would even be very happy if my skin didn&#x27;t improve any more but just stayed as is.</li>
    <li> Green Cream is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve gone through various acne programs since for the past 15 years and Green Cream is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used. I started with level 6 and never had any issues with burning or peeling. It&#x27;s helped my face to become much smoother and clarity improving over time. I&#x27;ve used this product for a few months and it&#x27;s well worth the $45 a month I pay.</li>
    <li> I have tried other retinol products, but they were expensive and didn&#x27;t do much.  I could see the peeling, so I know this is working.  I did have to skip days at first, and under my eyes gets a little sensitive, but my skin is getting used to it.  I can&#x27;t wait to move up to the next level.  I have seen some improvement after 1 month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 5 months now and have definitely seen a difference in the texture and overall look and feel of my skin. I am a 38 yo&lt;br /&gt;African American female and have had problems with acne since the age of 13. The last few years have been worse than usual with large cysts around my jawline and chin, and smaller white heads all over. I&#x27;ve been taking prescription meds for it (ortho and spiro) which have helped tremendously with the acne, but didn&#x27;t do anything for the roughness and unevenness of my skin. This green cream came to the rescue. I use it almost every night after washing my face and using Dennis Gross alpha beta peels, with a small pea sized amt on my still damp from the peel skin, and it&#x27;s done wonders for the unevenness and fine lines that have been cropping up, as well as the dark marks from the acne. I like that such a little goes a long way, as it is somewhat pricey. But I&#x27;ve been using the same 1oz bottle for the past 5 months, have started on my 6th month, and am pleasantly surprised by how long it&#x27;s lasted. I started with level 6 as I was using the peel before and figured I could handle it. I was right. Thankfully I have had no adverse reactions, no peeling or dryness or burns. I&#x27;ll be moving up to level 9 the next time around (have already purchased it thinking I&#x27;d run have out of level 6 long ago). I use it at night before going to bed and wash my face with a gentle cleanser in the morning and apply sunscreen. It makes my face so much smoother for makeup. Definitely keeping it as part of my nightly regimen. No complaints!</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing!!! I have dealt with adult acne for years and have tried everything possible to get ride of it.  I thought why not try this out and see what happens.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and my face is looking so much better! I have fewer breakouts and it&#x27;s clearing up my face.</li>
    <li> Never ever write reviews because I am too lazy but I am just soooo pleased with this product I had to write to let others with large pores and excess sebum plugs that this is only product I have found that handles this issue. 25 years old with very oily nose and rest of face is pretty fine. My face transformed in two weeks and all of my large pores I thought were scars are practically gone now thanks to no more sebum clogging them up. Recommended to everyone!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes after using it and find it hard to believe there was any retinol in this at all.  Usually you experience some stinging or show signs of redness this did nothing and I saw no results either.</li>
    <li> My nephew&#x27;s wife recommended Green Cream a few months ago. I was skeptical, but since I&#x27;m now over 40 and have lost my natural 10 years younger look I decided it was time to start reversing the aging process (people thought I was 18 well into my 30&#x27;s). I have VERY sensitive skin, suffered some major sunburns as a child, and recently my skin had become very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with level 3, and am now on level 6. When I first started, there was mild discomfort, but that diminished within a few days. I followed the directions EXACTLY (only use every other day for the first month) and had none of the peeling and redness issues other people had. I didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference until the other day: the crows feet around my eyes (happy lines from smiling I like to think they are) were deep enough that I could feel them with my finger. They are no longer there!! My forehead lines have diminished tremendously as well. Before I began using it I also noticed my makeup settling in the fine lines under my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t do that anymore because the lines are almost gone! I LOVE this stuff and will probably buy level 9 next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, if I&#x27;m out in the sun now I make sure I wear sunscreen (when I was a child I was allergic to the PABA and it would blister my face worse than the burn). Newer formulations are lighter and less greasy and don&#x27;t contain PABA. I also use a scrub because while this stuff exfoliates, it&#x27;s still a good idea to slough off the dead skin. I can&#x27;t say enough good about Green Cream!</li>
    <li> This product works so well for me. I&#x27;m using it for acne and as long as I use it every night, my skin stays clear. If I run out and stop using it for a few days, I break out. It&#x27;s something that you must use regularly for effectiveness. I&#x27;ve found that it works best, with the least amount of dryness/flaking, if I wait about 30 minutes after washing my face before applying the Green Cream. I don&#x27;t usually use a moisturizer with it, but if I do need it, I wait about 30 minutes after applying the Green cream in order to give the GC time to really sink in.</li>
    <li> Not a free sample for paid review!!! Bought out of my money after reading reviews and researching myself! LOVE results! Have oily skin with enlarged pores and blackheads on nose. Results in first week on this 57 year old skin. Smoother, tighter and expected drier skin but that is a bonus to my oily skin. Started with 6 and expect to order up to 9 with next order. Will def continue to be repeat repeat repeat, think you get it, repeat customer. Thanks for being all you advertised to be!</li>
    <li> I love Green Cream! I cannot wait until I can step up to level 9. In my opinion it works better than Retina Micro. After about a year of using it, my frown lines have virtually disappeared. I recommend not using too close to eye area, my eyes water profusely when I use it too close to the corners. I break out every once in a while, still, but that is to be expected with my age. Give it about 3 months to start seeing results. Great product for inbetween skin, acne and first signs of aging!</li>
    <li> It had definitely helped dry out the pimples faster. It didn&#x27;t remove scares. I have tough skin so I may need level 9.</li>
    <li> love it love it - great for cystic acne sufferers</li>
    <li> Received on time etc. My retinol cream works better so I quit using the green cream.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews sounded wonderful so I thought I would give it a try, and I did but it&lt;br /&gt;has been sitting in my cabinet for quite some time now.I only gave it 3 stars because I&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t see any differences to my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if it&#x27;s before it&#x27;s expiration date.  I have purchased this item twice from two different online stores and both times received a product that was expired.  There is no expiration date printed on the packaging, however you can tell by the sour smell and oily consistency that the product has gone bad.  Amazon is great though, if you contact them they will refund your money no questions asked.  It must not be a very shelf stable product, coupled with the fact that it&#x27;s not a well known brand and thus does not move quickly off the shelves.</li>
    <li> Did not care for this product.  I read instructions, followed them to a tea...noticed the changes they said would first occur, but as time went on, my skin looked worse and worse.  After 4 weeks, i stopped using it.</li>
    <li> This product is the real deal. So many products only have trace amounts of the active ingredient for which they are purchased, but this really delivered.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how great of a product this was until I switched to something different. I tried to go a more inexpensive route and I really regret it. Since returning to level 6, I have noticed how much smoother my skin is and a reduction in my minor breakouts. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson to stick with what works and not switch to the \\&quot;newer and better\\&quot; products.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do much of anything</li>
    <li> Has really made my skin look so much better.  Really shrinks the pores!  Great price on this site.  Many thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and would call my skin \\&quot;normal\\&quot; as far as sensitivity.  I&#x27;ve been using the level 6 Green Cream nightly as wrinkle prevention and treatment.  This was my first retinol cream (with the exception of a couple drugstore brands that didn&#x27;t seem to do much - my sense is that if it doesn&#x27;t advertise the concentration of retinol, then it doesn&#x27;t have much), and I am glad I didn&#x27;t start with the level 3.  (If you&#x27;ve used prescription acne medications in the past I&#x27;d go for the level 9.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first few days I noticed very quickly a shrinking in the size of my pores.  The drying and slight peeling didn&#x27;t start until a week or two in, and it has increased with nightly use.  I like the dryness and peeling because that makes me feel like it&#x27;s working, although I don&#x27;t actually know if that&#x27;s indicative of its effectiveness.  I exfoliate at least every other day and sometimes every morning to get rid of the dry and slightly peeling skin.  At first, I applied the GC by itself, but since my skin&#x27;s gotten drier I&#x27;ve started using a deep moisturizing night cream over top of it.  I should warn that since I&#x27;ve been using the GC, my daily application of SPF moisturizer burns/stings mildly.  I don&#x27;t really mind because it doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing to keep in mind with this cream is that you can adjust your usage depending on effects.  I use it every night on my face, but less frequently on my neck (made it red and irritated).  In addition to frequency, consider altering the amount you use.  When I wasn&#x27;t feeling the effects I wanted, I began using double a pea-sized amount, which made a difference (at least as far as dryness/peeling - again, not sure if that&#x27;s directly correlative to effectiveness).  I mostly notice these effects in the morning, but as long as I exfoliate and moisturize my skin looks normal during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month, I have noticed a decrease in both pore size and fine lines, and am very happy with the product!  When it runs out I might try skinceuticals just for the sake of comparison (after extensive research I decided that they&#x27;re pretty comparable in price and effect, but some skinceuticals users complained about the dispenser being defective, which is why I went with GC).</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!!!  After one use I saw a difference.  After one week, I was in love!  The difference in my pores and skin was significant and just incredible!  My pores were tiny and barely visible and my skin had a glow!  My skin is more even toned and my discoloration has faded significantly. My skin even felt better! The texture and consistency of the cream was lovely and silky!  After two weeks I did experience some mild peeling for a couple days, so I adjusted my use.  I now use the cream every two days or 2-3 times a week with excellent results!  You only need a little bit so it lasts a while, which is great because it&#x27;s not cheap.  I&#x27;ve had it for about six months and I may need a refill in the next couple weeks.  I am thinking of moving up to level 9 as I have had no issues with this product other than some mild peeling once for a couple days.  This has worked wonders on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***It is GREEN CREAM, I mean lime green!  So don&#x27;t freak, it won&#x27;t discolor your skin, you may notice a mild yellow-green cast as it sinks in.  You won&#x27;t be able to see the cream within a few minutes.  Only use it at night and always use moisturizer with sunscreen the morning after use (though you should always be using moisturizer with sunscreen)!***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Green Cream in conjunction with my nightly acne regimen: [[ASIN:B0014CKX2I Vivite Daily Facial Cleanser (6 oz)]](use day and night), [[ASIN:B000NVR9GY ***RUGBY BENZOYL PEROXIDE GEL 5%  [Health and Beauty]]] (use day and night), and [[ASIN:B0006BDQDG Peter Thomas Roth AHA/BHA Acne Clearing Gel 2 fl oz]](night only).</li>
    <li> Very irratating and seems to aggrevate breakouts.  Seems to smoothe fine lines in more oily areas, though.  Will keep using, but only sporatically since it is very drying, even on oily skin.</li>
    <li> I sent this product to my daughter.  She uses it all the time.  It&#x27;s great for getting rid of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> One word: It works. Okay, those were two words.</li>
    <li> Although it is not as great a AfirmX3.I still Like it. I use it a couple of times a week. It definitely got rid of the creepyness under my eyes</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading several great reviews.  I have normal skin and I used this product for +30days.  Absolutely no results at all.  My skin never tingled like retinol tends to do.  I highly doubt it has that much retinol in it as it says, if any.  I&#x27;ve had more results with drugstore creams like Neutrogena.  Plus, when I received this bottle in the mail, it was half empty.  Very much a ripoff, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It has cleared my acne up and it is working on getting rid of fine lines and wrinkles. I am 25 years old &amp; have been using the product for just over a month.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write these.. doesn&#x27;t matter if I love the product or if I hate it. But I thought I&#x27;d share on this one. The level 6 is definitely strong. My olive skin (mixed nationality) can usually take a beating, but this cream is like prescription grade. However, it does what it is supposed to. It peeled back the skin to reveal very smooth and much clearer skin underneath. But you definitely have to work up to this level and beyond. I could only use for two days and then 5 days off, recuperating, healing etc. Dry exfoliation with a scrub cloth or a wet rough washcloth would help with the flaking. I took the pain and redness hidden under makeup over the multiple questions and funny looks about why my face looked like it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to get level 3 and then graduating to level 6. I&#x27;ve had the Vi-Peel and this level 6 cream is pretty darn close in terms of potency. (The burning feeling and peeling was similar, though not as deep). I&#x27;d never tell you my skin was sensitive, but a couple of back to back days of using this had me rethinking about what sensitive skin really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let me discourage you, especially if you have as much scarring and adult acne attacks as I do. I&#x27;m confident that these green creams will finally help address this long standing issue for me. But be warned, when they say you gotta work up to this level, they aren&#x27;t playing with you.. it&#x27;s for real.</li>
    <li> I am only 25, but i have some faint lines around my mouth that i wanted to get rid of.  So, i bought this product and used it for a week at night only and while moisterizing my face after and in the morning.  I thought it was fine at first, but all of a sudden I wake up and ALL MY SKIN IS PEELING OFF.  I have stopped using it and am trying to deal with the damage that has been done.  I cannot even express how angry I am about this product.</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping w my sun spots, but havent seen too much of a difference  yet? Maybe itll take more time.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product.  You can see results in just a few days !! I recomend it but use sunscreen  24/7</li>
    <li> Stick with it and MOISTURIZE after each use and it has wonderful results.  Did wonders for my 16 year olds acne.</li>
    <li> Great product  Will definitely reorder. Feels great and works as promised. I really see a difference in my skin thanks</li>
    <li> This product is very potent use sparingly. Otherwise a good product. My face peals is I use it daily so I use it every three days</li>
    <li> Within a week I noticed a difference in my complexion. I defenitly recommend this product, I use morning and night&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> The best retinol-based OTC product I can think of! Highly effective at keeping skin acne-free, smooth, and polished. As far as this vendor I give a 5-star rating (although I&#x27;d like to see a surprise freebie sample or something thrown in with the order). Smooth, seamless transaction. Thank you!</li>
    <li> really loved this stuff.</li>
    <li> It works great on my daughter. Who has struggle acne from an early age.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that was comparable to Retin-A but wasn&#x27;t as expensive, doesn&#x27;t require a prescription and isn&#x27;t as irritating.  This is the answer.  Start with level 3 and work you way up to 6.  I haven&#x27;t gotten to level 9 - I&#x27;m sure the level 9 must be at least as strong to a strong Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely has made a difference with my complexion and wrinkles.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> No more sebum, cysts gone in 2 weeks, can not express enough :-), just looove it...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you AST, you guys rocks!</li>
