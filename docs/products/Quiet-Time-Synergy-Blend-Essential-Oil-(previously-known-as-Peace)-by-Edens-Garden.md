      <li>I love the scent of this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
      <li>I will be trying more of their scents.  </li>
      <li>I love this blend.</li>
      <li>Love this Edens oil is the diffuser, dab on my wrists, or sprayed on my bed linens.  </li>
      <li>lemongrass much better.</li>
      <li>I find this a lovely sent to fall asleep to.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>High quality at a great price</li>
      <li>this is great in bath bombs and hand salve, it is my favorite Eden&#x27;s garden blend so far.</li>
      <li>This product came quickly and was packaged nicely however didn&#x27;t smell nice and calm...</li>
      <li>I find their quality as good as anything else I have purchased, but a whole lot cheaper.</li>
      <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>My son and I like calm the child by plant therapy much better</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t cheap with shipping included.  </li>
      <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
      <li>Eden&#x27;s garden has some great synergy blends and I use everyone of them, regularly.</li>
      <li>Smells so nice, a very serene scent.</li>
      <li>The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous.</li>
      <li>Edens garden oils are just as good as young living IMO</li>
      <li>A very nice blend of essential oils to stimulate peace and a feeling of well-being.</li>
      <li>My new favorite!</li>
      <li>It smells unique and clean.  </li>
      <li>.......wears off quick</li>
      <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
      <li>For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Worth trying.</li>
      <li>Chose Edens as it was recommended as a higher quality.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the hot shower or the oil or even the placebo effect, but it is very relaxing.</li>
      <li>This blend is super earthy, I was hoping for something closer to young living peace and this was not it, but they shipped fast and got where i needed it to be.</li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re accustomed to synthetic scents, it takes a while to appreciate real lavender, real jasmine, etc.</li>
      <li>Very calming blend.  </li>
      <li>I really like this blend.</li>
      <li>It smelled very medicinal when I used it on my warmer in the house.  </li>
      <li>It is very relaxing.</li>
      <li>This essential oil is a tad expensive, but the mix of scents is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and this one smells great.</li>
      <li>I love the company and love the rest of their blends this one only rates so low because i was hoping for something a little different</li>
      <li>It really helps keep his mood calm and things in check to help in preventing of the headaches and other issues.</li>
      <li>My first time using essential oils.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>I often have trouble falling asleep at night and this blend, with a few drops on my pillow helps me feel peaceful and get ready to sleep.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the scent of this.  It is wonderfully complex, and very relaxing.  I use this in my atomizer. I find this a lovely sent to fall asleep to.  The packaging was good, and it was inexpensive.  I will be trying more of their scents.  I find their quality as good as anything else I have purchased, but a whole lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this smell.  It didn&#x27;t help me to feel at peace, calmer, more centered, etc.  It smelled very medicinal when I used it on my warmer in the house.  I will finish it up because I paid for it and it wasn&#x27;t cheap with shipping included.  I won&#x27;t buy it again though.  Just not right for me.</li>
    <li> My first time using essential oils. Chose Edens as it was recommended as a higher quality.</li>
    <li> I love to use this one in my heated room fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very calming blend.  Smells great.  I diffuse this one at night</li>
    <li> Expensive to ship. I buy no more.</li>
    <li> smells divine and I love it and so does my dog!</li>
    <li> We use several blends in our diffuser in the bedroom. A nice, relaxing way to settle into bed for the evening.</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> My son has trouble with migraines and endocrine issues. He uses this on a leather band for his wrist. It really helps keep his mood calm and things in check to help in preventing of the headaches and other issues.</li>
    <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
    <li> My wife said it is awesone</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this  product. I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and this one smells great. Worth trying.</li>
    <li> I use this to scent my home.  It smells unique and clean.  I&#x27;m just learning about essential oils so I&#x27;m not really knowledgeable.  I do like this scent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful but not over-powering fragrance that leaves a fresh and calming scent to the room. I use in the room where I work at home and it helps to keep me focused on the tasks at hand. I really like this blend.</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and was packaged nicely however didn&#x27;t smell nice and calm... I use it with a little orange or Mandarin essential oil and it fixed the problem. My son and I like calm the child by plant therapy much better and it works because he likes it.</li>
    <li> great for diffusers good smelling</li>
    <li> Smells so nice, a very serene scent. I like to put a couple drops in a bath.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome. I combine with almond oil..No creams!! and apply to the body and neck, shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;very nice.&lt;br /&gt;lasts for hours.....</li>
    <li> lemongrass much better.</li>
    <li> I admit that it took a while to get used to the smell. I&#x27;m not used to a lot of the scents in this blend, but it does seem to relax me now when I smell it. When you&#x27;re accustomed to synthetic scents, it takes a while to appreciate real lavender, real jasmine, etc. I drop a few drops in my shower and let the steam do it&#x27;s work. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the hot shower or the oil or even the placebo effect, but it is very relaxing.</li>
    <li> Love this Edens oil is the diffuser, dab on my wrists, or sprayed on my bed linens.  Good price &amp; quality oils.</li>

    <li> I love the scent. Relaxing.</li>
    <li> Love the smell beautiful blend! It behaved well in cold processed soap!</li>
    <li> This oil works wonderfully.  I have diffused it and applied it with carrier oil, and both ways work well when used on 2 rambunctious boys.</li>
    <li> This blend is super earthy, I was hoping for something closer to young living peace and this was not it, but they shipped fast and got where i needed it to be. I love the company and love the rest of their blends this one only rates so low because i was hoping for something a little different</li>
    <li> Eden&#x27;s Garden has awesome quality oils. The Peace blend has a wonderous scent. It is long lasting and truly relaxing. They are my go-to oil company.</li>
