<li> I bought this for my 12 year old son.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve gone through several acne remedies for my 12-year old daughter and since her skin is somewhat sensitive</li>
<li> After that, I take a couple days break, so my face will not get too dry, and then use all of it again for the next couple of days.</li>
<li> Just don&#x27;t use it every single day for an entire week, well you could, but your face might start to peel.</li>
<li> You can still use it over night, but in the morning before you go out in the long day in the sun, just wash it off, even if you just used the cleanser.</li>
<li> It took about 8 weeks for this happen, a  long time</li>
<li> OH and don&#x27;t go in the sunlight for long periods of time when you are using proactiv!</li>
<li> I use the cleanser once or twice a day but either the toner or repairing lotion sparingly as they have a tendency to dry my skin out.</li>
<li> I was very excited about purchasing this product, however I can&#x27;t use it at all, I hardly used it before it started irritating my skin.</li>
<li> I used for a month and had very dry skin.</li>
<li> And by a long day  in the sun, I mean like, spending an entire day in the sun where your face could get tan!</li>
<li> I Would recommend this product to anyone who has sever acne problems and have tried other products that just seems not to work !</li>
<li> I am prone to breakouts because I&#x27;m very active and have oily skin.</li>
<li> I will not use any other product!!</li>
<li> THis product works well on acne but too harsh for my skin.</li>
<li> Give it a few weeks, this product does work, but expect for your skin to be dried out as well.</li>
<li> and my face swelled up and was dried out for 2 weeks.</li>
<li> Within 2 weeks, the severe acne that she had on her forehead cleared up and now she only gets random pimples every once and a while.</li>
<li> , that&#x27;s a negative comment for me.</li>
<li> My skin reacted very negative to this product I missed work</li>
<li> I was given two painful injections piriton and hydrocortisone which carried the redness down a bit and lessened some of the itching.</li>
<li> Well I was wrong, this product began working just days after she started using it.</li>
<li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> I bought this from another site and was terribly disappointed in that, the product was out of date by almost a year.</li>
<li> Just hated dealing with the company itself because they never want you to cancel as they promised you could without a lot of hassle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> proactiv  is the best and I love that I can purchase the product without the monthly purchase plan. Great product great price.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!! I only use it once a day and as long as I do that my face is blemish free- no foundation needed here!!</li>
    <li> Worked great for my teenager and helped remove the zits. Great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Got this for someone else. Thank u</li>
    <li> This product works fine for me, although I do not use it everyday.  Make sure you wash your hands after use because it can bleach fabrics.</li>
    <li> I started using this product for the first time. For the first week, it went ok but I saw redness develop on my face. This product sent me to the emergency room! I had an allergic reaction to the benzoyl peroxide. I had a rash develop on my face and neck, that burned and itched incessantly. I was given two painful injections piriton and hydrocortisone which carried the redness down a bit and lessened some of the itching. I was given tablets to take for 5 days and sent home. his product indicated it was for sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s far from the truth. Some people may have seen success with this but as far as this product goes it&#x27;s TRASH! I have been fooled by all the celebrity endorsements for this product, but those celebrities have the money and a battalion of beauty pros to make them look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fingers even started peeling with this product. It was total disaster all around. In short DON&#x27;T BUY!!!</li>
    <li> My skin reacted very negative to this product I missed work and my face swelled up and was dried out for 2 weeks. I would not recommend this product and I have heard many negative things on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this from another site and was terribly disappointed in that, the product was out of date by almost a year.You could not tell that from the website, but here.....this product is up to date and fresh. It was packaged very well and I received it very quickly. Thank you so much,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
    <li> My face is clear and is staying clear of all break outs. It took about 8 weeks for this happen, a  long time but it is worth the wait</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this productuct! Proactive helped me out a lot but i still break out. It has made my face smoother! I can tell the difference from before I used it. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Proactiv has always worked really well for me. I use the cleanser once or twice a day but either the toner or repairing lotion sparingly as they have a tendency to dry my skin out. The reason for the low-ish review is that I ordered at Christmas and the product expires in April - too soon. I will probably not be through the repairing lotion or the mask by then.</li>
    <li> Works like it says and its a great product. Can change your life if you suffer from acne , great for anyone!</li>
    <li> Item seemed to work well for her and she liked it. We are still deciding if we will order it again.</li>
    <li> This is for my son who is twelve and it works great!  The tricky part is getting your teenager to use it twice a day.  The product arrived on time and as described.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used this product when my face initally broke out and it helped very much. I stopped using it because of the price and came back to it again after some years after my face started to break out again.</li>
    <li> THis product works well on acne but too harsh for my skin. I used for a month and had very dry skin. I have kept the repair stuff for the occasional blemish.</li>
    <li> been using it for almost 3 months and im just starting to see a difference. also I&#x27;ve been getting comments that i&#x27;m getting brighter in complexion, that&#x27;s a negative comment for me.</li>
    <li> Give it a few weeks, this product does work, but expect for your skin to be dried out as well.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have ordered proactive before and I know what each size looks like. I only got the 30 day kit it should have been alot bigger. I use to order the 30 day kit and I measured the bottles and they were exactly the same ounces and all. If you want to pay the price for 30 days get this. I suggest you look elsewhere</li>
    <li> I bought this for my cousin, the first time she used it-it was heaven. She lives in Qatar and I just mailed her another. She added her skin is acne free.</li>
    <li> Great for clearing blemishes.. Keeps the face smooth</li>
    <li> This product came super fast and in perfect condition. Nothing was expired and it works great! I don&#x27;t go through my kit very fast and can&#x27;t do the monthly kits. So this is perfect. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love proactiv. The thing is, I don&#x27;t use the toner and the repairing treatment every day. I only use the cleanser every day to wash my face, and then for a couple days I do use the toner and the repairing treatment. After that, I take a couple days break, so my face will not get too dry, and then use all of it again for the next couple of days. Just don&#x27;t use it every single day for an entire week, well you could, but your face might start to peel. It&#x27;s best to switch it up, it&#x27;s much more effective that way! OH and don&#x27;t go in the sunlight for long periods of time when you are using proactiv! You can still use it over night, but in the morning before you go out in the long day in the sun, just wash it off, even if you just used the cleanser. Still wash it off. And by a long day  in the sun, I mean like, spending an entire day in the sun where your face could get tan! Spending an hour or so, won&#x27;t really matter, it&#x27;s fine. If you spend too much time in the sun while proactiv is on, you could get more acne, but it&#x27;s not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT make the mistake of using too much toner to \\&quot;rub off\\&quot; a zit! DO NOT DO THIS. You will get your face burned, and it might take a couple weeks for the burn to go away. If you accidentally did this, use eucerin calming creme to heal the burn, it will heal much faster.&lt;br /&gt;But yeah basically proactiv is good! If you need to get rid of your acne, try it! IT&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old son. We seen results in 5 days. This product has the results they advertise.  Would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Proactive really works if you have problems with breakouts. I was only breaking out in my chin area and this has stopped the breakouts and my skin looks much better.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about purchasing this product, however I can&#x27;t use it at all, I hardly used it before it started irritating my skin. I have found that the botanicals by MK are much better and easier on my skin.</li>
    <li> This item was a gift for my niece and she use on a regular basis with outstanding results! She plans on purchasing a refill!</li>
    <li> I love Proactive. Have used it in the past with great results. Just hated dealing with the company itself because they never want you to cancel as they promised you could without a lot of hassle. I was excited to see I could order it from amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several acne remedies for my 12-year old daughter and since her skin is somewhat sensitive I was concerned that this would be too drying for her skin. Well I was wrong, this product began working just days after she started using it. Within 2 weeks, the severe acne that she had on her forehead cleared up and now she only gets random pimples every once and a while. She uses it day and night and loves it and feels so much more confident.</li>
    <li> I wasnt very happy with the product, the way I got them was in a bag. No instructions and I felt I got ripped off the price was 49.00. And I tried the product does not do a thing for me. I wish I could return. And I should of bought from the tv. Will never buy from them again, or recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product works like a Champ ! I Would recommend this product to anyone who has sever acne problems and have tried other products that just seems not to work !</li>
    <li> Lifesaver for me!! I am prone to breakouts because I&#x27;m very active and have oily skin. Proactiv is effective and you see results within days!! I love it! I will not use any other product!!</li>
    <li> love love love Proactive. After many years of fighting with a severe case of acne I found proactive and I will never go back to any other anti-acne product.</li>
    <li> The package was received on February 28, 2013. It was a two months supply. However, most of the items had an expiry date of March 2013. How can I use a two months supply before it expired!</li>
    <li> Her face did clear some but we will have to look further if we want to get rid of acne. Been using a month now.</li>
    <li> Gdaughter luvs it!  I don&#x27;t have enough words to express how this helps my &amp;#34;tweener&amp;#34; with her skin, she is very happy.</li>
