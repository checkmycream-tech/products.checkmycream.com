      <li>I love to use these to spritz on before I put on make up and after.</li>
      <li>Even though, the effect seems to be more of a placebo than anything else.</li>
      <li>A do-it-yourself mister needs to be checked to be sure it is not growing gunk.)</li>
      <li>Freshness, I love it.</li>
      <li>My dad kind of scoffed at the idea of paying for bottles water like this, but it was pretty nice to use.</li>
      <li>Another good thing ,  it doesn&#x27;t have any smell, just like pure water.</li>
      <li>I have loved this product for so many years, but haven&#x27;t found it for more than ten.  </li>
      <li>I will recommend specially people who travel a lot</li>
      <li>I love that they are great for a quick refresher or cool down (as I live in a very hot arid environment).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of cool water as opposed to splashing water on your face out of a faucet.  </li>
      <li>I spray is I can feel my face fresh</li>
      <li>As everything begins to dry out on the plane, a quick spray will nicely rehydrate you.  </li>
      <li>and when I&#x27;d get hot out walking around I&#x27;d mist my face with it.  </li>

      <li>was an absolute necessity!  </li>
      <li>I suppose there are cheaper ways to get this same result, but this is super convenient and you know the water is clean.</li>
      <li>I keep a can in my purse to spray my arms and face , when I am out ,I live in Texas and it can get very hot here.</li>
      <li>During the summer time, you just spray on your face when you feel hot or dry, you will feel instantly cool , fresh and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>This travel size is very convenient , you can put in your purse and take it everywhere.</li>
      <li>Keeping your skin moist is as important in the summer as it is during the dry winter.  </li>
      <li>, ok, granted, mineral water, but just the same thing you&#x27;ll find in a regular bottle of evian.</li>
      <li>HIghly recommended (both for ladies and gentlemen)</li>
      <li>pretty nice, bottles a little on the small side, but otherwise transportable, works well, keeps you fresh, would but again</li>
      <li>The air at work is so dry that a few mists of this really provide refreshing moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I do from the early nineties ....</li>
      <li>I am surprised at how much mileage I get out of the small containers.  </li>

    <li> I have used Evian water for a while now.I keep a can in my purse to spray my arms and face , when I am out ,I live in Texas and it can get very hot here.</li>
    <li> Did you know this is just water!?, ok, granted, mineral water, but just the same thing you&#x27;ll find in a regular bottle of evian. Even though, the effect seems to be more of a placebo than anything else. People who go for brand impact will find this to be a great product.</li>
    <li> I have loved this product for so many years, but haven&#x27;t found it for more than ten.  I flew to Spain and the Evian was an absolute necessity!  It&#x27;s just the right amount of cool water as opposed to splashing water on your face out of a faucet.  It is very refreshing, and also brightens fading makeup.</li>
    <li> pretty nice, bottles a little on the small side, but otherwise transportable, works well, keeps you fresh, would but again</li>
    <li> This travel size is very convenient , you can put in your purse and take it everywhere. During the summer time, you just spray on your face when you feel hot or dry, you will feel instantly cool , fresh and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;Even you spray it on your face with makeup, it won&#x27;t mess it up. Another good thing ,  it doesn&#x27;t have any smell, just like pure water. If you accidentally put on your lips you won&#x27;t taste any scent.&lt;br /&gt;So easy, so convenient and feel so good. HIghly recommended (both for ladies and gentlemen)</li>
    <li> I got these for a trip to Europe where I knew it was going to be in the 90&#x27;s.  I thew a bottle in my bag and when I&#x27;d get hot out walking around I&#x27;d mist my face with it.  It was nice and refreshing.  My dad kind of scoffed at the idea of paying for bottles water like this, but it was pretty nice to use.</li>
    <li> Love these!  I leave them in the refrigerator until I go out -- or travel -- and then pop them in my purse.  Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is far the best.. If you love being fresh while on vacation take with you this stuff you will love love it !! I do from the early nineties ....</li>
    <li> Like the 10 ounce container I keep on my bathroom counter at home, these little guys are terrific travel companions.  As everything begins to dry out on the plane, a quick spray will nicely rehydrate you.  Take it along everywhere you go:  on a plane, in the car, on a walk.</li>
    <li> Ok, this is just Evian in a spray mist, but the size is great for my purse and I also keep one at work. The air at work is so dry that a few mists of this really provide refreshing moisturizing. I suppose there are cheaper ways to get this same result, but this is super convenient and you know the water is clean. (A do-it-yourself mister needs to be checked to be sure it is not growing gunk.) It is also great for setting makeup, so 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love to use these to spritz on before I put on make up and after. It seems to help hold my make up through the day. The size is so convenient and very hard to find in stores. It&#x27;s also great to take one to the beach or pool to cool yourself off. Also good to wake children up with!</li>
    <li> Freshness, I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using these mini Evian sprays for about a year.  I love that they are great for a quick refresher or cool down (as I live in a very hot arid environment). I put mine in the refrigerator so it is nice and cold.  Although I don&#x27;t use mine daily, (maybe a couple of times a week) I am surprised at how much mileage I get out of the small containers.  Definitely a better deal online as well.</li>
    <li> Keeping your skin moist is as important in the summer as it is during the dry winter.  Great purse or pocket size.</li>
    <li> I put in the refrigerator and after bath I spray is I can feel my face fresh I even on hot time refresh and you feel wake up I will recommend specially people who travel a lot</li>
    <li> they expire but help your skin</li>
    <li> I love it, will be buying more. Don&#x27;t know how I lived without this up until now. Anyone can use it and feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have one in the car my office and at home..</li>
