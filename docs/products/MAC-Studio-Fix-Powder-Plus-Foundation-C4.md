    <li> This is FAKE and I wholeheartedly promise you!!!!   Makeup lovers,   If you think about it... this product is not that much more to buy the REAL stuff!  I mean why \\&quot;waste\\&quot; and throw away any of your hard earned money on fake junk?  We do not even know whats its really made with!  Please save up a lil more money and then buy from the online or brick and mortar stores.  Isn&#x27;t your face or clients worth it?!   So use your money wisely and do not buy from any Sellers/Ebayers/Whateverer&#x27;s that are new, have any low/bad feedback about quality, or if you just don&#x27;t feel right about it cuz the price is to good to be true.   If it looks to good to be true then its most likely a fake!   The fakes are getting better looking now and days(especially the eyeshadows...they no longer have the foam brush section in the bottom of them!)  Oh! and I always  get free shipping from them. Even if I am only spending eight dollars! Just always do a quick search for their \\&quot;free shipping codes\\&quot; You do not have to only get free shipping if spending over fifty dollars like the site says! ;)</li>
    <li> I saw a review on this foundation, some negative, but ... I bought mine and for me it and her perfect.&lt;br /&gt;In coverage , smell, texture and durability...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am going to start buying my mac from here all the time. I also got my mac when they said i would get it and that is awesome</li>
    <li> Its a Mac cosmetic...need I say any more?... The product is everything you want and more! You won&#x27;t be disappointed to purchase this!</li>
    <li> Have used Mac for a number of years and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mac foundations for years but when I received my products I could tell right away it was FAKE!! Shipping was fast but I was so disappointed  at what I got. I brought it in to the MAC store and right away the sales associate said it was a knock off. The powder had a different feel to it. It didn&#x27;t go on nice and smooth and the sponge that it came with ad a terrible feel to it too. When I emailed the seller to confront her about the product she said of course the sales associate would tell you the foundation non authentic because I didn&#x27;t buy it from their store. We compared the foundation and I can clearly tell the difference. I asked for a refund and asked the seller to pay for the cost of shipping back the fake products to her but she refused to pay for the shipping and I had to take the lost of about $30.00 to ship it back to her. Not impress at all!! I read in another feedback from the seller and she said she will pay for the shipping back but why didn&#x27;t she pay for mine?? Will never do business with this seller ever again!!</li>
    <li> I love MAC make up. I originally purchased this make up for my wedding. I was going to get my makeup done at the MAC store, and they told me it would be $150! I decided I would invest that money into make up I could keep, not just for one day! I am so thankful. I purchased this powder plus foundation, it works great. I have oily skin, and this product works great. Yes, it is expensive, but definitely worth the money. It makes my skin look great and flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked on MAC.</li>
    <li> Best powder I have ever used. Covers and looks great without looking too heavy. Worth every penny.  Also doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed it was original and the color was perfect. And the price is pretty much the same as you would pay for and department stores. Having the convenience of just purchasing  what I needed exactly online make it easy‪‬</li>
    <li> More expensive than purchasing from original mac store. Im overseas so i had to buy this.</li>
    <li> I use this exact compact every day, and when I received my order and used it for the first time I realized I had been scammed. this is in no way a true MAC item, the sponge is not even the same. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> This ítem came cracked</li>
    <li> If I could give zero stars, I would. Product is fake. I have used this for 10 years and unless you look carefully, they will fool you too.  Do not buy and go to a real MAC store.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful, I love MAC make up, it is my number one brand. This powder covers all imperfections. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product. Feels way lighter than liquid foundation yet has the full coverage. I&#x27;m hooked. It arrived promptly and very well packaged. Love it!</li>
    <li> as far as i know according to my wife, this is the best cosmetic product that she ever had, she&#x27;s been using it since 2000, and she says she&#x27;ll never change it for anything.</li>
    <li> producto origina, muy eficiente la compra y el envio; recomiendo para todo evento a este vendedor, es por lo que lo califico de la mejor manera.</li>
    <li> Product arrived beautifully packaged and exactly as described.  MAC studio fix foundation powder is the only foundation that I use.  Worth every dime!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wondering if  the make up its fake??? usually when I buy it from the store it looks a little darker, but this one looks lighter for some reason.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 4 years, and have only needed 2 of them. It lasts extremely long and has EXCELLENT coverage. My friends always think I&#x27;m wearing liquid foundation, but I am always wearing this powder one. I have sensitive skin also, but this has never irritated my skin. It&#x27;s very smooth, and MAC has an excellent range of colors. It never gets flaky and is by far the best powder foundation out there. There is nothing bad about this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best makeup brand Ever. I will buy MAC until I get old. I hope the y never change.</li>
