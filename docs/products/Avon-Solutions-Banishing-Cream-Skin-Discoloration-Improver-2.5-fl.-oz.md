      <li>Have used this product for four years, Love that I can obtain it through amazom.</li>

      <li>BUT THEN WHAT MORE CAN YOU EXPECT FOR THE PRICE?</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty good</li>
      <li>sometimes at night, mostly in the daytime after I wash my face with a very good, mild soap called the \\&quot;AMBI- Complexion Cleansing Bar\\&quot; something that I have been doing for over a year because I honestly love the way it leaves NO residue whatsoever and makes my face soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom,</li>
      <li>I am 55 years old and people say I look great for my age.</li>
      <li>To my great surprise I have noticed that the pigmentation areas is almost completely gone, even though I am no longer applying the cream.</li>
      <li>A lot of her friends have noticed the huge improvement as well.</li>
      <li>I am light skinned</li>
      <li>This is truly an affordable product that has high quality ingredients and amazing results.</li>
      <li>It cleared it right up!</li>
      <li>Exact same product, arrived in great shape.  </li>
      <li>I really wish this skin cream smelled better</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t remove them entirely, but did a good job.</li>
      <li>Very light non-greasy cream, that drastically helped smooth old acne scars and discoloration.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m almost sure its just from the normal change your skin has as its healing from acne.</li>
      <li>This product really works and it works quick.</li>
      <li>This REALLY worked for me, I highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>and I also use it VERY sparingly, [just a finger dab worth]</li>
      <li>It brightens up her skin tone while keeping her skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>but you have to be consistent with it.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Felt good going on and am sorry that I didn&#x27;t order more.  </li>
      <li>what about some kind of bleaching agent for dark spots?</li>
      <li>Can anyone tell me how much to use at a time?</li>
      <li>and now they just look pretty normal.</li>
      <li>I went my whole pregnancy with no stretch marks.</li>
      <li>One I apply makeup, it&#x27;s really gone.  </li>
      <li>It is not irritating or smelly, so, I will keep using it.  </li>
      <li>and I can really see some results.</li>
      <li>Works better than any other brands.</li>
      <li>This product worked on my cheeks so great that now I am using it on other dark areas on my skin and will give another review as soon as I see any results.</li>
      <li>I was glad to know that Amazon.com carried it, because it was the only thing that worked for me back then out of all the products I tried for spot removal.  </li>
      <li>but it came as described and in decent time.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t particularly like the fragrance or texture of this cream.  </li>
      <li>The most you can do is encourage cell turnover and they will fade a little faster.</li>
      <li>I find the item having a huge impact on clearing up dark spots on my face.</li>
      <li>OTHER LIKE GARNIER ARE BETTER AND FASTER ACTING.</li>
      <li>(tape pulled a bunch of skin off after surgery), but I have not been using it consistently and this spot is different than age spots, so I don&#x27;t know whether anything would help this spot.  </li>
      <li>Last a long time as it only takes a little to work great.</li>
      <li>Reduces sun spots and natural aging brown spots even on arms and hands.  </li>
      <li>I order this product from Avon directly and saved some money by ordering it here.  </li>
      <li>Also my acne has almost completely gone away, which was unexpected.</li>
      <li>I read and researched and basically found out that stretch marks are scars and nothing will make them go away completely.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for at least 10 years and I love it.</li>
      <li>HAVE FOUND GARNIER MUCH FASTER ACTING THAN ALL THE REST I HAVE TRIED.  </li>
      <li>So far this product has not, but I don&#x27;t want to just throw it away...</li>
      <li>It was so old that I tossed it and purchased this one.  </li>
      <li>Have only used few times but like how easily you can apply on the face.</li>
      <li>I still have some discolorations and this cream does not necessarily  prevent new marks.  </li>
      <li>I did notice that it helped with some older dark scars/discoloration from a skin infection, although it didn&#x27;t help much with a large patch of discoloration of unknown origin on my forehead.</li>
      <li>Will it even out rough spots and smooth out skin and slightly fade brown spots?</li>
      <li>I am going to use up my other stuff first, then go back to this.  </li>
      <li>It appeared to work the first few weeks</li>
      <li>I did get gradual lightening in an extreme high pigmentation area.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my dark spots, so i will not be buying this again !</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used this product for four years, Love that I can obtain it through amazom. Will it remove brown spots? No. Will it even out rough spots and smooth out skin and slightly fade brown spots? Yes. Yes as a nighttime face cream as well as on arms and hands</li>
    <li> I order this product from Avon directly and saved some money by ordering it here.  Exact same product, arrived in great shape.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good but you can&#x27;t miss a day, after 4 months I did see slight change</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 10 years and I love it. I am 55 years old and people say I look great for my age. We were at a home party for spa stuff and she put this cream on my face to make me look younger, the  other people you could see the difference in there skin tone but mine you could not tell at all. She could not guess which side their product was on so $5.00 on sale or $20.00.</li>
    <li> I used this daily for over a month and I did not notice any difference in the discoloration in my skin. I was hoping that I would see some improvement, but I saw none. I knew for the inexpensive price that I would not get a lot of improvement, but this did nothing.</li>
    <li> Have only used few times but like how easily you can apply on the face.</li>
    <li> I started using this product in May of 2009 and I expected immediate results and I was disappointed at first. However, after about 2 months of using it mornings and nights (applying sunscreen protection during the day, etc.) I did get gradual lightening in an extreme high pigmentation area. I felt at times as though the area was not lightening and I eventually stopped its use in August of 2009. To my great surprise I have noticed that the pigmentation areas is almost completely gone, even though I am no longer applying the cream.I must conclude that the cream works, but you must stick with your regime and avoid sun exposure, and if you have to, use a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Works over a period of time. But it works!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only a few short weeks now and before I knew it I saw a difference. I was very skeptical to try this product but I bought it because I wanted to target some dark spots I have had for several years. Experience with other skin lightening products in the past has taught me to become meticulous over my product choices because they had either tingled on my face pretty bad or {imo} made my dark spots appear even worse. Nevertheless, I have NOT been using this cream morning and evening like the recommendation indicates on the jar and I also use it VERY sparingly, [just a finger dab worth] sometimes at night, mostly in the daytime after I wash my face with a very good, mild soap called the \\&quot;AMBI- Complexion Cleansing Bar\\&quot; something that I have been doing for over a year because I honestly love the way it leaves NO residue whatsoever and makes my face soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, lol. Well, I had some very dark spots on both of my cheekbones&amp;lt;---yes HAD, they are gone now-Praise GOD! This product worked on my cheeks so great that now I am using it on other dark areas on my skin and will give another review as soon as I see any results. This REALLY worked for me, I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream once a day for two months now to help lighten my acne marks and scars. It has helped a bit but nothing to rave about.</li>
    <li> did not work and I am light skinned would never order it again.  I like kojic acid soap better, wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the Clinique product that I was using (which was working well) was just too expensive.  Unfortunately, the smell of this product is so strong (and, in my opinion, extremely unpleasant) that I have been unable to use it on the areas on my face or neck (which are the primary areas that I need it for)... so I cannot even say whether it actually works or not.  I *have* been using it periodically on a somewhat darkened area on my stomach from a skin injury (tape pulled a bunch of skin off after surgery), but I have not been using it consistently and this spot is different than age spots, so I don&#x27;t know whether anything would help this spot.  So far this product has not, but I don&#x27;t want to just throw it away...</li>
    <li> Loved his.  Felt good going on and am sorry that I didn&#x27;t order more.  I am going to use up my other stuff first, then go back to this.  I am always happy with Avon !</li>
    <li> Good product. Just did nor work for me.  My skin got worse when I was in the sunlight, even when I put some sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have always been a longtime user of Avon products. It works as expected.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my dark spots, so i will not be buying this again ! It smells good though ..</li>
    <li> Very light non-greasy cream, that drastically helped smooth old acne scars and discoloration. This is truly an affordable product that has high quality ingredients and amazing results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product once per day for 4 months and have noticed no change. Will finish the jar and update if changes.</li>
    <li> Did a good and as-expected job of lightening of the age spots on my neck and the backs of my hands. Didn&#x27;t remove them entirely, but did a good job.</li>
    <li> I started using the Avon Banishing Cream about 2 1/2 weeks ago. Can anyone tell me how much to use at a time? Should I apply liberally? I can&#x27;t seem to find directions for use. I am rating it in the middle as it is too soon to tell if the product is going to work or how well it is going to work.</li>
    <li> I still have some discolorations and this cream does not necessarily  prevent new marks.  But it makes my skin smooth and bright which is a good think if you are over 50!</li>
    <li> Works better than any other brands.</li>
    <li> Results are slow but gradually working</li>
    <li> This product really works and it works quick.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  It softened my skin and it is really good for Rosecia.  It cleared it right up!</li>
    <li> Works as promised. No scent, or plain subtle scent. Will last at least a year!!! Yeah. I will probably never need to buy another one since it is used so sparingly. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased two container of this product.  I am almost finished with second container and have not noticed a change in dark areas. The only Avon product I have used and yielded results was a small bottle of Anew Skin Brightener.  This product did not smell bad, practically odorless, it was not thick at all, but it did not do what it was intended to.  Best if used as a regular lotion and not for skin improving.</li>
    <li> The only product that I find to banishing my dark spots . This is the best product and works very quickly .</li>
    <li> This cream was inexpensive and just wanted to try it on my hands ,I have a few dark spots that I would like to see fade and so far I have seen a little results one spot seems to be fading but I may need to use this longer I put this on my hands every night and if I see good results I will order more I have also used this on a spot on my face still waiting to see the results.</li>
    <li> did not get the expected result. but satisfy</li>
    <li> This cream is a miracle. It removed all my superficial scarring in a month over expensive prescription cream prescribed by my Dermatologist. I will keep buying and using. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t particularly like the fragrance or texture of this cream.  Was hoping for more of a creamy texture like Loreal&#x27;s Hydra Nutrition.</li>
    <li> I used to sell Avon years ago, and having the type of skin that would show blemishes well, I decided to try this.  I was glad to know that Amazon.com carried it, because it was the only thing that worked for me back then out of all the products I tried for spot removal.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time now so I don&#x27;t know if the formula has changed, but time will tell.  It is not irritating or smelly, so, I will keep using it.  Maybe I will give another rating on it once a few weeks have passed and I can really see some results.</li>
    <li> I went my whole pregnancy with no stretch marks. Thought I had escaped....well two weeks postpartum they showed up (still don&#x27;t know how that happened). I read and researched and basically found out that stretch marks are scars and nothing will make them go away completely. The most you can do is encourage cell turnover and they will fade a little faster. Well, I had an idea...what about some kind of bleaching agent for dark spots? Wouldn&#x27;t that make the marks fade faster too? Well I picked this up...I mean, who couldn&#x27;t give it a try for the price?!? And after about 3 days, I noticed a difference! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now and my stretch marks are still clearly visible, but before they were UGLY and now they just look pretty normal. You may think it&#x27;s just the passage of time, but I don&#x27;t think so. I didn&#x27;t start using it until 17 months postpartum and I had seen very little improvement before then, but then as soon as I started using it, they started to improve. Could&#x27;ve been a fluke, I suppose, but I&#x27;m convinced enough to keep ordering it!</li>
    <li> I really wish this skin cream smelled better so I would be more enticed to use it. I did notice that it helped with some older dark scars/discoloration from a skin infection, although it didn&#x27;t help much with a large patch of discoloration of unknown origin on my forehead. Would I buy it again? Probably not.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a banishing cream for my mom. And I came across this Avon product on Amazon. I was thrilled by both the price and reviews. So I purchased a few for her. She absolutely loved this product. It brightens up her skin tone while keeping her skin soft and smooth. A lot of her friends have noticed the huge improvement as well.</li>
    <li> havent had the chance to use it yet but it came as described and in decent time. ill update my review if i find the product works for me :)</li>
    <li> Skin using it.  But does not show any sign of banishing or lighter my skin</li>
    <li> It did not take away the dark spots.</li>
    <li> This stuff works - I have a number of freckles and some age spots on me that I wanted to get rid of - takes a while but it works</li>
    <li> I have been using the cream for about 6 weeks now and there is not a big change in dark spots I have. There is some change, very minimal though and I&#x27;m almost sure its just from the normal change your skin has as its healing from acne. But the overall texture, smoothness and firmness has improved. Also my acne has almost completely gone away, which was unexpected. But in terms of a dark spot remover it is very slow to improve that aspect of your skin.</li>
    <li> After seeing all the good reviews, I ran to purchase this product. It appeared to work the first few weeks and then I realized that I was breaking out more. I stopped using the product and I wasn&#x27;t breaking out. It did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Reduces sun spots and natural aging brown spots even on arms and hands.  Last a long time as it only takes a little to work great.</li>
    <li> HAVE FOUND GARNIER MUCH FASTER ACTING THAN ALL THE REST I HAVE TRIED.  A GOOD PRODUCT, BUT OTHER LIKE GARNIER ARE BETTER AND FASTER ACTING.</li>
    <li> ive used this in the past and it really works i would wash my face in the morning before work and apply some and when i got home from work around 7pm i would wash my face again and apply more and cwith in two weeks i could see changes the spots look lighter</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago and forgot I had bought it to replace another product I was using.  It was so old that I tossed it and purchased this one.  I can&#x27;t tell you it&#x27;s magic, but I can say that it&#x27;s doing a great job of lightening my liver spots on my face.  I have three between my nose and lips that I detest, and after just a few nights, one is nearly invisible.  One I apply makeup, it&#x27;s really gone.  The other two darken ones are coming along, too.  Shipment was prompt and it was well packaged.  Price was great!</li>
    <li> This product is great for people who want a light cream.  It moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and sticky.  It works great!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I did not get to use it daily to see if it would improve the tone/color of my skin because every time I would use it my face would break out with zits!!</li>
    <li> Takes a while to work but you have to be consistent with it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product, it works great.  Follow directions please, does not work overnight,  Noticeable improvement in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I use this cream on my elbows and knees and it works well on elbows and knees. I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> I find the item having a huge impact on clearing up dark spots on my face. I am completely satisfied .</li>
    <li> Has not faded dark spots at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Go with a retinal product instead. It will work alot netter than this product.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING IT FAITHFULLY DAY/NIGHT &amp; IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK LIKE IT SAYS IT WOULD, WHAT A WASTE! BUT THEN WHAT MORE CAN YOU EXPECT FOR THE PRICE?</li>
    <li> This product smells awful, and, it didn&#x27;t improve my skin one tiny bit.  At least it didn&#x27;t cost very much.  I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Perfect product.  Exactly what I ordered.  I love Avon creams.</li>
    <li> refill for the product that appears to work</li>
    <li> My face looks brighter and healthier already after only 2 days.  Love this product.  Avon has always been my favoritr</li>
</ol>
