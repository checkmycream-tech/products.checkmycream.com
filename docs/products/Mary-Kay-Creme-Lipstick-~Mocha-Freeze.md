    <li> Love the product, as usual.  It took a while to receive, but got it nonetheless. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great consistency. I was a little worried when I first got it, but it works perfectly. I use it over lip balm (burts bees ultrasensitive) with a lipliner.</li>
    <li> This is great lipstick!  It stays well and doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.  I love this color too!  I can pull it off for evening but it works well for day wear too since it&#x27;s not too flashy.</li>

    <li> The color was awful on me.  I am very fair-skinned and maybe that&#x27;s why.  But, I made a big mistake in purchasing.</li>
    <li> Flattering and subtle  - very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;Some color but no brown or orange undertones.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t change color throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Quick delivery.</li>

    <li> IT&#x27;S SUCH A PRETTY SHADE &amp; GOES WELL WITH EVERYTHING!  PLUS IT GLIDES ON SO EASILY &amp; IT STAYS &amp; IS NOT GREASY LIKE SOME LIPSTICKS.  YOU DON&#x27;T EVEN HAVE TO BLOT AFTER APPLICATION.</li>
    <li> I naturally wear earth colors and this lipstick was just one of them. If I ever run low on this color I would get another one before that happens like I said &amp;#34;I love this color&amp;#34; if it was not said enough. I love this color...lol, a must get!</li>
