      <li>It keeps it shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>It smells like cinnamon and leaves your hair so soft and shiny.</li>

<li> so you can use less.  </li>
<li> My little sister lived in Hawaii and swore by this product.</li>
<li> There is no greasy residue left behind.  </li>

    <li> noticeable difference</li>
    <li> Good Stuff for your hair!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this but I don&#x27;t feel like  it has conditioned my hair. I have curly hair that just seems to be dry on the ends. I use it most days.</li>
    <li> I swear by Kitoko Oil Treatment. I have long thick hair, and I can go up to 6 months without a hair cut and have people tell me how healthy my hair looks--it&#x27;s all because of Kitoko! I use it every single time I am out of the shower on the ends of my hair. Prevents split ends and serves as a heat protectant when straightening or curling. Amazing price and it lasts for months. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  It makes my hair incredibly shiny and soft.  It never leaves my hair feeling oily or sticky.  After long-term use of this oil, I can honestly say that my hair is in the best condition it has ever been&gt;  My salon sells this for $40 a bottle...so the amazon price is also a great perk!</li>
    <li> I love affinage kitoko oil... smells awesome- my hair is at its best everyday because of this!</li>
    <li> The product is great ! After you get out of the shower just dry your hair with a towel , then pump once and put it all through your hair and especially on the ends and leave in . It restores your hair , leaves it soft and it smells great !! Has a clean smell to it , no fruity smell like most products . Try it , you won&#x27;t be disappointed!! Good luck !!</li>
    <li> The oils are Good for your hair, plus leaves it silky and shiny with no &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; feeling.  Only takes a few drops,</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way! Doesn&#x27;t eliminate frizz but it does calm it down considerably. I LOVE the fact that it comes off of your hands completely and you don&#x27;t have to take time to wash off extra product.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice fragrance and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy!  I use it all the time and recommend it. fmp</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t make it feel greasy or weighed down. I would highly recommend it. A must buy.</li>
    <li> My friend who&#x27;s a hairstylist first introduced this product to me 2 years ago and I&#x27;ve been using this hair product religiously ever since!  I add it to my damp, towel-dried hair before blow-drying.  It leaves my hair feeling soft, light and bouncy.  It doesn&#x27;t wear your hair done, unlike most oil treatments.</li>
    <li> I first tried this Kitoko oil treatment at my hair dressers salon.  I love how shiny, silky and smooth this product leaves my hair.  There is no greasy residue left behind.  This product is much better than the oil treatments that I have purchased from Sephora.  Plus it has a pleasant fragrance.  I would definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair oil.  It makes my hair really manageable without weighing it down.  Using more oil actually improves styling.  Moroccanoil is another great product; however, it&#x27;s a bit heavier so you can use less.  I use both oils.</li>
    <li> I love the product as I have been using it faithfully for the last year. It is the only thing that I have found to condition my hair and tame frizz without weighing it down. But upon receiving this order I was highly disappointed. The bottle was only 1/4 full, a broken seal and half of the contents were spilled out in the box.  The bottle itself was not broken or damaged in any way.  A waste of money and will have to look elsewhere for my next shipment.  My first review of this product was not allowed to be published.  This is the second attempt at trying to let the buyers know how disappointed I am with this transaction.  Great product, great value, but totally unusable to me.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist introduced me to this hair oil and it&#x27;s the only thing I use in my hair. It smells like cinnamon and leaves your hair so soft and shiny. I rub some in my damp hair and then blow dry in sections. After my hair is dry I use a little more to smooth out fly aways. I get compliments from men! First time I&#x27;ve ever received compliments from men regarding my \\&quot;shiny hair\\&quot; was from using this product.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this. And it has been great. Other Aragon oil seemed heavy on my hair. This is very light and really gives good frizz control and shine. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.  Not heavy or greasy at all.  It has a beautiful light scent.  Would highly recommend.  Wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this oil treatment and I have my hairdresser to thank! The smell of this is indescribable in the best way. I&#x27;ve been slowly transforming my naturally dark hair to blonde, and every time I take my hair lighter, the moisture is sucked out and my hair becomes very dry. This oil has definitely helped to heal my hair and bring it back to shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily or greasy feeling or looking.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time now. I started using it back in the states and when we moved to Germany, I had to start using a little more than normal bc the German water is extremely hard which makes my hair very dry and brittle. By using a little more of the oil in my daily hair routine, my hair is back to being soft and silky!</li>
    <li> I love this Kitoko Oil. My hairdresser told me about it on one of my visits to her. It smoothes hair, smells delicious and combats breakage. It absorbs super fast and your hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy as long as you don&#x27;t use huge amounts.  Would buy again!  You can also use this for dry skin on body and face.</li>
    <li> My little sister lived in Hawaii and swore by this product. When she came to the main land I was in hair envy!! I asked her the secret and she directed me to this Kitoko oil Treatment. I love it! my hair has never been so healthy and long. Hands down one of the best hair products I have ever used. I have wavey hair and get the frizz all the time. This oil tames my mane whether I am going natural or straightening, or styling. I have been spreading the word about this item and this seller!</li>
    <li> Addicitive! I have loved using this...great as a gift beause it&#x27;s good for all type of hair even oily hair like mines.</li>
    <li> When I received the product, it wasn&#x27;t apparent at first, but it was not a new, unopened container as advertised. Almost 1/4 of the product was gone and the spout insert was in the bottle but the sticker was carefully placed to make it look like new. I will not be purchasing this from Amazon again - what a ripoff.</li>
    <li> My hair has been bleached and highlighted several times. I use this product as soon as I get out of the shower before I blowdry my hair. It keeps it healthy looking. I would recommend this product to anyone that has damaged hair. I would be lost without it</li>
    <li> I love it! I put it on before I style and it makes my hair soft, smooth and shiny! Awesome!</li>
    <li> Amazing, even came a day early than expected</li>
    <li> fabulous detangler and conditioner in one product. I have very fine hair that has taken to tangling as I age. A smiggen of this and I am detangled and get a great condition at the same time. Hair feels great! Just love this product!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t have an oily feeling like most products do. Love love love it!</li>
    <li> I love using this oil. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel too oily, but I feel that my hair is nourished and smells good too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helped my hair so much.  It keeps it shiny and soft. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This oil is absolutely amazing! It restores your hair and makes it shine like no tomorrow.</li>
