      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice plate, but you may need to practice with it to get good results.</li>
      <li>Be as creative as you want!  </li>
      <li>The plate has nice details</li>
      <li>designs are nice, but I wish some of the blossoms and branches were either closer together or had another branch under the longest part.</li>
      <li>Of course please use youtube if you are new to stamping to get tips on the best techniques.</li>
      <li>(I figured there would be a learning curve, but watching youtube videos was fun and gave me great tips).</li>
      <li>I use an old credit card, and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and excited to do more stamping!</li>
      <li>after each use so the grooves will take up more polish.  </li>
      <li>Cute designs, stamps well.</li>
      <li>Conad is the best in sharp etching.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are many dupes out there, yet the conad is the original that can&#x27;t be beaten.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>The butterfly does not hold ink as well as some designs, so make sure to clean it before/</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it easy to use and versatile.</li>
      <li>Very cute nail art stamps, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Also the images fit well together</li>
      <li>luck and enjoy</li>
      <li>This is by far my most favourite stamping plate that I own.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape with it, and all it did was scratch my plates up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with the special Konad Polishes, salon polishes (Zoya, Julep, etc), as well as department store polishes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that Zoya glitter polishes work awesomely, as do the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails polishes.</li>
      <li>But I will be darned if she doesn&#x27;t use this the absolute most out of any gift we gave her.  </li>
      <li>Just received this plate today and did my first attempt at nail stamping, and it worked just fine</li>
      <li>Very cute, the image sets clearly in the nail, easy, fast and at the first time.</li>
      <li>bamboo design is useful the way it can be positioned.</li>
      <li>I am having so much fun with this plate.  </li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d known this before ordering a slew of the Konad Special polishes, but I got them cheap enough</li>
      <li>This plate is very versatile, the cherry blossom image is fun to use.</li>
      <li>I will purchase more Konad plates in the future.</li>
      <li>I love this plate because the images are big, and you can polish whatever part of the image you want.</li>
      <li>The cherry blossoms are really pretty</li>
      <li>gelly sandwich style (cured gel foundation, regular polish, cured gel topcoat), and then play around with the stamps on top of my cured nails.</li>
      <li>I love how you can make the designs so random, if more designs came like this I would buy more.</li>
      <li>Plate M66 prints clear and clean images.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a large pattern I can use partially and creatively, but picking just the right placement is a little tricky.</li>
      <li>and you can easily use multiple design elements together in one manicure.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know there was such a huge nail stamping community out there until I started to grow my nails.</li>
      <li>They stay on really well with a topcoat.  </li>
      <li>The leftmost side of the branch with only one flower where the branch splits isn&#x27;t a very useful portion of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The ideas are endless and I get so many compliments with each design I create.  </li>
      <li>I put a clear coat of regular polish on top once I&#x27;m done, and then I can switch it out multiple times with the wear of the gel</li>
      <li>These designs are very pretty, although most of the patterns do not fit fully on a single nail.  </li>
      <li>Konad plates are pretty much the standard by which others are compared, but this was my first one after using other brands.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The designs are clearly etched .but</li>
      <li>I need to work really, really fast and experiment with polish and stampers with the plate I got because the images dry fast because they are so fine-lined and not very deep.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They work with regular nail polish, as long as the first layer is lighter and the second layer is opaque.  </li>
      <li>I used sally hansen extreme wear in a very opaque color.</li>
      <li>- this is such a fun little hobby.</li>
      <li>This is extremely useful for doing pedicures since you want a big image for the big toe and smaller ones for the other toes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a beginner at this, so I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards the more simplistic designs, but have really got the hold of how to do it after reading reviews on this and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> The other individual designs are crisp and clear, but the man isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d want as a design, and it&#x27;s so small that I don&#x27;t think anyone would know what it is anyway.&lt;br</li>
<li> but I do not like the long design because I cannot have he same results twice.</li>
<li> The cherry blossoms pattern is large enough to make each nail a little bit different, and I recommend filling in blank spaces with some of the small individual flowers.  </li>
<li> The only problem I have with it is that obviously the designs are too big for a single nail, but I also like that iit&#x27;s different from other plates in that way.</li>
<li> it is more difficult to learn than I expected.  </li>
<li> but the key is having a thick, very pigmented polish for this to work.</li>
<li> thin lines that comes out crisp on your nails.&lt;br</li>
<li> Definitely use a thick nail polish for the stamping or when you scrape the polish off the plate all of it will come off!</li>
<li> Also chrome metallics usually do well</li>
<li> I bought my daughter some very expensive gifts, this was by far the cheapest.  </li>
<li> That way if they turn out wonky I can wipe it off with non-acetone polish remover and start again without worrying about ruining my base coat.</li>
<li> :(</li>
<li> Looks horrible, I prefert the stikers.</li>

    <li> I am having so much fun with this plate.  The ideas are endless and I get so many compliments with each design I create.  Be as creative as you want!  I didn&#x27;t know there was such a huge nail stamping community out there until I started to grow my nails.</li>

    <li> I bought my daughter some very expensive gifts, this was by far the cheapest.  But I will be darned if she doesn&#x27;t use this the absolute most out of any gift we gave her.  She loves these things and will sit at the table for hours putting different designs on her nails.  She&#x27;s 13 and just watched the You Tube vids as everyone suggested... now she&#x27;s an expert.  Great product, great fun!</li>
    <li> I love this plate because the images are big, and you can polish whatever part of the image you want. I love how you can make the designs so random, if more designs came like this I would buy more. Also the images fit well together and you can easily use multiple design elements together in one manicure.</li>
    <li> Conad is the best in sharp etching.&lt;br /&gt;Very thin lines that comes out crisp on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;There are many dupes out there, yet the conad is the original that can&#x27;t be beaten.&lt;br /&gt;Only one big con is the price, that&#x27;s why I moved on to&lt;br /&gt;the BM and Cheekys.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Conad, but you are the best.......</li>
    <li> this product leaves lots of options open.  it is more difficult to learn than I expected.  I think that with practice I&#x27;ll get there</li>
    <li> The plate has nice details but I do not like the long design because I cannot have he same results twice. However I gave it 4 stars because the quality of the plate enables me to do my stamping art without any problems, like not having the image transferring to the stamp.</li>
    <li> Konad plates are pretty much the standard by which others are compared, but this was my first one after using other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs are nice, but I wish some of the blossoms and branches were either closer together or had another branch under the longest part.

I need to work really, really fast and experiment with polish and stampers with the plate I got because the images dry fast because they are so fine-lined and not very deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice plate, but you may need to practice with it to get good results.</li>
    <li> Very cute, the image sets clearly in the nail, easy, fast and at the first time. Verry recomended. Also it has very nice designs.</li>
    <li> This is by far my most favourite stamping plate that I own. I insisted that I get this one from Konad. The grooves are deep enough and the images are big enough so you can choose where you want your stamp to be placed. This is extremely useful for doing pedicures since you want a big image for the big toe and smaller ones for the other toes. I did my pedicure using the bamboo image and it has lasted a week. Of course please use youtube if you are new to stamping to get tips on the best techniques. I suggest Ms80millions on Youtube.</li>
    <li> Very cute nail art stamps, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Plate M66 prints clear and clean images. This plate has a lot of different images to use. The cherry blossoms are really pretty and you can put them where you like individually or using the branches. The bamboo prints out very nicely too. I would recommend this plate to anyone who like nail art and nail stamping.</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed with this nail plate! I&#x27;m a beginner at this, so I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards the more simplistic designs, but have really got the hold of how to do it after reading reviews on this and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with the special Konad Polishes, salon polishes (Zoya, Julep, etc), as well as department store polishes. I&#x27;ve found that Zoya glitter polishes work awesomely, as do the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails polishes. I wish I&#x27;d known this before ordering a slew of the Konad Special polishes, but I got them cheap enough I&#x27;ll chalk it up to a lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been also playing around with gel nails - so I&#x27;ll do my gel nails gelly sandwich style (cured gel foundation, regular polish, cured gel topcoat), and then play around with the stamps on top of my cured nails. That way if they turn out wonky I can wipe it off with non-acetone polish remover and start again without worrying about ruining my base coat. I put a clear coat of regular polish on top once I&#x27;m done, and then I can switch it out multiple times with the wear of the gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would note (as others have as well), if you buy the stamping kits, don&#x27;t bother with the included scraper. I couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape with it, and all it did was scratch my plates up. I use an old credit card, and it&#x27;s awesome. It made all the difference between polish actually sitting in the design so the stamp could be picked up, and the image being smeared all over and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and enjoy - this is such a fun little hobby. All of my girlfriends now are having me practice my stamps on them, and are buying their own sets as well!</li>
    <li> These designs are very pretty, although most of the patterns do not fit fully on a single nail.  The cherry blossoms pattern is large enough to make each nail a little bit different, and I recommend filling in blank spaces with some of the small individual flowers.  The butterfly does not hold ink as well as some designs, so make sure to clean it before/after each use so the grooves will take up more polish.  They work with regular nail polish, as long as the first layer is lighter and the second layer is opaque.  They stay on really well with a topcoat.  Youtube has a lot of good tutorials on how to use these.</li>
    <li> This plate is just what I wanted. I was looking for something with an Asian theme. I love it and it works great! I will purchase more Konad plates in the future.</li>
    <li> Cute designs, stamps well. I find that this plate has crisper lines than my mash and bundle monster plates, but I&#x27;ve heard that konad is one ofthe best companies. The only problem I have with it is that obviously the designs are too big for a single nail, but I also like that iit&#x27;s different from other plates in that way.</li>
    <li> Wonderful engraving which makes for gorgeous nail art. I&#x27;ve found it easy to use and versatile. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Looks horrible, I prefert the stikers. :( I lost my money and my time...</li>
    <li> This plate is very versatile, the cherry blossom image is fun to use. Just put the polish on the part of the branch you want for each nail or on an individual flower. This work well for art on all ten nails without repetition.</li>
