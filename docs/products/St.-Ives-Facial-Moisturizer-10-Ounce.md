<li> This product always meets expectations, and has done so for the past 30 years I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
<li> I usually put two thick layers on at night after washing my face to keep my skin hydrated.  </li>
<li> Other two cans was bad closed.</li>
<li> Now it is just helping her face from getting any worse.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with St. Ives I suppose.</li>
<li> Absolutely horrible.</li>

    <li> Great moisturizer for a great price!!</li>
    <li> Okay where do I start? I am 51 years old and I have used every moisturizer out there. I have spend hundreds of dollars. I bought this on a whim and then finally opened the lid a couple of weeks ago and I have been slathering it on my face and neck ever since. It moisturizes like none other, it tightens, it fills in fine lines. I love the stuff!! I wash with cetaphil and then apply this beyond wonderful moisturizer. I also bought their apricot scrub and use that a couple of times a week. My daughter now uses this stuff and it controls her blemishes. You get a huge tub of it and ladies IT WORKS!!!! I am telling all my friends about it. Buy it, u will be thrilled!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for 30+ years, every night.  Could no longer find it in stores--delighted to order it online.&lt;br /&gt;I get many compliments on my old skin! I think it would be more wrinkly without this!</li>
    <li> for a cheap moisturizer its the best.........</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible. I used it once a day for less than a week and it completely dried out my skin. My face and neck become so irritated that by day 4 even washing my face hurt. I don&#x27;t know what in this product caused such a reaction since I don&#x27;t have any reactions to their other products, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I use it all over my body, my husband loves it o his face.  I&#x27;ve yet to try it exclusively on my face.  but it&#x27;s light and sinks in beautifully. Not greasy- feels healthy and clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Best lotion in the world. Has kept me looking young for the past 30 years! (only in this jar form)</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturiser which is not available in Australia. Even with the exchange rate and postage this is still really good value.</li>
    <li> very good my favorite moisturizer</li>
    <li> Each jar can run over $5 in the store, but buying 6 at once worked out to be under $4 each. I find each jar last me for months and is really great moisturizer. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This product always meets expectations, and has done so for the past 30 years I&#x27;ve been using it.  It&#x27;s especially nice when I&#x27;m asked for my ID and someone says &amp;#34;You&#x27;re 61 years old...NO WAY!!&amp;#34;.  Thanks St. Ives for a truly great product.</li>
    <li> you know you can&#x27;t beat the price &amp; quality of this product anywhere. it is a great little moisturizer that helps keep my dry aging face perked up, moisturized &amp; fresh looking. not to mention it is not thick or greasy &amp; great for using under makeup. I just hope they keep the price the same. it is a good steal for the deal.</li>
    <li> Been using this for awhile and like how my skin feels</li>
    <li> Seems like a good product. Can&#x27;t go wrong with St. Ives I suppose.</li>
    <li> i love it not greasy my kind of facial moisturizer and perfect deal</li>
    <li> I have a lot of loose skin from massive weight loss, and, combined with a weight training routine, this cream has made huge progress in tightening it.</li>

I have not experienced any break outs with this moisturizer, It does seem to be very nourishing and soothing. Although I&#x27;m not sure if it is helping with preventing or erasing wrinkles.</li>
    <li> much bigger than i expected and i bought six packed. haven&#x27;t used, but semlls good, hoping to have a good feeling.</li>
    <li> best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found. Good value, good results.  Put it on before bed and 5-10 years later, my face looks better than my friends who never used anything.</li>
    <li> Combination skin rejoice! This is the moisturizer for you! I have struggled for years with both acne and dry, flaky skin, and this is the BEST moisturizer I have found that works with both. FYI - I&#x27;m a 25 year old female and I swear by this stuff!</li>
    <li> One of the six cans ordered was open and the cream was out. Other two cans was bad closed.</li>
    <li> This face moisturizer is wonderful. It helped my grandmothers wrinkles for awhile when we first got it! Now it is just helping her face from getting any worse. It is a wonderful moisturizer for people of all ages! I am a teenager and I use it along with my grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;A bottle will last for around three months for her. So getting this 10 pack is a really great deal! You get all 10 good sized containers!</li>
    <li> This stuff is light and makes your skin really soft.  I usually put two thick layers on at night after washing my face to keep my skin hydrated.  It seems the price has increased quite a bit for buying a single jar-I would purchase in bulk to keep the cost down.  At around $5-6/jar (if you buy in a 3-6 pack), the price, quantity and quality of the lotion can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> 1/ Shipment:&lt;br /&gt;It was received on time, however, I received my package with 5 pcs instead of 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/ Product:&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes and gives you a good feeling specially when applying it after showing. The smell is acceptable, nothing fancy. Haven&#x27;t noticed the collagen kick in yet, but hopefully it will reflect in about a week or two.</li>
    <li> Went threw the winter using this and never had dry tight skin.  EXCELLENT  for reducing wrinkles</li>
    <li> good face cream. I feel like I have less breakouts when I use regularly.</li>
    <li> This works great! I love this stuff. I am 29 and starting to get lines on my face. I have used lots of different face creams over the years some costing over $100 but this works better. I put it on at night after i wash my face and when I wake up my skin is very soft. It is not oily and does not make me get bumps like some do. My skin does not feel clogged at all. I have been using this for a few weeks and I already see a difference in my lines. I will keep using this and recommend it to others!</li>
