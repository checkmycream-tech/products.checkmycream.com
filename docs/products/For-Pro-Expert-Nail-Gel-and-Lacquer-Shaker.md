### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>have used the heck out of mine (I make nail polish jewelry) and it still works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s awesome.</li>
      <li>The best ever for gel polish, love it!</li>
      <li>Use it to mix my ejuice - great shaker</li>
      <li>Sparks fly from outlet when plugging in this item.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about this shaker and for now I&#x27;m still stuck shaking my polishes by hand.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s good to shake them up once in a while and would rather not manually do it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty impressive agitation for one so wee.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I ordered this shaker!  </li>
      <li>Still, a nice cordless option to the AC adapter also included.</li>
      <li>The beads were rolling free in both and additive distribution was even and good after.</li>
      <li>After running it for about 2 minutes it did OK.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d see some improvement, but I didn&#x27;t really expect this great of one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please let me know if someone recommends something better.</li>
      <li>Prettier result in fewer, easier coats :).    </li>
      <li>Works much better</li>
      <li>I feel safe letting them shake in that machine --</li>
      <li>I love nail polish and have too many bottles.</li>
      <li>I would recommend the opi shaker better</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has been able to shake EVERY shape and type of bottle that I&#x27;ve used it for.  </li>
      <li>Mostly a no-brainer plug and play.    </li>
      <li>They bought three more for the shop.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand Amazon was excellent (5stars+++)</li>
      <li>This works fine......</li>
      <li>I purposefully used a problem child color of an otherwise fabulous gel polish line.</li>
      <li>I blotted the underbelly to remove dust lightly.    </li>
      <li>bottles are secure.  </li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>Notes out of the box;  * Very nice, low profile footprint design.  </li>
      <li>It also makes mixing your own tints and colors easy (adding eye shadow to clear polish).</li>
      <li>It does a good job of getting all the colors thoroughly mixed, which is challenging to do by just hand-shaking, since gel polishes are very dense.</li>
      <li>Lucky to give it one star....</li>
      <li>I was hoping that this would be able to help me mix some of my gel polished and regular polishes that tend to settle better than me trying to mix them by hand.  </li>
      <li>So I returned it, returned was processed quickly.</li>
      <li>Even after leaving polishes on the machine for several minutes, switching the direction of the polish, etc., it was far more effective for me to just shake them.  </li>
      <li>Me shaking them by hand was not only faster but far more effective.  </li>
      <li>Right, ForPro shaken.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unscathed by alcohol meaning any gel polish mishaps can wipe right off.</li>
      <li>It did a good job on both a chunky glitter and a streak-prone frost in a conventional lacquer brand.</li>
      <li>Thanks ForPro!</li>
      <li>I pop it into this Shaker and let in ride for 30 second intervals depending on how settled the polish is :-)  </li>
      <li>I did shake them once to break surface tension first though.</li>
      <li>I have over 200 bottles of regular nail polish, more than 30 gel polishes and about 40 stamping polishes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Get the last drops of polish out of a bottle by shaking it up before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this is powered, so you don&#x27;t have to use batteries at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Blah, blah, blah.\\&quot; I&#x27;d be more specific, but I was operating it right on a stainless steel counter to put it through the noise test.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Add a few drops of lacquer thinner (NOT nail polish remover!) to an older/thicker polish and shake it up for 30 seconds and your polish will be good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Over the course of a couple days the shaker worked fairly well for the first 50 or so polishes and then the motor slowly died.</li>
      <li>Probably because it shakes so much?</li>
      <li>Very displeased with this.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone when wants the life of their polishes extended.</li>
      <li>Especially compared to Robarts that jiggle off tables and sound like landscaping machines.    </li>
      <li>So far, this polish shaker has worked well, and its price point is WAY better than others currently on the market.  </li>
      <li>All things are equal in my test, except I was more careful in application of the human shaken swatch, which has 2 more coats for a subpar, unusable result.</li>
      <li>I own several hundred bottles of nail polish and was excited to shake some new life into a few of the older ones.</li>
      <li>After all, I&#x27;m capable of giving a few arm shakes of a polish that&#x27;s already fairly well mixed.</li>
      <li>Noise level mild especially in comparison to my incessant bottle agitation whining.</li>
      <li>I love this little machine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a lot of regular and gel polishes that get used rarely, and if shaken for aminute behave as if new..</li>
      <li>tried both the ac adapter as well as putting in new batteries.</li>
      <li>Simple but gets the job done and cheap enough.</li>
      <li>First one received would not work with cord only battery.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to try a lacquer shaker to help my polishes to apply more smoothly and last longer, but they were all so expensive until this one came out.  </li>
      <li>Clear rubber feet stay put while leaving no marks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s loud, but I don&#x27;t expect anything else out of that type of machine</li>
      <li>Before had separation, some streaky clearness and clinging pigment near the neck.</li>
      <li>I like ForPro so far.</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd one that has done this exact same thing.</li>
      <li>Application was easy and like normally behaved other vampy, dark, well agitated gel polishes.</li>
      <li>The strap has holes on both sides -- don&#x27;t forget this when you&#x27;re trying to fit a small or irregular shaped bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried really hard to give it more care actually because I wanted to be ungenerous to ForPro.</li>
      <li>I like this; however, I don&#x27;t think it shakes fast enough or enough.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;d be unladylike to compare it to a &#x27;personal massager&#x27; out loud wouldn&#x27;t it?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more quiet than some and has little rubber feet so it doesn&#x27;t slide everywhere (but still moves a little).</li>

<li> Not worth the money for the time it lasted.</li>
<li> There are some super thick stamping polishes (MDU) that I still have to add steel mixing balls to, but anyone who has that type of polish knows that it&#x27;s particularly difficult to mix</li>
<li> So when I want to do my nails and my polish needs a little shake-up</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
<li> I used this shaker and had it there for what seemed like forever and maybe a few pieces of glitter moved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> But, human agitation was a streaky, bubbled shrink-back, difficult, wrinkling mess at every application and cure.</li>
<li> Very cheap and nasty..</li>
<li> and it has made simple tasks difficult.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed I couldn&#x27;t exchange it for a new one, and now there are none in stock.</li>
<li> Received second worked just not a great mixer unfortunately.</li>
<li> Seriously underwhelming.  </li>
<li> This sucks!</li>
<li> Something is wrong with either the power cord, or the plug on the shaker.  </li>
<li> Absolutely not Happy!</li>
<li> That&#x27;s dangerous.</li>
<li> I injured my wrist really bad</li>
<li> Oopsy, my bad.</li>
<li> As a licensed Nail Tech, I am so disappointed!</li>

    <li> So far, this polish shaker has worked well, and its price point is WAY better than others currently on the market.  It does a good job of getting all the colors thoroughly mixed, which is challenging to do by just hand-shaking, since gel polishes are very dense. We shall see how long it holds up.</li>
    <li> I have over 200 bottles of regular nail polish, more than 30 gel polishes and about 40 stamping polishes.  I really wanted to try a lacquer shaker to help my polishes to apply more smoothly and last longer, but they were all so expensive until this one came out.  I finally felt like I could afford to try out a polish shaker without breaking the bank.  Here are some of the finer points about this shaker:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been able to shake EVERY shape and type of bottle that I&#x27;ve used it for.  This includes round bottles, square bottles, tiny MDU mini bottles, etc.  Everything.  The strap has holes on both sides -- don&#x27;t forget this when you&#x27;re trying to fit a small or irregular shaped bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottles are secure.  I feel safe letting them shake in that machine -- I do not fear that they will jump out and shatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job it&#x27;s supposed to!  There are some super thick stamping polishes (MDU) that I still have to add steel mixing balls to, but anyone who has that type of polish knows that it&#x27;s particularly difficult to mix up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add a few drops of lacquer thinner (NOT nail polish remover!) to an older/thicker polish and shake it up for 30 seconds and your polish will be good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the last drops of polish out of a bottle by shaking it up before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this is powered, so you don&#x27;t have to use batteries at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the heck out of mine (I make nail polish jewelry) and it still works perfectly.  I love this little machine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s loud, but I don&#x27;t expect anything else out of that type of machine</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just defective, but this thing did not work at all!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this, but when I got it, it was broken. I could not get it to work by plugging it in or installing batteries. I was a little disappointed I couldn&#x27;t exchange it for a new one, and now there are none in stock. I&#x27;ve heard great things about this shaker and for now I&#x27;m still stuck shaking my polishes by hand. I&#x27;ll update this review when/if I get a working shaker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I ordered this shaker!  It works great😄. I have a lot of regular and gel polishes that get used rarely, and if shaken for aminute behave as if new.. I have had absolutely no problems with it at all, it performs as advertised.  I would recommend it to anyone when wants the life of their polishes extended.</li>
    <li> This works fine......</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my nail technician. They bought three more for the shop.  woot woot.</li>
    <li> Use it to mix my ejuice - great shaker</li>
    <li> saves my hands from shaking gels and polishes</li>
    <li> I like this; however, I don&#x27;t think it shakes fast enough or enough. I have some nail polishes with quite a bit of glitter and the glitter didn&#x27;t move!! The bottle was on its side for a while and the glitter had floated to one side. I used this shaker and had it there for what seemed like forever and maybe a few pieces of glitter moved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if someone recommends something better. I love nail polish and have too many bottles. I think it&#x27;s good to shake them up once in a while and would rather not manually do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you in advance.</li>
    <li> As a licensed Nail Tech, I am so disappointed! Didn&#x27;t even turn on once! tried both the ac adapter as well as putting in new batteries. Absolutely not Happy!</li>
    <li> Seriously underwhelming.  I was hoping that this would be able to help me mix some of my gel polished and regular polishes that tend to settle better than me trying to mix them by hand.  Although the machine makes a lot of noise and may make you think it&#x27;s working, it did a terrible job.  Even after leaving polishes on the machine for several minutes, switching the direction of the polish, etc., it was far more effective for me to just shake them.  Me shaking them by hand was not only faster but far more effective.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Saves my wrist a lot of pain!!</li>
    <li> Notes out of the box;  * Very nice, low profile footprint design.  * 7 inches long, 5 inches at widest part of the oval, 2.5 inches tall.  * Fits up to .75 oz polishes with all shaped bottle necks (bam! take that iZen Pro!)  * Silver plastic, no idea on solvent resistance (yet).  * Uses both AC adapter or batteries for cordless operation.  * 5600 shakes per minute promises the box and spec detail.  * 3 detachable, adjustable rubber securing straps.  * 1 on/off button, with a lighter pressure &#x27;pulse on&#x27; feature.    Operation:  * Cinch to strap on.  * Pretty impressive agitation for one so wee.  * Noise level mild especially in comparison to my incessant bottle agitation whining. \\&quot;Ow! My arms! Blah, blah, blah.\\&quot; I&#x27;d be more specific, but I was operating it right on a stainless steel counter to put it through the noise test. It&#x27;d be unladylike to compare it to a &#x27;personal massager&#x27; out loud wouldn&#x27;t it? Did I just type that? Oopsy, my bad. Quieter over a mat, silicone, towel or cork tile by miles. I did that too.    Result:  Before had separation, some streaky clearness and clinging pigment near the neck. I gave it my regular human powered roll/tap/roll for the following &#x27;before shaker&#x27; application demo. (See posted pics)    Left, regular human agitation. 5 freaky coats and I had to wrangle dual directions and mucho smoothing in application. I tried really hard to give it more care actually because I wanted to be ungenerous to ForPro. But, human agitation was a streaky, bubbled shrink-back, difficult, wrinkling mess at every application and cure. Just like last time I dared to be decadent. I purposefully used a problem child color of an otherwise fabulous gel polish line. Plus, I left the cleansing paper towel wipes in the photos to demonstrate the horrid vs acceptable cure difference. Like eww! That&#x27;s dangerous. It even wiped off in spots!    Right, ForPro shaken. 3 coats. Application was easy and like normally behaved other vampy, dark, well agitated gel polishes. Say what? I thought I&#x27;d see some improvement, but I didn&#x27;t really expect this great of one. The color is wearable and I like it now.    All things are equal in my test, except I was more careful in application of the human shaken swatch, which has 2 more coats for a subpar, unusable result. I had to, it was having a tantrum in streaky pants before ForPro.    Other notes:  ForPro requires a phillips head screwdriver to open the 4 AA battery housing. Probably because it shakes so much? Still, a nice cordless option to the AC adapter also included. Yay that. *Batteries not included.    And, I think any warranty would be online via ForPro website only? This didn&#x27;t come with instructions or warranty card in the box. Mostly a no-brainer plug and play.    It&#x27;s unscathed by alcohol meaning any gel polish mishaps can wipe right off. I blotted the underbelly to remove dust lightly.    Clear rubber feet stay put while leaving no marks. That&#x27;s awesome. Especially compared to Robarts that jiggle off tables and sound like landscaping machines.    I like ForPro so far. I think it saves product and my shake stress physiology. Prettier result in fewer, easier coats :).    It did a good job on both a chunky glitter and a streak-prone frost in a conventional lacquer brand. I did shake them once to break surface tension first though. I also rotated the bottles and let them shake twice. The beads were rolling free in both and additive distribution was even and good after. Thanks ForPro! Please last an eon now.</li>
    <li> Worked once, then quit.  Put batteries in and it worked again, but when the power cord was plugged in, it cut the power off.  Something is wrong with either the power cord, or the plug on the shaker.  This is the 2nd one that has done this exact same thing.</li>
    <li> I own several hundred bottles of nail polish and was excited to shake some new life into a few of the older ones. Over the course of a couple days the shaker worked fairly well for the first 50 or so polishes and then the motor slowly died. It got slower and slower and then just stopped shaking all together. Not worth the money for the time it lasted.</li>
    <li> Shocking product. Broke when arrived. Fiddled about with it, got it working for about 3 days now broke again.. Sending it back which is a hassle cause USA but not worth anything. Very cheap and nasty..</li>
    <li> Simple but gets the job done and cheap enough.</li>
    <li> The best ever for gel polish, love it!</li>
    <li> Bought it for the nail salon. It doesnt work that well. I would recommend the opi shaker better</li>
    <li> so far so good. I injured my wrist really bad and it has made simple tasks difficult. So when I want to do my nails and my polish needs a little shake-up I pop it into this Shaker and let in ride for 30 second intervals depending on how settled the polish is :-)  It also makes mixing your own tints and colors easy (adding eye shadow to clear polish).</li>
    <li> Lucky to give it one star.... Maybe the unit was defective, because the on/off button didn&#x27;t work, the unit ran on 2 batteries vs 4 and stayed on when plugged in with ac/dc adapter.  On the other hand Amazon was excellent (5stars+++) in the return process</li>
    <li> Very displeased with this. The directions say to shake the polish for around 20 seconds, but that had nearly no effect on a settled glitter polish. After running it for about 2 minutes it did OK. An hour later I tried a 2nd bottle and the machine smelled like burning plastic, then quit working altogether. Returned; I didn&#x27;t like it well enough to get it exchanged.</li>
    <li> The one I received doesn&#x27;t turn on with the provided adapter or with batteries.</li>
    <li> Sparks fly from outlet when plugging in this item. Returning for refund.</li>
    <li> This sucks! I tested with a polish that had been sitting for a while. After all, I&#x27;m capable of giving a few arm shakes of a polish that&#x27;s already fairly well mixed. I bought this specifically for polish that needs some extra help. Does not do the job. It&#x27;s more quiet than some and has little rubber feet so it doesn&#x27;t slide everywhere (but still moves a little). Wouldn&#x27;t recommend, wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. After trying several bottles, I donated it so someone else could try it.</li>
    <li> First one received would not work with cord only battery. So I returned it, returned was processed quickly. Received second worked just not a great mixer unfortunately. Just not powerful enough. Ended up getting tattoo ink mixer. Works much better</li>
