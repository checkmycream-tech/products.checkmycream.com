### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for men who want a low-maintenance hairstyle.</li>
      <li>But the best thing is the smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But again, the best thing is the smell.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great for finishing things off, and taming fly aways.</li>
      <li>The smell is great - not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Great shine, no residue, smells woodsy and herbal.</li>
      <li>Keeps my curls in good form throughout the day without getting too crispy.</li>
      <li>I got this since it says that it is good for longer hair.  </li>
      <li>so it tends to curl my hair, however it provides a good control</li>
      <li>I have had strangers comment on how good it smells.</li>
      <li>The product does good work but the smell is gagging.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing and smells good - even though it&#x27;s meant for men.</li>
      <li>He is the kind of guy that tells me &#x27;cheaper brands are just as good,&#x27; EXCEPT for this one product.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much perfect.</li>
      <li>I like the way it smells, so I started using it on my own fly-aways.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t smell the product before you buy it, it is your own fault.</li>
      <li>It also decided to delude itself in my hands, instead of in my hair, so that all of the nice oils or whatever were stuck on my fingertips.  </li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
      <li>Anyway, if you like the scent, you will love this product.</li>
      <li>This product does have a very strong, unique smell.  </li>
      <li>Also - if you are a man who likes to use cologne - you will never be able to with this strong scent as it overpowers everything.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably best for really dry hair.</li>
      <li>It does not grease up your hair and washes out easily, like you didn&#x27;t had it at all.</li>
      <li>but it is way, way too strong.</li>
      <li>It has a strong smell and is too oily</li>
      <li>Smell is strong.  </li>
      <li>Manly, but not like a strong cologne.</li>
      <li>Gives just the right amount of texture to fine hair.</li>
      <li>Gives a nice natural look.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;And the next time you go to the dentist, the hygienists may remark about how good your hair smells.</li>
      <li>The most important part for me was that ingredients are all natural.</li>
      <li>Overall a really nice product.</li>
      <li>My husband has really thick wavy hair - perfect hair really.  </li>
      <li>&gt; If you are looking to style your hair the most natural possible without too much effort this product may be for you, me i still like more the gastby pomades, but this product its really good when you dont have too much time and want a natural look.</li>
      <li>It gives an after-shower texture similar to when the hair hasn&#x27;t been washed for a day or two and is lookin mighty fine.</li>
      <li>Great control for those of us with frizzy or hard to manage hair.</li>
      <li>First the smell:</li>
      <li>When I went to use it the first time, I realized the smell was from this stuff.  </li>
      <li>First, lets talk about the texture: it looks, like cum.  </li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s like 10x better than American Crews.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It also managed to make my hair extremely greasy without giving any kind of maneuverability to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t believe all the negative comments about this great product.  </li>
      <li>This product reduces frizz and promotoes smoothness of longer hair while leaving it looking natural and clean.</li>
      <li>The product is oily, I believe it is better suited for people with dry hair.</li>
      <li>It is very overpowering.</li>
      <li>Now, the price I would say, is reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Apply to wet hair and blow dry immediately, or let it set in your hair for an hour or so then just brush out (perfect for men with a long commute).</li>
      <li>My fella has long hair and bought this pomade to smooth his frizz.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second the perfomance: Its a liquid pomade more easy to use and faster than American Crew or any other solid pomade, it does stay and manages to add volume to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for when I curl my hair or pull it back or for the little hairs that stick up after I flat iron it.  </li>
      <li>Now, after applying it in as many different ways as I could think of, it still never really held</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a female, with very curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I had in the past problem with dandruff, but since I started to use this Aveda product it never appeared and my hair looks and feels strong.</li>
      <li>For shorter hair, it can be used for a classic, combed back look that doesn&#x27;t appear greasy like Brill cream does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care about the smell as long the item works as i expected but for those wondering about the fragance of this pomade, let me tell you it smell like those products for cleaning wood furnishing something strong and pungent, but the smell goes away in less than a hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used a variety of amounts, from barely any, to a quarter sized amount, and it still made my hair crust.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old male.</li>
      <li>Really helps to weigh them down and reduces curl shrinkage.</li>
      <li>Not too sticky or oily - it&#x27;s very difficult to screw up the application - and has a mild, clean fragrance that won&#x27;t compete with any cologne or aftershave.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something that would add a little weight to my hair but this really was too oily.  </li>

<li> Last a long time..</li>
<li> It was expensive, I had to go aaaaall the way down to the mall to find it, it smells so very strong, my eyes started watering.  </li>
<li> This is the only hair product I will use and I am not a particularly meticulously groomed man.</li>
<li> You never get those little white specks in your hair like with the American Crew wax</li>
<li> SO much less price than my local Salon.</li>
<li> It smelled like a tree came in my hair, and not a pretty smelling tree.  </li>
<li> It is extremely fragrant.  </li>
<li> I had to wet my hair down at work three times to get my hair in check.</li>
<li> It dried out in about 10 minutes, and then left my hair as stiff as a board.  </li>
<li> The difference is, I would trade 5 months worth of this crap, for 2 weeks of american crew, any day.</li>
<li> I have read previous reviews and everyone is complaining about the scent.</li>
<li> I know that&#x27;s not relevant to</li>
<li> I really miss Redken&#x27;s Liquid Pomade, too bad they stopped making it.</li>
<li> I use every morning and it lasts at least through the late afternoon.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had people come by my office late in the day asking what cologne I was wearing, and I don&#x27;t wear cologne.  </li>
<li> I mean, 6.7 oz for about 22 bucks</li>
<li> That is absolutely ridiculous.</li>
<li> A little weird but flattering.</li>
<li> I hate to think what people who sit next to one would do if you wore this to church or the symphony.</li>
<li> I thought the smell was some other crap my hair dresser put on me.  </li>
<li> The scent itself isn&#x27;t bad</li>
<li> I must say, this product was just awful.  </li>

    <li> It has a strong smell and is too oily so it tends to curl my hair, however it provides a good control</li>
    <li> The product does good work but the smell is gagging.  It smells like you were outside and got way too close to a campfire -- well, and people look at you like you stink when you walk by them.  Also - if you are a man who likes to use cologne - you will never be able to with this strong scent as it overpowers everything.  I hate to think what people who sit next to one would do if you wore this to church or the symphony.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Gives a nice natural look.  I purchased this at the salon I go to.  I thought the smell was some other crap my hair dresser put on me.  When I went to use it the first time, I realized the smell was from this stuff.  It is extremely fragrant.  I&#x27;ve had people come by my office late in the day asking what cologne I was wearing, and I don&#x27;t wear cologne.  It is very overpowering.</li>
    <li> Smell is an issue for me</li>
    <li> My fella has long hair and bought this pomade to smooth his frizz. I like the way it smells, so I started using it on my own fly-aways. It&#x27;s great for when I curl my hair or pull it back or for the little hairs that stick up after I flat iron it.  Great shine, no residue, smells woodsy and herbal. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair crispy like spray or greasy like wax. Pretty much perfect.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t believe all the negative comments about this great product.  My husband has really thick wavy hair - perfect hair really.  He is the kind of guy that tells me &#x27;cheaper brands are just as good,&#x27; EXCEPT for this one product.  He LOVES this Aveda Pomade and prefers it over all others.  The smell is great - not overpowering.  He uses Head and Shoulders shampoo, then this product and has no problem with flaking.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This product reduces frizz and promotoes smoothness of longer hair while leaving it looking natural and clean. It gives an after-shower texture similar to when the hair hasn&#x27;t been washed for a day or two and is lookin mighty fine.

Which may be micro-creepy but its her world so I just go with it.</li>
    <li> SO much less price than my local Salon. Thanks!</li>

    <li> Perfect for men who want a low-maintenance hairstyle. I use every morning and it lasts at least through the late afternoon. Apply to wet hair and blow dry immediately, or let it set in your hair for an hour or so then just brush out (perfect for men with a long commute). Not too sticky or oily - it&#x27;s very difficult to screw up the application - and has a mild, clean fragrance that won&#x27;t compete with any cologne or aftershave. Overall a really nice product.</li>
    <li> Smell is strong.  I got this since it says that it is good for longer hair.  Nah.  I can not tell that it did anything for my hair.  As an afterthought, I remember that the seal was broken cleanly too.  It did not hold or keep my hair in control.  It actually felt like it is a serum to make my hair shinier but flowing with no control.  I looked like I rolled out of bed after a wind storm came through.  I had to wet my hair down at work three times to get my hair in check.</li>
    <li> I must say, this product was just awful.  It was expensive, I had to go aaaaall the way down to the mall to find it, it smells so very strong, my eyes started watering.  First, lets talk about the texture: it looks, like cum.  I know that&#x27;s not relevant to it&#x27;s quality, but it&#x27;s something that I thought about the entire time.  It also decided to delude itself in my hands, instead of in my hair, so that all of the nice oils or whatever were stuck on my fingertips.  Next, the smell.  It smelled like a tree came in my hair, and not a pretty smelling tree.  If trees could wear Axe cologne, this pomade is what the smell would smell like.  Now, after applying it in as many different ways as I could think of, it still never really held it&#x27;s form, and then, it crusted.  I used a variety of amounts, from barely any, to a quarter sized amount, and it still made my hair crust.  It dried out in about 10 minutes, and then left my hair as stiff as a board.  It also managed to make my hair extremely greasy without giving any kind of maneuverability to my hair.  Now, the price I would say, is reasonable.  I mean, 6.7 oz for about 22 bucks, that&#x27;s like 10x better than American Crews.  The difference is, I would trade 5 months worth of this crap, for 2 weeks of american crew, any day.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product I will use and I am not a particularly meticulously groomed man. Gives just the right amount of texture to fine hair. But the best thing is the smell. Liquid pomade is just easier to manage than pastes. You never get those little white specks in your hair like with the American Crew wax products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, the best thing is the smell. Manly, but not like a strong cologne. I have had strangers comment on how good it smells. A little weird but flattering.</li>
    <li> This product does have a very strong, unique smell.  I was looking for something that would add a little weight to my hair but this really was too oily.  It&#x27;s probably best for really dry hair.</li>
    <li> Great control for those of us with frizzy or hard to manage hair. A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and smells good - even though it&#x27;s meant for men. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that sometimes it dries my hair out a bit. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great. Keeps my curls in good form throughout the day without getting too crispy. Really helps to weigh them down and reduces curl shrinkage.</li>
    <li> The product is oily, I believe it is better suited for people with dry hair. The scent itself isn&#x27;t bad but it is way, way too strong. Jeeez. I really miss Redken&#x27;s Liquid Pomade, too bad they stopped making it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a 3 years now. I&#x27;m 33 years old male. The most important part for me was that ingredients are all natural. It has a specific scent, so I would suggest to go to the store and smell it before buying. If you like it, like I do, product is terrific. It does not grease up your hair and washes out easily, like you didn&#x27;t had it at all. I had in the past problem with dandruff, but since I started to use this Aveda product it never appeared and my hair looks and feels strong. It feels like bottle lasts forever, and it does. I have read previous reviews and everyone is complaining about the scent. That is absolutely ridiculous. If you don&#x27;t smell the product before you buy it, it is your own fault. Are you going to buy a perfume without smelling it? Anyway, if you like the scent, you will love this product.</li>
    <li> Only thing I use on my hair.. Last a long time..</li>
    <li> One of my fave hair products ever!  Second only to Aveda&#x27;s Pomade.  I&#x27;m a female, with very curly hair.  This stuff works great for finishing things off, and taming fly aways.</li>
