      <li>Putting on a lovely scent should make you feel beautiful, not cranky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this item and would recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Nice item, good quality</li>
      <li>Works  great, and I can enjoy my perfume now.</li>
      <li>So I got this bottle and works nicely.</li>
      <li>It was also nicely boxed and protected with tissue.</li>
      <li>Nice bottle for travel.  </li>
      <li>Came with a funnel too, which was nice</li>
      <li>It was an inch shorter than advertised, but I am pleased with the quality.</li>
      <li>It is much better.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>It works well for what I wanted, so I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I am able to fill it so did not return the product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m returning it for sure</li>
      <li>Now able to use my perfume again.</li>
      <li>I removed the top from my bottle and poured  it in this atomizer.</li>
      <li>the bottle is sturdy and I liked the clean look.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy glass atomizer with good weight to it.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to refill</li>
      <li>then I thought it should be but free shipping offset the cost...</li>
      <li>I ordered this and was able to remove the whole top of my damaged Bulgari and transfer it to this</li>
      <li>Decent price, nice look,</li>
      <li>I got my favorite cologne is a liquid without a sprayer so am really liking this product</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this atomizer a try, though without much hope that it would be better.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a refillable spray bottle for aftershave and this fills that bill nicely, however if you are looking for a really fine spray this isn&#x27;t for you because it definitely has a semi-heavy spray.  </li>
      <li>The glass is heavy and looks good, and the spray is a strong, fine mist.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>The free funnel was not included and the metal cap had a large dent in it upon arrival.  </li>
      <li>It is better than its modest price might suggest, and I expect to use it for years.  </li>
      <li>I actually like this bottle more than the original bottle.</li>
      <li>I recommend this very highly!</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>This was exactly was I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It worked at first</li>
      <li>And when it finally does start to \\&quot;spray\\&quot;, it&#x27;s more like a spit...</li>
      <li>I dropped and broke the first one.  </li>
      <li>and I ordered this atomizer for me use because it is plain and fairly sex neutral.  </li>
      <li>certainly packs some misting power.</li>
      <li>they certainly spray liquids</li>
      <li>Mine included a nice little funnel which i wasn&#x27;t expecting from the product description...</li>
      <li>This thing shoots it out with what seems like pretty high pressure.</li>
      <li>The fault is probably mine for not reading the description more carefully.</li>
      <li>It is a kick I am on and was glad to get the empty bottles.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Works really well.  </li>
      <li>With this we can simply fill our own atomizer with the scent of our choice and since the bottle is clear we can see at a glance how much is left.  </li>
      <li>and now I have my whole new bottle again.  </li>
      <li>Recently broke my cologne bottle and need a quick solution.</li>
      <li>Thought I might have put the top on too tight...</li>
      <li>Works very well, only problem is when taking the cap off the spritzer top comes off with it a little.</li>
      <li>but I am glad I thought to order a small funnel to transfer the perfume from a non-spray bottle to this atomizer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After the first night that this had perfume in it, I took off the cap to find that the inside of cap and entire metal looking (it&#x27;s plastic)</li>
      <li>It probably cost a little too much, but it does beat wasting a hundred bucks worth of perfume.</li>
      <li>i was pleasantly surprised at the weight of this bottle.  </li>
      <li>It even came with a tiny funnel, which worked very well and an eyedropper style syringe for transferring your colognes.</li>
      <li>It works well and is fairly easy to fill with either the small funnel or the eyedropper that comes with it.  </li>
      <li>This is a very sensible alternative to expensive packaging, and after all the packaging often costs more than the product.  </li>
      <li>Pour slowly and you will do fine.</li>
      <li>You will need a pretty steady hand to fill because the funnel is small.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter, after she had broken the pump spray that was attached to her favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>It was easy to transfer some of the cologne to this atomizer, using the long dropper and small funnel provided.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works really great I got my favorite cologne is a liquid without a sprayer so am really liking this product</li>
    <li> I broke a perfume bottle and was unable to use it. Purchased this refillable bottle. Now able to use my perfume again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice atomizer.  The glass is heavy and looks good, and the spray is a strong, fine mist.  I bought cologne which came only in a &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; version, which I dislike, so I bought this atomizer for it.  It was easy to transfer some of the cologne to this atomizer, using the long dropper and small funnel provided.  I am very pleased with this item and would recommend it.  It is better than its modest price might suggest, and I expect to use it for years.  It was also nicely boxed and protected with tissue.</li>
    <li> I am a man and I ordered this atomizer for me use because it is plain and fairly sex neutral.  What I received was a completely different atomizer that is round, scalloped, and very feminine.  I cannot believe that the seller (Crystals And Trinkets) would bait and switch so blatantly.  I&#x27;m returning it for sure and I will be careful buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Bought this Item. It worked at first but now it will hardly spray. This was after only about 40 times of using it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a refillable spray bottle for aftershave and this fills that bill nicely, however if you are looking for a really fine spray this isn&#x27;t for you because it definitely has a semi-heavy spray.  It works well for what I wanted, so I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This product started out working wonderfully.  the bottle is sturdy and I liked the clean look. After a couple days, the sprayer stopped working.  I tried everything and it just does not want to spray.  Would not recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> Made a non-working bottle of cologne useable again!</li>
    <li> Works but no funnel included. Wasted a lot of expensive cologne trying to fill it.</li>
    <li> Recently broke my cologne bottle and need a quick solution. This bottle works great and comes with a funnel and dropper to transfer.</li>
    <li> Purfect... Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> they certainly spray liquids</li>
    <li> good.  as expected.  thanks</li>
    <li> Works really well.  You will need a pretty steady hand to fill because the funnel is small.  Pour slowly and you will do fine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we needed.</li>
    <li> This product was just what I needed, at a good price. I had a bottle of perfume that my son brought me back from France that the sprayer had quit working. I removed the top from my bottle and poured  it in this atomizer. Works  great, and I can enjoy my perfume now.</li>
    <li> It was an inch shorter than advertised, but I am pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> Works great, though (as others have noted) it gives a generous spray so you might have to scale down from the number of sprays you used to use with another bottle.</li>
    <li> Decent price, nice look, big bottle&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is the sprayer sometimes locks up or doesn&#x27;t spray- just takes some patience to use</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Poured perfume from another bottle into this one because the squeeze atomizer was broken. Easy to hold, works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Just what was needed for my homemade perfume.  It is a kick I am on and was glad to get the empty bottles.</li>
    <li> I had a perfume bottle that quit working so I thought that I would transfer the perfume to this.  I actually like this bottle more than the original bottle.</li>
    <li> I order a lot of colognes made of essential oils, but the spray bottles they come in leave a lot to be desired. Either the spray head gets clogged or the tubing doesn&#x27;t seem to quite reach the perfume in the bottle.  Putting on a lovely scent should make you feel beautiful, not cranky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I&#x27;d give this atomizer a try, though without much hope that it would be better.  But yea! It is much better. It&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Pretty&lt;br /&gt;**Heavy enough to withstand breakage, even when dropped on a tile floor&lt;br /&gt;**And the sprayer sprays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered a 2nd one and will order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.11.14  Update:  After some use, and a knock to the floor, the sprayer head got stuck, and now it&#x27;s un-usable, so I&#x27;ve down-graded it from 5 stars to 3.</li>
    <li> I put my slash on colognes in it cause I would rather spritz than splash...  A little more expensive then I thought it should be but free shipping offset the cost... Mine included a nice little funnel which i wasn&#x27;t expecting from the product description... Guess I missed that in the write up..</li>
    <li> Works very well, only problem is when taking the cap off the spritzer top comes off with it a little. Came with a funnel too, which was nice</li>
    <li> i was pleasantly surprised at the weight of this bottle.  it sprays well.  all in all, very happy that i purchased it.  thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a very sensible alternative to expensive packaging, and after all the packaging often costs more than the product.  With this we can simply fill our own atomizer with the scent of our choice and since the bottle is clear we can see at a glance how much is left.  I recommend this very highly!</li>
    <li> Nice bottle for travel.  Sprays easily...comes with plastic squeeze tube for filling instead of a funnel</li>
    <li> Very sturdy glass atomizer with good weight to it. I would definitely say it feels like a quality perfume bottle. It is a very nice size and the sprayer on it certainly packs some misting power. Though, I would prefer the mist come out in a wider pattern instead of what it does. This thing shoots it out with what seems like pretty high pressure. Not a big deal, just hold it a little further from your face... Have used both cologne and preshave liquid in this atomizer with great results. I wouldn&#x27;t have any problem recommending this sprayer.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this bottle.  I put a perfume from pour bottle, which I seem to have trouble with.  I&#x27;ve had three different lids to pour bottles come loose and lost the fragrance.  So I got this bottle and works nicely.</li>
    <li> Nice item, good quality but I am glad I thought to order a small funnel to transfer the perfume from a non-spray bottle to this atomizer.</li>
    <li> Perfect size.  Easy to refill</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, after she had broken the pump spray that was attached to her favorite perfume. It works fantastically, and she did not need to replace the perfume.</li>
    <li> The free funnel was not included and the metal cap had a large dent in it upon arrival.  While I will be able to use this, I was disappointed in the condition and lack of funnel.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Great design and durable.</li>
    <li> I did receive the product, however the package did not contain the funnel for refilling the bottle.  I am able to fill it so did not return the product.  If you would like to send the funnel that would be great.</li>
    <li> Although the glass container is hefty / solid, the sprayer and cap are terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first night that this had perfume in it, I took off the cap to find that the inside of cap and entire metal looking (it&#x27;s plastic) piece was covered in perfume.  Thought I might have put the top on too tight... so I decided to only put the cap on halfway the next night.  However, this still resulted in perfume somehow covering everything that was under the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided I&#x27;d just ignore the cap after that... don&#x27;t plan to travel with this bottle, so figured I could just leave the cap off at all times, and still use the bottle.  However, the sprayer on this bottle doesn&#x27;t work well at all either.  It has to be \\&quot;primed\\&quot; with a few pumps before it releases any perfume.  And when it finally does start to \\&quot;spray\\&quot;, it&#x27;s more like a spit... there is no horizontal stream or spray coming out... basically small droplets of perfume just fall out.  You will have to use gravity to get the perfume to fall where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> It even came with a tiny funnel, which worked very well and an eyedropper style syringe for transferring your colognes.</li>
    <li> Photo is misleading. It shows what seem to be two bottles. This is what I wanted. In fact, it is showing one bottle, with and without the cap. The fault is probably mine for not reading the description more carefully. At the same time, the photo invites misinterpretation. I am annoyed with myself, and with the vendor and Amazon.</li>
    <li> This was exactly was I was looking for. I use it for a room spray and linen spray made of essential oils.  Perfect size and works well.</li>
    <li> This bottle does the job of replacing a perfume bottle with a broken atomizer.  It probably cost a little too much, but it does beat wasting a hundred bucks worth of perfume.</li>
    <li> This bottle saved my $100 bottle of Bulgari which the sprayer broke and I could get perfume out of it.  I ordered this and was able to remove the whole top of my damaged Bulgari and transfer it to this and now I have my whole new bottle again.  I love this.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought.  I dropped and broke the first one.  It works well and is fairly easy to fill with either the small funnel or the eyedropper that comes with it.  I&#x27;d buy a third if I broke this one.</li>
    <li> Just what i need,Great</li>
