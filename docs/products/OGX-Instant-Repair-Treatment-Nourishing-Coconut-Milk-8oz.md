      <li>Great product but many of our local stores don&#x27;t have it in stock.</li>
      <li>It may be a bit to strong for some people though.</li>
      <li>I am a fan of Nexxus products, but I must admit, I have never been so pleased to find an inexpensive product that can absolutely stand on its own up against the leading brands.</li>
      <li>The product is really cool, and I love the smell.</li>
      <li>Rinses easily and  a light cream consistency.  </li>
      <li>Great for those with frizzy, damage or/and dry hair plus the smell will attract many.</li>
      <li>This is a great deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>buy one get one free, I bought the rest of the coconut milk shampoo,conditioner and anti-breakage formulas on the shelf.</li>
      <li>Thanks Organix!!!</li>
      <li>so I was excited to try out this product.</li>
      <li>My hair is natural, it is ok, but nothing special, I like 10 better.</li>
      <li>I get more positive attention from this than my $65&amp;amp;up perfumes.</li>
      <li>I chose one star because there is nothing special about this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I use this on my beard and my beard became much more full and the hair became much stronger and healthier in just one week.</li>
      <li>Bought this product 2 years ago,  it sat around, finally used it and loved it.  </li>
      <li>it was still soft and still smelled like coconuts which was nice.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it really helped my damaged hair.</li>
      <li>The smell is good but the effect on my hair is not obvious.</li>
      <li>This product keeps my hair super moisturized.</li>
      <li>Could not find in a store but was lucky to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This makes my hair feel healthy, very soft and hydrated and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good product, beside the fact that it has really strong coconut smell, which I can&#x27;t stand few mins after I put it on.</li>
      <li>I must admit when these products first came out, each time I&#x27;d walk by them and think \\&quot;coconut-milk\\&quot;--right!...</li>
      <li>I use the entire Organis nourishing coconut milk products and they are amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s weighless as they claim and really makes your hair healthier and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I can just tell the difference in my hair when I apply it in my hair daily because it also makes my hair so manageable and gives it a nice luster--not greasy-shiney at all.</li>
      <li>but if I left it on for an hour it would make my hair feel nice.</li>
      <li>I have used this product on my hair and it made it feel softer and look more alive.  </li>
      <li>This product is really worth a try.</li>
      <li>I would recommend for this product for anyone who have damage hair, or dry hair ...........makes my hair very healthy</li>
      <li>You notice the differenc right after the first time.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of the Organix Coconut Milk and keep trying different products.  </li>
      <li>Okay, knowing that my hair is a 4c, I thought I would give this product a try, using it primarily as a deep conditioner and or leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair the daily moisture it needs and gives it shine and restores a healthy looking curl.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Organix Coconut products, especially this one.  </li>
      <li>I most likely will not be buying this again</li>
      <li>It did nothing more then a regular hair conditioner would do.</li>
      <li>I think its a great deep conditioner and recommend it to anyone with hair like mine or for someone who just has dry hair.</li>
      <li>I love using this right after I straighten my hair because it becomes dry afterward.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m excited to see what a few more treatments will do.</li>
      <li>I used large amount but still got my hair unsmoothy.</li>
      <li>A little more money but worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells amazing...love this product</li>
    <li> Great product but many of our local stores don&#x27;t have it in stock. I hope the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t discontinue this product. It moisturizes my hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Useful for everyday use and not to heavy for your hair styles. This product smells great also and not greasy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I like it - but this is the third time I&#x27;ve bought it - I like it, but the quantity in the container is low.</li>
    <li> This product is really worth a try. It&#x27;s weighless as they claim and really makes your hair healthier and smooth.  You notice the differenc right after the first time. I also have the shampoo, hair conditioner and leave in.</li>
    <li> This is a great deep conditioner. I&#x27;ve been trying to switch to organic products and this one is the best. It smells amazing and really smooths my thick coarse hair. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I was very happy once this product came in the mail. I absolutely love anything coconut so this was perfect for me. Once I opened up the product I immediately smelled the coconut which was great. It may be a bit to strong for some people though. I evenly applied the product to my hair and left it on for about 5 minutes. I rinsed it out and my hair was very soft. Once I dried my hair it was still soft and still smelled like coconuts which was nice. My hair is naturally curly, frizzy, thick, and dry. My only cons with this product is that I don&#x27;t really like the container it&#x27;s in and how the product seems a bit watered down. I wish the product was a little bit thicker. All in all I think its a great deep conditioner and recommend it to anyone with hair like mine or for someone who just has dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, kinky, dry and frizzy African hair and I was never happy with any product until I tried this. It gives my hair the daily moisture it needs and gives it shine and restores a healthy looking curl. The bonus is that I get compliments on how my hair looks now, which never happened before, and how my hair smells great! I ordered two jars of this because I never want to run out of it. I think I&#x27;ll start using the shampoo and conditioner from this product line as well since I am so satisfied with the treatment.</li>
    <li> Great for those with frizzy, damage or/and dry hair plus the smell will attract many.I get more positive attention from this than my $65&amp;amp;up perfumes.All their products are great but this particular 1 is the best!Hard to find in stores and cheaper to find on Amazon even after shipping prices.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on my hair and it made it feel softer and look more alive.  It did not appear to frieze.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner and hair treatment. After one application, you can feel the difference on your hair texture. It leaves the hair manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this.  I read the reviews and thought it&#x27;d help my thin, color-damaged hair, but I&#x27;ve found that my Aussie Deep Conditioner has had more luck (despite making my scalp greasy) than this has.  It does little to \\&quot;deep condition\\&quot; your hair, and when you&#x27;re done the results aren&#x27;t that different from a bargain brand conditioner.  I&#x27;m looking into mayonnaise/castor oil/vegetable glycerin treatments soon since I&#x27;m not happy with the chemical heavy products on the market, but I&#x27;m also not pleased with the so-called \\&quot;alernatives\\&quot; so far either.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with Ogx instant repair treatment. It completely dried my hair out. I bought this product hoping it would help to &amp;#34;nourish&amp;#34; my hair. Many of their other products have done wonders to my hair so I was excited to try out this product. After using this product, my hair was extremely frizzy and course. Much worse than what it was before using the product. I will never purchase this product again</li>
    <li> I am an African-American with thick hair. This makes my hair feel healthy, very soft and hydrated and overtime I can see my hair looks healthy and is healthier. I love all Organix products. I use most of them!</li>
    <li> I am not sure about the reviews saying this product is \\&quot;thin\\&quot; textured; my product is like thick custard and it really moisturizes! I love it and love using it as a mask in the shower; sometimes I leave it on for 10 minutes! The smell is wonderful and it really adds strength as well. I use it with the shampoo, on and off with the Organix Brazilian Keratin Therapy system ( I love them both)! GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it really helped my damaged hair. I will make sure I always have it on hand. The shipping was good too.</li>
    <li> Bought this product 2 years ago,  it sat around, finally used it and loved it.  Could not find in a store but was lucky to find it on Amazon.  Was not the same.  Not as&lt;br /&gt;thick.  Did not condition my hair as expected.  Tried It&#x27;s a Ten Hair Mask and whao, what a difference.  No more snarls and dryness.  A little more money but worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this on my beard and my beard became much more full and the hair became much stronger and healthier in just one week.</li>
    <li> I love these product. Leaves hair very shiny. It is hard to find at the store.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Organix Coconut products, especially this one.  I&#x27;ve been using it as gel to lie my thin edges down, and they have thickened tremendously.  And it smells great, of course.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!! I am a fan of Nexxus products, but I must admit, I have never been so pleased to find an inexpensive product that can absolutely stand on its own up against the leading brands. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I absolutely have seen improvements in my hair. The shampoo, conditioner and self-heating oil made my hair sooo soft that I was afraid that I had used too much; my hair curled up in beautiful ringlets, the texture--just fabulously soft. The anti-breakage formula seems to make other products on my hair work better. I can just tell the difference in my hair when I apply it in my hair daily because it also makes my hair so manageable and gives it a nice luster--not greasy-shiney at all. I was so pleased with these products my local Vons had a sale--buy one get one free, I bought the rest of the coconut milk shampoo,conditioner and anti-breakage formulas on the shelf. Since Vons does not carry the self-heating oil, I drove over to my local CVS and bought 3 bottles of it. When I got home I went online here to amazon.com to order the rest of the coconut milk line. I must admit when these products first came out, each time I&#x27;d walk by them and think \\&quot;coconut-milk\\&quot;--right!...I bet they only give you just a drop;I&#x27;m not wasting my money!!\\&quot; Boy, Was I surprised! Thanks Organix!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product that  nourishes the hair shaft and builds body.  Wonderful  coconut smell.Rinses easily and  a light cream consistency.  Great price.</li>
    <li> It seems to make my hair some what softer, I do love the smell. I hope that I continue to see a improvement.</li>
    <li> After seeing several of my fave beauty gurus online mention Coconut Milk, I stumbled upon another fashion blogger who explicitly mentioned this product that has helped her maintain her 3b/3a hair. Okay, knowing that my hair is a 4c, I thought I would give this product a try, using it primarily as a deep conditioner and or leave-in conditioner. LOVE LOVE the smell of this product but the consistency of this product put me off. It was very liquid-y (moreso than I would anticipate for something that is &amp;#34;milk&amp;#34; based). I do not use this product everyday but when I do I love the way it smells and how weightless it feels on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but it also hasn&#x27;t really done anything to improve the condition of my hair. Since purchasing this item, I am now half way done with this milk product but I am not too sure if I would buy it again?? It just smells and feels great but I don&#x27;t really believe it actually has help grow my hair or improve the condition of my hair or strengthen it, but thats just me &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> nice smell and I tried it three times but I thonk my hair is not responding to this treatment,,may be I need sthg stronger</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use, has a great smell and it did wonders for my summer hair. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> The coconut smell was great and the product worked fine. It did nothing more then a regular hair conditioner would do. Not a bad product, but not a great one. My kids love the coconut shampoo.</li>
    <li> The smell is good but the effect on my hair is not obvious. I used large amount but still got my hair unsmoothy.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to say something about this treatment because it seems to have worked a miracle on my frizzy, dry, curly hair, and I&#x27;ve only used it once! I got compliments from two different people the day after I used it and they both noted how shiny my hair looked and how the curls were defined and voluminous. Totally made my day. My hair does feel softer after that one use and I&#x27;m excited to see what a few more treatments will do. I followed the recommendations on the jar (combed the cream in and wrapped up my hair in a shower cap for a few minutes) and will try a longer treatment period next. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Normally I use the regular shampoo and conditioner for this line. I also use the macadamia nut deep conditioner. I thought I would try this instead. The results were not to my expectations. My hair was not as soft as when I use the macadamia nut product. It did smell very nice and was shiny though.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I put it in my dry hair before a shower and leave it in as long as I can. Follow that with a shampoo and conditioner and my hair is silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I really like the OGX coconut milk products. I was a little disappointed with this one. It was not the best daily conditioner but if I left it on for an hour it would make my hair feel nice. I do think that this product goes well with the regular coconut milk conditioner OGX has. I most likely will not be buying this again but I will use it up.</li>
    <li> I love using this right after I straighten my hair because it becomes dry afterward. This restores the softness and moisture and fixes the damage the heat has caused. I&#x27;m so glad I found something that actually works and isn&#x27;t crazy expensive.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this product . makes your hair silky and smell amazing. highly recommended. you wont be disappointed. thanks</li>
    <li> Love the coconut milk products they burnish your hair wonderfully and used with the shampoo and conditioner it works very well</li>
    <li> Works for softening and rejuvenating coarse hair. Should let it sit for a long time though for best results. Very good, not a miracle, and I wish it were heavier and creamier because it leaves my hair too bouncy when I rinse it out.</li>
    <li> I chose one star because there is nothing special about this conditioner. It is definitely not an instant repair &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s labeled. It&#x27;s no different than any other conditioner. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this repair conditioner, I use it all the time, it makes my hair so shiny &amp; silky smooth. It smells great &amp; it goes great with the coconut shampoo &amp; conditioner!!1</li>
    <li> I was scared to use the coconut milk regular/nourishing conditioner because of the reviews so I tried this one (instant repair) instead.....I loved it, it made my hair really soft and moisturized, and I have thick THICK and dry hair, and to smelled so good to me ,this has helped my hair alot and I plan on ordering some more of this as well near the future!!!</li>
    <li> This product keeps my hair super moisturized. Honestly, it is one of the best (and quickest) deep conditioners on the market. I just wish it was a larger size!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I have thick curly hair and it leaves my hair smooth. I use the entire Organis nourishing coconut milk products and they are amazing.</li>
    <li> great conditioner I use this  in my hair and sit under the dryer it leave my hair very soft. great product</li>
    <li> I would recommend for this product for anyone who have damage hair, or dry hair ...........makes my hair very healthy</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to use heat , I put this stuff in my hair Put a shopping bag on my head a left it on for about a hour and it made my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair smell and feel soft...you cant use it a lot or your whole head or youll be out of it in a week. Ide compare it to herbal essences blue moisture coconut shampoo..</li>
    <li> It is very watery and I don&#x27;t see any impact from using it - not sure if it actually works. It smells really good but not sure it does much beyond that.</li>
    <li> The product is really cool, and I love the smell. I have greasy hair and it works ok. I recommend for this kind of hair.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the Organix Coconut Milk and keep trying different products.  Unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t work on my hair.  It leaves my hair smelling good, but the texture of my hair is always course after I use it.  Do not recommend for long fine hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product due to the other great experiences I have had with OGX coconut milk products.  Needless to say I was quite disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t give the nourishing repair as what was expected, more like a general basic conditioner. A positive is that it smells beyond amazing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product, beside the fact that it has really strong coconut smell, which I can&#x27;t stand few mins after I put it on.</li>
    <li> My hair is natural, it is ok, but nothing special, I like 10 better.</li>
