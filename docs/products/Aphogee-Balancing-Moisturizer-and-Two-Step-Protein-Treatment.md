      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>its Amazing.</li>

      <li>The bleach worked beautifully in getting my hair white....as well as frying it and making it super brittle.</li>
      <li>i am so thankful i found this product i put it in today but before thne i had read many reviews saying you will wash it out and your hair will feel better!</li>
      <li>and this is the best protein treatment I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
      <li>I follow up with step 2 which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft and smelling wonderful.</li>
      <li>Please please please, make sure this product is what your hair needs, this is a very strong protein treatment that may not be needed for your hair type.</li>
      <li>I heard a lot of great reviews about this product and at first I always wondered what was it.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite hair care products.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s going to be okay.</li>
      <li>Not a chemical smell but maybe more like a &amp;#34;rotten vitamin-e&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I recommend this product but don&#x27;t use it more then once</li>
      <li>It mostly affected my ends, so I had them cut off.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair feeling great!</li>
      <li>I love this product and ordered the curl moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This treatment can save your hair if you&#x27;ve bleached it or otherwise abused it, as I have done many times.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s going to be okay.</li>
      <li>Ok peeps</li>
      <li>It made a BIG DIFFERENCE in my hair, in a very wonderful way.</li>
      <li>My hair does feel much better.  </li>
      <li>I used the product on my hair and it miraculously made it silky smooth, and gave it movement!</li>
      <li>I will be buying a bigger bottle I love it!!! :)</li>
      <li>Ordered this on prime and got it really fast, which is good because my hair needed immediate rescue.</li>
      <li>The shipping was good and fast also.</li>
      <li>but it was really easy and helped my hair improve</li>
      <li>Do NOT use this too often, it&#x27;s strong and will leave your hair feeling brittle.</li>
      <li>Since its strong I&#x27;m going to use this once a year.</li>
      <li>My hair has been through highlights and hair color before and was fine</li>
      <li>Great product to have on hand, especially if you bleach or relax your hair.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s important to follow the directions completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did more research on it and how to exactly use it which I found out through YouTube.</li>
      <li>I knew the bleach would do significant damage</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s full</li>
      <li>I love it so much it works just like they said it would.</li>
      <li>I love apogee hair care products thanks to the 2 step protein treatment and the balancing mosturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been cool with doing risky things with my hair.</li>
      <li>Ummmmmm, im straight bald in the top of my head, after using this.  </li>
      <li>Do not use Apoghee more than once every six weeks or so because too much protein can make hair brittle.  </li>
      <li>I rate this 4 stars because the seller should fully inform the buyer how to adequately use it.</li>
      <li>so my hair is super curly.</li>
      <li>My hair felt great after I washed it out, but it feels that way after my normal deep conditioning sessions.</li>
      <li>My hair came out lovely, soft and full of strength.</li>
      <li>This product made a significant difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>Bleached hair needs this stuff about once a week - it takes some time to do the 2 steps but it well worth it to have my hair not breaking off like straw.</li>
      <li>The deep conditioning doesn&#x27;t do so much to treat as it adds more moisture and makes it feel healthy once again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now add the fact that I bleached my curly locks &amp; put blue dye in it &amp; you have the perfect mess of hair on earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very watery and gets sticky QUICK so prepare to have it everywhere and be sticking to yourself until it dries and you shower.  </li>
      <li>I am a fine haired natural, just using this treatment for the first time, and my hair absorbed it like a dream.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smelly and very intense!</li>
      <li>Anyone who bleaches their hair to a very light level should use this regularly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own hair since middle school and others hair since high school</li>
      <li>I used so many proudcts and used everything I could find and this is the only thing that ever worked I promised you you will not regret it</li>
      <li>Long story short, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>PLEASE try this first.</li>
      <li>When I heard that it stopped a lot of shedding I was immediately interested.</li>
      <li>Saw a drastic difference within the first use.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know exactly why.</li>
      <li>hair is growing back stronger &amp; healthier, &amp; it&#x27;s able to maintain</li>
      <li>My first time getting this</li>
      <li>Then it&#x27;s time to rinse the first step out.  </li>
      <li>The deep conditioner smells much better.</li>
      <li>and it really helps my hair to get back in shape, and if you trim it every 6 to 8 weeks, even better.</li>
      <li>is a great product and the only brand I use to treat hair, but please be smart when applying ANY protein treatment and either have someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing apply it, or be extremely careful.</li>
      <li>I decided to use this to prevent the breakage I experienced after my last relaxer that was due to an inadequate protein treatment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GOD the protein treatment smell will make you want to vomit, but it works! Helped my hair stop shedding.</li>
    <li> Bleached hair needs this stuff about once a week - it takes some time to do the 2 steps but it well worth it to have my hair not breaking off like straw.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to do this protein treatment because I couldn&#x27;t determine if I needed moisture or protein, especially since the symptoms are similar. Since I had tried everything else to no avail, I decided to go through with it. Followed the directions to a letter and my hair turned out great! Used a hooded dryer and a shower filter as we have really hard water. This will definitely be a part of the arsenal from now on.</li>
    <li> i am so thankful i found this product i put it in today but before thne i had read many reviews saying you will wash it out and your hair will feel better! and yes it did feel stronger!!!! i am a dye freak these 2 months i been doing foils and then went platinum blonde without wanting to go that light so then i went dark brown which was what i started with... my hiar was so fried i was so scared to touch it b.cus it would just end up in the palms of my hands this stuff has cut down 90% of my breakage and feels pretty much 90% of what my hiar used to be before bleaching it!!!! im so happy i will continue to use this!!!!!!!!!! my hhair is down the half of my back and i used almost the whole porting bottle but i have lots of conditioner left!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have bleached proccesed gross hair or its breaking offf YOU NEED THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff did anything. My hair felt great after I washed it out, but it feels that way after my normal deep conditioning sessions. I don&#x27;t know if I will be purchasing it again. I haven&#x27;t noticed any big difference in my hair. I have 4c color treated natural hair by the way.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot of great reviews about this product and at first I always wondered what was it. I did more research on it and how to exactly use it which I found out through YouTube. When I heard that it stopped a lot of shedding I was immediately interested. I shed so badly and I don&#x27;t know exactly why. So I decided to give this a try. I was a little afraid at first because they say not to touch it while it dries and I was like oh no my hair is going to fall out. But I went and purchased this at my local beauty supply store today and I put it all over my hair and it smelled so bad. Rinsed it out used the moisturizer then deep conditioned with my own deep conditioner. When I started blow drying my hair I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was it has NEVER been this soft before. It looked and felt like I just got a relaxer. I also noticed there was not much hair on my shirt after like it usually is. This is a great product i&#x27;ll be using it from now on every 6 weeks :-)</li>
    <li> This stuff is beyond nasty. It did absolutely nothing for my hair except make it sticky. It did not feel any softer or look any healthier. It smells like a dead yak and it gets EVERYWHERE. Took me ages to get the oily residue off my bathroom floor. I do not have excessively damaged hair. I had bleached part of it once with some nasty bleach stuff that came with this blue Splat hair dye that I bought. The bleach worked beautifully in getting my hair white....as well as frying it and making it super brittle. The rest of my hair I eventually dyed with a Loreal bleach or something like that. That part of my hair wasn&#x27;t white, but it was blonde and perfectly healthy. I decided to try this stuff to hopefully heal up some of the brittle bits of my hair (or at least make them softer and more manageable) but it just did not work at all. It gave my hair a sticky and oily residue that took 3 shampoos to get out. I followed the directions to a T. I have really long hair, so it took a lot longer for the product to dry in my hair despite using my hood hair dryer and my hand hair dryer. It also irritated every bit of exposed skin that it touched. This is definitely not something I&#x27;d ever use again. I&#x27;ll just let my hair heal on its own and save myself the (literal) irritation.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hair care products. So great.</li>
    <li> Omg stinks so bad, smells like feet and @$$! Lol.....less shedding for my hair though</li>
    <li> It smells horribly and didn&#x27;t do much restoring to my relaxed hair although i see many swear by it. I used the nexxus emergency treatment and that did wonders for my hair without the horrible smell.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I love it so much it works just like they said it would. Thank you so much. The shipping was good and fast also.</li>
    <li> Ordered this on prime and got it really fast, which is good because my hair needed immediate rescue. My hair was really breaking and started even falling out. This product came highly recommended on YouTube so I decided to try it. Saw a drastic difference within the first use. I used this once a week, and each time I saw less hair in my palm. The conditioner has a masculine scent, but really softens your hair. I love this product and ordered the curl moisturizer. Will definitely stick with this brand.</li>
    <li> Wow! My first time getting this and boy does it help! Seriously I&#x27;m going to do this every month! Ok peeps yes follow the instructions! I suggest looking at youtubers demonstrating how to use/apply. This stuff has a stinky smell like umm that yellow-ish sauce you get from Pho restaurants? Or your grandpa&#x27;s stinky feet lol. It makes ur hair hard as a brick..so before u put this stuff in your hair make sure it&#x27;s tangled free!!!!!!! Last note, my hair is thick and past my shoulders by 1-2 inches but it&#x27;s thick so I used the whole bottle &amp;#62;~&amp;#60; curly hair problems lol so I suggest you kno u have a big head full of hair or even longer than mines..I suggest going to the beauty supply store and get the small packages to add on to save some $$$</li>
    <li> Ummmmmm, im straight bald in the top of my head, after using this.  I regret it.  My hair broke off badly.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty bad like trashcan. Not sure if actually helped my hair feel healthier?</li>
    <li> I use to flat iron my hair regularly but due to the damaging effects on my hair I have cut back and have been opting for ways to norish and protect my dry, damaged hair. This product made a significant difference after the first use. It made my hair feel so soft and hydrated. It does smell funny and is a little messy but well worth it.</li>
    <li> After having bleached hair for almost a year, I tried doing an at home relaxer only to end up with gum for hair.  It mostly affected my ends, so I had them cut off.  Some of my hair still felt gummy in spots.  I searched YouTube for tips, and this had lots of rave reviews.  I tried it today, as soon as it arrived.  My hair does feel much better.  It smells God awful. Like unwashed booty hole.  I&#x27;m still paranoid that I smell it, but I asked my mother and boyfriend and they don&#x27;t smell it.  The deep conditioner smells much better.</li>
    <li> FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! A friend of mine gave this product a bad review but she was treating this product like a deep conditioner (keeping it on too long with heat) and her hair became a thick, heavy, flat mess.&lt;br /&gt;  I have relaxed hair. After using this product and rinsing it out, I used a leave-in conditioner and deep conditioned a few days later. My hair came out lovely, soft and full of strength.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but if this can help anyone with hair damage, I&#x27;ll write it.&lt;br /&gt; My hair has been through highlights and hair color before and was fine I&#x27;ve never had breakage in my life; but one day my hair stylist called out &amp; another stylist highlighted my hair with BLEACH!! Left it on my hair 2 long and my hair started breaking off as soon as I got home. Every time I combed my hair, brushed my hair, washed my hair, even touched my hair, large pieces of hair would break off. The breakage was REAL y&#x27;all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I had no idea what to do, nothing was working. No amount of deep conditioning, keratin, or oils were helping me. Even the Aphogee 2 minute miracle treatment did little to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I you this product stopped my breakage in it&#x27;s tracks; I mean it made all my breakage stop completely.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use it for another 6 weeks, because it&#x27;ll be 2 harsh on your hair, but my gawd this treatment is seriously a life savor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Aphogee 2 minute miracle after every wash as a substitute in between my 6 week periods (you might want to purchase that too).&lt;br /&gt;My hair is growing back stronger &amp; healthier, &amp; it&#x27;s able to maintain it&#x27;s length because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan cut my hair later to even out all the breakage, but this seriously is a miracle product. I just had to review!</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this I read that it smells bad and it sticky both are very true but the smells not completely unbearable. My hair is relaxed so it needs protein and I had a little trouble with my hair breaking and shedding. I use to have like a glob of hair in my comb every time I combed my hair especially after I combed it out after washing. Now my hair barely breaks and sheds; I will keep using this every 6 weeks and about a week before I get a relaxed. I recommend this product but don&#x27;t use it more then once a month or it could lead to protein overload. Also don&#x27;t forget to use a moisturizing deep conditioner after this to balance out the protein and because protein dries out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you need a little of protein between using this every 6 weeks like me try a light protein based conditioner like the Aphogee 2 Minute, ORS Replenishing Conditioner or the ORS Nourishing Conditioner (all of these are light protein conditioners and can be used weekly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for people who are scared to try it out because of protein overload I say go ahead and give it a try! I was so scared because I thought my hair would fall out for some reason lol but it was really easy and helped my hair improve so I&#x27;m happy! I do recommend that your put the protein into a spray bottle so it&#x27;s easier to put in your hair and not get your hands sticky</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that I straighten daily.  Due to all the heat on my hair, my hair has begun to split and break off.  I use this once a week.  I just wash my hair, apply the treatment, and let it dry in my hair.  Once it&#x27;s dry, I wash it out and use the conditioner.  My hair now feels like it&#x27;s salon treated every day!  I love it!!  Best product on the market for split ends and breakage.</li>
    <li> If your hair is breaking, this will slow the process.  Anyone who bleaches their hair to a very light level should use this regularly.</li>
    <li> I am a fine haired natural, just using this treatment for the first time, and my hair absorbed it like a dream.  I deep conditioned afterward, and it feels like I have a new head of hair. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> It left my hair feeling great! My skin, on the other hand, broke out horribly wherever the treatment had touched and took a while to go away.</li>
    <li> Please please please, make sure this product is what your hair needs, this is a very strong protein treatment that may not be needed for your hair type. It&#x27;s very smelly and very intense! It makes your hair very hard and once the product is washed out, your hair will be so tangled you have to be patient and work thru the tangles. Smells horrible!!</li>
    <li> I love apogee hair care products thanks to the 2 step protein treatment and the balancing mosturizer. The two of these products saved my hair after a horrifying relaxer! My hair was like straw after I processed it! I nearly cut it all off. Apogee was my last chance! I used the product on my hair and it miraculously made it silky smooth, and gave it movement! The following day I was going on vacation so it was very important that I did not waste my money on a failed product! The mosturizing only made the final results better! I love apogee! After I finish this review I&#x27;m going to buy the entire product line!</li>
    <li> Works like I charm. I have burnt my hair to no return. Lets just say I&#x27;m back at a full length. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own hair since middle school and others hair since high school and this is the best protein treatment I&#x27;ve used by far. My friend fried my hair to the point where it felt like a mixture of hay and old rubber bands and after two treatments it looked and felt basically normal again; after the first treatment you could tell that it was workimg wonders and i could brush it again. I rate this 4 stars because the seller should fully inform the buyer how to adequately use it. Im lucky enough to have been married into a family of cosmetologists so I know what I need to do to make it work to it&#x27;s full intent.&lt;br /&gt;Some tips for the buyer:&lt;br /&gt;It is a protein treatment, that means you&#x27;re adding protein into your hair. If you don&#x27;t need that added protein it could be damaging to your hair and make it brittle. Remember, too much of a good thing is also a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;Also, protein hardens and your hair is fragile. If you&#x27;re not careful and you act carelessly you CAN break off chunks of your hair when it is dry.&lt;br /&gt;Never blow dryit to make it go by faster, unless you know what you&#x27;re doing. Yes, heat does open the follicles, but not knowing how to properly blow dry it with a protein treatment in you can break your hair off.&lt;br /&gt;After washing it out, always always always use the deep conditioning second step. NEVER leave out this part. You just added so much protein to your hair and protein is dry. If you don&#x27;t deep condition it, it will feel dry, it will get super tangled, and it won&#x27;t FEEL as healthy as it is. Protein treatments treat the hair and add nutrients they don&#x27;t soften your hair. The deep conditioning doesn&#x27;t do so much to treat as it adds more moisture and makes it feel healthy once again.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and the only brand I use to treat hair, but please be smart when applying ANY protein treatment and either have someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing apply it, or be extremely careful.</li>
    <li> This two step treatment is essential for anyone who colors their hair.  It stops breakage cold and delivers strength and softness to tired, weakened hair.  I use this treatment whenever I changed the color of my hair.  The color removal process is certainly damaging and this treatment gives me silky, strengthened tresses.  Just follow the package directions. The first step is really stinky (that&#x27;s the real protein).  I use a blowdryer to dry the protein treatment into a hard shell.  Then it&#x27;s time to rinse the first step out.  Be sure the protein is completely rinsed out before continuing on to the next step.  The second step is a moisturizer that stays on for two minutes. However, sometimes it&#x27;s not enough hydration for my hair so I use a deep penetrating mask, such as Je Veux Mud Mask or Shea Moisture&#x27;s Manuka Honey mask, with heat.  Both of these masks add essential moisture that the second step of Apoghee doesn&#x27;t give me.  You may not need it, but I often do so I thought I would mention it.  Do not use Apoghee more than once every six weeks or so because too much protein can make hair brittle.  This treatment can save your hair if you&#x27;ve bleached it or otherwise abused it, as I have done many times.  You will be amazed at the results.  No other protein treatment works as well.  You can get Apoghee at Sally Beauty Supply.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A great deal for this product:)</li>
    <li> I used this yesterday with great results. My hair is relaxed and I am 8 weeks post and I will be getting a touchup next week. I decided to use this to prevent the breakage I experienced after my last relaxer that was due to an inadequate protein treatment. I&#x27;ll admit, I was really scared while using this, because of the &amp;#34;for professional use only,&amp;#34; warning on the bottle, but I am very satisfied with this product. It made my hair feel stronger and it stopped the moderate amount of breakage I was experiencing. I will say one thing, although I&#x27;m usually not too picky when it comes to ingredients, I didn&#x27;t use the balancing moisturizing conditioner that it came with, because it had mineral oil in it and I didn&#x27;t want it to coat my hair and led to underprocessing of my roots after my touchup. Instead I used my trusty moisturizing deep conditioner, (Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Masque), and did that for 30 minutes. I was left with soft, smooth, light and airy hair after rollerseting. I will definetly be doing this every six or so weeks and next time I think I&#x27;ll just buy the protein treatment only, since I don&#x27;t really need the moisturizing conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought and used this product because my hair was breaking off badly. It didnt smell as bad as I thought it would( because of other reviewers).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, to be honest, Im not sure if it actually worked. I did see less breakage the first few days but after that it was still breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;My hair type: relaxed but I have been on a eight week relaxer stretch, I am hoping to get to 12 weeks, I used to relax my hair every 4 weeks. So my hair is in three textures, new growth, thicker relaxed, and over processed relaxed.</li>
    <li> I destroyed my hair with bleach and had to cut a few inches off, I wish I had found this stuff long ago. Makes my hair softer and does help ALOT with breakage.</li>
    <li> Great product! Hair almost feels normal again. Hopefully it&#x27;ll hold color the next time around!</li>
    <li> I am crazy amazed with these products. It&#x27;s a salon treatment and it&#x27;s important to follow the directions completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it on, comb through (I didn&#x27;t but my hair was detangled in the shower) and dry your hair. Don&#x27;t bend it while drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it&#x27;s dry shower it out and put the conditioner on for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bleached my black hair to white blonde and used toner as well. My hair was mushy on the ends and dry all over but now it&#x27;s very soft &amp; I was able to brush it while wet without it breaking and there were only a few strands in the brush compared to handfuls before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the only protein treatment that I&#x27;ve ever used and I like it. It has helped with breakage and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is stronger.</li>
    <li> Err, don&#x27;t understand the rave about this one.. It did not improve my hair a single bit. Maybe it works better for some types of hair than the other. I have thin hair bleached in the past. To be honest, an egg on your head overnight does much more noticeable wonders! So I guess I would rather stick with the natural remedy.</li>
    <li> the protein is like water with shaving cream, and the conditioner is a little bit better but still smell bad. I didn&#x27;t really notice any improvement on my hair , and the directions got ripped so  Im not sure I need to look up how to use it</li>
    <li> I use this once every two months. I put on step 1 and wash it out usually the next morning. I follow up with step 2 which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft and smelling wonderful. Do NOT use this too often, it&#x27;s strong and will leave your hair feeling brittle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this treatment every 6 weeks and it really helps my hair to get back in shape, and if you trim it every 6 to 8 weeks, even better. Try it! its Amazing.</li>
    <li> This made my hairline and nape burn immensely. I didn&#x27;t let it dry but I did leave it on for about 10 minutes. Btw, it does smell. But the balancing moisturizer smells great</li>
    <li> Once you get passed the smell it works really good. I have natural curly to kinky hair with a little heat damage. This treatment helped with my straight ends.</li>
    <li> I had planned on bleaching my dyed black hair to change to a lighter brown.  I knew the bleach would do significant damage so I purchased this before hand planning to use it in between the bleach and the dye.  My hair was in fair condition but I expected a lot more damage than what I got so granted, I wasn&#x27;t having a hair emergency after the bleach.  However, I decided to go ahead with the protein treatment prior to coloring to at least help the color take more evenly.  The treatment does have a offensive smell.  Not a chemical smell but maybe more like a &amp;#34;rotten vitamin-e&amp;#34; smell.  It&#x27;s also very watery and gets sticky QUICK so prepare to have it everywhere and be sticking to yourself until it dries and you shower.  The moisturizer has a mens cologne smell that will last for days.  However, that being said, I will continue to order this product for maybe a monthly treatment.  My hair has never felt that good.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product. I noticed less breakage and shedding right after my 1st treatment. Happy customer :)</li>
    <li> My Mom used this years ago on me and my sisters years ago, when we were younger. It works great. Since its strong I&#x27;m going to use this once a year. Smells horrible but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have super curly hair after a few years of straighting and dyeing and bleaching my hair I lost the curl pattern and had wavey almost straight hair it was ugly frizzy and would never curl anymore thank god I found this product I cut all my dead ends off and still my hair was still not curling till I found this product first time I used it it was amazing I used it like the directions said styled my hair as usual my hair was so curly I hace curls I havent seen in forever I was almost to the point where I was just going to accept I would necer have curly hair again im so happy I didnt give up and found this its a life savor and I will continue to use forever I used so many proudcts and used everything I could find and this is the only thing that ever worked I promised you you will not regret it I will be buying a bigger bottle I love it!!! :)</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks but it truly works. After one application, my hair felt and looked thicker. I had dyed my hair about three weeks ago and the color really did not show up, but for whatever reason, this product intensified the hair coloring and now the color is showing. I have also noticed less hair breakage and it also left my hair extremely soft. The conditioner is one of the best conditioners I have ever tried. My purpose of using this product is due to I have very fine 4B, 4c natural hair and per research this hair type can benefit from regular protein treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post 6 month review: please be very careful with using this product! I am suffering from protein build up. Please research on protein build up before using this product. It is a horrible experience! I currently rate as average due to I can place no blame on the actual product itself. I was using this once a month and everyone&#x27;s hair is different. In otherwords, it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault for causing the build up. Maybe I was using it too ofen, maybe I have protein sensitivity, maybe I have high porosity hair. Who knows. Whatever the case,  protein build up should cause great concern. The build up will cause the hair to become EXTREMELY dry and rough and is hard to rid of it. I have been clarifying for months in order to try to get my hair back to normal.</li>
    <li> Im surprised this actually worked. I was desperate!  It definitely made my hair stronger and healthier looking.</li>
    <li> This 2 step treatment is a lifesaver! I&#x27;m Puerto Rican, Scottish, &amp; African American so my hair is super curly. Now add the fact that I bleached my curly locks &amp; put blue dye in it &amp; you have the perfect mess of hair on earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt absolutely horrible before I used this treatment. I was crying &amp; convinced I needed to cut at least 3 inches of my hair in order to save the rest from split end hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the treatment and the second I washed step 1 out of my hair I could feel the difference. By the time I was all done with step 2 my hair felt like it was in heaven. Long story short, this is a great product. If you&#x27;re having a hair crisis &amp; you feel like cutting it is the only way to solve it PLEASE try this first.</li>
    <li> I was honestly a little iffy on using it at first because online I had seen mostly African American women using the product. I didn&#x27;t think it would do as good on my hair. But, boy was I wrong! It made a BIG DIFFERENCE in my hair, in a very wonderful way. My hair was fried, absolutely destroyed. This product along with the Aphogee Shampoo made my hair softer. It didn&#x27;t repair it fully, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine it doing any better than it did! I will continue to purchase this product. I am truly satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great product for restoring the PH balance in my hair. It helps gives your hair the strength it needs, and I had color treated hair. I was experiencing a lot of breakage. Thinks to Aphogee my hair is stronger than ever.</li>
    <li> Great product to have on hand, especially if you bleach or relax your hair. I recently suffered from some relaxer/bleach damage (I take total responsibility, I should not have done two chemical processes so close together) and I am confident that using this product before relaxing my hair kept me from going bald (I still had lots of breakage, but that was my fault for dying my hair several times and then relaxing it. Stupid, I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this the week before you chemically treat your hair, and in the wash after.</li>
    <li> Stop crying. Buy this. Hold your nose. Use it. It will save you from cutting off all of your hair after severe chemical damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a white girl with naturally brunette hair that is wavy on top and curly closer to the nape of my neck. I have colored my hair every color of the rainbow, but the hair I have now had been dyed black for years. After lightening it from black to platinum over the course of a few weeks, the last round of bleach went awry due to timing issues, and my hair was fried. I had my husband cut off about six inches, but my now shoulder length hair was still mushy and if I tried to comb it while it was even damp, it would rip out in chunks. It was sticky and awful. I&#x27;ve had a pixie. I&#x27;ve been cool with doing risky things with my hair. But this length had taken years to grow out. I literally cried. I was ready to cut it all off and start again. I tried every deep conditioning method I could get my hands on. They made it a little better, but I still couldn&#x27;t comb it and it would take over 5 hours to dry naturally. I was afraid to touch my hair. It looked like it was hanging in faux dreadlocks for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I bought some of this from Sally&#x27;s. First off, it smells HORRIBLE and the directions and reviews are a little scary. But I donned some gloves, dampened my hair (I had already washed it a few hours prior to this application, but it had started to dry), and applied the treatment. It took a long time to dry and harden. I would blow dry my hair for about 10 minutes, then wait for 20, blow dry it again for 10, and so on. I noticed a few places weren&#x27;t getting hard, so I applied a little more to those areas. It took about 4 hours total to harden and dry, but I finally got to wash out my hair. It was noticeably less porous immediately. When I had shampooed or conditioned it prior to this, when it was wet, my ponytail would be about the diameter of a baseball. It was immediately about half that size, which was closer to my normal thickness. I conditioned it heavily, then used a leave-in conditioner when I got out of the shower. I can finally get a comb through my hair, and although there are still a few places that are breaking, it is greatly improved. It started drying more quickly, and looks less damaged. I applied the first treatment about two weeks ago, and I am going to go through another round today. They recommend every 4-6 weeks, because too much protein can cause your hair to be brittle too, but I can tell that it&#x27;s not quite back to normal yet, and it was SO devoid of protein before, I think it can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have bleached-to-death hair, buy this and some purple shampoo (use about every three days), and condition your hair regularly. Try to avoid applying too much heat (from blow dryers or straighteners), and be gentle. But it&#x27;s going to be okay. You got this.thickness.
