### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Trimming worked perfectly using the nose trimmer.  </li>
      <li>A wonderful product that my son is raving about.  </li>
      <li>For now, he&#x27;s very happy with the two blade system.  </li>
      <li>so there are no cords to get in the way as you look in the mirror to get that perfect look</li>
      <li>Conair&#x27;s trimmer is not the perfect tool</li>
      <li>This is a very good trimmer.</li>
      <li>with the lack of a cleaning brush, the features of the Conair 2-Blade Trimmer make this a great unit.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job</li>
      <li>, if this trimmer is priced under $40, that&#x27;s a great price.  </li>
      <li>, if this trimmer is priced under $40, that&#x27;s a great price.  </li>
      <li>and he was happy to know that it stayed charged for awhile.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t let the photos fool you - build quality isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>What I like best about this trimmer is the fact that it does charge very quickly, and holds the charge for the duration of me having to wrestle with my 3 yr.</li>
      <li>Not a replacement for a manual razor but good for what it is.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been a good performer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thorough but the illustrations are not too good and, being just a folded piece of paper</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thorough but the illustrations are not too good and, being just a folded piece of paper</li>
      <li>A lot of the attachments weren&#x27;t great at catching the curls evenly.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been a good performer.</li>
      <li>Gives a good close shave for an electric razor with no burning.</li>
      <li>The good thing is that it comes with a carry bag and a separate travel pouch which can be used for attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Comes with a handy storage bag to keep all the attachments and the power cord together - makes it great for traveling.</li>
      <li>So if you are thinking of purchasing this for trimming a child&#x27;s hair, then this is a good choice.</li>
      <li>Battery life was good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
      <li>Attachments are easy to install and it works great without the attachments, too.</li>
      <li>For the under $50 range rechargeable lithium ion trimmers, there are quite a number of trimmers that give you amazing value with plenty of extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>trim real smooth but not quit close enuff.</li>
      <li>It does not have any kind of tray to set it in, so you have about a dozen implements that have to go someplace.</li>
      <li>still recommend Conair&#x27;s trimmer but be prepared to supply your own cleaning brush -</li>
      <li>still recommend Conair&#x27;s trimmer but be prepared to supply your own cleaning brush -</li>
      <li>Looks like a nice toy versus a man&#x27;s hair trimmer.</li>
      <li>These are nice additions to the package.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did nicely trim the nose and ear hairs though.</li>
      <li>Conair trimmer comes with a nice travel case that holds the device and all the accessories and can slip inside you gym bag or travel</li>
      <li>all, a quality instrument, easy to use, and a good buy.  </li>
      <li>A trimmer is only as good as its blades and in this department the Conair was excellent.  </li>
      <li>My hairs are ALWAYS getting stuck in the blades and I wasn&#x27;t about to use my good badger hair brush to try and clean it</li>
      <li>It has a sculpted design to fit nicely in your hand.</li>
      <li>It came with a nose and ear hair trimmer which I figured was a gimmick, but it too worked better than the one I had bought from Sharper Image years ago.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll give this two stars on the basis that I like the charging indicator (something that is often omitted on a trimmer) and that the nose hair trimmer works better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>charged, all you need to do is attach the proper comb (see below) or the ear-nose trimmer and proceed to the best of your talent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My curiosity got the better of me</li>
      <li>I decided to replace the Wahl with the Conair GMT288GB Lithium Ion 2-Blade All-In-One Trimmer and am glad I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
      <li>With the six attachable combs, he is sure to find what he needs whenever he changes his mind about his look.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure I can come up with many positives and negatives for any trimmer</li>
      <li>Finally it comes with excellent instructions for using it, for suggesting how to trim your hair, and for maintenance.  </li>
      <li>He finds using the trimmer is much more efficient than the moustache comb and scissors he was using before.  </li>
      <li>It did a better job thinning my mustache.</li>
      <li>I think that is important if you are using it to trim a child&#x27;s hair, because when he moves around, I get nervous because this is kind of bulky in comparison.</li>
      <li>It has some redeming features, but there are better choices from Wahl and Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>

      <li>It does get really warm and gives off a kind of hot plastic smell because of the batteries.</li>
      <li>So all in all, I will continue to use this one, because the quality of the cut is pretty good, but the most important thing I like about it, is that it holds the charge and is quieter.</li>
      <li>The trimmer itself is rather bulky to be used to trim the nose, but it works better than those cheap AA powered nose hair trimmers you buy in the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few beard trimmers over the years and this product just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. The reason, I already fight bathroom clutter and this thing just contributes to it with all of the attachments.  I can&#x27;t really figure out why it needed all of them when my last three trimmers did fine with a single click adjustable blade.  This includes an adjustable attachment that is a bit difficult to adjust, and as far as I could tell it doesn&#x27;t have any way (at least any easy way) to determine what setting you are on.  My other trimmers put a nice little number next to it.  I also found that without any combs that it was hard to see what I was doing for trimming the edge lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is nice and and it looks high end. I definitely like how it looks better than my current Norelco, however, my this won&#x27;t be displacing my Norelco, because that has an easy dial to adjust length and also a convenient vaccuum to suck up the hairs before they make a mess all over my sink.</li>
    <li> This is a very good trimmer. It does a great job but you need to note a few things. It does not have any kind of tray to set it in, so you have about a dozen implements that have to go someplace. Also changing out the implements is not easy and I feel that if I did it a lot I might break the plastic assembly. So I plan to use it primarily as a beard trimmer and probably not use the various head attachments that came with it. That&#x27;s what I needed, and it works well for that. My previous Conair beard trimmer lasted several years.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to get this because I was thinking of growing out my beard some but didn&#x27;t have a trimmer (and my hair grows in quite thick, as anyone who knows me will testify) and I needed a nose/ear hair trimmer. Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t really do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a nose hair trimmer, it takes a surprisingly long time. I kept reading the directions to see if I had done something wrong, but no - it&#x27;s just not very effective. I definitely have long enough nose hair to where I&#x27;d expect this to make short work of it. On ear hair it&#x27;s super ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as facial hair - I didn&#x27;t grow a full beard and try it out, but I really shouldn&#x27;t have had to. Even with a pretty solid stubble it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot. Additionally, all the attachments were confusing to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and don&#x27;t let the photos fool you - build quality isn&#x27;t that great. Looks like a nice toy versus a man&#x27;s hair trimmer. It was very plasticky.</li>
    <li> For the under $50 range rechargeable lithium ion trimmers, there are quite a number of trimmers that give you amazing value with plenty of extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those wanting precision trim with the extra swag, the Conair 2 Blade Lithium Ion Cutting System is a trimmer worth checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I.  WHAT&#x27;S IN THE BOX:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box are the:&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- Recharger Cord&lt;br /&gt;- Nose and Ear Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- 6 All Purpose Combs&lt;br /&gt;- Single Blade&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Position Comb&lt;br /&gt;- Oil&lt;br /&gt;- Bag&lt;br /&gt;- Dopp Bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II.  TESTING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the instructions are easy to read, diagrams are not exactly the clearest.  Fortunately, with this trimmer, you can figure things out on how to switch out the blade for a nose/ear trimmer.  The shaver comes pre-charged out of the box and for the most part, this Conair trimmer is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shaving, it helps to have the option of the 2-blade trimmer which helps with precision cutting. Especially for those hard to reach spots on your neck and face.  For those wanting to get a certain type of stubble or beard, while some trimmers only have 2-3 combs, Conair gives you six.  As well as a 5-position comb for those wanting different lengths of beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noise and ear trimmer worked well.  It&#x27;s important to note that the nose and ear trimmer is rounded (which I prefer) than the flat edge that sometimes can cut your skin.  While it does get warm, nothing to hot that it will burn you.  Trimming worked perfectly using the nose trimmer.  Only challenge was trying to figure out how to install it as the pictures on the instructions were hard to see.  But you need to remove both blade heads and this nose and ear trimmer was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if the battery is dying out on you, fortunately there is a red light indicator towards the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging was quite quick and loved the fact that it was around an hour and half to recharge (box says 1-3 hours) and the run time is 60-0 minutes, where my other trimmer is only 20 minutes.  And while other trimmers have a single blade, this Conair offers a two-blade cutting system.  And there is also a 2 minute quick charge for 1 use which is cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with all these accessories, you want somewhere to store it.  Not only do you get a single pouch provided, but also a bonus dopp bagg which was pretty cool!  So, no worries on organization, Conair has you covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUDGMENT CALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair Lithium Ion is a solid trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was there any caveats to shaving?  Not really but there are somethings that people may need to know.  Accessories are in plastic&lt;br /&gt;and can get a bit flimsy.

But I&#x27;m sure I can come up with many positives and negatives for any trimmer but when it comes to value, the fact that you do get 6 all-purpose comb, a circular nose and ear trimmer, another blade for 2 times the trimming action and a 5-position comb plus a pouch and dopp bag.  Plus the quick charge and its long run-time is another positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if this trimmer is priced under $40, that&#x27;s a great price.  Otherwise, if the prices fluctuate and this goes over $45 or $50, it may be a bit too pricey for my taste. But definitely do your research on other lithium ion trimmers with similar pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for what Conair offers in this 12-piece set, I&#x27;m quite impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!60-0 minutes, where my other trimmer is only 20 minutes.  And while other trimmers have a single blade, this Conair offers a two-blade cutting system.  And there is also a 2 minute quick charge for 1 use which is cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with all these accessories, you want somewhere to store it.  Not only do you get a single pouch provided, but also a bonus dopp bagg which was pretty cool!

    <li> Gives a good close shave for an electric razor with no burning. Not a replacement for a manual razor but good for what it is. Easy set-up, doesn&#x27;t take that long to charge. It does get really warm and gives off a kind of hot plastic smell because of the batteries. Other than that, pretty nice razor, recommended.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has a novel design with two cutting heads.  This was never really something I felt I needed, but Conair advertises that it makes trimming facial hair quicker and easier.  How well does it work?  Honestly, I felt like the dual cutting head was bulky and hard to maneuver and did not add a lot to the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself comes with 6 different fixed trimmer guides and one adjustable trimmer guide.  They cover both the primary and secondary blade, although it advertises that you can use the guides when only one blade is installed.  I gave this a try and found that while it technically works, the trimmers themselves do not stay particularly well attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer noted, the quality of the trimmer was especially apparent when trying to edge the face and trim down sideburns.  Using the trimmer with no guides attached, I found it difficult to get a good clean cut.  In some cases, it just didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of other accessories, the trimmer comes with a soft bag, a zipper case, and an AC adapter to charge the internal lithium ion battery.  It also includes a nose hair trimmer attachment which actually worked quite well.  The trimmer itself is rather bulky to be used to trim the nose, but it works better than those cheap AA powered nose hair trimmers you buy in the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion?  There are other options for simple trimmers that allow you to carefully edge the face that cost less.  For a nose hair trimmer, I recommend the [[ASIN:B000EBFJXS Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]].  This Conair trimmer seemed like a good idea, but the edging performance is sub-par, the plastic guides are flimsy, and the double blade just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  3 stars.</li>
    <li> Conair&#x27;s trimmer is not the perfect tool but it has a few good things going for it that should make it a worthy pick for anyone motivated to self-manage his facial hair. It can be used to trim one&#x27;s beard and mustache but also to keep a &#x27;stubble&#x27; look under control, avoiding forever going through shave-growth cycles. In addition, it can be configure as a nose-ear hair trimmer which comes quite handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPERATION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once charged, all you need to do is attach the proper comb (see below) or the ear-nose trimmer and proceed to the best of your talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The English/Spanish manual tries to be as thorough as possible explaining the trimmer&#x27;s operation and options and discussing your options when it comes to facial hair design and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A typical session involves selecting the proper configuration, depending on what you are planning to achieve:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- single blade configuration for edging&lt;br /&gt;- nose/ear tool&lt;br /&gt;- a stubble comb for keeping your stubble under control&lt;br /&gt;- a jawline attachment for trimming under your chin&lt;br /&gt;- the 5-position comb for overall beard maintenance&lt;br /&gt;- blade-only for detailing your mustache&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I takes a little bit of practice but you can get come good results in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT YOU GET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer body hosting the rechargeable battery&lt;br /&gt;- 2 trimming blades, attached to the body but removable&lt;br /&gt;- 3 stubble combs (close, medium and high)&lt;br /&gt;- 3 jawline combs (1mm, 2mm, 3mm)&lt;br /&gt;- 5-position comb (4mm, 6.5mm, 9mm, 11.5mm, 14mm)&lt;br /&gt;- adapter/charger&lt;br /&gt;- lubricating oil&lt;br /&gt;- storage pouch&lt;br /&gt;- dopp bag (called a &#x27;bonus&#x27; but likely to come with your order)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOME SPECS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life is rated at about 60-90 minutes off a full charge&lt;br /&gt;- Charge time is 1-3 hours&lt;br /&gt;- 2-minute quick charge for one (short) use is possible&lt;br /&gt;- Lubrication is recommended more or less on a monthly basis and cleaning after each use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returns and warranties:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the relative ease of use and operation once you learn it and the quality of the trims.

    <li> Picked this up for my dad who is a pretty whiskery guy and has been thru his share of trimmers in his lifetime. He didn&#x27;t care much for the nose trimmers as he felt they were too big and hard to really see but he&#x27;s always really preferred his little scissors anyways. He also prefers the last Schick I got him as it had a self charging and cleaning stand as this one has neither not even a cleaning brush and all just stores in the pouch it came with. However he likes the charging light signaling when its ready and the overall shave is smooth and likes the trim in general, just prefers the last one I bought him. Oh well. Still not a bad trimmer just better ones out there.</li>
    <li> The Conair GMT288GB Lithium Ion 2-Blade All-In-One Trimmer is a nice idea, but the two trimmer sections really don&#x27;t seem to do any better than single trimmer models made for the same purpose. The trimmer itself feels well made, and has the benefit of various trimmer guides, a lithium ion battery, and a well designed ergonomic shape. It all falls short at actual trimming though, it just seems to miss too much, even for light touch-ups, requiring much more time and patience to get the job done than should be necessary. This is really a let down, as I&#x27;ve always liked Conair products on the whole. I really think they need to go back to the drawing board on this one, it just doesn&#x27;t perform that well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Wahl Compact Cordless Travel Trimmer to manage my beard and mustache, but unfortunately that unit was starting to die.  I decided to replace the Wahl with the Conair GMT288GB Lithium Ion 2-Blade All-In-One Trimmer and am glad I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to its size,  the Conair initially seemed cumbersome. It&#x27;s much larger than the Wahl compact trimmer so maneuvering the trimmer around my face took some getting used to.  But, I find that the larger, dual blades of the Conair reduces the amount of time it takes to trim my facial hair.  One thing that is helpful is the design of the trimmer&#x27;s body.  It&#x27;s ergonomically shaped which makes the trimmer comfortable in my hands.  Since the Conair is larger, I expected the motor to be louder but it&#x27;s about the same as the Wahl, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features of the Conair trimmer that I like:&lt;br /&gt;* Powerful motor trims smoothly with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;* Dual cutting blades for a quicker, more efficient trim.&lt;br /&gt;* Ergonomic design fits comfortably in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;* Upper blade can be removed so detailing beard/mustache edges is easier.&lt;br /&gt;* Six single combing guides and one 5-position guide allowing you to trim from a very close stubble to a 14mm length.&lt;br /&gt;* Nose and ear trimming attachment.&lt;br /&gt;* Includes blade lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included are 2 storage pouches.  A smaller, lighter one for storing the trimmer and accessories, and a larger and sturdier, zippered pouch that can be used for traveling.  These are nice additions to the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small thing that I would have liked Conair to include is a small cleaning brush;  most of the previous trimmers I&#x27;ve owned included one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the lack of a cleaning brush, the features of the Conair 2-Blade Trimmer make this a great unit.  I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I hadnt shaved in 2 weeks and needed this product immediately upon buying it.  I dont like to shave and usually keep my face trimmed to a days growth.  So I plugged it in and started and was pleasantly surprised at how well it was working.  My curiosity got the better of me and I just had to try out the nose hair trimmer before finishing the rest of my face.  While working on the first nostril the thing just dies!  So yeah, only runs from battery and not from power cord as well.  Glad I was stuck at the house until it was charged enough to continue trimming the other nostril and 90% of my face.</li>
    <li> Bottom line: While this trimmer has a novel dual cutter head design, it performs poorly. The dual head adds bulk but not any value; the attachments are not well made; the overall ergonomics and design is poor. It has some redeming features, but there are better choices from Wahl and Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full review: I was looking forward to trying this out since I&#x27;ve never used a dual head trimmer before (e.g., a trimmer that has two cutting blades working at the same time). I figured two blades have to be better than one, right? Wrong. The dual blades only add bulk to the trimmer, making it difficult to see what you&#x27;re doing, and offers no cutting benefits over a good single-blade unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is so-so. It has a sculpted design to fit nicely in your hand. That&#x27;s good, but the sides are smooth, hard plastic, so it&#x27;s difficult to keep a firm grip on it while using it, especially with wet hands. Some type of non-slip coating or finger grip nubs is sorely needed. The heads are very plasticy and don&#x27;t give me the feeling they will last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a wide selection of trimmer guides. Most snap on, and provide a single length. One is graduated so you can adjust the depth of cut by sliding it back and forth. The guides are not well-made -- they do not latch onto the trimmer head securely (e.g., there&#x27;s always a bit of wiggle) which means they do not function well in maintaining a consistent cutting length. The graduated guide is especially problematic -- it uses plastic click stops that are difficult to engage/disengage, which makes adjusting the length a frustrating process. The size markings on all the guides are hard to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second cutting head can be removed, turning this into a conventional trimmer. However, the guides can only be used when both cutting heads are attached. That&#x27;s a shame, since it&#x27;s much more maneuverable when configured as a single head trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting performance is only average. I had to make several passes to get a clean edge on my sideburns. Even then, the cut was not nearly as clean as other trimmers or even the trimmers built into my electric razors. It did a better job thinning my mustache. However, regardless of how it was used, the dual head made it difficult for me to see what I was doing. I was never sure where the cutting edge was, which does not inspire confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not come with a counter-top stand but rather has a bag that stores all the attachments, trimmer and charger. That&#x27;s both good and bad - no clutter on the bathroom counter, but it&#x27;s less convenient to keep at hand for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pro&#x27;s list is pretty short. It has a lithium ion battery which provides good power, it has a charging indicator, and it has a nose hair cutting attachment that works surprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several other cutters out there at this price point or less that work much better, have better build quality, and are easier to use. I&#x27;ve been using the Wahl lithium ion trimmer ([[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]]) for a couple of years and it&#x27;s been a good performer. Not perfect, but much better than the Conair. Any of the Norelco trimmers (they make several varieties) also outperform this Conair, and some are less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give this two stars on the basis that I like the charging indicator (something that is often omitted on a trimmer) and that the nose hair trimmer works better than others I&#x27;ve tried. Everything else about this trimmer is sub-par, and I don&#x27;t recommend it.I had to make several passes to get a clean edge on my sideburns.

    <li> I&#x27;ve got a goatee and have used trimmers for years that break after just a few years.  This Conair trimmer is hefty and I expect it to last a while.  On a very basic level it trims but it was extremely complex to use.  Reminded me of one of those complex 35mm cameras that I could never figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has so many attachments they include a handy bag to keep track of the all them all:  2 cutting blades, 3 \\&quot;jawline\\&quot; attachments, 3 \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; attachments, a five position comb and a nose/ear trimmer.  The manual wasn&#x27;t really clear which ones to use in which situations and since I keep a short, trim beard the jawline/stubble attachments weren&#x27;t a close enough shave.  All those attachments and I still felt I got a closer trim from one of my cheap disposable ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a full beard or are looking for detailed manscaping, this might be a good trimmer.  Personally it was too confusing.  It did nicely trim the nose and ear hairs though.</li>
    <li> All beards are not created equal.  Nor are all trimmers.  My facial hair is thick, curly, and grows sparsely in places (such as cheeks/jawline).  Here are my observations after a few weeks _trying_ to use this to maintain my \\&quot;Movember\\&quot; Stache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A dual trimmer really was overkill.  Even with the attachments, precision movement was tough and in some cases I still had to make multiple passes, possibly due to curls.&lt;br /&gt;2. Holy Clutter!  I have limited counter space and a toddler who gets into everything.  The pouch is not a solution.  It really should have come with a charging base that includes attachment storage.&lt;br /&gt;3. No blade brush.  My hairs are ALWAYS getting stuck in the blades and I wasn&#x27;t about to use my good badger hair brush to try and clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;4. Battery life was good.  I found I only needed to charge it about once a week and the indicator made sure I didn&#x27;t get stranded halfway through a trim.&lt;br /&gt;5. Curly hair.  A lot of the attachments weren&#x27;t great at catching the curls evenly.  A common frustration.&lt;br /&gt;6. Attachments.  Speaking of attachments.  They are cheap and plastic.  I had a few snap off mid use due to poor fastener build...  Conair cut some corners here to save on the bottom line.  I suppose one can only expect so much from a sub $50 trimmer.  Other reviewers have commented on the nose hair trimmers but I found it to be only adequate as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is not the best facial hair grooming tool and I&#x27;ll probably fall back on one of my old WAHL trimmers.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the Conair GMT288gb Trimmer for my middle son who is just beginning to shave thinking it was a regular electric shaver.  It became property of my eldest son who has a beard and a moustache.  He finds using the trimmer is much more efficient than the moustache comb and scissors he was using before.  The danger of a slip and a cut lip are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has several heads that are easy to slip on and off which you can set to the length of cut desired.  It is cordless so there are no cords to get in the way as you look in the mirror to get that perfect look and it keeps a charge for a long time..  One head works well on the moustache, you can use another shorter cut for your beard, and yet another for sideburns.  In addition there is a feature that allows for the removal of pesky nase and ear hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair trimmer comes with a nice travel case that holds the device and all the accessories and can slip inside you gym bag or travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great way for the men in the family to keep their facial hair in check and their handsome faces intact.</li>
    <li> The Conair trimmer has been very useful as it trims well,  it is easy to use, and holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold so trimming is easy and accurate.  It comes with a variety of attachments, the motor runs quietly and smoothly, and it is easy to recharge.  It&#x27;s a small learning curve to learn how to replace the hair trimmer attachment for the \\&quot;nose hair\\&quot; trimmer attachment, but once changed over, the nose/ear trimmer is a dynamo!  It is very smooth, and when it come to cutting nose hairs, smooth is good, no, mandatory!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, a quality instrument, easy to use, and a good buy.  I would have rated it 5 stars but the changeover from facial trimmer to hose trimmer is awkward, yet that is a minor issue.</li>
    <li> trim real smooth but not quit close enuff.</li>
    <li> Conair offers a dual blade head design in this trimmer, but as other reviewers have stated it results in adding bulk to the trimmer and weighs it down without making too much difference in trimming. And it makes it less convenient as it&#x27;s harder to see than a single blade trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with many attachment combs and a multipurpose adjustable comb but they feel pretty flimsy and although they are marked with letters it&#x27;s hard to keep track of which attachment does what, and in my opinion adds complexity to a device that should be relatively simple. The last thing you want in the morning is to first have to look through all the attachments to find the right one and then have it pop off the trimmer due to being flimsy. The good thing is that it comes with a carry bag and a separate travel pouch which can be used for attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an additional nose and hair circular trimmer that is a nice extra as most trimmers do not offer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this trimmer offers many bells and whistles but the quality is just ok and makes the trimmer less user friendly - overall rating - 3 stars.</li>
    <li> What I like best about this trimmer is the fact that it does charge very quickly, and holds the charge for the duration of me having to wrestle with my 3 yr. old grandson to trim his hair. Now I have used less expensive trimmers on him, to which the quality of the cut is very similar to this one, but the less expensive one that I used was a little lighter then this one. I think that is important if you are using it to trim a child&#x27;s hair, because when he moves around, I get nervous because this is kind of bulky in comparison. The nice thing about this trimmer is that it is quieter then the less expensive one. That is also important, because it doesn&#x27;t scare him the way the other one did. It doesn&#x27;t change the fact that he still moves around, but he not as afraid with this quieter one. So all in all, I will continue to use this one, because the quality of the cut is pretty good, but the most important thing I like about it, is that it holds the charge and is quieter. So if you are thinking of purchasing this for trimming a child&#x27;s hair, then this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who has been experimenting with how he wants to &#x27;design&#x27; his face.  He&#x27;s been growing in a mustache, beard and his sideburns but it looks messy.  With the Conair cutting system, he has been able to get edgy, precise lines with minimum fuss.  The system itself fit in his hand well and he was happy to know that it stayed charged for awhile. With the six attachable combs, he is sure to find what he needs whenever he changes his mind about his look.  For now, he&#x27;s very happy with the two blade system.  He gets a close shave without any irritation and the system fits comfortably in his hand.  He doesn&#x27;t need the nose/ear trimmer yet, but foresees that he will later down the road and will try those then.  It comes with a bag to easily store everything together and also a bonus travelling bag.  A wonderful product that my son is raving about.  Now I&#x27;ll have to buy one for my husband!</li>
    <li> Just the right size trimmer with a lot of different attachments to handle just about any trimming need.  Attachments are easy to install and it works great without the attachments, too. Charges quickly and really holds the charge a nice long time.  Easy to grip and quickly maneuver.  Without the attachments, a gentle touch is required as the trimmer can really scratch the skin if not careful.  But that may be the only negative.  Comes with a handy storage bag to keep all the attachments and the power cord together - makes it great for traveling.</li>
    <li> My past two trimmers made me skeptical, but I decided to give this one a chance.  Unlike previous trimmers now gathering dust, this Conair works.  A trimmer is only as good as its blades and in this department the Conair was excellent.  I have a full beard and this trimmer cut right through it.  It has never caught or pulled.  I can trim my beard and mustache quickly.  It is light-weight and cordless which allows you to get at your beard from any angle.  It came with a nose and ear hair trimmer which I figured was a gimmick, but it too worked better than the one I had bought from Sharper Image years ago.  There are seven comb attachments for different lengths.  I like the stubble combs.  There are three of them and they give me the look that I want.  Cleanup is easy.  The blades come apart allowing you to brush off the hair.  I wish they had included a big brush for this purpose.  Finally it comes with excellent instructions for using it, for suggesting how to trim your hair, and for maintenance.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
