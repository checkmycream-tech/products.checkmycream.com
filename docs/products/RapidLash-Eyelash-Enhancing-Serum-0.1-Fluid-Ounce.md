<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is like a miracle. I do not usually believe in products like this, but I gave it a try because I miss my younger, fuller lashes. Within 30 days, I had lashes as good as or better than the ones I had in my 20s. Worth it!!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes have never been longer, thicker or more healthier!  RapidLash works</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t RAVE about products.. hardly at all unless I really believe in them.  I was SO skeptical.  LOL.  So, I put it on 3-4 times a week over 3 weeks.  I&#x27;m not very good at &amp;#34;every night&amp;#34;.. however, talk about long lashes and bottom lashes like I&#x27;ve never even had!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t HAVE lower lashes until now.  I don&#x27;t even take my make up off every night, but now I always put a coat of this on regardless, even if my mascara is still on.  I&#x27;m still getting amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how good this stuff is.  I&#x27;m buying it as Christmas gifts, and will always repurchase, without a doubt.  I&#x27;m still using mine and I think I&#x27;ve had it now about three months.  I actually looked at my lashes this morning and asked myself if they were really mine???  LOL...  Something that actually does what it says... such a surprise.</li>
    <li> I love rapid lash! One of the few beauty products I&#x27;ve used that has had really impressive results. And I love to blow cash on beauty products. I started to see results after about a month of use. People have asked me if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes! You really have to use it religiously to keep your new glorious lashes looking perfect, but you just have put a little on before bed, so it&#x27;s no biggie.</li>
    <li> good product with significant effect shown after 1 month.</li>
    <li> Wow! It took about 6 weeks to see full results, but my eyelashes have really grown and gotten thicker! This product has radically changed how my eyelashes look when I apply mascara (before my lashes always looked short and clumpy regardless of what mascara I used, now my lashes look super long and thick). This is a great product for a great price (I&#x27;ve used other brands in the past that gave me similar results, but cost significantly more). In addition, I have had no sensitivity or redness along my upper lash line (unlike other products where my eye lids looked irritated and dry for the entire course of use). I will definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have to be sure to use it daily but it definitely builds lashes</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it too regularly as I&#x27;m not a person easy to being a habit but I do see slight result..</li>
    <li> I bought this at Costco (2 tubes for $50) and it totally works. I thought it was a dud but I figured I had 2 and it wasn&#x27;t hurting so I kept using it every single night and about 6 or 7 weeks in all the sudden I had really thick long lashes from basically nothing.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up.</li>
    <li> Really Works!!  I am a former Latisse user, and while I can say this doesn&#x27;t work nearly as quickly as Latisse, it is less than half the price and it really does what it&#x27;s claimed to do.  Don&#x27;t just take my word for it either...  Do the research.  It has been clinically proven to be effective.  I started using this long after my eyelashes had cycled back to their normal growth rate and had become short and thin again.  This product got them back to their Latisse like state.  This product is a great alternative! I will definitely keep buying.</li>
    <li> I used this diligently for about a month and a half, taking pictures of the process, and saw 0 difference. This product does nothing.</li>
    <li> This is the best and cheapest serum I have found. If you use it every night you will see result in about 4 plus weeks. I have tried others, and they did not work as well, or were super expensive. This is the best product for your money. Just try not to put to much on and I know this sounds crazy, but try not to get it in your eye, it might sting just a little. Some people don&#x27;t like it because it seems a bit runny when putting it on.</li>
    <li> It really works just be constant and you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
    <li> good but not what i expected</li>
    <li> This product works!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Same as the eye brow enhancer. I have been using it for three weeks and no difference.</li>
    <li> makes my eyelids turn brown</li>
    <li> This product really works. I had very few lashes and this product made my lashes grow. I loved it . Its worth your money. I ve tried many eyelashes products will definetely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This has worked well for me but after several months it seemed to lose its effectiveness.  I keep applying it as I don&#x27;t want to lose what length I have.</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s been just over two months and over the last 2 weeks I have seen dramatic growth. The ends of my eyelashes had broken off using an eyelash curler, now they are fully grown back and super thick. It tends to work more in patches then uniformly i.e. more growth along certain areas but I&#x27;m happy overall and will continue using. Was nervous about this purchase but do not regret buying. Great price for great product. It also works really well on lower lash line. EDIT TO ADD: mine has Isopropyl Cloprostenate in it (in reference to all the other reviews that mention that this ingredient is what makes it work).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It work a little some of my lashes are long, but some part are short. Weird.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product at all! The product sent has an expiration stamp that states it expired before I ever ordered it!</li>
    <li> I did not expect it to work, just bought to try, because &amp;#34;the price is right&amp;#34;. I have dark and thick but short lashes that began to thin with age. After using RapidLash for 8 weeks they became noticeably longer and darker, but the biggest surprise happened when I used mascara. I don&#x27;t use mascara very often, so when I used it recently to the party I was really surprised: the lashes looked so unrealistically long, like these false lashes that are in fashion now. Funny side effect: they began to curl, each into its own direction, so when I used mascara, they looked kind of &amp;#34;bushy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought a set of 2 at Costco for $50, I think it&#x27;s a better deal than just paying for one, I had been using this for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;m starting to look the difference when I put on mascara, my eyelashes do look longer, not fuller yet but longer. I was using latisse and besides of being over $100 it turned my eyelids brown and my my eyelashes were growing close to my eye, I probbably using too much product, anyways I stop using it and my eyelashes stop growing and got short again and the color also it&#x27;s gone. I will see if Rapidlash does the same but so far it&#x27;s seem to working ok and I loved the price too.</li>
    <li> I love this, my eyelashes have truly grown in less than the 8 weeks they said, I am very happy.  Also so easy to apply and does not hurt in any way.</li>
    <li> It is showing (expired date on it)&lt;br /&gt;No isn&#x27;t working.....I have used before &amp; it worked.....</li>
    <li> Skeptical at first, but I got through the first month even though I saw no visible results. I am in the beginning of the 3rd month and my lashes are growing very long and are slightly darker. I really love my results so far. I am ordering another bottle. The nottlw I have says the active ingredient is hexatein, I know some people were using the other but I am noticing a difference with this one and am very happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product well over 30 days and have not seen a change.  I have a slight bald spot above the center of my eyelash and was told I would see a difference.  Not!!!! Very disappointing.  I wish I would not have thrown my money away on this.</li>
    <li> I will say that this stuff works. It definitely works.. Now it&#x27;s not going to give you Kim kardashian eyelashes like you ( or I) might be looking for, but it works. My lashes are average length but they had gotten super short and thin because of applying false lashes on. The glue had actually pulled some lashes out of my eyes so I had bald spots. With in a month of using, all my  bald spots were gone and I had a very nice length. Considerably longer than normal. Who knows after my second month I might actually get my kardashian lashes afterall.. I will say that when I first started using this I had headaches and did not realize why it was more of a sensation in my eyeballs. Once I made the connection I started being much more careful about how I applied the substance to my eye line and the headaches went away so perhaps I was being too sloppy and it was getting into my eyes. I haven&#x27;t had any other problems and like my results. You will see a difference that much I know..</li>
    <li> Great product!  Eyelashes are longer, and it didn&#x27;t change my eye color or make my eyelids red.  It&#x27;s even worked on a sparse area of my eyebrow.</li>
    <li> Not too sure if I can see any results yet, some lashes started falling out also... Eyebrows seem bushier but I havnt plugged them in a while so not too sure if this product actually works for me</li>
    <li> I like this serum.  I have had it just a couple of weeks and I can see a difference in my lashes.  I would re purchase this product even though it is a little pricey.</li>
    <li> after a month i am seeing result! this is comparable to Latisse (which I used previously) with a much better price</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed changes yet, but will give it a chance. Very good applicator, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> It works for me after 3 weeks I can see the difference.</li>
    <li> Yep, it works.  My lashes are noticeably longer.  For me, it took about 6 weeks to really see a signficant different.  Very easy to apply.  I didn&#x27;t experience any stinging, redness, etc.  I just ordered another tube and plan to keep up the regimen.</li>
    <li> Love it.  For me it has taken about 8 months worth of use to regrow my lashes and even regrew my eyebrows which had fallen out.</li>
    <li> My lashes were naturally short and very light brown in color. If I rubbed my eyes I would typically end up with three or four lashes falling out. It took approximately four weeks to notice results from using Rapid Lash. My lashes became darker and strong, and by week eight I noticed they were longer. It has now been 14 weeks and my lashes are thicker, darker, and considerably longer. This is the first time I would describe my lashes as very \\&quot;full\\&quot; and \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; without having to apply mascara.    Tip: I apply one thin line of product just at my lash line (where you would apply eye liner). I do this after I shower just before bed. You do NOT need to reapply in the morning as the product absorbed overnight and continues to work throughout the day. I&#x27;ve been using the same tube for over three months now and it is still going strong. I have had amazing results and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This really works for me and I have experienced no negative side-effects.  I certainly don&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;fake eyelash&amp;#34; look but my lashes look natural and are noticeably longer.</li>
    <li> I was unsure if this product would work or not.  While a lot of people said they saw growth, I was afraid that I would be that 10% where the product didn&#x27;t work and I just threw away $30.  But after trying to manually stimulate eyebrow growth using brow brushes and castor oil, I was desperate as I didn&#x27;t want to spend the rest of my life filling in my brows with a pencil.  I had over-plucked my eyebrows in high school (like so many of us) and regretted it ever since.  I decided to throw caution to the wind and take the chance, and boy am I glad I did!  By the time the tube was finished I saw definite growth where there was none previously.  I did end up buying another tube (RapidBrow this time) as there were still some gaps, however my eyebrows are almost completely back to their bushy beautiful self. I only did it once a day at night before I went to bed.  I don&#x27;t know how people do it twice a day or even in the morning as the product leaves your brows &#x27;wet&#x27; which would mean I would not be able to pencil in my brows - and that&#x27;s not happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all the people considering this product and are on the fence - I would recommend.  I had a great experience with this product and it seems that with most people, if it works for you - it works.  Additionally to the reviewers that say to just use castor oil, castor oil is to make the hair that is currently there healthier.  It does not grow hair like this product does.  I will go back to using castor oil once my brows have completely grown back.</li>
    <li> Product was over 2 months expired when it arrived</li>
    <li> Great delivery and love the product.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for awhile now after I noticed my lashes getting really thin in my early forties. I use it twice a day, onece in the morning and again in the evening just before I go to bed. Give it a month and you will definitely see a difference. The only down side is you have to continually use it or you&#x27;ll lose the results.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes really grows a lot longer and thicker in a few weeks. I don&#x27;t even wear frake eyelashes anymore.</li>
    <li> It works -- but make sure you check the ingredient list. There are two versions out there. The Canadian version, also sold in America and another version with the ingredient called  &amp;#34;Isopropyl Cloprostenate&amp;#34;. Only the version with &amp;#34;Isopropyl Cloprostenate&amp;#34;  is the one that works -- like a charm. I had long lashes in a week. Amazon accidentally sent me the Canadian version. I returned it and called them and specifically asked them to send me the one with the Isopropyl Cloprostenate in it. Thanks to their great Customer Service, they did.</li>
    <li> This made my eyelashes amazing for the first few months, now its not working like it was.. Eyelashes are back to being thin and shorter even though I apply this every night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Johanna and I got rapid lash because all my eyelashes got pulled out from fake lash extentions from the nail salon. I was really embarrassed of having short lashes to begin with after that I had none! So I decided to give it a shot and rapid lash is awesome!! Its affordable and really worked! I started seeing results by week 4! Now my lashes are longer than they were! They even touch my eyebrows when I open my eyes!</li>
    <li> Works wonders.  Even my 14 year old commented on my eyelashes and did not know I was using this product.</li>
    <li> I was using Lutesse for a long time, then I decided to try something less expensive.  This actually works better for me, my lashes are not only longer, but they are thicker as well.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Does not burn your eyes, it works, Easy to apply, Great price-- Yep, buy it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff - really works, especially has helped fill in my sparse eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Have used for two years. Noticeable difference in length and darkness of existing eyelashes. Have experienced no side effects. Recommended it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Is it normal to have swollen eyes? After using it, my eyes are swollen at the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I think I should return it. How should I do it for?</li>
    <li> Must not be the same formula as when I tried a few years ago.....meh - been a month and I really see no difference one way or another.  Won&#x27;t re-purchase.  And to those who posted photos, posting without mascara and then after use, with mascara, really?  Not helpful.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping &amp; works wonders!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works very, very well. I bought some for my daughter for Christmas and it is already starting to work.</li>
    <li> Try this one..it really works IF used as directed!&lt;br /&gt;Living proof it really works rather quickly, I might add! ! !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two months now. I can&#x27;t tell if I notice a difference or not. Will continue to use this...and if I suddenly have a change, I will update my feedback. I can say once you apply it, you can&#x27;t tell you have. I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have had ZERO reaction...so that is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> Rapid Lash absolutely will make your lashes grow.  You will start seeing a difference in about 3 weeks.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because you must be prepared to make this a long term commitment.  If you stop using it, your lashes will begin to fall out and they will revert to their original state.  So don&#x27;t expect the growth to be permanent unless you continue to use the product.  I like the results, so I will keep doing so and will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Still using. Hope it will work.</li>
    <li> No lash growth whatsoever</li>
    <li> Love it .. U really can see the result in 10 days</li>
    <li> I got to say...I hardly had eyelashes, now I have a good bit. I am very shocked that it worked.</li>
    <li> Omg be careful with is product. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin first off.  I was using this for lashes and to thicken my brows. I started to notice I was getting dry crusty skin in my brow area, I went to wipe it off and took some of my skin with it. It gets basically irratates the skin, scabs and peels your skin. Gross.</li>
    <li> Love it , it works !!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I will never go without this. It has made my lashes thicker, fuller and longer. Works just like it says. It does take at least 4 weeks to notice when you first start using it, but keep it up and your lashes will be beautiful.</li>
    <li> Product does make my lashes fuller and longer, after just a few weeks!  I would definitely use it again!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all. I was using iMax eyelash serum, which worked really well, but stung like crazy. Switched to rapidlash...... and my eyelashes are now sparse and thin.  :(</li>
    <li> Yes, this works. It makes your lashes longer- not thicker however!!</li>
    <li> It def works.  I know Latisse is a little faster, while this is a fraction of the price.  I also use it to help grow in my eyebrows- this is something I will continuously buy bc it provides the natural looking subtle beauty of longer lashes and being a child of the 90&#x27;s I over-plucked my brows and this helps those hard to regrow areas.  I like looking like a princess when Im not wearing makeup and this is one the the products that provides thats glamuor</li>
    <li> I have ordered and used this off and on for awhile.  This time when I ordered, the tube seemed to not be completely full and doesn&#x27;t come out as well as it has in the past.  It does work (when I remember to use it).  I think it is a good product - but you have to keep up with it.  When you stop, so do your eyelashes.</li>
    <li> The product is used at night, takes 3 months to really show results.&lt;br /&gt;I live in the UK and bought it as it is half the price in the USA.</li>
    <li> Have been using this the last year and my lashes have grown and filled in to the point that friends think I have false eyelashes on. They are shocked when I tell them that they are my real lashes.</li>
    <li> I love this product... I was looking for something not to expensive to play around with when I noticed that my eyelashes were starting to thin and did not look as nice. After 2weeks the looked nicer after 4 weeks wow my eyelashes are longer and prettier! I am using it as directed every night after I wash my face &amp; before I go to bed..</li>
    <li> Happy with the results and price.</li>
    <li> I have notice a difference in volume and length, not the results I want to see it, but I think it will take some time. Just using for a month. But great product!</li>
    <li> I  am a older women and have never had very long eye lashes and my daughter was using this and I could not believe her lashes  so I got me one and I can say that mine are not as long as hers but they are getting their.  Easy to use!!</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.</li>
    <li> I always hate super negative reviews because I think those people are just debbie downers. That being said I can&#x27;t really give a review of this product because I went to use it and it was expired. I purchased it in Jan 2014 and its expiration date was October 2013. I&#x27;m a little bit disapointed in Amazon. I&#x27;m a religious user of Prime, and this is a little bit disheartning. I will check closely in the future all products that can expire!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but had to add my comment because I&#x27;m somewhat upset. I&#x27;ve used this product from this seller for some time time and it actually has worked despite my skepticism. I&#x27;ve never had visible eyebrows (very light) and with this product you can actually see them. And I had eyelashes that the optometrist couldn&#x27;t even get hold of to open my eye, and after using this product for about a month, even my dental hygienist remarked on my eyelashes. But not this round. I haven&#x27;t gone quite back to square one, but it isn&#x27;t working the way it used to. I&#x27;m going to try ordering the same product from a different vendor. I hope they haven&#x27;t changed the formula. Maybe the stuff I got was from an old batch. When it works, it&#x27;s fabulous! 6 stars when it works.</li>
    <li> 2 weeks saw longer fuller lashes, its been 6 weeks now and just wow even fuller then the first two weeks .I use once a day in the morning. I cant believe what this stuff has done. I will NEVER go without it again. The price is awesome compared to some of the spa products that are hundreds. I am simply amazed at the results!!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually receive the Rapid Lash Eyelash and Eyebrow Enhancing Serum. What I received was merely the Eyelash Enhancing Serum. After much difficulty trying to return what I received for what I ordered and paid for (two different prices), I chatted online with Kalai at Amazon.com and received wonderful service/assistance. I got a refund for the serum that I originally paid for and Kalai was able to have the billing dept bill me for the actual item I received. So for THAT, I am extremely happy. Can&#x27;t really say much about how I feel about the Eyelash Serum yet - it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used RapidLash for several years and it does work without changing eye color as Latisse is known to do.</li>
    <li> After only two weeks of using it I think I applied less than one coat of mascara and I was shockeedd !! My lashes were taller and thicker. Then after a month I saw the difference without applying mascara and now I can&#x27;t stop using it and my lashes grow healthier and thicker by the day. People also think that I wear extensions, and I seriously did not have any lashes before using it at all !  Definitely will buy it again. This time I&#x27;ll try it on my eyebrows too, heard it works good on them.0</li>
    <li> I have used the product for three weeks and my lashes are filling in, I&#x27;m anticipating even more results with continued use.</li>
    <li> I live rapid lash!  My lashes get so long I need to trim them</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I have been using it for almost a month and my eyebrows are darker and thicker than they have ever been in my life!  I only apply it before I go to bed.  And I still have a lot left!  I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s not something that I have to buy monthly because of the price.  I don&#x27;t think I would keep buying it if they put any less in the tube.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I have used this daily for one month and have seen no change/growth whatsoever.  I would not recommend it or purchase it again.  The only reason I gave this a one is because you cannot submit without a star rating.</li>
    <li> Does not separtate the lashes, they kind of clump together. I probablywon&#x27;t buy this mascara type again.. I like my  lashes separated to show their lengths.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased this item at a doctor&#x27;s office.  It worked fairly well at the beginning, so after the first tube was nearly empty, I saw that I could purchase it from Amazon and the price was less.  I regret that because it hasn&#x27;t done anything to enhance or lengthen my lashes.  What a waste of money.  I will not buy thus product again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Having just started using two weeks ago it&#x27;s hard to rate yet.Give me 2 more weeks,and I&#x27;ll get back to u.</li>
    <li> I had ok lashes to begin with but i still noticed a difference using this. They seemed to darken and grow longer. I finished my tube and my lashes still look good. I&#x27;m waiting to repurchase because i&#x27;d like to see how long the results last with using it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 27 yr. old daughter for Christmas... and she recently told me that it does indeed work!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure what&#x27;s wrong with it - this stuff used to work so well my eyelashes rubbed against my sunglasses bacause they had grown so long (basically by not falling out).  Doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I do wonder about the dates stamped on these products, and some Amazon sellers seem to sell fairly dated items.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers who state the product is ineffective. I used to use Revitalash pre-2008 formula which was absolutely amazing before it was taken off the market. I switched to Rapidlash, and while the results were not nearly as dramatic, still not bad, especially for the price. I have used it for a few years. However, I have noticed that with the last two tubes I have used that I bought from Amazon, the product has failed to perform well. I thought I was imagining things until I sow some recent posts to this forum. I also agree is it because we are getting old stock. Beware.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a more slower process. than the first time I used it, last Fall.  I see very LITTLE difference in my brows.  I am still hoping as it has been a little less than a month.  I am only using it on my brows---I pirchased the Rapid Brow---it seems the Rapid grow lashes worked better.</li>
    <li> I had damaged lashes from extensions and this worked miracles!! Within a week my &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; patches were gone. I am now on week 3 and I can see that my lashes are fuller (more lashes overall, not thicker individual lashes) and they NEVER fall out anymore. I used to lose a few lashes a week naturally so this is a big bonus. I&#x27;m hoping that with continued daily use, they will grow longer as well (not that they are super short now, but still).</li>
    <li> I had no results with this product.  I am using Latisse again, the old saying that you get what you pay for holds true here</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since February and I am extremely satisfied with the results I have seen.  I had short lashes, was looking for a product that would not cause irritation on my sensitive eyes and one that was affordable.  I am so glad I purchased RapidLash!!!  It met all of my criteria and it provided me with the results that I was after.  I have used this pretty much every night since it arrived and my lashes are fuller, thicker, darker and longer.  It took a few weeks to see results, so be patient and don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t see overnight falsies on your face.  After you do your skincare routine at night, swipe this on before bed and it will do its thing.  I bought this for my mom and ever since she has been using it, I can see a difference in her lashes as well.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  I will keep coming back to repurchase this product.  I don&#x27;t know enough about the ingredients or understand how it works, but all I know is that it DOES! :)</li>
    <li> I tried all the natural ways before getting this thing. None of then worked. I did an experiment. I used it only on my right eyebrow, the results are impressive. The left one almost looks awkwardly shaved, considering I didn&#x27;t do any hardcore shaping I just plucked out the one or two random ones, while the right one looks like a normal slightly bushy eyebrow. But the interesting thing is that the hairs themselves are long and dark. It&#x27;s not just that there&#x27;s many of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used RapidLash for years and love the results. I have naturally longer lashes to begin with but this definitely makes them longer. I stopped using it a few different times over the years and my lashes went back to their original length after a few weeks. I love having long lashes so I just keep using it now. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all but it does make the skin around my eyes a touch darker/red looking. It&#x27;s not permanent and goes away if I stop using RapidLash but I love having longer lashes so I just wear a little more under eye concealer and it&#x27;s completely covered. You can&#x27;t beat this price on Amazon and 1 tube lasts me 2-3 months so the price is well worth it for me. For the past few months I&#x27;ve been using it only every other night and my lashes are staying long. This is one of those products that is going to work great for some and not at all for others--hence the mixed reviews. For me, I love it!</li>
    <li> My lashes are NOTICEABLY longer, but not thicker. I still have to wear several coats of mascara to make them thick. However...I&#x27;ll take the length! I&#x27;ve never used Latisse to compare them so I don&#x27;t know if it works better/same.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to know if it works. I have blond thin lashes to start, so I don&#x27;t know if it is possible to thicken them.</li>
    <li> so disappointed with this product. I can&#x27;t believe i wasted a lot of money in a product that doesn&#x27;t do what it claims. Now im really wondering about all these positive reviews in here. hmmm.. my bad...I really wanted my money back.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think this was working but kept using it. Looked in the mirror yesterday and couldn&#x27;t believe how long my lashes looked.</li>
    <li> Well I am just the messenger...&lt;br /&gt;My wife says these are just what works for her...just fine....&lt;br /&gt;As usual Prime shipping and ease of purchasing and quick delivery make for a economical purchase with quick delivery....no hassle makes a happy buyer....</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom and she reports to be that it doesn&#x27;t really seem to be helping her.</li>
    <li> There are not enough words to describe it.....but it is a great product that works very weell all the time</li>
    <li> This is colorless.  You apply it at bedtime just like eyeliner...as close to your lashes as possible.  If you do get it in your eyes...it does burn.</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t help my lashes grow</li>
    <li> I can see it working already after only a week of use. Now I may be de exception, because I have lots and lots of hair (but somehow minimal body hair) it might be in my genes that with a little help my eyebrows and lashes will grow and get fuller. I cannot wait to see the end result.</li>
    <li> It really works, I tried different ones and they don&#x27;t produce the same result!</li>
    <li> There is no color, it is clear serum.  Applied at bedtime only. No irritation.  This evaluation is redundant!</li>
    <li> Great product lashes grew extremely long and darker within 4 weeks. Use as directed and you will see results fast.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve written a review, but I felt compelled to after the success of this product. I bought just one and have been using it on an off for 2 months on my brows and I can say they are almost perfect! Going from having bald spots to not needing to fill in has been just what I&#x27;d hoped for. Very happy I bought this!</li>
    <li> Did dry my eye lids and made itch so I only used only on brows which is really why I wanted it. Worked great first two months.  Not now in 3 rd month though, and tube not empty. Will try something else</li>
    <li> It really works but is old in 30 days. I like it and have used it for over a years</li>
    <li> The product that I received seemed to be close to empty. I think I may have gotten one that may have already been used. I need to return it so I can get a replacement. I used it a few times but I didn&#x27;t feel like there was enough product to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and the difference in my lashes is minimal at best. A little disappointed,  but maybe I just need to use it longer. I&#x27;ll repost in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using it and haven&#x27;t noticed anything . I thought they felt stiffer  when removing my make up  but I may have been the mascara .</li>
    <li> have used this product for a year--seems to be losing it&#x27;s effect--will continue using until this one is gone then decide if I will order another one</li>
    <li> I do not know if this works or not.  There was not enough product to try it out.  It was expired.  It arrived sealed, but there was almost nothing left in the bottle. It  also slightly irritated my eye lids.  I think because it was expired.  I read good reviews about this product, but would not buy from amazon.  It is available at ULTA and cvs.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rapid Lash for over 2 years.  I have tried some other lash enhancing serums but I still like this one the best.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t  expecting this product to work at all. To my surprise my lashes grew very noticeably. I ran out and miss it dearly and my lashes have returned to normal. The only downside is the price but it&#x27;s worth it. Will certainly repurchase when I can afford it.</li>
    <li> My only issue is that the seller sends appropriately packaged, but expired, product, which is why I cannot give this a five-star ranking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this a number of times and this really does stop lash and brow shedding and brings back thick eyelashes and eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give the seller another try; however, if I receive another expired tube, I will purchase this elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Being a 40+ (closing in on 50) woman, my lashes, brows, and hair are getting noticeably thinner.  Hair got chopped off into a pixie (love it!), brows may never return but can be filled in well enough to disguise the overplucking of my teens, but lashes?  What can you do besides falsies?&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this product in hopes of two outcomes: 1. a little thicker, longer lashes, and 2. better conditioned lashes with less breakage and loss.&lt;br /&gt;With this product, I got exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;I took some &#x27;befores&#x27; and really should have taken the time to do it right so I could post them here.  It has been probably 5 weeks and this morning I put on a light swipe of mascara and the length I have now is incredible!  Not much thickness, but the noticeable bare spots I had before have been replaced with lashes!&lt;br /&gt;I am over the moon with this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A side note: before purchasing another tube of RapidLash, I ordered Embellash...just to see the difference in the two.  Look for that product review 6 weeks from now or so.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I started to use this product in February of this year and have used it almost everyday since then. One tube lasts me about 2-3 months. I do use this on my eyebrows as well due to my diagnosis of being an &amp;#34;over plucker&amp;#34; and they have grown back in nicely. The key to using this product is to keep using it. I started noticing a difference probably around week 4. I did notice quite a few lashes falling out in the 2nd month but I kept using it and it eventually stopped, thank goodness. I have seen multiple reviews on Amazon saying that customers received an expired tube. I believe that these folks are reading the date at the bottom of the tube which is in fact the manufacturer date. Here is a question and answer from the Rapidlash website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. Where do I find the expiration date for RapidLash?&lt;br /&gt;A. Every RapidLash is stamped with a manufacture date MFG month and year on the bottom of every tube. An unopened RapidLash has an expiration date two years from the MFG date. For example, if the bottom of the tube is stamped 01/12, then the product expiration date is 01/14. If, the RapidLash tube is opened, the product should be used within 12 months. This is indicated by a universal symbol of an open cosmetic jar with 12M (12 months) located on the back right hand corner of the RapidLash unit carton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just thought I would add this in my review so that potential customers wouldn&#x27;t think the same thing.</li>
    <li> I got this product and within days of nightly applications could see a difference in my lashes! Yes, it&#x27;s expensive (Amazon helps with that!) but it truly does work and with a great thickening/lengthening mascara, I don&#x27;t even consider falsies for big events anymore! I also appreciate that as a contact wearer and can have sensitive eyes, this doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. If I use it every night, I do notice a slight pink line at the application spot but if I switch it to every other night or take a short break from it, the pinkness goes away. That&#x27;s the only side effect I have noticed and it wasn&#x27;t even really noticeable.</li>
    <li> Love it. It works great and is a great price. Most stores are selling it at 49.99. It&#x27;s great to find a product that really does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t stop using it or you will lose lashes.  I have used it since last fall and lashes look great!  Long and full!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, my eyelashes are the same length as they were before using this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! I love my lashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4yr., and swear by it!  If you have any skin sensitivities then you cannot purchase ANY eyelash serums, even the very expensive one - and you know which I am referring to.  You will fight darkening in some areas around the eyes, but it is sooo worth covering up to have full thick eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference between using this and not using it. But I have noticed some increased length, nothing really noticeable in regards to volume. Even though I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic improvement, it still helps with length so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this, but my girlfriend swears by it.  She says her eyelashes have never been better, and even uses it on her eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I dont know... I am dissapointed cause i have yet to see any results. I bought it cause it had really good reviews ... I will have to try something else</li>
    <li> Rapid Lash does work.  I have used it twice before with great results.  I ordered from a different source before.  For some reason, this bottle I ordered from E Shoppe is not working very well.  I&#x27;m sorry but, this is the truth.  Will not order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> This product was expired when I received it. I received a full refund and got to keep the product for the inconvenience. Again, it was expired,  but I tried it out anyway. I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s truly amazing! This is the second tube I&#x27;ve purchased but I&#x27;m honestly still using the first one! I love it so much I didn&#x27;t want to be without it! ;) My lashes are so much thicker and curl naturally it didn&#x27;t take long either for me to see the results. I definitely recommend this product be used. It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
    <li> love it! i have had complete strangers comment on my long lashes! will continue to use regularly</li>
    <li> I bought Rapidlash over 4 years ago when I was still dating, preparing to the big day - wedding. I ended up with a beautiful makeup without any falsies :-) And pictures looked great! Because I was impatient I used the serum twice a day vs. once as recommended in instructions. I had no adverse reactions and only slight redness the first a few days of using it. I still sometimes rev up my usage to twice a day if I get lazy and stop applying the serum for some time which eventually leads to shorter lashes. I&#x27;m so addicted to my long eyelashes now that I cannot be without this thingl. It&#x27;s definitely working. Random women ask me on the street, at the store, anywhere I go if my eyelashes are fake. Nope, they&#x27;re not. And I gladly share the secret. But I do not believe that it works for everyone, unfortunately. A few of my coworkers purchased Rapidlash too and one of them is saying that she&#x27;s not seeing any results yet even though it&#x27;s been more than a month. She is a Phillipina and her natural eyelashes are short and scant. Who knows, maybe she is predisposed to shorter lashes more than me. I noticed that my Asian friends and coworkers don&#x27;t see results as soon as I do. I don&#x27;t know what to tell them. This stuff works for me most definitely. Just keep using it. Although, if your eyelashes are falling out like crazy (some other reviewers said that), then by all means stop using it because your skin/lashes do not agree with this product. We are all different, have different body chemistry. Use your judgement, please, and don&#x27;t blame the product itself.</li>
    <li> NOTHING!  pseudo product or bad batch</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not tried other eyelash serums because I like this product. At 60 my lashes are short and thin but with this product they look great. Lasts a while and I can usually pick up another tube before my lashes go back to normal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure my lashes are getting longer, but they do seem to be a little thicker, and healthier looking.</li>
    <li> I do not see any results so far and disappointed. Really hoping rest of tube proves to be worthy of cost</li>
    <li> For eyelashes, this product actually works and improves eyelash length and quality. Only one I found that does. However, the jury is still out on claims of improvement on other areas, such as eyebrows.</li>
    <li> It took 8 weeks before I saw results. I&#x27;m glad I did stick with it. My eyelashes are longer and there were signs of new growth. My first tube lasted 6 months. This is my second tube and I will continually use this product. I totally recommend this product. But remember it will take awhile before you see results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results for at least 6 weeks and thought this was a BS product, then all of a sudden, I had longer lashes. Not thicker, but more. Given the options, this is the best for the price and no eye sensitivity</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell that this did anything, other than make my skin red and take a chunk out of my wallet.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it works really well.  I started to notice my lashes growing longer within 3 weeks from the time I started applying it to my upper lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I noticed that my lashes aren&#x27;t getting thicker as I would have hoped, but definately longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend people purchasing this product to help enhance both your eyelashes and eyebrows because I&#x27;m an Esthetician and I can say that it does work great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years now and it does work. It doesn&#x27;t give overnight results and your lashes won&#x27;t look like a full set of falsies, but it really does improve the length and number of your own lashes. A little pricy for the amount but worth it.</li>
    <li> Rapidlash serum takes about 3 to 4 weeks to notice the growth.  Once it kicks in, the lashes get stronger and longer.  I use it on my eyebrows and they look much better as well. I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for about a year.Really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> As much as I wanted this product to work it didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations. I have been using the product daily for about 5 weeks. I started using this product after having eyelash extensions for a couple months. Now I do think there has been SOME improvement in my lashes - ie longer/fuller lashes, I still wonder if it is quite worth the money. My lashes are about 20% longer -- nothing compared to what some other reviewers have state about looking like you have false lashes....far from it. I don&#x27;t think my lashes have changed in color. Maybe a scant amount fuller. I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to think there is going to be a noticeable difference to other people. I haven&#x27;t experienced it. No comments yet.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. My eyelashes had fallen out due to a thyroid condition and within a month of using this product they have grown back and are longer than before. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this for months and wrong through 2 tubes (or whatever you call it) to give it a chance. Not only did it not make my eyelashes longer, quite a few either fell out or broke off. At first I thought, maybe they are knew ones growing in and that&#x27;s why I kept up with it.  But after a few months it was obviously damaging my eyelashes. It apparently has worked for others, but it sure didn&#x27;t for me. However, now, 6 months later, my lashes are fine so it didn&#x27;t do permanent damage.</li>
    <li> After wearing false lashes for so long this product really brought my real lashes back to life from damage to length and fullness in as little as 2 months. A must buy!</li>
    <li> Still crazy about this stuff after almost 4 years. My wife recently thought her eyelashes weren&#x27;t as full as they might be and tried another product. Sorry She wasted her money. She returned to using rapid lash again. They work great for her brows as well. They make her lashes and brows darker and her lashes curly. She loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work. I NEVER give reviews. But this product I saw growth in both my eyelashes and eyebrows where they had been thinning towards the outer edges. I love this product and plan on using it as long as I can!</li>
    <li> I am SO pleased with RapidLash! About a year ago my eyelashes suddenly started falling out. I had so many bald patches I could barely put on mascara. My mom had success with RapidLash a while ago, so after being completely disappointed with an Urban Decay product, I decided to give it a try. I started seeing results within a few weeks. 6 months later, my lashes are back almost 100%. One particularly stubborn spot is still slightly sparse, but small hairs are growing in. The rest of my lashes are so long it&#x27;s almost annoying! They&#x27;ll touch my cheeks when I blink if they&#x27;re not curled and mascara-ed lol I&#x27;ve been using the same tube every night for 6 months and it&#x27;s finally time to buy a new one. Bottom line - RapidLash is awesome!!! Thank you for giving me my lashes back!!</li>
    <li> this product is AMAZING!!it really works..am speechless</li>
    <li> This product works!  It gives you fuller lashes without making them grow freakishly long. :-)</li>
    <li> Works!!!!  And at a much more palatable price than Latisse.  Near the end of the products life, it is however difficult to get out of the tube.  Tip it over and dip the brush in to get out the last drop.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly! I am Asian and have shorter lashes that just stick out straight. I have been using this for over a year now and have seen no side effects and only great results! My lashes are now very long and curl beautifully with a lash curler. I have gotten comments from people asking where I got my eyelash extensions. Definitely would recommend this for people trying to get longer lashes.</li>
    <li> I noticed a change right away. I do recommend this product if you can&#x27;t afford the more expensive stuff. Great alternative.</li>
    <li> A girlfriend suggested the product and it worked very well.  My lashes are thin but Rapid Lash seemed to add more lash.  The length definitely was longer.  After awhle, I cut back to every other day and the growth/maintenance continued.</li>
    <li> This product works. Helped my eyelashes grow longer and slightly thicker. I&#x27;m also taking biotin tho so that&#x27;s prob helping.</li>
    <li> Buy this product and use it religiously on brows and lashes and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I don&#x27;t think you need to pay more than this to get the results that this product offers.  Buy this and you&#x27;ll be batting big lashes in less than a month!</li>
    <li> I began using this product in January, and about 6 weeks later I noticed some results. The lashes on my left eye had gotten pretty long while the lashes on my right looked thicker, but not as long as the left. I continued using almost every night (about 5x a week), and just a few days ago noticed that the lashes on the right finally are as long as the lashes on the left. I am very happy with the results, even though it did take a full 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I did noticed at times little patches of lashes had fallen out, but I was told this was normal and the lashes did grow back rather quick. If you stick with this, you will see results, but don&#x27;t expect it to work in 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> The only drawback is that it takes so long to see results. But it DOES work well...just gotta give it time.</li>
    <li> This made a big difference in my eyelashes.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love it...I had light thin lashes and now have dark thicker and longer lashes. I now use every other day to keep them full and long.&lt;br /&gt;I am a senior and have hair loss as well as my lashes thinning...... Its amazing.</li>
    <li> Works very very slow. Product is too small and continuously keep on buying for better result.This product is ok but be prepared to keep on buying more if you want the best result.</li>
    <li> Rapid lash really works! I was amazed at how long my lashes have gotten in just a couple weeks. I was hoping it would make them thicker though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who has Lupus and has a problem with losing her eyelashes. She loves it! It keeps her lashes looking really lush and beautiful.</li>
    <li> It was dried up when I got it.  All of the other times, it has been great. So, I kind of feel like I got suckered on this one.</li>
    <li> Does what it claims to do. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me or my mother. But it does work for my friend who recommended it to me! I guess its a hit or miss.</li>
    <li> I am one of the most skeptical people on earth when it comes to beauty products, so I research heavily, and read a lot of Paula&#x27;s Choice reviews. While there isn&#x27;t too much scientifically peer reviewed evidence for this working, many members of Paula&#x27;s team had great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unexpectedly, so did I! My tiny stubby 5-6mm Chinese eyelashes, over the course of &amp;#62;1 month of daily application, are now 7-8mm! My lower lashes are a lot less sparse as well. The problem is that I have been bad with consistently applying it since, but the difference was definitely noticeable.</li>
    <li> Good services and received after 2 weeks. Very efficiency, thank you !</li>
    <li> After using for about 6 weeks I have gotten comments EVERY DAY about how long my eyelashes are.  This product absolutely works.  I am down to using about every other day as I have gotten the desired results.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for both my daughter and I. Saw her lashes were longer within 2 wks. Within 4 wks I noticed mine were longer. Will definitely order this product MANY more times. It adds that little bit of extra beauty to any woman&#x27;s looks</li>
    <li> I use this everyday on my brows &amp; lashes, only at night. It took me 8+ weeks for results. I&#x27;m not sure if that result window would be shorter if I really gooped it on. Both brows and lashes are thicker and longer and I am happy about that! Not denser, though. The product may not be able to overcome those genetics! It will sting if you get it in your eyes so use caution when applying. Also from time to time, after applying it to my brows, my skin gets itchy there. No rash, just itchy and then it subsides.</li>
    <li> My favorite product  and works like magic. In 30 days you will get the longer eye lashes you want. I even use it on my eye brows and it seems to work too.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  Give it about 8 weeks and you will LOVE your looooooooonnnnnnggg lashes!</li>
    <li> My sister turned me on to this.  After a month or so of use (I use in the morning, let it dry, and then put on my mascara), my lashes are longer and fuller and are even curling a bit.</li>
    <li> I read A LOT of the reviews and did my research before ordering this product. I bought it because it says it can also be used to help grow out your eyebrows, which was my main use for it, but unfortunately my search continues for a product that will do just that. My review targets only MYSELF, their were many who said it worked for them. You never know unless you take a small risk.</li>
    <li> I realized after using it for several weeks that my lower lashes grew a little, the lashes from one eye were bigger than the other. So I had to apply more product in the smaller lashes. My top lashes improved in length not so much. When I stopped using it for a week or two, the length of my lashes went back to normal again. If planning for a big event, then plan the use of it in advanced, it may work for a week or two, and then your lashes will go back to normal. I have used other serums that work better than this one, but of course I payed around 200 dlls for it, and 30 for this one. So the results, if compared by the price I payed, were as expected.</li>
    <li> I had also used this product for over two years and it is as good as the Mavala Switzerland product.  I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> RapidLash Eyelash enhancing took about 4 to 6 weeks to work but all the sudden I noticed huge difference my lashes were so long I didn&#x27;t need to put so much mascara and if you know me I love mascara.</li>
    <li> This is as good as City Lash, but a lot less expensive !  Will continue to buy !</li>
    <li> Ive used both lattise and revital lash..although they both work fairly well, I saw a difference in rapid lash, in just a week. AND its a 3rd of the price. Deff recommend!! If you stop using it all together your eyelashes may fall out a litttle but thats normal and will happen with any eyelash growth serum you use. Id recommend using it once a week to maintain your long lashes!! Deff csnt live without this stuff!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a little over a month.....and I can definitely tell the difference.</li>
    <li> After I received it I kept reading the bad reviews and just could not get myself to put chemicals right by my eyes, so I sent it back without even opening it. I wish there were 100% natural eyelash serums that worked. If anyone has tried any, please comment below and let me know.</li>
    <li> I am in love as this product WORKS.  I am considering dyeing my lashes to avoid mascara altogether.  Now,  I use only color on the tips of my lashes as this product has given me very long and luxurious lashes.  I do know that I use only every other night now.  If I quit using it, I think my lashes will fall out (other reviewers mentioned).  I do not need more length now so I use every other night for maintenance.  This is the perfect product.</li>
    <li> made my eyes itchy and dry</li>
    <li> regular item purchase all the time good price</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product, but suddenly after about 3 weeks of consistent nightly use I did notice a difference!  Now I wish I had taken before &amp; after shots.  I only used it on my top row because the instructions on the box specifically say that and I wasn&#x27;t going to take any chances with my eyes.  When I saw results I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it on my bottom lashes too, but I found that it irritated my eyes.  I can&#x27;t imagine why that would be the case, maybe it works it&#x27;s way into the tear duct?  Anyway, they got noticeably red and itchy so I went back to just using on the top.  Some nice long lashes are better than none.</li>
    <li> Makes your lashes longer but not much fuller. My lashes are away longer than before. I look like having mascara without wearing one. No irritation or discomfort. You will start noticing the difference in just 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product works but it takes a long time to see the results. I have been using this for over a month. You have to be persistent and I find that it helps sometime to take a day or two break.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but it actually works.  I started using it and then stopped.  What started me to using it again was ironically, it appeared on Dr. Oz as a &amp;#34;Does it Really Work&amp;#34; product.  Apparently, the ingredients were originally used in glaucoma medication and the doctors/scientists discovered that it also caused the lashes of these glaucoma patients to grow.  The lady Dr. Oz had as a guest said that because the Rapid Lash does not have &amp;#34;prescription potency&amp;#34; it should be used twice a day but never at night. I followed her directions, accept I only used it once a day so my results were not as fast as 30 days. I have to say...WOW...my lashes have definitely grown to the point where I can actually use an eyelash curler!  Before, the idea of me even owning one was a joke.  If you want really fast results use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I put off buying this for a long time and now I realize that was a stupid move. I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s healthy to do the eyelash extensions and so I researched all different eyelash serums until I picked Rapid Lash. I started to see subtle results during my 3rd week (no lashes falling out and looking longer) and continued into the 4th. By week for (am on week 6) they were even longer. I had zero side effects, no stinging or burning, simple to apply every night and I will continue to buy this for a long time because I don&#x27;t want my lashes to go back to the way they were. They are extremely long now and almost touch my eyebrows. I&#x27;m sure if I put 2 coats of dark mascara they would look fake. I highly recommend the product BUT do be sure to do it every night on a clean eyelash. It delivers if you follow the instructions :)</li>
    <li> It was pretty much empty and expired - don&#x27;t know if it really works - not enough serum in the container</li>
    <li> I certainly was skeptical about the product and fearful of some of the warnings of permanent skin and eye color changes, but I&#x27;m happy to report neither has happened in the two months I&#x27;ve been using RL. The first month I noticed a difference in length, and by the end of the second month I&#x27;m finally seeing a difference in fullness. It&#x27;s reduced my lash loss a lot - I&#x27;m guessing my wash routine and mascara use were rough on them and RL has helped strengthen them enough to withstand it. One tube lasts a long time so I definitely feel the cost is worth it.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are so long!</li>
    <li> This really worked for me!! My lashes are fabulous now!!</li>
    <li> Nope. Did absolutely nothing for me. Didn&#x27;t even really condition my eyelashes. Previously I had been using Talika Lipocils, and I must say that that product truly works. I felt I should switch it up and use something people are constantly raving about - wish I didn&#x27;t. Honestly was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had very good results with this product.  My lashes were already short and sparse, but summertime allergies caused itching, and the constant rubbing didn&#x27;t help at all.  After using RapidLash for about two weeks, I could already tell a difference.  I&#x27;m still using my first order, but plan to purchase more.  I actually have lashes that I can see now!</li>
    <li> works for men who have ever had the unfortunate experience of dealing with trichotillomania.</li>
    <li> Works well. See results with time. On my 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this because i heard other good reviews. Every time i use this i see major results (much longer lashes) within only a couple days. the problem i have with this is that my lashes become very fragile and stiff and almost all of them fall out every time i remove my mascara. I think it just depends on the person. For 35 dollers i dont think this is worth finding out if it will work for you unless you are verry deperate.</li>
    <li> 7 MONTHS EXPIRED!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;EXPIRATION DATE ON BOTTOM WAS 01/14!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It works!  I&#x27;ve applied it nightly and within three words, noticed lengthening. After two months of use, my lashes are longer and fuller.</li>
    <li> This product................barely WORKED AND CAUSED ME TO GET AN EYE INFECTION.&lt;br /&gt;It was my second bottle and I used twice a day. DID not work at all after one month 1 time per day and my hair grows like crazy every where else. My lashes after 4 months of Mary K lash extend look awesome.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  I use it on my eyebrows and they grow fuller and it is true to the product that it takes only about 3 weeks to see results.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately some of the top reviewers (and the ingredients list) reflect a RapidLash that doesn&#x27;t contain isopropyl cloprostenate - the active ingredient. A lot of these 4 and 5 star ratings are for the old formula, not the new one. The new formula is just some eyelash conditioner - just get a little brush and apply some nutritive oil along your eyelashes instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy the good version from Amazon.co.uk!</li>
    <li> I tried this product and, after two containers, found that there was some enhancement to both length and fullness; however, I also started to experience a severe reaction where the skin around my eyes became quite inflamed.  It took time to build to this reaction but it was extremely uncomfortable and unattractive.  the situation improved as soon as I stopped using RapidLash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months and it&#x27;s working! however I still think it&#x27;s a bit pricy</li>
    <li> hands down best there is at a livable price. my lashes went from non existent to amazing. gotta keep using but thats fine with me as long as they keep the price reasonable. so worth it</li>
    <li> This product is incredible.  I&#x27;m very wary of products claiming to do just about everything.  I have blue eyes so I wouldn&#x27;t try lattise because of eye color warnings.  I asked someone at Ulta about an eyelash lengthener and he told me about rapidlash.  He said it was best seller and more importantly best RESELLER.  I tried it and absolutely love it.  I use it every night without fail - simple to apply and no side issues.  I just purchased rapid brow - hope it works as well.  JUST DO IT!</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Put it on every night before bed like liquid eyeliner (but clear) and soon enough I had pretty long lashes!  Long as in, when I look up, I can feel them on the skin under my eyebrows (if that makes any sense).  Anyways, this was recommended to me by my (very fabulous) aunt and since using it myself my mom and sister have both expressed a desire to try it after seeing my results.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now so I&#x27;ll update if it stops working.  This just works great so I have great looking lashes without falsies (because no one likes a fake girl) so as long as it keeps working I&#x27;ll do it.  I may try latisse or something in the future... I have a friend who works in a dermatologist office and says a prescription lasts about a year and it&#x27;s about $100 so about the same as this if you compare apples to apples.  I have a feeling prescription stuff may work better (so even longer lashes?) and this is a bit irritating to my eyes.  Nothing major but I have very sensitive eyes - as in I have tried so many mascaras and only Ulta brand Mascaras keep me from waking up the next morning with angry, red, puffy, hurting eyes.  So I doubt most people would be sensitive to the RapidLash Serum.  But overall I&#x27;m very happy with my longer eyelashes!</li>
    <li> Delivery good. Results not so good.</li>
    <li> Not sure if the ratings are paid ratings but not only does this thing not work, it also caused my eyes to twitch.  My eyes were twitching non stop till I realized it could have been this serum.  I then stopped using it and no more twitching.  I even applied sometimes more than twice per day and no noticeable difference in lashes.  I&#x27;m pretty pissed that I can&#x27;t get a refund for it now.  I wasted all that money for a bottle with water in it.</li>
    <li> It works, but if you donot insist on using it. Eyelashes will drop off.</li>
    <li> I love RapidLash! I have been using this for about 2 months now and my lashes are longer than ever. I used to use L&#x27;Oreal lash serum and that worked well too but the effects when trying RapidLash beat L&#x27;Oreal by far.&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian and have very thin delicate lashes that fall out all the time. I had to constantly try to hide the bare spots on my lash line with mascara and eyeliner. It was a never-ending battle. I tried the L&#x27;Oreal product first and was happy that my lashes started growing in more. I read reviews on yelp and decided to invest more and try RapidLash. It is totally worth it. I put this on every night before I sleep and in the morning before I go to work. (I don&#x27;t wear any make-up at work, I don&#x27;t know if this makes a difference) But when I do decide to curl my lashes and put mascara on, I can see how much it has worked. My lashes are full and long. People think that I am wearing fake lashes or have the lash extensions on.</li>
    <li> This works as good as Latisse or other expensive prices.  I use every night and my lashes are unbelievable.  They almost look like false lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Used this product for over a month to a month and a half now. My lashes are longer and a little fuller but more noticeable in length. People ask me where I get my lashes done. When I tell them they&#x27;re not fake and my real lashes they&#x27;re amazed!! Great lash product and totally recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. MY LASHES FALL OUT CONSTANTLY AND WHEN I USE THIS SERUM, MY LASHES GROW LIKE CRAZY. I DON&#x27;T EVEN NEED MASCARA. I AM CRAZY ABOUT IT. EVEN MY HUSBAND NOTICED MY LASHES AND YOU KNOW HUSBANDS RARELY NOTICE ANYTHING. LOL!</li>
    <li> IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;I NOW USE SOMETHING ELSE.&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS IS LATISSE WHICH IS TOO EXPENSIVE AND TOO MANY WASTEFUL BRUSHES.</li>
    <li> Really works but you must continue to use it, the results are not permanent.  Takes about two weeks to see the difference but then it kicks in nicely. Tube lasts a long while because you only need a very small amount.</li>
    <li> It actually works. I am currently at week 12 and I&#x27;ve notice a big difference in the length of my lashes as well as the number of lashes on my eye lids. I get comments about my lashes now from family and friends on how long they are. Previously, they have been sparse and short due to my eyelash curler and constant non-stop mascara use. The only reason why I have not given 5 stars is due to the fact that I got dark circles around my eyes that I did not have before I started applying this product. Now it looks as though I haven&#x27;t fully taken off brown eye shadow around my eyes. Now, I no longer need mascara but need concealer. I recommend it for people who want longer lashes but don&#x27;t mind dark circles around their eyes.</li>
    <li> This works! Used regularly before bedtime every night, It took about 2 months to see noticeable results. My lashes are noticeably longer.  Love the product</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully, but be warned, when you stop using it your lashes go back to their original length</li>
    <li> Love it... As always works great!!!</li>
    <li> I used it on my eyebrows, and they are slightly thicker and there are new ones growing. I have only used it for approximately 3 weeks, and the results are visible.</li>
    <li> It does nothing but irritate my eyelids and makes them red.  It&#x27;s a waste of time and money.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> my lashes start to grow in nice way. i like this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  My lashes were ok before using rapidlash but now they are so long with mascara, they look fake.  Love this product.  Took a few weeks to work and now I use it every other night or so.</li>
    <li> Used this product for almost 2months. I did notice some darkening of lashes and my lashes got silkier and maybe a little longer but not fuller</li>
    <li> Love this product! been using for around 6 months. ive always had long lashes but i was curious to try this product after hearing a lot of hype over it. I started noticing a difference around two weeks after steady use. fast-forward to now and my lashes rarely fall out and have grown like crazy! totally recomend this product, worth the money!</li>
    <li> Being using this and I can see some growth on my eyelashes.  Don&#x27;t think they will get extremely long but it does help.  They are thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> this actually works for me. Takes about a month. Had to stop using because of cataract surgery and lashes became shorter,, but after I started again, eyelashes grew back to where they were when I resumed using product.</li>
    <li> My wife says this is supposed to miraculously grow her lashes in three weeks but I have not seen this and I do not think any of these age defying things work. They are gimmicks and the bottom line is people are going to age, so save your money on your kids and spare the creams and serums for Hollywood.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product now for three weeks.  I have seen some changes, but only recently.  I do not have any discoloration or irritations other reviews mentioned.  Considering the cost to other eyelash enhancer serums, this one is pretty good!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price! Works just like the expensive brand sold at salons for a whole lot less.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about 2 years and it really works. You must use it every night for about 6 weeks to see the full results.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this before and it lasted a long time.  It is amazing.  However, my latest order had 1/4 of the product in the tube.  Probably will pay more for Latisse next time.</li>
    <li> I first used this product in 2009 and it took 2 mo of continued use to notice any results, and then it quit working for me totally after 8 mo. Since that time I have used several different eyelash enhancing serums, including Latisse, with non optimal results. I decided to retry RapidLash since it did work for me several years ago. Once again, it took two months to &amp;#34;kick in&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll see if it stops enhancing after 8 months.</li>
    <li> use it for my eyebrows, my brows have gotten thicker! yay</li>
    <li> I like this better than Lattisse....goes on thicker so doesn&#x27;t flow into your eyes. I had no dry out or breakage from this product</li>
    <li> Not too expensive, it came a bit late but product works wonderfully, really enhances your eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I have been using RapidLash for years.  It has changed my life.  I have purchased it at Costco, and Amazon.com.  I am 54 years old, and always had short, blonde eye lashes and almost invisible eyebrows ( I never have had to pluck or wax them).  The 1st time that I started using Ra pidLash, I noticed a difference in 4 days.  I use a 10X mirror, so maybe that is how I noticed a difference so soon.  The product does not work as well on my eyebrows, but any bit helps.</li>
    <li> I am using this since years, great product, no discoloration and usable with contacts. Recommended it to some friends and they all love it.</li>
    <li> It actually works, not so much on the thickness but the length did improve a lot. Totally recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I was missing half my lashes from both eyes. I usually have full, long lashes but they fell out for some unknown reason. I used RapidLash every night  and began to see new lashes at 4 weeks. By week 7 my lashes had filled in. On the down side, when the RapidLash got into my eyes I&#x27;d wake up in the morning with very red eyes and they&#x27;d hurt when I looked to the side. My eyes also seemed to be more sensitive to the sun. I started using less RapidLash and fanning them dry.  Just be really applying it and don&#x27;t use too much. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> some new hair growth but not much. I think my eyebrow got darker from use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE this. I did some amazon research as well as looking at photos from google to instagram. I have fairly long lashes already but this took them to a whole new level. I started using 2x a day morning and night and my lashes went got longer thicker and even curly. I don&#x27;t need an eye lash curler and any mascara will do. I just ordered a new bottle and am only using it at night now. Wanted to do the 2x a week to get me started faster. I would say the bottle will last a good month,</li>
    <li> Works great for getting long lashes, but if you want thicker lashes it doesn&#x27;t work as well. I already have long lashes and wanted thicker ones. Takes a lot longer to get the thicker look. But they will get longer with in a month or so. I didn&#x27;t have any side affects. The bottles do come expired a lot of the time (by a month or so), but they seem to still work fine.</li>
    <li> Really upset with this product. I got it and it had already been expired for over 6 months..</li>
    <li> This works. I am 52 and my lashes were down to nothing. This is great and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes as bloodshot as some of the others do. I like it much better than Latisse and it is far less expensive and no RX required.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have used Latisse, and it burned my eyelids.  It did work,  but was painfully expensive and painful to use.  Rapid Lash produces the same results with no pain either to my eyelids or my wallet.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
    <li> Great product .....really does work...but once you stop using it ...the hairs stop also..</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product</li>
    <li> FAB PRODUCT USED FOR SEVERAL YEARS</li>
    <li> YES! I&#x27;ve been longing for long eyelashes after envying a friend who gets eyelash extensions. I don&#x27;t want to have to pay for extensions, so I&#x27;ve instead invested in RapidLash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not seen hugely dramatic results, but I&#x27;ve seen great improvements. My eyelashes are longer and thicker, and less easily pulled out when I&#x27;m removing eye make-up. You can really tell the difference when I wear mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light brown eyes and have not noticed any discoloration of the iris or skin on the eyelid. I will continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Second time that I buy it, and I can´t be happier...of course it doesn´t work as latisse, you won´t get a dramatic effect, but it definitely works! Nowadays I´m mostly wearing clear mascara, I only use a color one for a night out as I really don´t need it. As a contact user I can also say is totally safe.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm ! Been using it for years and it&#x27;s made my lashes thick &amp; longer!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes actually grew!  Holy crap!</li>
    <li> disappointing results</li>
    <li> I use this and KALISI SKYHIGH LASHES both. I did need to use them for three months but finally got my lashes going. Keep with it, don&#x27;t give up, especially if you have very fair short lashes like me. I&#x27;m over 30 so age is not on my side, but I do now have beautiful lashes thanks to both products.</li>
    <li> If you do as it says, It will work. I love my lashes and all my family and friends have noticed!!!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any results, i applied this product before bedtime everyday and no results were noticed.</li>
    <li> Does not work, been using it for 4 months and no changes.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me as expected.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work, but just didn&#x27;t see a difference. I did not experience the burning or stinging that some have mentioned, however. It might work as a lash conditioner, if you believe that is all you need?</li>
    <li> Love it!  My lashes are incredible now! Longer and fuller.  I  am just thrilled that I have such beautiful lashes. Lashes that can tickle me daughter&#x27;s cheek. Revivals my sister-in-law&#x27;s lashes and she uses the super expensive lash product.&lt;br /&gt;Slight darkening by lashes but it&#x27;s slight and can be part of a &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; eye look.</li>
    <li> It really does the work1</li>
    <li> Best ever, makes your eyelashes grow but you can miss a day, it does take a while 3 weeks to see improvements. so be paitience</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and it does add length and as you get older you certainly need more volume, and this does it!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, took about 3-4 weeks but really seeing the results!!!!!  Even my husband noticed :)</li>
    <li> This product really works!  Love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, however I felt compelled to review Rapid Lash.  I have to be honest, I didn&#x27;t see results until 3-4 weeks and now I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months now and I have been getting compliments on my lashes left and right.  People think I have extensions.  It didn&#x27;t make my lashes thinker, but they are incredibly long.  I just love it!</li>
    <li> Works great...lashes longer, fuller after about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Oddly enough, this worked better on my eyebrows than my eyelashes. But I&#x27;m happy with the results. After 7 weeks of nightly applications before bed, I see a significant difference. My natural arch has grown back. I&#x27;m hoping they get even thicker because I&#x27;m loving my eyebrow shape. I guess after years of over tweezing, I had completely forgotten what my natural eyebrows were shaped like. I&#x27;m very happy and this is the best price for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for anyone with thin brows.</li>
    <li> Not sure how well this stuff works because I just started using it but I have heard really good things about it in the past which is why I bought it. Product was shipped and arrived quickly and I am happy with it so far!</li>
    <li> Rapid Lash makes my eyelashes grow longer and stay in longer than without using it which makes them thicker.  I won&#x27;t skip an application!</li>
    <li> So far looking good .</li>
    <li> seem to be effective, but not apparent.</li>
    <li> I used this product a couple times within 2 weeks and saw a difference. A couple&lt;br /&gt;People even though my lashes were fake.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE It.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this since July, when my sister and I bought a dual pack at Costco. It works great for me. No burning or irritation. Have to be patient and use every night for a month like it says. At almost 60, my eyelashes were sparse and my eyebrows were getting gray and sparse. There is definite difference! My eyebrows are thicker and darker and my eyelashes are noticeably longer - makes my eyes look younger. I will continue to use. I don&#x27;t know what happens when you stop using it, I haven&#x27;t had a break in use since July. My tubes last about 2.5 months.</li>
    <li> Great service and a great price.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  This is my second purchase.  It worked the first time, but I stopped using it after a while and forgot about it.  Your lashes will go back to their skimpy, short length after awhile.  My lashes were so short I would barely get them into an eyelash curler.  Then I remember this product.  Repurchased and have regained longer lashes.  It takes a few weeks, but this stuff really works!</li>
    <li> The product did increase the length of my lashes...not so much the fullness or thickness.  I was hoping for the fullness more than length.  Still would recommend for those out there that want longer lashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now on my eyebrows and eyelashes. I mainly bought them for my eyebrows, since a lady at the salon made them razor thin!!! A month ago, I could not leave the house without penciling in my brows. Now, after using this twice a day, they are just thick enough to leave the house without doing anything to them!! .  My eyelashes are definitely longer. It is not that noticeable when they are not curled, but when I use a curler without mascara they look a lot longer than they used to be. I probably won&#x27;t  need to use mascara after the second month of using this.  Mascara makes my lashes fall out anyway!</li>
    <li> I tried those expensive lash growth items and none of them worked as good as this one. I will buy again and again and again.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, especially after I didn&#x27;t see results in the first month. But I stuck with it, and once a week I am asked by total strangers...&amp;#34;are those your real eyelashes?!&amp;#34; Coworkers. The Dentist. My husband. It totally works! I had stubby little lashes, and now I have lashes that touch my eyelids when curled! Pair this with a black lash tint at your salon and you&#x27;ll never need to wear mascara again.</li>
    <li> The formula must have been changed. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> After only 2 weeks so an amazing difference.  Lashes were longer and maybe a little darker.  Going on three weeks and so far no side effects of dryness or redness.</li>
    <li> Sorry, results not to my liking</li>
    <li> Works well if you use it for several weeks at a stretch.</li>
    <li> This product totally works! I use it every morning after my shower and I have super long lashes.. I had used a very expensive competitor&#x27;s product previous but I have to be honest and say that this product works just as well and is far less expensive. I am very happy with the results and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> My Eyelashes start growing after 4  days</li>
    <li> Just wish they were larger tubes for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product. It really works as promised! My eyelashes were noticably longer and thicker after four weeks... Unfirtunately I developed an allergy to one of the ingredients which made my eyelids itch and sting, had the exact same problem with the latisse so i had to stop using it. Be careful not to get the product in the inner pockets of your eyes through tears or dripping as it will grow hair as well and it hurts to pull out! Would highly recommend product!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical but, after reading many of the reviews, I decided to try it.  I was amazed -- IT WORKS!  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> this really !does make a difference</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF JUST WORKS! PERIOD POINT BLANK! I WAS TRYING TO BE CHEAP AND NOT PURCHASE ANYMORE AND TRY LESS EXPENSIVE WAYS TO GROW MY LASHES BUT THAT WAS AN EPIC FAIL! WENT BACK TO THIS BECAUSE IT WORKS EVERYTIME! AND AMAZON IS MY GO TO SITE FOR VALUE BECAUSE I CAN&#x27;T GET IT CHEAPER ANYWHERE ELSE.  WORKS JUST AS WELL AS LATISSE WHICH I&#x27;VE USED IN THE PAST! GIVE IT ABOUT 2-3 WEEKS TO START SEEING SOME RESULTS, BUT I GUARANTEE YOU THAT YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED! I&#x27;M NOT A &#x27;FAKE EYELASH&#x27; KIND OF GIRL SO GROWING MY LASHES IS MY ONLY OPTION.  IF YOU&#x27;RE LIKE ME, THEN THIS IS A MUST!</li>
    <li> I do think it helped my sparse eyelashes.  It makes them longer with consistent use over at least 4-6 wks.  It does not make lashes darker and it is not as effective as Latisse or Lil lash but it is much more cost effective.  I had no irritation, easy to use, and does improve eyelash length and decrease breakage.  You do have to use it everyday as suggested and be patient because it does take time to see the growth. I will continue to order</li>
    <li> OMG this product rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very small. It&#x27;s the size of an average mascara tube. I was very skeptical at first but,  after I read the review written by a guy who noticed his sister&#x27;s lashes without telling him, I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Packaged arrived on time as promised. I have ZERO lashes. So I&#x27;ve been using it 2x/week. Plus it  wouldn&#x27;t hurt adding  this step to my skincare routine. It&#x27;d just replace the coconut oil. HAhA.  I get ready for my night skincare routine( remove make up, falsies, eyeliner, etc..), wash my face, my boyfriend pops out of nowhere and yells, &amp;#34;Babe, you have lashes.&amp;#34; ***then zooms in on my profile  q(O.o!)P .....&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;yes that was the face he made. I laughed so hard yet embarrassed at the same time and thinking ..&amp;#34;Yes! yes!  Yes! it&#x27;s working! ya know? Like finally a product that works&amp;#34; I have been thinking about getting the lashes extensions instead of rocking the falsies. I get tired of glue, and it burns sometimes, and it peels between wears....urrrrhhgggg Frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using it. I read the instructions on the back as you always should with any product. The instructions say o apply this at night time after removing all make up for the best results; it also mentions the product can be applied WITH make up but advises to make sure it is applied directly on the skin before applying make up. That&#x27;s why I use it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not get this product anywhere on your tear-duct.  It will slightly burn. I made the mistake of this by not completely drying that area before applying the product. After this incident i applied a little higher than suggested for fear it burns again.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 weeks now since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I took the chance to look in the mirror while my bf was starring at me and I could actually see the thicker, fuzzier, full new set of growing lashes shooting out. Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A  lot of people were talking about a darker line on the eyelid from using this product? I keep watch for that but didn&#x27;t see one. Not, yet at least if there is one. My skin is Olive so it doesn&#x27;t even matter. lol.  The serum feels like gel on the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t naturally burn, just make sure to completely dry that area.  I did a apply to the lower lash line, and it&#x27;s working wonders ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the results. Nothing wrong the product. I only gave 4 stars because, now i need LENGTH!. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was Helpful......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Apply to skin! NOT lashes. Product needs to be absorbed by the skin in order to trigger growth!</li>
    <li> It was past the pull date when I received it!</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything in the beginning, but I decided to stick it through and just use it and see what happens - and I&#x27;m so happy I did. It&#x27;s been great. My eyebrows are really filling in and I love seeing the little hairs where I haven&#x27;t had any in forever. I&#x27;m not exactly Lily Collins but thank God I&#x27;m not Bette Davis either.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s well worth the price. Just use it, give it a month or two and then revel in the fact that your eyebrows are really looking gorgeous.</li>
    <li> This product does work.  I&#x27;ve used the prescription Latisse in the past and I found that this works just as well for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this eyelash enhancing serum and can already see some difference in the lushness of my eyelashes. My lashes are definitely darker as well as my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve only been using for a short while and will have to reserve more comments after longer use ; )</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Be patient. I used every day for about 4 weeks and then I started noticing my lashes were longer and thicker. The only down side is as soon as you stop using or even if you miss a few days they go back to normal.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Best I have found.</li>
    <li> Get ready, it works!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My eyelashes are long and beautiful.  I am asked nearly everyday if my eyelashes are real.  I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara anymore, but when I do, my lashes are noticed.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years and it still is working wonderful for me!</li>
    <li> This is hands-down and eyelash-batting The Best of this type. Which is why your salon will charge you 3x Amazon&#x27;s price!</li>
    <li> I have used this for about two years now, Definitely has worked for me. I will keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought Rapid Lash 4 times now and I can say that it really does work if you use it consistently.  I would have given it 5 stars except this last bottle was different.  When I used the other 3 bottles, you could see a significant improvement in length and strength in my lashes.  Even if I skipped a day here or there, the results were very significant.  I received many compliments about the length and of my lashes. I loved it! However, this 4th bottle must be old or the formula just changed as there doesn&#x27;t seem to be as much of a difference (maybe a little longer, but not dramatically different). I&#x27;m 1/2 way through the bottle and am considering buying another just to see if this one was a fluke.  I hope so as I really did love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product enough - my lashes are longer, thicker, darker.  I&#x27;m 53 and have the lashes of a 25 year old - get it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for about 4 months and as a black female this is one product that I did notice length and darker lashes.  As for my brows it does work but very very slow. slower than the lashes but just be patience and before you realize you will notice that your mascara on your lashes are looking longer and I&#x27;ve had people even ask me if my lashes were real.  That&#x27;s the ultimate compliment.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot through Amazon and am always reluctant to place a less than great review as people who like the product at times act like I personally attacked them but this product is so not worth the money, at least for ME! Background, I tried it about a year and  a half ago and saw absolutely no change after following the directions and using for two months. In my desire for awesome lashes I did eyelash extensions for 2 months. After opting to stop doing that I found my lashes damaged and shorter than before. I take many selfies to document things so my imagination doesn&#x27;t influence my perception of  the results. I decided to try Rapid Lash again, assuming it had to work as my lashes were already shorter and thinner then usual. I saw absolutely no improvement after two months of using this product. If it works for you great but my experience has taught me to never waste money on it again!!!</li>
    <li> It does seem to help eyelashes look longer but it made my eyes red and the rims became somewhat inflamed. I had to discontinue use within the first week.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well for me and I am very pleased with the results. You need to use it for awhile, 1 month to 6 weeks before you see the results. Nice to have great eyelashes again!</li>
    <li> I used it every night( I&#x27;m sure I skipped like a night every week) and by the end of the month I had really noticeable results. Many say the application area darkens and I think mine did but just a very little nothing noticeable. I saw it because I was regularly checking for that but no one else did. My eyelashes were long and very voluminous and I didn&#x27;t even use a lot of product  to get results. My tube lasted me for well over a month almost 2-3 maybe. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Lilash before and Rapidlash does the same or better for less than half the price. Also, sometimes if I put on too much on my lower lashes, Rapidlash does cause a little itching but it&#x27;s never as bad as the irritation and redness I had from using Lilash. I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for two months now and there&#x27;s been a noticeable growth in the length of my lashes. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made my lashes thicker though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product and I hope my lashes keep growing.</li>
    <li> It did exactly what I wanted it to do----enhanced eyebrows that were beginning to thin out.&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Works really well for me. Never had long lashes before and now they touch my glasses when I blink!</li>
    <li> Quick results - longer lashes within a month.  Wish it made them fuller too but I love it!</li>
    <li> Product was expired &amp; didn&#x27;t work as good!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works as promised!  Have long, thicker lashes again.  Definition worth the money!</li>
    <li> This product has good reviews because it used to work well for people, because it used to contain the eyelash-growing ingredient called isopropyl cloprostenate. Even though this ingredient is listed in the ingredients on this Amazon page (as of when I ordered it in 12/2014), I just received this product today (manufacturing date 7/2014) and the box does not list isopropyl cloprostenate. Save your money and find a product with isopropyl cloprostenate in the ingredients, or go to a dermatologist&#x27;s office and get Latisse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am copying and pasting a review from a beauty website www.paulaschoice.com below (written in 11/2014) . I found this article helpful in making my decision to return RapidLash.&lt;br /&gt;RapidLash is a cosmetic product claiming to grow lashes. Like many companies with their version of lash-growing products, RapidLash seems in to compete with Allergan’s expensive prescription-only version called Latisse, which costs considerably more. Most of these Latisse-wannabes are nothing more than colorless liquid eyeliners with some peptides or plant extracts thrown in even though these have no research showing they can affect hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original formula of RapidLash stood apart not only because it costs considerably less than Latisse but it did, at least in theory, work to grow lashes. Sadly, a legal threat from Allergan led to the company changing RapidLash&#x27;s formula, and the new version no longer contains the potentially effective ingredient found in the original, as we discuss below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A serious distinction between Latisse and original formula RapidLash is Latisse, as a prescription-only drug, is subject to intense scrutiny, proof of safety and efficacy by the FDA that RapidLash is not. Rocasuba, the company that distributes RapidLash, has done some amount of their own testing, but it pales in comparison to the level of testing Latisse went through to prove what it can and can&#x27;t do and what risks accompany its benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claims for RapidLash are carefully worded so they remain strictly cosmetic and not like a drug but here&#x27;s the difference: the original formula of RapidLash contained an ingredient that quite possibly allows it to work like Lattise. However, as mentioned above, the current formula does NOT contain this ingredient, which is why we no longer recommend RapidLash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the original RapidLash formula: The active ingredient in Latisse is bimatoprost. Bimatoprost is the active ingredient in the prescription medication Lumigan used to treat glaucoma. Patients with glaucoma who used Lumigan noticed their eyelashes really grew and got darker. Allergan owns Lumigan and so they took advantage of this side effect and obtained FDA approval to sell the active ingredient as a lash growing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RapidLash&#x27;s original formula contained an ingredient called isopropyl cloprostenate, which has some distant molecular similarities to bimatoprost. While there is no published research showing isopropyl cloprostenate can grow lashes, its relation to bimatoprost clearly exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This association is the likely explanation behind RapidLash original formula&#x27;s effectiveness. Given the original formula worked similarly to Latisse, it was also possible that the same side effects associated with Latisse could occur when using original formula RapidLash, yet those concerns don&#x27;t exist for the current formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So should you consider trying the latest RapidLash formula for longer lashes and fuller eyebrows? Sadly, no. The Paula&#x27;s Choice Research Team has used the original formula with much success, though some of us also got a bluish-red discoloration along the lashline. The current formula replaced the isopropyl cloprostenate with a blend of peptides and plant extracts that do not have any substantiated research proving they effect lash growth, volume, or color, and this is the version the majority of online and in-store retailers are selling now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: A pricier version of RapidLash is sold as Neulash. These lash-enhancing products are nearly identical and neither is all that effective, so there&#x27;s no need to spend almost twice as much on Neulash (you may see it on cosmetic counters at Neiman Marcus department stores).</li>
    <li> Be careful, as this product caused bad inflammation on my lids. I only used it once but my eyes were so inflamed for 10 days, it hurt. I have never had experienced any allergic reaction to any cosmetics or others. To avoid such fate, I suggest testing the product on the inside part of your wrist in a circular pattern. If after 24 hours you have no reaction, then try a small amount on only half of the lid. Only then should you go on using it, if you want to be certain that you are not allergic to this formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully since it arrived two months ago and really don&#x27;t see any significant difference.  I expected my lashes to get thicker, but they are as sparse as ever and I must be doing something wrong with all the glowing reviews this product receives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I run out, I will not be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> Takes awhile to notice a difference but it really does work. Three weeks into using it I could notice longer lashes, and a month into it everyone else started noticing.</li>
    <li> This works for me.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it and the best price I found was on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really thin, light and short lashes that get more so as I get older (senior citizen here).  This doesn&#x27;t do anything to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; up the lashes I have so only four stars, but it has made my lashes longer and I have a few more which is all I really expected at my age.  My lashes appear to be a bit darker as well.  I do know of people -- much younger -- who have had better results with the prescription product; but this is a great price for something similar that does a decent job for me.  I&#x27;m not sure that the vastly more expensive prescription product would do any better; but am not willing to spend the funds to try it.</li>
    <li> It works! Lost my lashes after chemo and they never came back. It&#x27;s never going to be perfect anymore but thanks to this stuff I do have lashes again</li>
    <li> Really works if you remember to use it every night!</li>
    <li> I only purchased this due to the many positive reviews - was I blind?  Apparently so.  I put this on exactly as directed &amp; the only thing that grew was &amp;#34;MY HOPE&amp;#34; every single night - until I had a dream that I had long fluttering eyelashes - but as I said, It was just a dream.  Here&#x27;s what RapidLash did for me........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It acted like a mild form of glue, made some of my eye-lashes  stick together, l&amp; eft an awful scale along both top and bottom eyelashes (lesson well learned)  If I can save you time &amp; money - I&#x27;m sure happy to do so.</li>
    <li> Very good at lengthening my lashes within 2 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t seen a thickening/increased number of lashes.  Used it on my eyebrows and they have grown faster, but not thickened either.  Have used the same tube for 2.5 months, longer than expected which is a nice bonus.  Would recommend, especially for the lower price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Purchased after fake lashes ripped my real ones out in clumps.  I used daily before bed as instructed and within 2 weeks my lashes were well on their way to being back to normal. Between 2-3.5 weeks it was as if I never had fake lashes.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my third tube. I just use every other day. A tube lasts @2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Long, long lashes. Best price around. Finally beautiful lashes. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s  was irritating for my eyes,  so used for my eyebrows. yes it did work , got some more about 3 weeks later.</li>
    <li> Definatley makes my lashes MORE plentiful!! I wish it lasted longer though!!</li>
    <li> it took forever to get here and it burns my eyes</li>
    <li> Does not irritate my eyes and I had some improvement of eyelashes.  Think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Not as much as I liked Lilash, but this is working great!</li>
    <li> fast shipping.  works very well.  will keep using this product</li>
    <li> results in weeks but a lil itchy after putting them on</li>
    <li> Product works and the price was great</li>
    <li> I noticed my eyelashes grow up but then they fall out a bit :(</li>
    <li> Three weeks!  Longer! Fuller! Will continue use.  Very sensitive, blue eyes.  No burning. No eye discoloration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m seeing much of a difference</li>
    <li> i see results, but they are not too intense. I also don&#x27;t use it every night like I&#x27;m supposed to.</li>
    <li> So, after the FIRST night of wearing it, I woke up to a bloodshot right eye.  I was freaking out just a bit.  It didn&#x27;t hurt but it was NOT flattering.  Thought I&#x27;d give it another chance.  Nope.  The next day, I woke up with BOTH eyes super bloodshot and my left eye actually had some goop too.  I stopped using it immediately and it took at least 2 1/2 days for the bloodshot eyes to finally become clear.  I guess I&#x27;m highly allergic or sensitive to this &amp;#34;Wonderful&amp;#34; product.  Too bad it wasn&#x27;t WONDERFUL for me.  :(  Just going to stick with castor oil on the lash line.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months. Good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes if it gets into them!</li>
    <li> I have read a few reviews wherein RapidLash worked to start with, and then quit working and the reviewers&#x27; lashes got worse than ever. I sure hope that does not happen with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it now for at least 4-5 months. I don&#x27;t remember just when I started. It didn&#x27;t happen over night, but after about a month I thought I could see some improvement. Then a little further down the road I KNEW it was working. It has made a dramatic difference in my lashes, both thickening them up and lengthening them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 65 years old and I think I might possibly be having a thyroid problem. My hair started to thin, and then the eyebrows and eyelashes. Right now my lashes are very nice and I am still using RapidLash. I was very faithful to apply it EVERY night for quite a long time, but now there are probably 2-3 nights a week that I skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an old mascara brush and apply a light layer of vaseline to my lashes and brows at night. I&#x27;ve heard that it conditions them.</li>
    <li> This product is all natural and you can see results in 3 weeks. I was very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> IT REALLY WORKS I MEAN EVERYONE KEEPS ASKING ME HOW AND WHAT I AM DOING TO MY LASHES...... LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product &amp; very easy to use...I have only been using it a couple of weeks but already notice fuller lashes!!  From what I hear from my friends, they are really loving it too!!!</li>
    <li> First of all, the ingredients listed on this item is INACCURATE and pertains to another (maybe older) product.  The other (older?) RapidLash product with Isopropyl Cloprostenate is called RapidLash Eyelash Renewal Serum.  It also says PROMAXYL at the bottom of the product, instead of HEXATEIN.    The correct list of ingredients for this one with Hexatein can be seen on http://www.amazon.com/Rapidlash-Eyelash-Enhancing-Hexatein-Complex/dp/B00AWD5B9K/ref&#x3D;sr_1_7?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1421509124&amp;sr&#x3D;8-7&amp;keywords&#x3D;rapidlash    All that said, I&#x27;m using what may be the newer version that&#x27;s got Hexatein.  I&#x27;m seeing moderate improvement on my 5th week. I&#x27;ll update this post as my usage continues.    FDA Investigations on its website http://www.fda.gov/iceci/enforcementactions/warningletters/2011/ucm251951.htm:  Further online search showed that the original formulation which had Isopropyl Cloprostenate had been cited by the FDA in 2011 as \\&quot;Unapproved New Drug and Misbranded Drug\\&quot; and \\&quot;Adulterated and Misbranded Cosmetic\\&quot;.  \\&quot;Isopropyl Cloprostenate is a synthetic prostaglandin analog in the same class of compounds as the active ingredients in FDA-approved drugs...\\&quot; The manufacturer had been asked by the FDA to \\&quot;... take prompt action to correct the violations cited...\\&quot;.  This may explain why the product formulation has been altered.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product. I read some reveiws that were good and some bad, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try for myself. After about 2 weeks i noticed my lashes getting longer and after a month they started to thicken. I love my lashes. My lashes had been short and few over the last 2 yrs and I really wanted my long thick lashes back. I felt like I was looking older lately and it wasn&#x27;t until the Rapid Lash kicked in and my lashes grew and thickened up that I realized that it was the lack of lashes that, to me, made me appear older when I looked in the mirror. That really bothered me because I&#x27;ve always looked young &amp;#34;for my age&amp;#34; and I wasn&#x27;t ready to give that up, obviously lol. It&#x27;s a pleasure to put mascara on now! I have also used an eye serum around my eyes which got rid of all the dark circles, puffiness and crows feet around my eyes [[ASIN:B00NJYFTLE Oculift - Doctor Recommended Eye Serum for Diminishing Dark Circles, Puffiness, Bags, Fine Lines and Wrinkles.]] Now I don’t wear concealer and wear less mascara and no eye liner, just a slightly darker shade of eyeshadow on my lid line. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and have recommended it to my mother who has the same issue with her lashes and eyes, and several friends too. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a shot to try at the very least. You never know.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but it does not work since they took out a crucial ingredient due to a lawsuit submitted by Latisse manufacturer.</li>
    <li> good price and it is very effective.</li>
    <li> This product really works.</li>
    <li> It works!!!&lt;br /&gt;But a friendly reminder, it only help darken/strengthen/prolong any hair you already have. It won&#x27;t let sparse area grew denser.</li>
    <li> been using for 3 weeks and no difference yet!</li>
    <li> i read these reviews and wanted to believe them.  I had used Lattisse with good results but too expensive.  after using rapid lash for 6 weeks, nothing, absolutely no regrowth or new growth  a waste of money.  Costco should pull it from there shelves</li>
    <li> Ive been using many months now, part of my routine. After about 6 weeks I noticed my lashes touching my sunglasses. People comment on my lashes now and I&#x27;ve regrown my outer brow hair. Wouldn&#x27;t think of giving up and have friends and patients in our vascular practice using it too. We have cosmetic services in our office so I tried Latisse but with only a few lashes lengthening...looks spidery. Rapid lash seems to increase the number of lashes too. Please try thiis before spending a ton of money on other products.</li>
    <li> I had been using Latisse and after about seven months noticed diminishing results, including my lashes falling out, along with increasing irritation to my eyelids. Was about to give up on my lashes but decided to give Rapid Lash a try. I can honestly say that the results are equal to, and maybe better than my results with Latisse when it was working well for me. Specifically, my lashes seem longer and also thicker (seems like there are more rows of them) and my eyelids are no longer irritated. Got these great results after about a month using Rapid Lash and have been using it about three months now.</li>
    <li> I really used to love this stuff.  I don&#x27;t think it works as well as it used to.  But, it may not be working as well because I&#x27;m getting old stock.  I checked the date stamp on the bottom of the tube and it&#x27;s close to two years old.  I went to the manufacturer&#x27;s Web site and found this has a shelf life of two years.  I&#x27;m getting it much cheaper here but it&#x27;s not a bargain if it&#x27;s not going to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum on and off the past year. It has really helped me to grow long lashes and made them fuller as well while using it, but as soon as I stop, they return to the original state in a few weeks.  I use it now 2x, 3x a week to give them a gentle boost and have a less dramatic, but more natural effect.</li>
    <li> It works well but probably not as well as some of the more expensive preparations.  I&#x27;m hypothyroid so hair loss is a concern.  This does keep my eyebrows and eyelashes intact.</li>
    <li> This product might work but due to the fact I couldn&#x27;t get anything on the brush to apply to my eyelid, I will never know.</li>
    <li> It expired on February 2014, and I got it three days ago.</li>
    <li> I need longer to test it as it takes 6-8 weeks before you see results but initial results are positive!</li>
    <li> I have used generic Latisse in the past with very good results. I decided to try the rapid lash because it is less expensive. I have been pleasantly surprised with the results! I would recommend it!!</li>
    <li> My lashes are definitely longer and fuller. I also use an eyelash primer and the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; forming mascara. My eye lashes really pop now.</li>
    <li> It works! I&#x27;ve gone through several of these over the last couple years and they work great. My lashes are noticeably longer. I don&#x27;t think it makes them a lot thicker but I&#x27;m well satisfied with the length. I can get a couple months out of each container. A little goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> My friend recommended me Rapidlash eyelash enhancing serum. I&#x60;m using Rapidlash for month. I can see difference. I use it for my eyebrows.. It works)))My eyebrows look more bushy and it seems like they grow more than before.I hope i will continue grow after i stop to use it,i&#x60;m not sure if it will keep or not that&#x60;s why i gave 4 star. Otherwise i would give 5 star</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. No apparent results at all, even after using almost the entire tube. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Seems like a great product so far.  Have been using it along with Nutrilash (costs twice as much) product which was really working before I tried using Rapidlash.  I switched because of the reviews and lower cost of of Rapidlash.  Now I am not sure why I have long, luxurious eyelashes ( as in which product really did it)!  All I know is that both of these products seem to work wonders and I now am no longer tempted by other high end, overpriced products like Latisse.  Who needs it?  I actually was asked by my dermatologist what I was using because she noticed my eyelash growth.  When I told her, she wrote it down so she could recommend it.</li>
    <li> My lashes are short and stubby but there&#x27;s a visible difference after using Rapid Lash. I keep an extra tube on hand so I never run out.</li>
    <li> Have used this product successfully for a long time.  This one seemed to have less product.  Then there was a pinkish coloring on the applicator.  I threw it away after the pharmacist said it was a type of mold</li>
    <li> I tried RapidLash a bit skeptical but read my Blog review about it with pictures! https://fabinyour40s.wordpress.com/2015/01/29/rapid-lash-eye…nhancing-serum</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing the effects that were advertised.</li>
    <li> It took longer than a few weeks, but this product has really made a huge difference in how my eyelashes look.  People think I have on mascara and it&#x27;s just my natural lashes!</li>
    <li> It actually works! I have blonde very sparse eyelashes. I have seen a big improvement and growth with this product!</li>
    <li> It might work for someone but didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have been using it for 4.5 weeks and didn&#x27;t see any changes at all. Not even a bit. So, it definitely does not work as they claim  it would. It also make my eyes itchy every time I used it. So, it was 4.5 unpleasant weeks and no results at the end. So, the only one thing make me happy is I don&#x27;t have to keep using it anymore. I would not recommend this product. It just doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
    <li> love it...this is the first product I have purchased that actually worked on my lashes</li>
    <li> If you use this product every night you will see results!!! I am 55 years old and have nice eyelashes. I would recommend this product to everyone. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this very fast after order.  This product is amazing.  I had completely lost a section of lashes on my right eye.  After using this my lashes grew back long and luscious.  It took 1 month to completely grow out my lashes.  In still using it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is clearly a rip-off.  It does not work. I applied it just as directed and got absolutely no results.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed.  Saw no results. Knew it was to good to be true.  Not worth the money. Save your money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Rapid ash for @ years and find it works very well on my  brows. I have never tried it on lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem: It&#x27;s inconsistent with the quality control. continue  to receive some tubes that are totally dry, empty , or with  very little product .Other orders have arrived  with  full serum . I welcome feedback&amp;#62; Also Amazon has this product listed at different price points despite same wight. Advise welcome.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes have been nearly non-existent for as long as I can remember. I finally decided I wanted lashes, so I got extensions a couple of times. After the second time getting extensions, I noticed the glue took away many of my eyelashes and I was left with even fewer lashes. I thought about Latisse, but heard about the risks as well as the expense and the need for a doctor prescription. When I started using Rapid Lash, I was skeptical. I didn&#x27;t notice results for at least 3 weeks, but then all of a sudden, you start noticing the results. I have more eyelashes and they are thicker and longer. They don&#x27;t look like long and fake lashes, but they are finally noticeable. I will keep using and hopefully they will get even longer. I highly recommend this product: good results, inexpensive, no side effects and no prescription needed.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff. I have used it for a while and had not reorder for some time. Glad to have it back.</li>
    <li> I saw noticeable results around week 6, and ordered another tube. I&#x27;ve been using it, nightly, for close to a year now and my lashes have continued to grow and are falling out at a much slower rate than normal. I get compliments on my lashes all the time, now, and am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I am getting anything on brush. Is that right? or is the bottle empty?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why it works but it does!</li>
    <li> was looking for faster results</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day for about 5 weeks and I CAN REALLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE longer….my left lashes were always skimpier than the right, thats where I can really see the results the best!</li>
    <li> For an unknown reason some years back my eyelashes began falling out and breaking off to the point where it was embarrassing. I just had a few straggly lashes here and there along the lash lines. I tried vitamins which did not help.  Next I tried another eyelash serum which helped some but over time I still was not happy. In doing some more research on the Internet I recently ran across RapidLash Eyelash Enhancing Serum and thought what the heck, it&#x27;s worth a try. I&#x27;ve been using RapidLash for about 3 months and OMG, I am so amazed at the beautiful, long and thick eyelashes I now have! My lashes didn&#x27;t have this much fullness and length even before they fell out and broke off. I will continue to use this stuff probably forever. FYI Amazon has terrific prices too compared to the cosmetic and drug stores because I&#x27;ve comparison priced. If you want thicker, longer and healthier looking eyelashes in about 4 weeks (or less--for me), you just have to try RapidLash. I promise you it really, really works! Plus you can also use it on your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I feel like this might work for some people, either that or this business has a banging PR that goes heavy on the five-star reviewing, but I&#x27;ve had this for almost two months and still haven&#x27;t seen any crazy results after consistent usage. I don&#x27;t think my eyelashes have grown or become thicker, at least not noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve about given up on it, but in reality I will just keep trying until the tube runs out and if I STILL don&#x27;t see any magic, I&#x27;m not going to purchase another bottle.</li>
    <li> No, it doesn&#x27;t satisfy me at all!  I&#x27;ve been using same serum in different country zone and the result was incredible I start to see the difference on my 10th day of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The product under the same name which i purchase here is just a water and has 0 result! so sad....</li>
    <li> 2 weeks in and I am seeing a difference!! My lashes are getting longer!</li>
    <li> This is the only non-prescription eyelash enhancer that actually works. My lashes grew longer than I ever remember them being!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are softer and in better condition...but I did not notice any improvement in thickness or growth of my lashes.  So was a bit disappointed as I had hoped for more.</li>
    <li> been using over a month, haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference. but then again I haven&#x27;t measured.</li>
    <li> I started using this about 3 weeks ago. I gave up wearing mascara because it didn&#x27;t show up much.  Well today I tried the test, and applied mascara.  Wow I have eyelashes again. I can actually see them. Before I tried mascara and it hardly did anything. Wish I would have taken a before and after photo like someone else did.</li>
    <li> the shipping was  very fast, a real surprise</li>
    <li> Love this product, really works!</li>
    <li> not working i guess...</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt; After only a week or so of using it at night before bed, my lashes are fuller. With mascara on they look huge! I was skeptical at first and even considered getting expensive eyelash extensions, but now all I have to do is keep using RapidLash!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of results. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using RapidLash three months and it took most of that time to see a marked difference in my eyelashes.  However, my lash count has easily doubled or tripled and my lashes have darkened with its use.  I am 72 and my lashes were thinning due to age.  I had even stopped using mascara because it only emphasized how sparse they had become.  A friend recommended RapidLash to me.  I had tried a couple of other brands (both far more expensive) and neither had worked.  But her lashes were looking especially lush, so I gave it a go and have been really pleased with the results.  I’ve purchased a second tube for when I run out, but I’ve used it every day for three months and my first tube isn’t gone yet.  This product really delivers what it promises!</li>
    <li> Mind you, I have been plucking my eyebrows since high school (about 20 years ago), but when I bought this product it sounded like from the reviews that I was going to grow a miraculous amount of hair back. I barely have 5 more hairs than I did before. Maybe if I kept on applying the product for 20 more years I would have all my eyebrows back, but in the meantime I think I&#x27;ll keep my money.</li>
    <li> I have used this previously and it really fills in my sparse lashes.  It does need to be used regularly to get the full effect, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Works for when you put it not when you stop using it. .. but you can hardly tell the difference before or after... they kinda fall of when stop using it so it was a waste of $ for me didnt really work for me sorry:/</li>
    <li> I have very short lashes and after two weeks they are already filling in and lengthening! Easy to use and no side effects.</li>
    <li> I received the product a few days ago and used it the first night. Woke with very red lids along the eyelash line. It&#x27;s been three days and one eye is still red. Someone suggested using it only twice a week and, eventually, my lids will adjust.  It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been a Latise user for several years. I loved the results, but hated the price tag. After reading a ton of reviews on RapidLash I decided to give it a try. I hadn&#x27;t used Latise in a few months when I started so my lashes were not as long and full as they once had been when using Latise regularly. I applied RapidLash in the evening, every night for a month and was really surprised to see my lashes were beginning to fill out and lengthen again. They are not as long and full as with Latise, but I can honestly say I am very happy with the results. I think I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I used it before but not consistently and did get results but probably would&#x27;ve been even better had i put it on everyday per instructions. I didn&#x27;t get to document photos but wanted to share my experience this time around where I had week 1, two, and 3. I had little to no lashes before which I didn&#x27;t get a photo of as I use to get extensions done and it was getting so costly and time consuming, i went back to this product because I know it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the tube beside my toothbrush so I remember to put it on before bed or in the morning and let it set before I do my makeup. Yes, it does seem to work (for me) even doing my makeup and using my normal liquid eyeliner etc. I did have some mascara on in the last two photos but wanted to show how amazing my results have been just 3 weeks in!!</li>
    <li> This gave me more lashes but made them shorter! its good if youre looking for thickness and not length</li>
    <li> It really works, but you must use it consistently.</li>
    <li> my second one....eyelashes are growing as i expect</li>
    <li> I used this nightly for about 6 weeks, then stopped because I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement. I was aiming to re-grow some lashes in a particular spot of my eyelid, where they had fallen out. It looked like I had a bald spot on my eyelid, and looked even stranger with mascara on. Well, I stopped using it and forgot about it. Then 2 weeks later, I noticed that my lashes were not only growing back, but they were much fuller than before. I&#x27;m back on the wagon now, and thrilled with my continuing results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! In two months I have the longest thickest fullest lashes!!! I curl them and go... People ask me what mascara I am wearing... I don&#x27;t wear any!!!</li>
    <li> Works great...been using it for 3 years!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been four weeks and while I&#x27;ve seen a small change in my lashes, there has definitely been no \\&quot;wow\\&quot; factor.  There&#x27;s been a small increase in the length and possibly even smaller one in the thickness.  I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully every night.  I will try it for another couple of weeks and post an update if there are any further changes.  UPDATE 10/14/14 - After almost three months of use I can finally say that there has been an increase in the length of my lashes.  Still not convinced that the thickness e.g. numbers of lashes, has increased but they are longer.  I&#x27;ll continue using for now but I would have to say that \\&quot;Rapid\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t really belong in the name of this product. I did up the rating to four stars because my lashes did get longer, but if I had the ability I&#x27;d probably give it a 3.5 star rating instead.  Not sure I&#x27;ll repurchase since there are other lash enhancers out there to try :)</li>
    <li> I like this product, my lashes look much better for sure.</li>
    <li> Been using for sometime now. It works. My lashes broke off after getting lash extensions for awhile. This brought them back. Use on my eyebrows as well to fill in bare spots.</li>
    <li> Works to some extinct</li>
    <li> I have used several more expensive eyelash enhancing serum and this works the best!</li>
    <li> reasonable price, quick delivery</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. I buy it and use it on a regular basis. My skin is easily irritated but I am able to use this product and only feel a slight irritation in the morning which is cleared up as soon as I wash my face. My eyelashes are much longer now but to stay long this needs to be used on a regular basis. They used to be pretty short and I would use an eyelash curler but that made them fall out. With this product, my eyelashes hit my glasses. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great price Love this product. i use it on my eyebrows too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time and I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my eyebrows and it does work.  It doesn&#x27;t completely fill them in but I definitely see a difference.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be beat, Lasts forever, application is easy, you can skip a nite or two after the first 2 weeks and your new longer lashes still grow in. The tube lasts forever. I recommend that once you have the lashes you so desire, apply every 2 nites, it seems to never run out. But when the product starts to get thick then replace it and watch yr lashes grow in even longer once again. I never have seen darkening of my light brown eyes nor redness or irritation. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Works really well for me. I have nothing to compare it to but I sure notice when I run out and my lashes go back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;!! I love my long lashes.  Thicker???  No, I don&#x27;t think so.  For sure longer and it took less than a month.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all! I like this product and now I understand all the &#x27;hype&#x27; it has gotten!</li>
    <li> This is the only products that is useful for me! I use it almost everyday and it really work well! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I received the product and there seems to be very little content??? The brush is almost dry when extracted from the tube.  Is this the way it is suppose to be?&lt;br /&gt;No results yet as I have only tried to use it 5 days now.</li>
    <li> Recently I have been contemplating getting eyelash extensions. I have fairly nice eyelashes to begin with but I do definitely want the thicker, longer, fuller and darker.I am not yet at my desired result. Hopefully I can get to the point where other people look at me and state how great my eyelashes look and how thick and dark they are. I have only been using this product for about 4 to 5 weeks. I know that not only can this product to take a little bit longer than that to show a really good results but I am slightly at fault. I forget or neglect to use it every single day as directed and I&#x27;m sure that if I start religiously using it every single night as I am supposed to that I will get the full effect that I want in no time. Although I have not reached my desired results, nor do I actually know if I will ever get there, I have been pleased enough with this product that once the first bottle ran out, I have bottles two and three on the way and they will arrive here in a day.considering I&#x27;m a born skeptic, something has to be a fairly good result for me to know only finished using the product, no only decide to buy it again, but decide to buy the next two bottles at once. If you are having any problems with your eyelashes not being out of quit or not being what you want, definitely give this product a try and see how you like it. I really think that you would be pleasantly surprised. if I&#x27;m surprise and I hope that I&#x27;m able to buy my next two bottles at once, &amp; I haven&#x27;t even been using it as often as I should or as directed, I&#x27;m going to try to use the next 2 bottles as I should because I&#x27;ll get a better results, you should be surprised as well. And honestly... Absolute worst outcome is that your eyelashes improve a little bit for a while and you weren&#x27;t happy enough to buy it again. You&#x27;d only be out about $30. Take the plunge and give it a try.</li>
    <li> Love rapidlash!! Been using it for 5 years. Don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> Rapid lash is terrific. I would recommend this product over any&lt;br /&gt;of them.I have been using it since September. The greatest!!!</li>
    <li> It works great, but it takes 3-4 weeks until anything is noticed.  Then it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after thinking about it for a long time, simply because of the cost.  I mean, $30 is not cheap.  Nevertheless, after reading all the reviews on several sites, including this one, I went ahead and ordered it.  The first evening I put it on, there was a little irritation in my eyelids and eyes, a little burning sensation.  The next morning, my eyes felt heavy, like I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep.  I chalked it up to that, not enough sleep.  So, for five days, I kept using it, and every day my eyes felt weird, like heavy or as I said, like didn&#x27;t get enough sleep, and a little irritated too.  It all started after I started using the RapidLash.  So, I stopped using it.  It&#x27;s now day 2 after I stopped using it, and my eyes are feeling back to normal.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it that made my eyes feel weird, but I don&#x27;t want to risk messing up my eyes for long eyelashes.  Nothing happened in the 5 days I used it, no growth, etc. which I didn&#x27;t expect because it says you need to use it for a month at least.  I&#x27;ll just go back to using Rimmel Eyelash Accelerator mascara, not a huge help, but at least it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.  It&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t sell this in a sample size so you can try it before you spend $30.</li>
    <li> Did not work. I recommend just going to the doctors and getting Latisse. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time........it works!</li>
    <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t see a difference at all after using for 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is mind over matter or the incredible mascara I have found...or maybe this product does work!!  This is my second tube.  I am afraid to stop using it! :)  The upper lashes in my left eye had a bit of a gap in the middle where the lashes were shorter, stubby, and sparse for some reason.  They have grown back to the same length as the other lashes and all my lashes look fuller. I think it is due to this product...I think I will continue to use it...:)</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> A bit irritation at first.  But I applied a light layer of foundation underneath my eyes and above my lashes prior to applying the serum.  Worked like a charm.  My lashes do get longer, just not as fuller as I expected though.</li>
    <li> I bought this retail before and within a week my lashes almost doubled in length I was BLOWN AWAY !! But this product is a fake, no results whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet. Been using it for a month and I might just give up...</li>
