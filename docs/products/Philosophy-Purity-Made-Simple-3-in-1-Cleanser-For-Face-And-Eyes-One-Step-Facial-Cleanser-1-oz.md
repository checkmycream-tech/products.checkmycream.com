<li> I really really like this small personal travel size sample.</li>
<li> am in my late 20&#x27;s and have very acne prone skin.</li>
<li> A 16 ounce lasts six months for me because it only takes a little to do the job.</li>
<li> I used this for a little over 2 weeks</li>
<li> Same results as using soap or any other cleanser.. Not impressed.</li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t do bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love Philosophy products.  This is such a nice cleanser!  And this was nice for travel!  Thanks</li>
    <li> My fave face wash of all time.</li>
    <li> Works well, good product.  All Philosophy are good products.  I thought it would take my mascara off a lot better than the run of the mill face wash but it didn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Your face feels clean in one simple step.  Great travel size. Will be purchasing again soon.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for travel and it&#x27;s the perfect size. after i thought about it i should have just bought a travel bottle and added some from my big bottle but i&#x27;m still okay with my purchase. this wash is great!</li>
    <li> I love cleansing my face with Purity.  You don&#x27;t need a toner.</li>
    <li> First off - this is my absolute must-have facial cleanser. It MELTS the makeup off my face - even eye makeup. There&#x27;s nothing more disappointing than a facial cleanser that only works on bare skin and can&#x27;t handle the makeup situation. lol. It&#x27;s incredibly gentle and I go into panic mode if I run out before my new bottle arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have very acne prone skin. This stuff was a huge help to me. I can get carried away with &amp;#34;treating&amp;#34; my acne prone skin with products that are much too harsh. This was a very calming way to remove my makeup and it&#x27;s just what my skin needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a giant bottle at home and this is the perfect size to keep in my purse. I use maybe more than others - but I get about three washes out of it and then I refill it.</li>
    <li> This product was as described. It is a great small bottle for travel. I would purchase this again, I love philosophy products. best face wash ever.</li>
    <li> I love this size of purity... I travel a lot ...and it&#x27;s take off the make-up...great...thank you so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable and it shipped very quickly...</li>
    <li> I got it for the travel size. I have always loved the product.</li>
    <li> Quick service from the seller! I love getting this size to give as gifts. This face wash is absolutely worth the price. A 16 ounce lasts six months for me because it only takes a little to do the job. Your face gets very clean but not dried out.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought the trial size.  Does a great job cleaning/removing makeup.  Don&#x27;t like the smell but I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used. It takes off most of my makeup, minus my heavy duty waterproof mascara. It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes at all and smells fresh.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I used this for a little over 2 weeks and it&#x27;s already cleared up my skin. Well worth the 5 dollars, 1. Because it lasted over 2 weeks and 2. It cleared up my skin from acne. I&#x27;m hooked, just bought the 8 oz bottle on Friday night and got here on Monday which if a 1 oz bottle can last me over 2 week the the 8oz bottle is well worth the $25.00. So happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do amazing and it didn&#x27;t do bad. It just was.. Same results as using soap or any other cleanser.. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> it last almost a month. with just a tiny amount you can clean your face perfectly. I will buy more!</li>
    <li> I really really like this small personal travel size sample. I refill it from a larger bottle of the same brand and it is excellent for travel and keeping in the shower for my Clarsonic! I have reviewed this before, although not fond of the smell- the product is amazing, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really like this cleanser! doesn&#x27;t foam up or anything.</li>
    <li> I broke out with this product</li>
