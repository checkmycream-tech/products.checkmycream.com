      <li>Incredible useful, i charged 1 time and use 2 weeks, better than my previous item.</li>
      <li>I really liked this Sonicare brush system and didn&#x27;t want to give up my new brushes I had purchased.  </li>
      <li>It took two full days to charge up</li>
      <li>I did have to charge it for a full 24 hours before it indicated it was done charging.</li>

      <li>I was pleased to be able to purchase this without buying a whole new toothbrush!</li>

      <li>Although Sonicare has many new modles with lots of bells and whistles I am so grateful this vendor could supply me with just the replacement battery for my tried and true, sufficiently adequate toothbrush.</li>
      <li>my handle finally giving up the ghost it was great to be able to buy the Handle Only because my charger still works.  </li>
      <li>Exactly how it was described!</li>
      <li>I had been to the dentist in a couple of years and they could not believe it since my teeth were pretty much plaque free.  </li>
      <li>I contacted Sonicare and without a problem they just sent me a new handle and a prepaid return for the old one--saying that yes it was covered for 2 years from the original purchase--if I had any more problems to contact them.  </li>
      <li>More powerful than the original Sonicare handle...too rough.  </li>
      <li>It was good to only replace the handle of the toothbrush, than to purchase a whole new unit</li>
      <li>Works fine so far.</li>
      <li>For $31 some dollars when the whole set is over $200, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
      <li>Overall, couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
      <li>Shipping, packaging and seller were first rate.</li>
      <li>Lost my toothbrush in a pretty rad way...</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Product exactly as represented.  </li>
      <li>It took 36 hours to charge first time, and is holding up vwry well.</li>
      <li>After 3 weeks of use the handle works flawlessly, it took about 30 hours to fully charge (for light to stop blinking) and holds the charge at least for 4 days, that is for how long I left it without charging.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and holds a charge for a week.</li>
      <li>We really like our Sonicare electric toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>works well and is the proper fit for my Sonicare toothbrush</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Had to return the handle.  It started out OK and then after a week of use, it would stop after 15 seconds when it was fully charged.  I had no problem returning it; got the full refund.  FYI, it does not have the quad pacer.  I did speak with a representative from Sonicare and she said none of the new handles for the e-series have quad pacers in them.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time and in great condition. I have been using the new handle for over a week and it works perfect with my e series heads.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Much less expensive than replacing the entire toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have several Sonicares and have had them for years.  I had been to the dentist in a couple of years and they could not believe it since my teeth were pretty much plaque free.  I think it is a great toothbrush and I will continue to buy Sonicare for years to come.</li>
    <li> I bought the Sonicare set 15 years ago and it works perfect. I was working in Europe off and on and would charge on the handles up and it would last two weeks without a charge. Lately they have only been lasting a few days so when I saw this I had to get a spare. For $31 some dollars when the whole set is over $200, it&#x27;s well worth it. It took two full days to charge up but it&#x27;s like brand new again. I looked at the newer versions but I don&#x27;t think they are made as well.</li>
    <li> A quality product.  Philips can be depended on!!  The only thing that wears out is the battery, and all batteries will eventually wear out over time.</li>
    <li> We just received this today.  I had thought it would fit the charger base but it does not.  Warning to others, it might be worth it to just buy a whole new handle and base.  I&#x27;m relunctant to try buying a recharger base and have it not fit as well.  Money down the drain!</li>
    <li> More powerful than the original Sonicare handle...too rough.  I&#x27;d rather use a non-powered toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Defective, charge for over 12 hours, lasted ( running ) 29 seconds.</li>
    <li> I had my old e series toothbrush for 5 years before it stopped holding a charge. Great product I didnt want to spend 200 dollars on a brand new model. This worked great, matched my spare replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> Battery fine but timer does not work.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly and was delivered fast. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> As many wrote I had a problem after about 6 months of use--it would not hold a charge and then it would--very inconsistent and I did not want to carry the charging station with me when I was gone for just a week.  I contacted Sonicare and without a problem they just sent me a new handle and a prepaid return for the old one--saying that yes it was covered for 2 years from the original purchase--if I had any more problems to contact them.  So, I am a happy person!</li>
    <li> I am glad that I can find a replacement battery for it without buying the whole unit again.  I had bought another battery replacement from ebay before, but it failed to recharge after a month.  This one doesn&#x27;t have that problem.  I have it for more than 2 months now. So far so good.  It keeps its charge.</li>
    <li> Works fine as a replacement battery.</li>
    <li> Works fine so far. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Although Sonicare has many new modles with lots of bells and whistles I am so grateful this vendor could supply me with just the replacement battery for my tried and true, sufficiently adequate toothbrush. Excellent service!</li>
    <li> Works perfect better than buying a whole new toothbrush</li>
    <li> I received the order in an appropriate amount of time.  It was a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> Works like new! It is new!</li>
    <li> Works fine - much more power than my old handle had with its battery dying.  However, my old unit had 30 second timers and this one just runs solid for 2 minutes - not as user friendly.</li>
    <li> This is the single-speed, no timer version. Works great, ordered another.</li>
    <li> These work great! Thank you</li>
    <li> works well and is the proper fit for my Sonicare toothbrush</li>
    <li> Incredible useful, i charged 1 time and use 2 weeks, better than my previous item. Well noted for further purchase</li>
    <li> The handle works well like it is supposed to! I like the colored handle which helps differentiate it from other handles in the household. It was shipped on time ,plain packaged which is part of the reason why this is so much cheaper than you could buy in a store but basically the same product</li>
    <li> Item did not fit my charging dock like description stated.  Attempted to return but did not hear back from seller.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly.  Didn&#x27;t have to buy another toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Already had the charger, so I ordered this handle and mated it with one of the extra brush heads I had.  Saved a little money that way.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to be able to purchase this without buying a whole new toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve had it a month and still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it! It was a great item to buy.</li>
    <li> Works great  and arrived fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this is not the Sonicare Elite handle base and I have the charger for Elite.  Difficult to see the difference from the photo.  So I had to return.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and a great product!!!</li>
    <li> It was very nice to find that I could replace just the handle.  The charger still works fine and I have a supply of brushes.</li>
    <li> the Sonicare came on time and were as advertised - works great and fits my charger</li>
    <li> Nice deal, forgot to check my charger, ordered another one already.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Great seller</li>
    <li> Makes your teeth feel very clean but not happy with the hardware. After brushing your teeth a few times if you unscrew the brush part and look in the top of the battery part a bunch of gunk collects in it, it&#x27;s really gross. Gunk gets in all the crevices in the toothbrush mechanism too. We will continue to buy Sonicare just not this style</li>
    <li> Nice Price works good</li>
    <li> Product works great with old charger. I dropped my old handle on the floor. I have tile so it broke. The thing I wish I had received was info on how to charge it. The handle came with no info at all. Would have been 5 stars with info.</li>
    <li> Very good new charger if you do not want to buy a new Sonic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it was missing a feature that I depend on:  the 30 second timer............. I guess when this one goes dead (probably 3 years) I&#x27;ll have to upgrade.  I didn&#x27;t this time because I had invested already in so many back-up heads.</li>
    <li> Works great and even has the newer batteries which give me much more life. Missing the timed markers but that is of little consequence. Overall, couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> I really liked this Sonicare brush system and didn&#x27;t want to give up my new brushes I had purchased.  The handle was all I needed and this on fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Good price, works fine.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews stating that the Handle Only item did not hold the charge as long as the ones that came with the complete kit, I was reluctant.  I decided to give it a try.  So far, it works as well as the ones that are in the kit.  I am thoroughly happy that I didn&#x27;t have to spend as much and getting more than I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just bought a 6 pk pk of heads before my old Sonicare handle stopped working.  Only needed the handle, this saved me some money and works great</li>
    <li> It took 36 hours to charge first time, and is holding up vwry well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed it doesn&#x27;t do the 30 second time intervals like the base I replaced. It does stop after 2 minutes but it sure would be nice to know when to move to another part of my mouth. I&#x27;ve been using the timer on my phone! Otherwise it works just fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still working til the base arrives.</li>
    <li> This is an older model, but works well.  It was difficult to tell from the online pic whether it would fit my charger base, although it looked about right.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out that it did not fit my charger, but I was able to get another charger base at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Works great.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this Sonicare product for many years.  It now appears to be discontinued so with 5 handles still left from a Costco purchase and my handle finally giving up the ghost it was great to be able to buy the Handle Only because my charger still works.  A great product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I returned this product because it was too big for my existing charger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days.  So far so good, but I think it is a little louder than the one I replaced.</li>
    <li> Handles appear to work well.  NiMH batteries should last longer than the old units&#x27; NiCads.  Minor downside, these handles don&#x27;t have the 30 second timer like the &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; models (like my old 5700 handles).  But all that means is watching a clock to know when to move to a new quarter of the jaw.</li>
    <li> 1005 of what I expected.</li>
    <li> Just a replacement.  Works great</li>
    <li> Took a while to get all charged up, thought for few hours that this was a bum deal. But it eventually charged up and is working well.</li>
    <li> After years of everyday use my Sonicare wasn&#x27;t holding a charge as long as in the past. Since I always kept the handle in the charger this really wasn&#x27;t that big of an issue.  Then the bottom cracked and a piece fell out, but the handle still worked. I knew it was only a matter of time and then it finally stopped working completely.  I bought this replacement handle because it seemed likely to work with my model. (some models #s were slightly different) but after reading the reviews, I ordered this handle. It arrived quicker than expected and it works like new.</li>
    <li> We really like our Sonicare electric toothbrushes. They both lasted about 18 months. Wish it was longer, but overall satisfied with the product., or we would not of bought more.</li>
    <li> It was good to only replace the handle of the toothbrush, than to purchase a whole new unit</li>
    <li> A great product as a replacement for my old handle. Fast delivery and holds a charge for a week. Quick charge and good price.</li>
    <li> good replacement for base handle</li>
    <li> Happy to find the handle without the charger and brushes, saved a bunch of money! Great option when the rest still works.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and as described. Been using it for a couple weeks now and I don&#x27;t expect any problems. It appears to be a legit Phillips Sonicare product.</li>
    <li> I really hope I am not writing this review to soon. After 3 weeks of use the handle works flawlessly, it took about 30 hours to fully charge (for light to stop blinking) and holds the charge at least for 4 days, that is for how long I left it without charging.</li>
    <li> One function not working.  Delivered on time.  No instruction manual. The 2 minute function worked. But not 30 second per area.</li>
    <li> Love the Sonicare - this is the second unit we have purchased and we have had great dental check-ups since using it.  Shipping, packaging and seller were first rate.</li>
    <li> Lost my toothbrush in a pretty rad way... Had my backpack in the back of our drift car at round 1 of Lone Star Drift series early in the day... before I realized it the backpack was upside down and apparently my sonicare fell out of the poorly zipped pocket. While mid drift it apparently then ended up flying out at 80 mph through a single drain hole in the spare tire spot, never to be seen again. Since I already have the base and a spare head that came with my new sonicare I&#x27;ve only had for a month, This new base the only replacement part I needed. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Perfect! So happy to have found &amp; received these handles! After almost 8 years, the batteries in our pair of Sonicare toothbrushes bit the dust &amp; we didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a set of completely new toothbrushes. We already had a pack of brush heads, so the new handles (containing new rechargable batteries) were exactly what we needed to get back in business. Shipping was quick &amp; the handles work great. Will definitely repeat order whenever we need these in the future. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Great product.  It works very well.</li>
    <li> Buying a replacement handle for less than $30 was way cheaper than buying a new kit for $100.  It works fine with my existing charger just fine.</li>
    <li> Exactly how it was described!</li>
    <li> Charged with ease and responds well with brushing.</li>
    <li> Good replacement product.</li>
    <li> Originally when I got this item, I was able to get it to charge and use it as intended, despite the fact it did not really fit my old  charging base.  Eventually after 30 -60 days, it quit working and I complained, but no warranty existed. Disgusted,  I purchased a whole new pair of brushes, handles, charger bases &amp; travel cases from another Amazon vendor, and gave one set to my sister, keeping the other for myself.  Well, looking at the new product and this handle, I saw they were identical.  Tested it and lo &amp; behold, the new charger base fit this replacement handle perfectly.  It is working like a champ, charges fully and quickly (within about 4-6 hours) and is always ready to use the next morning after nighttime brushing.  So glad I did not throw it away when it quit working with the old base, as it is now working just fine with the proper charger base, and I have a spare for any future eventuality.  Bottom line: For Sonicare products, It is VERY important that you only use the base that was intended by the manufacturer.  You might get a non-matching base to work for a little while, but you&#x27;ll probably have troubles, as I and another reviewer or two described.  This vendor is perfectly legit and reliable, product arrived as described and in good time.  If you buy it and use the wrong charger, that will be your own error.</li>
    <li> Just what we were looking for and good price</li>
    <li> I was especially glad to have been able to buy the handle separately without having to purchase the whole ensemble from Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as represented.  I did have to charge it for a full 24 hours before it indicated it was done charging.</li>
    <li> Works perfect. Delivered as promised, I will not hesitate to order aging.</li>
    <li> Bought April 16 2014 and April 1 (11 months later) it DIED!  Note that we have 3 other sonicares we have in our house (for wife and kids) and all these have performed wonderfully for over 2.5 years.  These were purchased from Costco.  This one I purchased on Amazon looks identical to manufacturer&#x27;s product, but I wonder if it&#x27;s a close looking second?  Knowing you get what you pay for, I chose this one because it was more expensive that many others listed on Amazon ... hoping for quality.  Very disappointing</li>
