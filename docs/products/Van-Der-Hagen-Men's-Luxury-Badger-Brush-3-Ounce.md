      <li>But for a beginner, it is an excellent first brush.</li>
      <li>I would say the hair is somewhere between pure and best quality.&lt;br</li>

      <li>You&#x27;ll be making a nice foamy lather on your face rather than just in your mug.</li>

      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that one day a nice quality 3-piece safety razor will be sold in stores like Target for not a lot of money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that one day a nice quality 3-piece safety razor will be sold in stores like Target for not a lot of money.</li>
      <li>This brush lathers up very easily.</li>
      <li>it would be to  shake out most of the water from your brush after it&#x27;s been in warm water and to lather your face  </li>
      <li>The badger hairs are soft and workable and give an excellent lather.</li>
      <li>it would be to  shake out most of the water from your brush after it&#x27;s been in warm water and to lather your face  </li>
      <li>and it does an excellent job of conditioning my face and whiskers, preparing them for the double edge razor shave to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I shake off most and start lathering up my Van Der Hagen Luxury soap.</li>
      <li>For the price point cant get better than this.</li>
      <li>Most info I find about making lather tends to just be about making it in your mug rather than on your face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had any complaints it would be to make the bristles shorter and put a heavier handle on the brush to give it a  better weight.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the highest quality badger, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
      <li>Ive lost many hairs already, usin g it with Dreadnought.</li>
      <li>This is a much better quality brush in terms of the quality of the badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes with a $20 shave mug, $5 soap, and a $10 stand, way better deal.</li>
      <li>I had any complaints it would be to make the bristles shorter and put a heavier handle on the brush to give it a  better weight.</li>
      <li>Has not shed at all and creates the the most luxurious lather ever.</li>
      <li>you buy this please read the 1 and 2 star reviews of the shave set and take notice of the sure number of people who said it fell apart in under a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Everythig ok.</li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re making your cream make sure the tips of your brush have plenty cream otherwise known as peaks.</li>
      <li>Hopefully that helps the wetshaving hobby gain support in the mainstream/future and let people know that safety razors provide better shaves, save you money, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What I can say is that this VDH badger brush does whip up great lather (I&#x27;ve used it with Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat, The Shave Den soap, Provence Sante, Colonel Conk, Williams, C.O. Bigelow, Ingram, Godrej and Real Shaving Co.)</li>
      <li>Most info I find about making lather tends to just be about making it in your mug rather than on your face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will admit I was worried about my purchase because most of them cost a lot more than this.</li>
      <li>it builds lather well, holds a good deal of water, and takes up excess lather easily (great for later passes!).</li>
      <li>if you can afford it buy a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hopefully that helps the wetshaving hobby gain support in the mainstream/future and let people know that safety razors provide better shaves, save you money, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am an experienced wet shaver and have always used a good oil, brush, 2 blade razor and after balm.</li>
      <li>I say all this to reenforce my beluef that Van Der Hagen products are, for the money spent, the best value that I know of.</li>
      <li>This is a good reasonable priced brush.</li>
      <li>is easy.  </li>
      <li>this brush a strong performer for the price?  </li>
      <li>This was one of the cheapest badger brushes available.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I would say that is a cheap brush</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done up to 7-8 for a BSS (baby smooth shave).</li>
      <li>If you want a cheap brush that works well, then get what I (fortunately) still have: Tweezerman Brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a cheap bastard I guess.</li>
      <li>There are some better, but this, white his price, is good.</li>
      <li>The VDH is also a good bit larger knot than the Tweezerman model so in turn it holds more lather.</li>
      <li>It also rinses clean with no fussing.</li>
      <li>Just when you get into a rhythm, you have to stop and clean a hair from your soap, or from your brush, or face.</li>
      <li>I recommend Geofatboy&#x27;s on YouTube &#x27;Clean and Condition</li>
      <li>You will have far better results with a better model, or a boar or synthetic brush.  </li>
      <li>I apply water to my face and move the brush around creating a super thick lather that&#x27;s as nice as I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great starter brush or travel brush for wet shavers of all skill levels.</li>
      <li>The bristles do NOT fall over willy-nilly; you&#x27;ll be able to use the semi-rigid bristles with authority when you want to, but it&#x27;s still gentle on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I knew I wanted a good brush that would last a lifetime.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when you know you&#x27;ve done a good job and can start lathering your face proper.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll see how it feels when full of lather...</li>
      <li>Now for the good part, and the only reason I gave it three stars.  </li>
      <li>Nice and soft</li>
      <li>Returning for a full refund.  </li>
      <li>Nice and soft on my face.  </li>
      <li>Not bad though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a steal at ten bucks, so I figured I&#x27;d better grab one more before they disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I figured it would just split and fall apart quickly.</li>
      <li>a final note I would like to say that my brush smelled a lot like badger, took many many washes to diminish the scent.</li>
      <li>Right out of the box, this brush does stink (common for any animal hair brush that hasn&#x27;t been pre-conditioned by the manufacturer), so check online to see how best to de-stink the thing</li>
      <li>If you get it for a good price its probably worth having just to see if you want to get a higher quality brush in the future.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the same problem as many of the owners, it sheds a lot!  </li>
      <li>Super smooth feeling/lathers really well...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had this kit for a couple of months now. I&#x27;m replacing the brush. It loses 5+ hairs per shave, this is quite annoying. Just when you get into a rhythm, you have to stop and clean a hair from your soap, or from your brush, or face. I gave it two stars since the rest of the kit is fine, but the brush is not good at all.</li>
    <li> The pros?  It looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons?  It sheds like crazy.  I would not purchase this product again, if you are looking to make the jump to a badger hair brush, don&#x27;t do it with this one.  You will have far better results with a better model, or a boar or synthetic brush.  There is a reason this brush is priced so low.  From day one, it has been shedding.  This brush is especially bad if you use a double edge razor, as the long hairs will get caught in the blade and dull it prematurely.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s LOTS of good things to say about this brush:  it builds lather well, holds a good deal of water, and takes up excess lather easily (great for later passes!). The bristles do NOT fall over willy-nilly; you&#x27;ll be able to use the semi-rigid bristles with authority when you want to, but it&#x27;s still gentle on my skin.  It also rinses clean with no fussing. As for subjective metrics, I enjoy that this is a brush with a knot on the bigger side.  The flip side to this bonus is that the brush does shed pretty consistently for me (although not affecting performance -- at this rate I&#x27;ll still get my several years of use before the knot gives out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this brush a strong performer for the price?  Certainly.  Is it a *great* first brush for the new wet shaver?  You bet!  Especially because the brush comes washed/sanitized already, so there&#x27;s no need to &#x27;un-stink&#x27; before using.  THE best? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Initial observations as I&#x27;ve not had an opportunity to use it yet but will follow up more in depth... this brush was shedding the second I held it. Several hairs were sticking up above the knot loft and these were easily removed. Also several bits of hair came out of the knot. By bits I mean as if some of the hair ends had broken off.. real small bits. I think this may be due to washing several, if not hundreds, of knots together at the same time from the factory since the brush doesn&#x27;t have the usual \\&quot;dirty badger\\&quot; smell but smells as if it&#x27;s been washed as the clean, soapy scent on the knot out of the box is overpowering. I can picture many knots in a soapy bath being agitated by an arm to get them all clean and all of that knocking about causing split and broken hair ends and those bits of hair getting into the knot. The hair is soft for the most parts but the ends feel bristly and pointy in this dry and unused condition. I&#x27;ll see how it feels when full of lather... Would have been nice if it came with the usual plastic brush stand but one of those can be easily found elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews on this brush including the two star review about the sheading. I though it couldn&#x27;t be that bad, my brush is worse.  It sheads like bristles like a striper does clothes.</li>
    <li> Thanks, goods of an opravd of expectation</li>
    <li> Being a long time wet shaver, I have seen many brushes (synthetic, boar, badger)and I must say that for the money, this is a great brush. Has not shed at all and creates the the most luxurious lather ever. It is soft, but not too soft and has a balanced weight that feels comfortable in the hand. You truly can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush when you consider other&#x27;s of this type will be more than twice the price.  Well done Van Der Hagen.....</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I used this brush this morning. I had 4 brush hairs in my beard which was very annoying. After shaving, I washed the brush and it lost an additional 14 hairs to the sink. I don&#x27;t know how many went down the drain. I&#x27;m not sure I can return it since I used it. Caveat emptor!</li>
    <li> Picked this up for $9.99 at Target. It wasn&#x27;t on sale or anything so it seems they have the best price. My only brush I&#x27;ve had for the last year has been the Parker silvertip w/ chrome base which is a great brush but the knot is rather big for my shaving mug so I picked this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at how to care for your brush I recommend Geofatboy&#x27;s on YouTube &#x27;Clean and Condition Badger/Boar Brush video&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked the brush in hot water to soften the bristles pre-cleaning. I noticed that unlike my chrome Parker brush which sinks to the bottom and stays there, this Van Der Hagen brush since it has a plastic base it floats. I used regular hair soap and lathered it in my hand and then washed it off. Then put hair conditioner on it and lathered it again. Conditioner makes the brush very soft. I did the hair soap/conditioner thing about 5x, by that time most of the bad badger smell was gone. Then I wiped the brush on a towel to get rid of the residual water and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the brush got very soft with the hair conditioner. Not many bristles fell out, maybe three total. My silvertip brush loses bristles so I&#x27;ve come to accept that that&#x27;s gonna happen. The badger is much easier and softer than dealing with fallen out boar bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  always soak my brush in very warm water to soften the bristles. This brush retains lots of water, I&#x27;m impressed. I shake off most and start lathering up my Van Der Hagen Luxury soap. Great, great rich and thich lather!! I apply water to my face and move the brush around creating a super thick lather that&#x27;s as nice as I&#x27;ve ever experienced. The brush does flatten out on your face and the bristles are longer compared to my silvertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my second pass the brush still has tons of thick, rich white cream and does the job of lathering my face again most excellently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I must say I&#x27;m really impressed. This is a real badger brush, it has the smell of badger, it retains water really well, makes a great/very foamy thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t agree with the bad reviews this brush has gotten. My brush doesn&#x27;t shed like crazy and the lather is as good as what I get using my Parker silvertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any complaints it would be to make the bristles shorter and put a heavier handle on the brush to give it a  better weight. For the money this is a great quality brush and makes some top notch lather. The feel of the bristles on your face is medium compared to stiff boar and silvertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any advice for making great thick lather it would be to  shake out most of the water from your brush after it&#x27;s been in warm water and to lather your face  w/ the soaped up brush for at least 30 seconds prior to shaving. You&#x27;ll be making a nice foamy lather on your face rather than just in your mug.

Hopefully that helps the wetshaving hobby gain support in the mainstream/future and let people know that safety razors provide better shaves, save you money, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is getting 5 stars. It&#x27;s very cool that you can buy something like this of this quality locally without having to go online or to a specialty store.

Happy shaving.retains water really well, makes a great/very foamy thick lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t agree with the bad reviews this brush has gotten.

    <li> My only shaving brush for the past year or more has been the Omega boar brush. It didn&#x27;t hold water well and made a lousy lather on my face and the bristles always fell out while shaving and got stuck in the shaving cream. I&#x27;d been wanting a badger brush for awhile and I&#x27;d read a lot about them and if you visit any shaving forum you well know there are so many differing options/opinions/suggestions/prices/likes that it becomes really confusing and hard to make a decision on what to buy. I knew I wanted a good brush that would last a lifetime. This was one of the cheapest badger brushes available.  The brush did smell when I got it which is normal if you&#x27;ve read up at all. Upon arrival I soaped it up and washed it off about 4 or 5x in shave soap and it still smelled, mainly when wet. I used it a few times and the smell dissipated. This brush isn&#x27;t scratchy at all.  This brush lathers up very easily. It holds a ton of water so after it&#x27;s been soaking and getting warm in the water before my shave I press some of the water out otherwise the cream doesn&#x27;t get very thick. I find that after the first pass that the cream gets thicker. I&#x27;m not sure that this is because there&#x27;s less water on the brush or it&#x27;s atributed to my wiskers.  You only need to make the cream once at the start of your shave and you&#x27;ll have enough for many multiple passes. I&#x27;ve done up to 7-8 for a BSS (baby smooth shave). When you&#x27;re making your cream make sure the tips of your brush have plenty cream otherwise known as peaks. That&#x27;s when you know you&#x27;ve done a good job and can start lathering your face proper.  I give this brush 5 stars. I don&#x27;t see a need to buy another brush in the future. The handle is made to last and the metal ring looks classy. There have been very few hairs to come out of the brush which is a sign of quality. This is a great product and well worth the $20 spent, especially if you shave often. I shave every 1-2 days.  I wish the logo was engraved on the brush rather than how itis painted on and ends up rubbing off. It would look classy and I&#x27;d be able to remember years from now what company made the brush in case I wanted to buy another or someone was curious about it. Some people may not want a maker&#x27;s name on their brush though. This brush weighs quite a lot and even moreso when it&#x27;s been submerged in water. Not bad though. You know you&#x27;re getting a good shave and lathering is easy.  If you buy this be sure to use it with a stand so it can dry correctly!</li>
    <li> Great brush for the Renaissance man! Great texture and lathers up thickness!</li>
    <li> Four months daily use no problems it&#x27;s all about how you take care of the brush, highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving brushes for over twenty years so I know a good one. This is a good reasonable priced brush. The badger hairs are soft and workable and give an excellent lather. I&#x27;ve had larger brushes and smaller ones and this is about in the middle. Some tips since they can be expensive be sure to treat it carefully. You need a brush stand to air dry with bristles facing down after every use and light pressure when applying lather. My old ones have lasted for years and if you treat this one carefully should last the same.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush about a year ago.  The bristles started falling out from the start.  I would lather up, and they would fall out onto the lather, on my beard. I kept using it, hoping it would stop.  They just kept falling out.  I just bought another one of these brushes, hoping I got a defective one.  Exact same thing.  Returning for a full refund.  Terrible brush.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the same brush that  comes with Van Der Hagen&#x27;s Luxury Shave Set.&lt;br /&gt;see here: [[ASIN:B004L4EING Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set]]&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy this please read the 1 and 2 star reviews of the shave set and take notice of the sure number of people who said it fell apart in under a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the shave set 4 stars despite this junk brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is badger, and Im still using mine, I will be looking to upgrade soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brush head feel completely out of the plastic handle.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to hot glue it back, but for $16 bucks, do you really want to do that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest buying a different brush, even if its boar hair, as long as its better made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want this brush, skip buying it by itself and buy the shave set for $30.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a $20 shave mug, $5 soap, and a $10 stand, way better deal.</li>
    <li> Shampoo plus lots of conditioner will remove smell. Soft. But knot did not hold.</li>
    <li> I have used several brushes now and gave the VDH badger brush a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this brush has proven itself worthy to remain in my arsenal of wet shaving hardware. I lost about four hairs on the first use and after that it hasn&#x27;t shed a single one. The trick for me was not only hanging the brush in my chrome razor stand but gently rinsing it out after shaving and giving it gentle shakes to remove excess water. And by gentle I mean very delicate shakes. I follow up by \\&quot;painting\\&quot; a dry towel with the brush until it is a bit more dry. Just a few swipes and then it gets air dried in the razor stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did knock a star off for the brush&#x27;s stiffness as it is a bit too soft when compared to a Tweezerman badger brush. I find that I can make lather quicker with the Tweezerman but would rather apply the lather with the VDH. The VDH is also a good bit larger knot than the Tweezerman model so in turn it holds more lather. I would estimate it is 20-30 percent larger than the Tweezerman.  I do alternate brushes so that may help with the shedding (or rather, the lack thereof) that others complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great starter brush or travel brush for wet shavers of all skill levels. I was able to find mine at a local Target for just shy of ten dollars making it an incredible deal on a pure badger brush. But if I had to order another tomorrow, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to spend another ten spot to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good brush. Real good brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards.</li>
    <li> Makes a decent lather but the knot is falling apart after 6 months.</li>
    <li> Just over a year ago, I got this brush with the VDH Luxury kit and it&#x27;s been an excellent introduction to the art of brush lathering. It did shed hairs at first...as I&#x27;ve read is to be expected from any brush...but it has since slowed to the point where it might shed four or five hairs over the course of a couple week&#x27;s shaves...but this is only occasionally. It&#x27;s honestly not something I pay much attention to because this brush didn&#x27;t cost me $100, and the hairs it&#x27;s lost have not been missed; the loft still looks and performs great. I use this thing as the tool it&#x27;s intended to be used as, and I fully expect it to wear out or break at some point down the road. It&#x27;s not an art piece I fawn over or baby. I do, however, practice good brush care and storage techniques (drying it upside down on the stand included with the VDH Luxury kit), which I think will increase the life of even the cheapest brush. Right out of the box, this brush does stink (common for any animal hair brush that hasn&#x27;t been pre-conditioned by the manufacturer), so check online to see how best to de-stink the thing and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how scratchy it is compared to other pure badger brushes because the only other brush I&#x27;ve owned was most likely a synthetic brush my dad gave to me when I first started shaving about twenty-five years ago...and I don&#x27;t remember what that brush was like. What I can say is that this VDH badger brush does whip up great lather (I&#x27;ve used it with Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat, The Shave Den soap, Provence Sante, Colonel Conk, Williams, C.O. Bigelow, Ingram, Godrej and Real Shaving Co.) and it does an excellent job of conditioning my face and whiskers, preparing them for the double edge razor shave to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was searching for my starter kit, I wanted a brush with a resin (plastic) handle. I didn&#x27;t like the idea of a wood handled brush being used around water...I figured it would just split and fall apart quickly. The finish of this VDH brush is actually very nice. The resin handle has a nice shape and weight to it, and the chrome ring around the base of the knot is a nice touch that still looks great a year later. The VDH windmill logo did quickly disappear from my brush, but that might only be a problem for those of you who really like that logo and any status is provides. This brush did slip out of my hand one day when I was flicking water out of it and it slammed into the bottom of my sink basin, taking a small chip out of the edge of the base. It&#x27;s not fragile...it can take a punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has held up and performed so admirably that yesterday I stopped in my local Target store and bought a replacement for $10, preparing for the day when my original finally gives up. My tastes/needs may graduate to a slightly more expensive brush when this day comes, or I might crack open my back-up VDH badger and keep going...who knows? It&#x27;s a steal at ten bucks, so I figured I&#x27;d better grab one more before they disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a newbie to the world of wet shaving, on a quest for an inexpensive badger brush to start you out, this is an excellent choice that will likely still be with you when you shed your newbie status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (APR 2014): This brush died right at the two year mark; it began to shed hairs aggressively. I like the handle of this brush so much I couldn&#x27;t just toss it, so I cleaned out the original knot and replaced it with a black badger knot. Very similar characteristics to the original pure badger knot but a bit more refined.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Lathers well on my face with VDH luxury soap.</li>
    <li> Great brush. The scent lasts for quite awhile but will fade with time.  A few loose bristles will fall out during the first few uses but then is fine.</li>
    <li> Husband clearly loved this bruch, just as good as some of the pricier ones.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to try a badger brush.  It&#x27;s not the highest quality badger, that&#x27;s for sure.  Could be a little softer for the money I paid.  I&#x27;ve had the same problem as many of the owners, it sheds a lot!  Have had this brush in my rotation for a couple of months and its still shedding every time I use it.  Now for the good part, and the only reason I gave it three stars.  It does create a huge amount of lather if used properly.  The brush itself does not hold enough water to make a proper lather with soaps or creams.  I&#x27;ve had to add water as I swirl it around in my mug.  Once I get just the right amount in there the lather really explodes!  I&#x27;ve gotten it pouring over the side of my mug when I do it right.  If you get it for a good price its probably worth having just to see if you want to get a higher quality brush in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush at Target. This brush is not the same brush that is included in the Van Der Hagen Luxury Set. That brush is boar bristle, while this is badger hair. I have had no problems with this badger hair brush as far as excessive or prolonged shedding. The animal smell is very minimal, and actually somewhat less than with an Escali badger brush that I recently bought. I have had two Van Der Hagen green boar brushes for several years. The one that I keep for a backup, is still in the box, because the first one won&#x27;t wear out, in spite of constant use! I use Van Der Hagen shave soap exclusively. I say all this to reenforce my beluef that Van Der Hagen products are, for the money spent, the best value that I know of.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush about 3 months ago. After using it almost every day and comparing it to other brushes, in my opinion it is a pretty good brush for it&#x27;s price point. It is soft and lathers well. I would say the hair is somewhere between pure and best quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does smell like a badger, but compared to a live badger, it isn&#x27;t that bad. And all badger brushes tend to smell that way at first with a few expensive exceptions. Just lather it up with some soap and let it sit for a few hours. In time te odor fades away completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush did shed some hairs in the beginning but after a few weeks of use it only dropped one or two every now and then. If your brush is shedding a lot, then you are not caring for it properly or you got a bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect a $10 brush to be of the same quality as a $60 silvertip. But for a beginner, it is an excellent first brush.</li>
    <li> This was my first shaving brush, and it barely lasted 3-months. Every time I would lather and shave it would shed at least 5-10 hairs and after a couple of months it was looking very sparse and couldn&#x27;t hold a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a WSP silver tip brush as a replacement and it has yes to lose a SINGLE hair... not a SINGLE hair. Not to mention the badger hair is literally 3x as thick with this new brush. Go with quality and save yourself time and money down the road.</li>
    <li> Super smooth feeling/lathers really well...great price too.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I got into this whole \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaving thing very recently.  Unlike most enthusiasts you&#x27;ll find online, I knew that I would not be able to justify this hobby from the typical cost savings/environmentally friendly/oh my poor sensitive skin perspective.  It&#x27;s just not that different from using a cartridge razor, except that you can get a closer shave with enough practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This badger brush, however, helped me draw the line on how far I was willing to pursue this hobby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I thought it would be good to have it hold on to the lather in between passes with the razor, rather than having to get another blob of shaving cream and wash half off my hands and down the drain after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the thought of rubbing this stinky brush over my face multiple times each morning leaves me nauseous.  If you have ever wondered, \\&quot;Gee, what would it smell like if a wild rodent made sexytime with my face?\\&quot; then this brush is for you.  If not, you may want to seek other alternatives.</li>
    <li> I found this for ten bucks at Target, so at its current Amazon price of writing this ($18.25) it&#x27;s badly overpriced for an already poor quality product. I&#x27;ve been using this almost every day for nearly a month, and it just has not stopped shedding. Each use there&#x27;s at least a couple hairs that fall out. I&#x27;m finally starting to notice it too; one side of the brush is looking kind of oblong compared to the other side. I&#x27;m disappointed because from what I&#x27;ve read, most quality brushes shed a little in the beginning but stop shedding after that and can last for years. That&#x27;s certainly not the case for this brush. Maybe it just needs some Propecia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first badger hair brush. Compared to the boar&#x27;s hair brush I owned before, it makes lather great! I can&#x27;t compare the quality of the lather it makes to other badger hair brushes since I haven&#x27;t owned any others (for my birthday I plan on getting a fancy silvertip!). But the absurd amount of shedding is enough for me to warrant people not to buy this; the stress of seeing it slowly go bald will make you slowly go bald!</li>
    <li> Although this is my first shaving brush I have read up on proper use and care.  Even following those guidelines this brush is continuing to shed excessively after many months of use, I&#x27;m talking 15-20 hairs per shave, and has lost significant volume from this.  Maybe I just got a bad one; I guess I&#x27;ll never know b/c I&#x27;ll try a different brush next time.</li>
    <li> Okay, so it&#x27;s not silver badger fur, but if you&#x27;re new to the straight razor scene, this will feel luxurious. Get a good glycerin based soap, and for the first few times, just use it to wash your face. Get used to building a foamy lather vs a soapy one. The coarser grade of this brush will actually help remove dead skin and leave your skin soft and discomforting to other males in the break room. LoL I had no problems with the wooden base splitting, but I shake it dry, and store it in a bristle brush caddy with the bristles facing downward...LIKE YOU&#x27;RE SUPPOSED TO. With a little research(IF you&#x27;re new to it) and some care, this brush is worth every penny. The shave is closer, it&#x27;s more nostalgic, and let&#x27;s face it...if you can wake up and hold a razor to your neck and not die, you have a \\&quot;one up\\&quot; on most normal guys. Go  get some.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush from Target as well. Smell I could live with, as that washes out after proper conditioning, however it sheds very badly. Ive lost many hairs already, usin g it with Dreadnought. After the first use it felt like a cheeply made Chinese or dollar store paint brush that comes with a child&#x27;s art set. It does not build a good later at all and in fact seems to destroy it, even when the lather is extremely dry it barely produces anything save for a very thin coating of the cream (not lather) at the bottom of the shave bowl as if the brush was eating the lather. This brush is counter intuitive to wet shaving and would find better use in painting cheap acrylic paintings. When it dries it dries nicely and gives the illusion of a good performance, but when its go time this brush fails miserably. Buyer beware, but if you wish to disregard the warning go to Target and buy it there as amazons price is too high.</li>
    <li> This brush has been used over 30 times and I still have to stop shaving a minimum of 5, and up to 15 times per shave to pick the hairs off my face, out of the lather, out of the bowl etc.....it&#x27;s everywhere.  I returned the first one thinking it was a defect, but the new one is doing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I give up.... Save your money and go another route -  This product is horrible.</li>
    <li> the brush will work well for beginners as it is relativly inexpensive will hold water rather well and is rather stiff so it will not completely fan out from applying to much pressure making the lather however this brush will eventually start to leave the user wanting as it is a clipped hair brush so its rather aggressive and prickly</li>
    <li> If you are not into buying those $100 badger brushes from Rooney, this just works perfect. For the price point cant get better than this.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this</li>
    <li> Has been excellent for lathering up Proraso in a bowl.  Nice and soft on my face.  I picked up this badger brush for ten dollars at Target.  For that price it&#x27;s a total steal.  Nice and soft, only lost a couple bristles the first few times using it, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  It&#x27;s no silvertip, but cmon guys, TEN BUCKS.</li>
    <li> Junk. Used once and the glue failed.&lt;br /&gt;Handle is hollow so the glue area is just a ring around the bristle bundle.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s only $10 at Target, but this brush is crap. I used it once and lathered up my face with Omega, but the results were terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush completely lost its shape on its first use and SHED worse than a Chow Chow. I&#x27;m returning it and getting my $10 back! If you want a cheap brush that works well, then get what I (fortunately) still have: Tweezerman Brush.</li>
    <li> I am an experienced wet shaver and bought this brush while travelling, as I didn&#x27;t pack my DE kit due to the airlines. I must say, I have found this brush to be remarkably good for what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t lost any hair in over a month, but then again, I am experienced at taking care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t treat it like the barber in a western movie (the smashing thing is hysterical). I use it as it should be used, swirling like a brush both loading an applying the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When finished, I rinse it repeatedly, gently squeeze it out, knot to tip, then strike the handle against the heel of my other hand to shake the water out and make it &amp;#34;bloom&amp;#34;, then hang it in a brush hanger to dry. I have lost NO hair. I have found NO hair in my sink or soap, and certainly NONE on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, certainly this brush does not have a long life expectancy like a $200 brush; it&#x27;s a basic badger brush, but it is a good one and I recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to tell everyone that if anyone was considering purchasing the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set that this is not the same brush as the one included in that kit. This is a much better quality brush in terms of the quality of the badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having just got this brush i cant really review the long term durability but i can tell you it appears to be a good brush for the money. The hair on this brush isnt scratchy at all, it feels very smooth and comfortable even rubbing the dry hair against my face. I was suprised at the quality of the hair in this brush for the money. compared to the brush included in the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set this brush is vastly superior. the brush included in the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set felt like it was going to rub my skin raw.</li>
    <li> Great brush, but the hair pulls out every now and then</li>
    <li> It is cheaper than others and it is not boar hair which Muslim dislike.&lt;br /&gt;It work wonders and great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product I guess, I just can&#x27;t get over the price is all. I&#x27;m a cheap bastard I guess. I&#x27;m sorry for this awful review. You should buy this product.</li>
    <li> Does the job just as well as the pricey ones.  I will admit I was worried about my purchase because most of them cost a lot more than this.</li>
    <li> Loses hair on your face when used as others have mentioned. But the price is right so it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> Let me preface by saying that I NEVER leave reviews for anything. This one truly got under my skin though and I felt it necessary to pass on the word. I am an experienced wet shaver and have always used a good oil, brush, 2 blade razor and after balm. This is by far the worst brush I have ever used. They carry this specific item at my employer which has never carried a product that I did not like; until now. This brush leaves 15-20+ hairs on your face during every shave. You spend half the shave time, not shaving but picking hair off of your face and reapplying the areas that lost the lather. Awful product. Put the money out for an Art of Shaving brush.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, and I read mixed reviews about it over here so I went for it and bought it hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush sheds a lot and I mean it when I say so, every time that I shave I need to be removing brush hair from my face and on my razor, every shave at least five to ten hairs are removed from the brush. And I don&#x27;t even give this brush av rough treatment, it&#x27;s just a poorly made brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say that is a cheap brush and you get what you pay for, but if you can afford it buy a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note I would like to say that my brush smelled a lot like badger, took many many washes to diminish the scent.</li>
    <li> Looking his price is good for that. There are some better, but this, white his price, is good. Everythig ok.</li>
</ol>
