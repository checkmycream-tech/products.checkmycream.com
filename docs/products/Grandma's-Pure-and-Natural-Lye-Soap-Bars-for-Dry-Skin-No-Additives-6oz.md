      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great soap.  </li>
      <li>It cleans well and leaves your skin feeling good.  </li>
      <li>Product is good though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually kind of a pain to get a good lather from it.</li>
      <li>Love this soap!</li>
      <li>This soap does not lather which is important to some, but it&#x27;s still a great soap.  </li>
      <li>My grandmother used to make her own.</li>
      <li>no fancy smell just leaves you felling very clean!</li>
      <li>It is wonderful for people with eczema; helping to keep the skin clear &amp; moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and clean.  </li>
      <li>so I plan to try another brand from Amazon and can give a better review.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THE SOAP;  </li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>Love this soap.</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a bit easier on the skin than some of the harsher soaps out there, but I find it equivalent to Dove.</li>
      <li>I know there are people who love Dove</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, and</li>
      <li>It does not have fragrance because people who want this type of soap do not want a drying lather or a cheap smelling fragrance which so many people are use to when it comes to soaps and lotions.  </li>
      <li>What a joy to find an old fashioned cleansing bar.  </li>
      <li>Really feels good on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I shampoo my hair with it and it really removes the hair spray if you soap it up and leave it for 5 minutes with a towel around it and rinse and soap again and rins really good.</li>
      <li>It is amazing to me how great this soap helps with diabetic dry skin problems.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, but didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
      <li>but I have come back to it because it really is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Love these products, soap makes me feel so clean, and it doesn&#x27;t have the suds of gels and other products, works great with the logos.</li>
      <li>I never felt so clean.</li>
      <li>This did not work any magic on my skin or really do anything special for me.</li>
      <li>We bought these originally as an Emergency item to shelve for future use if need be, but because of the scent covering properties of this soap I am purchasing more for hunting season(right around the corner :)).</li>
      <li>Great all natural soap made the old fashioned way.</li>
      <li>I have skin issues, and this soap is better for my skin than the main brand soaps.</li>
      <li>That being said, I love that this bar has only three ingredients in it, and in my head, I feel better using it.</li>
      <li>and it does not irritate even the most sensitive areas.  </li>
      <li>Works really well to help combat and calm my husband&#x27;s psoriasis.</li>
      <li>I think that this is pretty comparable with the Dove soaps in terms of price and sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>As long as you can get past the ingredient, &amp;#34;lard&amp;#34;, and just think of bathing the way they did in 1900, then this soap is excellent.</li>
      <li>By the way the health food stores are filled with decent soaps that have natural fragrance added if you just have to have it.</li>
      <li>even better than I expected.</li>
      <li>thanks for finding this onhere</li>
      <li>I use Dove normally and didn&#x27;t find any drastic difference except for the smell.</li>
      <li>I cut the bar in half width wise and use half at a time .Easier to handle and not wetting or wasting the whole bar.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>HE ALSO HAS VERY SENSITIVE SKIN; AND HE LOVES IT TOO.</li>
      <li>Soap that cleans you without a lot of other stuff in it that you more than likely don&#x27;t need.</li>
      <li>mostly it lasts about as long as any other bar of soap as far as I could tell.</li>
      <li>Works very well especially for homemade laundry detergent.  </li>
      <li>Once he started using this soap, the eczema disappeared completely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve use this product before I really like it especially in the winter when skin tends to get dry although not real crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>It does get very mushy if not allowed to dry well.  </li>
      <li>Really improved my dry and itchy skin.</li>
      <li>I guess if you&#x27;re into the whole &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; craze you might find it better, but I&#x27;m convinced that&#x27;s merely confirmation bias.</li>
      <li>Made in USA with a label reminiscent of the covered wagon snake oil salesman in wild west  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been great for my fairly dry and sensitive skin (no need for moisturizer afterwards), and doesn&#x27;t leave any harsh fragrance behind.  </li>
      <li>The Dove bars are cheaper yes, but I&#x27;ve found that they don&#x27;t last as long as this particular bar, so it evens out.  </li>

<li> Was down to my last bar and figured to check here.  </li>
<li> The only soap we had when I was little.  </li>
<li> this gives it some shine which is not easy to do and it does not yellow my salt and pepper color.!!</li>
<li> No more dry skin problems.</li>
<li> I am not familiar with the types of Lye Soap</li>
<li> A little fragrance wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
<li> I have used this soap off and on for a few years</li>
<li> I also use the shampoo/shave bar, no more itchy scalp.  </li>
<li> I have curly hard to manage  hair</li>
<li> I bought this after reading all the reviews here, but was disappointed by the soap in general.</li>
<li> it is cold and we suffer..</li>
<li> My son had terrible eczema and we tried everything!</li>
<li> I have horrible exzama.  </li>

    <li> Great soap.  Reminds me of the lye soap my aunt used to make on the farm.</li>
    <li> Greatest soap.....ever!</li>
    <li> My husband likes it. He feels cleaner from using it.</li>
    <li> I have horrible exzama.  This is the best soap to use w/ this condition!  Don&#x27;t let the name &amp;#34;lye&amp;#34; hold you back.</li>
    <li> I am not familiar with the types of Lye Soap so I plan to try another brand from Amazon and can give a better review.  I do like the Lye Soap. I shampoo my hair with it and it really removes the hair spray if you soap it up and leave it for 5 minutes with a towel around it and rinse and soap again and rins really good. Shipp, Seller &amp; Packing great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product before I really like it especially in the winter when skin tends to get dry although not real crazy about the smell</li>
    <li> even better than I expected. No scent. Leaves skin feeling like silk.</li>
    <li> What a joy to find an old fashioned cleansing bar.  It cleans, brightens and kills germs.</li>
    <li> I have skin issues, and this soap is better for my skin than the main brand soaps. As long as you can get past the ingredient, &amp;#34;lard&amp;#34;, and just think of bathing the way they did in 1900, then this soap is excellent. I have used it for the past four years, and it really has helped.</li>
    <li> My son had terrible eczema and we tried everything! Once he started using this soap, the eczema disappeared completely. Great product.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this soap !</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SOAP;  I EVEN GOT MY SON ON IT.  HE ALSO HAS VERY SENSITIVE SKIN; AND HE LOVES IT TOO.</li>
    <li> I like the soap but I had received a 6 ounce from another state and the 6 ounce was larger and fatter than the bars I received.  Product is good though.</li>
    <li> works great ! Last a long time. no fancy smell just leaves you felling very clean!</li>
    <li> We bought these originally as an Emergency item to shelve for future use if need be, but because of the scent covering properties of this soap I am purchasing more for hunting season(right around the corner :)).</li>
    <li> Found this locally, went to restock and the store has been out of stock forever.  Was down to my last bar and figured to check here.  Lo and behold it was here.  Made in USA with a label reminiscent of the covered wagon snake oil salesman in wild west  But, this product does what ti claims.  Give it a shot and se for yourself.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Have been using it for years. No more dry skin problems.</li>
    <li> Hubby and I use this. We are trying to cut back on the chemicals we apply to our skin.</li>
    <li> Great all natural soap made the old fashioned way. It is amazing to me how great this soap helps with diabetic dry skin problems. I never felt so clean.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap off and on for a few years but I have come back to it because it really is a great product.  I have very sensitive skin and it does not irritate even the most sensitive areas.  If you get a bug bite, make a lather and put on the bite, let it dry. It calms the itch and no chemicals.  It irritates the daylights out of me when I read a review from someone who just does not get the purpose of using cleaner products.  It does not have fragrance because people who want this type of soap do not want a drying lather or a cheap smelling fragrance which so many people are use to when it comes to soaps and lotions.  So many of the  general commercial products that are  the drugstores etc are just loaded with bad for you junk.  I know there are people who love Dove but I&#x27;ll take this soap over Dove any day.  The price is great for the return of a great product.  I cut the bar in half width wise and use half at a time .Easier to handle and not wetting or wasting the whole bar.  By the way the health food stores are filled with decent soaps that have natural fragrance added if you just have to have it. I also use the shampoo/shave bar, no more itchy scalp.  I have curly hard to manage  hair this gives it some shine which is not easy to do and it does not yellow my salt and pepper color.!!</li>
    <li> bought this from  hardware store madie in usa and for itchy skin.wonderfull my skin is smoother andno itches.. i want a case..i gave to all the family..up north here it is cold and we suffer..thanks for finding this onhere</li>
    <li> Each bar lasts a long time, 1.5 months with two people using it every day.  It&#x27;s been great for my fairly dry and sensitive skin (no need for moisturizer afterwards), and doesn&#x27;t leave any harsh fragrance behind.  I think that this is pretty comparable with the Dove soaps in terms of price and sensitivity.

That being said, I love that this bar has only three ingredients in it, and in my head, I feel better using it.</li>
    <li> Really feels good on my skin.  It seems to reduce inflammation.  The couple pimples that I have had since using this are gone in record time.  Not inflamed for days.</li>
    <li> My Husband Will Only Use This Soap Hes 66 And His Skin Is Wonderful</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the reviews here, but was disappointed by the soap in general. It&#x27;s good, but didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. Soap bar doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as advertised...mostly it lasts about as long as any other bar of soap as far as I could tell. I use Dove normally and didn&#x27;t find any drastic difference except for the smell. This did not work any magic on my skin or really do anything special for me.

    <li> Love this.  The only soap we had when I was little.  My grandmother used to make her own.</li>
    <li> Works really well to help combat and calm my husband&#x27;s psoriasis.</li>
    <li> This soap does not lather which is important to some, but it&#x27;s still a great soap.  It cleans well and leaves your skin feeling good.  It is wonderful for people with eczema; helping to keep the skin clear &amp; moisturized.  This soap reminds me of the soap my grandmother used on the farm 50-60 years ago.  It does get very mushy if not allowed to dry well.  I keep it in a raised, draining soap dish so air can circulate around the bar.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Works very well especially for homemade laundry detergent.  Smells good and clean.  Also helps prevent outbreak of poison ivy after contact with the plant.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Really improved my dry and itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Soap that cleans you without a lot of other stuff in it that you more than likely don&#x27;t need. Good stuff!!</li>
    <li> I found this in the tractor supply store, but when they didn&#x27;t have it Amazon came thru...woo hop. Love these products, soap makes me feel so clean, and it doesn&#x27;t have the suds of gels and other products, works great with the logos.</li>
    <li> Has been working great for me and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> A little fragrance wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
