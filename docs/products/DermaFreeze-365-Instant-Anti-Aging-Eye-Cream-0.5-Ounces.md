    <li> Saw little results.  I would not buy it again... Never could get the pump to work either. :(</li>
    <li> Works leaves a  Lil residue</li>
    <li> Love this- it really works</li>
    <li> Misleading advertizement in that the effects only last about 1-2 minutes</li>
    <li> It simply work so good.</li>
    <li> This is Nancy, I use this daily as it is a product I really like, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> A friend uses a Lancome eye cream sold at Macy&#x27;s which seems to work well but costs around $80 for 1/2 ounce.  This product works on me and I have received comments about my eyes looking a lot better than before using it.  For around $20 a half ounce, it&#x27;s a real bargain.  Supposedly the Brazilian plant product in it has been proven to work according to the Mayo Clinic.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about two weeks and I have not seen any change at all! I would not spend the money for this product.</li>
    <li> WAS ILL WHEN ARRIVED .. SO FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT .. BUT WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE A REFUND FOR ALL!?    IS IT TOO LATE FOR A REFUND???</li>
    <li> good eye serum..it is quite firming...used it above and below the eyes...didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like some products do...it doesn&#x27;t take much. a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff really really works! I use it above my upper. I have wrinkles there :( horrible I hate it! So I thought I would see if this works and it does. 💕</li>
    <li> I bought it last week and i love it!!! you have to use it on a clean face.  I use it at night and after my shower in the morning.  I wait 5 minutes before putting on my make up.  all you need is really a little dab, not too much. I saw a difference right away.  I have puffy and dark circles under my eyes and my husband wondered what i&#x27;ve done with my face.  my eyes look fresh and woken up.  i&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for so long.</li>
    <li> No difference at all.</li>
    <li> REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;flakes off and really doesn&#x27;t zap the wrinkles, it could be a better product and relax the wrinkles. thank you</li>
    <li> I wasted hundred of dollars on anti wrinkle eye cream..i wish i had bought this on earlier..it works but on lighter ones more efeectively than the deeper ones..n within few days the lines become less prominent i have been using it since 3 wks.. n planning to buy the face cream too...</li>
    <li> THE DERMA FREEZE365,ARRIVE IN MY HOUSE  VERRY DRY,INSTED I  RETURN ,I MIX W/ SCAR GEL, AND NOW I CAN USE.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product recommending to all my friends. Almost removed all dark circles under my eyes. Need to buy more bottles</li>
    <li> Good product. Works great for about and hour or so. Make sure to have a mirror handy though. Once it dries you get a white crusty film on the area.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Tried a sale bottle at tjmax, and when I went back to get more, no luck. So I checked on trusty amazon, and there it was. Will be continuing to order this product. Lifts the skin under the eyes dramatically without hazy white residue.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all. The 2 dermafreeze tubes were almost empty when received. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I found the product a bit much as far as what I needed.  It definitely has a &#x27;cool&#x27; sensation, and does indeed work quickly.  It didn&#x27;t feel &#x27;natural&#x27; to have the cool sensation, nor the coating on the skin that would show if you rubbed your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found &amp;#34;MenScience Eye Rescue Formula&amp;#34; much more natural, and worked sufficiently for my needs.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to really use this to see if it works really well because it would sting the heck out of my skin under my eyes. The pain would get more intense the longer I left it on, so both times I tried to use it, I had to wipe it off. Very annoying! I&#x27;ve used lots of eye creams but none that caused me physical pain!</li>
    <li> Everything perfect!!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> parabens - BAD, BAD, BAD!!!  as in potentially carcinogenic! but the U.S. FDA continues to allow manufacturers to include it in virtually all our cosmetics (if you hunt you can find some that don&#x27;t include - i refuse to buy anything else).  BAM!  this one is OFF my shopping list.  I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for a healthful under-eye cream or treatment that includes Brazilian zuma.  i was on the mayoclinic.com site looking for help with my dark circles (which occasionally cause people to ask me who punched me) and they mentioned that study without naming the product.  wish they were a little less circumspect.</li>
    <li> I did not try the product, because what I received was a well used dried up box of the product. I was afraid to even get it near my eyes. Would never order it again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Works great!!! Will buy again!!!</li>
