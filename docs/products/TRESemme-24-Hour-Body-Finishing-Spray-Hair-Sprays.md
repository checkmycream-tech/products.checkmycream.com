      <li>I love this hair spray.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this hairspray.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I feel like my hair is better off not even spraying it with this.</li>
      <li>I am better off using gel than this.</li>
      <li>I finally found it at Amazon &amp; was very happy.</li>
      <li>I read an article online yesterday about when your favorite products have been discontinued and it mentioned looking online.  </li>
      <li>It smells amazing and it really does hold well all while keeping volume in your hair since it is very light.</li>
      <li>It does have a notably strong hold for all day use even with teased hair.</li>
      <li>it is never there, which is fine because I can just buy it online.</li>
      <li>The spray is like a mist and light.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t always find it readily available.</li>
      <li>Great hairspray holds my fine hair better than any other product I have tried .</li>
      <li>hairspray does have a prominent \\&quot;girly\\&quot; scent, which was a bit bothersome at first, but it grew on me.</li>
      <li>Several people have complimented that it smelled good.</li>
      <li>The greatest thing is that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all, leaves my hair bouncy and adds a subtle shine...</li>
      <li>4.5 star worthy for it&#x27;s price and capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous others and while this isn&#x27;t perfect, I&#x27;ve gone back to it a couple times</li>
      <li>This product came fast and it spray easily.</li>
      <li>; them in and the lids come off and crack and on rare occasions leak.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;* Washes off easily with any decent drugstore shampoo (don&#x27;t ever bother with TRESemme shampoos and conditioners, they don&#x27;t work in removing this</li>
      <li>You can spray a reasonably large amount of this and get good hold with limited stiffness.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years &amp; love it.</li>
      <li>cant get enough of this and it gests here quickly!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use hairspray much, but this does what I need it to do.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t guarantee flake-free finish from every bottle; for the most part all my other spray cans did not leave any flakes.</li>
      <li>Some of the containers I have purchased are so hard to press the spray button on the top that I couldn&#x27;t get any spray out!</li>
      <li>Every other product I have tried weighed down my hair, but this hairspray is light and goes on in a very fine mist.</li>
      <li>This product works as well as any high end salon product i have ever used.</li>
      <li>With hair like mine, you loose volume and bounce and it falls flat very easily.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally use product in my hair.  </li>
      <li>so I would definitely say its worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice subtle shine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product adds soft control without weighting my fine hair down.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every single hairspray on the market from the most expensive one to the cheapest and was never 100% satisfied.</li>
      <li>My hair looks bouncy , shiny and not stiff at all.</li>
      <li>I little expensive but a great product!</li>
      <li>It is long-lasting while leaving my hair feeling soft (not crunchy or sticky at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For those with sensitive skin, this hairspray may or may not cause breakouts, so that is truly a wildcard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has been working for me so far.</li>
      <li>Unless you are planning on doing a lot of physical activity, this hairspray won&#x27;t really hold your style in place all day.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and there isn&#x27;t a hard sticky feeling left on my hair once sprayed.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine and limp hair that goes past my shoulders.</li>
      <li>This is the only hairspray that works for my fine, thin hair.</li>

<li> &lt;br /&gt;In comparison to all the other failed hairsprays I have tried under $10.00, this hairspray is lightweight, yet still does a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /</li>
<li> The finishing spray is nice but the container is very awkward to use.  </li>
<li> It is very light but does the job without the ugly sticky quality or the rats nest other sprays create.</li>

<li> Other places just &amp;#34;throw&amp;#34</li>
<li> It does not hold up against humidity just like any other hairspray out there</li>
<li> I have curly hair, a bit dry and not easy to maintain in shape.</li>
<li> No sticky mess</li>
<li> I have been very disappointed to find that so many stores have stopped carrying it!</li>
<li> It helps give my hair some body and bounce and lift without being overly stiff or sticky.  </li>
<li> It does not leave a stiff finish.</li>
<li> It is hard to press the nozzle down.  </li>
<li> Lately I have been unable to find it in several stores.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t get sticky and hard, but doesn&#x27;t hold.</li>
<li> So if I have one that is too hard to push, I just hold it upside-down and hit the button against the rim of the sink.</li>
<li> /&gt;What is so disappointing is that it is so hard to find anywhere.</li>
<li> bad thing is that it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not terribly awesome</li>
<li> Too bad it seems as though it might have been discontinued???</li>
<li> (Finishes my look) and doesn&#x27;t smell all that bad.</li>

    <li> This is the only hairspray that works for my fine, thin hair. Every other product I have tried weighed down my hair, but this hairspray is light and goes on in a very fine mist. It is long-lasting while leaving my hair feeling soft (not crunchy or sticky at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have had a problem with is the container. Some of the containers I have purchased are so hard to press the spray button on the top that I couldn&#x27;t get any spray out! I saw on their website that others have had this problem, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I think I have found a solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, I accidentally dropped my hairspray and the button at the top hit the sink countertop. After that, I was able to press the button easily every time! So if I have one that is too hard to push, I just hold it upside-down and hit the button against the rim of the sink. This has been working for me so far. If you are having the same problem, try it!</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray. It keeps your hair in place but doesn&#x27;t harden.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair.  This product adds soft control without weighting my fine hair down.  I little expensive but a great product!</li>
    <li> This is by no means the perfect spray, or I would have given it five stars, but it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve found.  You can spray a reasonably large amount of this and get good hold with limited stiffness. It is very light but does the job without the ugly sticky quality or the rats nest other sprays create. The only downside that doesn&#x27;t allow for five stars is the smell. It&#x27;s not terribly awesome but it is strong and difficult to avoid- you&#x27;ll smell hairspray all day.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous others and while this isn&#x27;t perfect, I&#x27;ve gone back to it a couple times so I would definitely say its worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use product in my hair.  I chose this item because of the great reviews and price Amazon had offered.  This product is awesome!  I love the smell and there isn&#x27;t a hard sticky feeling left on my hair once sprayed.  No sticky mess what so ever and was easy to brush through at the end of the night!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It holds my style beautifully. My hair looks bouncy , shiny and not stiff at all. This product works as well as any high end salon product i have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray holds my fine hair better than any other product I have tried . Wish it came in bigger bottles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every single hairspray on the market from the most expensive one to the cheapest and was never 100% satisfied. When I found TRESemme 24 Hour Body I stopped searching. This product is SO incredibly good that I will never use anything else, no matter what name/brand would be on the bottle. I have curly hair, a bit dry and not easy to maintain in shape. But when I spray it with this stuff, it just falls into shape and stays there. The greatest thing is that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all, leaves my hair bouncy and adds a subtle shine...It smells really good too - another bonus!&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is that it&#x27;s hard to find. I used to get it from RiteAid but it just disappeared from the shelves...So I had to order it online.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...5 stars for this product, TRESemme!</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this hairspray for years, I absolutely love it! I have very fine and limp hair that goes past my shoulders. With hair like mine, you loose volume and bounce and it falls flat very easily.  I use this spray every day. It helps give my hair some body and bounce and lift without being overly stiff or sticky.  Its the only spray that I use.  I have been very disappointed to find that so many stores have stopped carrying it! When I do find it in a store, I stock up and buy 3-4 bottles at a time! I read an article online yesterday about when your favorite products have been discontinued and it mentioned looking online.  I&#x27;m thrilled to see that Amazon is carrying it and I can order it anytime I need to! If anyone from the TRESemme company is reading this- please, please, please put it back on the shelves!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years &amp; love it. Lately I have been unable to find it in several stores. I finally found it at Amazon &amp; was very happy. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this hairspray. It smells amazing and it really does hold well all while keeping volume in your hair since it is very light. I have been using it for years after I found it on Allure&#x27;s Best of Beauty list. Too bad it seems as though it might have been discontinued??? Everytime I go to Target it is never there, which is fine because I can just buy it online.</li>
    <li> The product was packed very nicely.  Other places just &amp;#34;throw&amp;#34; them in and the lids come off and crack and on rare occasions leak.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> cant get enough of this and it gests here quickly!</li>
    <li> 4.5 star worthy for it&#x27;s price and capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor&lt;br /&gt;This hairspray does have a prominent \\&quot;girly\\&quot; scent, which was a bit bothersome at first, but it grew on me. Several people have complimented that it smelled good. Some even took a closer whiff... yup that&#x27;s it... smells good. It&#x27;s not as overpowering as Dove&#x27;s Style+Care Extra Hold Hairspray that has pink accents (I tried that and it wasn&#x27;t good at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to all the other failed hairsprays I have tried under $10.00, this hairspray is lightweight, yet still does a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* It does have a notably strong hold for all day use even with teased hair.

I try Target, Walmart, CVS, Walgreens... I just can&#x27;t always find it readily available.</li>
    <li> This product came fast and it spray easily. I don&#x27;t use hairspray much, but this does what I need it to do. (Finishes my look) and doesn&#x27;t smell all that bad.</li>
    <li> I have long thick asian hair. This does not hold my curls ever and even in humidity or wind. It doesn&#x27;t get sticky and hard, but doesn&#x27;t hold. I will not be purchasing this again. I am better off using gel than this. Sometimes I feel like my hair is better off not even spraying it with this. The spray is like a mist and light. I like the way it sprays compared to others, but wish it would hold my style.</li>
    <li> The finishing spray is nice but the container is very awkward to use.  It is hard to press the nozzle down.  I find myself using both hands which is not standard when using hair spray.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray.</li>
