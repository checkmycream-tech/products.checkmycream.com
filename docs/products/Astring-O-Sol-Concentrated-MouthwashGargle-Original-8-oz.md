      <li>I buy A String O-Sol often, I love it!</li>
      <li>The power of this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>I honestly have not had a sore throat since I started using this product.  </li>
      <li>This is far and away the best mouth rinse.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that it is very strong and make sure you dilute before using.  </li>
      <li>I like it and will order more.</li>
      <li>He reported that his throat immediately felt better and the gargle removed the mucous that was clinging to his tonsils.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for many decades.</li>
      <li>I have been using Astring-O-Sol mouthwash for a number of years and am completely satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Use in warm water as a gargle or we even use full strength on sores in the mouth.</li>
      <li>The most amazing thing Astring-o-sol does for me is that when I put a drop of it on a new mosquito bite, it ensures that it will soon relieve the pain and eliminate the longer term itch.</li>
      <li>Using it in my WaterPik, just about an eighth of an inch in in the mixing cap is all it takes for a full WaterPik tank.</li>
      <li>Mosquito bites really bother me, and I&#x27;ve tried many products DESIGNED for bites, but nothing works as well for me as Astring-o-sol.</li>
      <li>I used this stuff full strength and have to wear a lobster bib all the time now.  </li>
      <li>Super extraordinary.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it is no longer available over the counter.</li>
      <li>Little known mouth wash and great for gargling for sore throats</li>
      <li>A few drops makes for a great effect.  </li>
      <li>It is worth the buy.</li>
      <li>but my breath is fresh and flamable</li>
      <li>I have used it since childhood, and find it superior to every other mouthwash on the market.  </li>
      <li>It is a strong, but pleasant, interesting and very refreshing tasting mouthwash that comes highly concentrated and only several drops are used in a small glass of water.</li>
      <li>The problem is the too-large UPC label in the middle of the backside, cannot easily be removed &amp; obscures the important part of the instructions.  </li>
      <li>Really strong stuff - - a bottle lasts me nearly 3 months (once a day).</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told my fiance to dilute it first</li>
      <li>While it is far cheaper if you can buy it in Mexico, it is still worth the money at this much higher price.</li>
      <li>When used properly, it leaves your mouth tingling fresh with a mild Wintergreen flavor.  </li>
      <li>It is very economical and can be mixed to whatever strength I require.</li>
      <li>It has a refreshing scent that&#x27;s not sweet, and that makes your mouth feel fresh and alive.</li>
      <li>Astring-o-sol has been around for a long time; I remember using it in my teens which means it was available in the mid-to-late 1960&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used it daily for the past 20 years and it is good for the breath, teeth, and mouth.  </li>
      <li>This a tremendous product; a long time ago that I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>Concentrated and it should last very long.&lt;br</li>
      <li>5 stars if it were a larger container so that I don&#x27;t have to re-order much.</li>
      <li>Used it daily diluted, works well on cankers straight</li>
      <li>Right after starting to use this, my next dental appointment showed 25% reduction in &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; -- the depth of the gum line.</li>
      <li>64 oz, which is 2 quarts and not a half gallon.  </li>
      <li>i am 84 years old  (but don&#x27;t look a day over 83) and was introduced to to this product at about the age of six -- about 10 years after my parents started using it -- and have used it daily since.  </li>
      <li>Seriously, if you go too strong you might burn off a layer of mouth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a highly concentrated mouthwash that goes a very long way.</li>
      <li>Thanks to other reviewers as it was their advice that had me pick this.</li>
      <li>It is exspensive, but when one considers that it is very effective when using only a few drops in a small glass of water, it is actually quite inexpensie compared to other mouthwash products on the market.</li>

    <li> I remember this mouth rinse from childhood. We wanted a concentrated mouth rise for an upcoming trip.  The only instructions are  on the backside of front label that are to be read from back of bottle.  The problem is the too-large UPC label in the middle of the backside, cannot easily be removed &amp; obscures the important part of the instructions.  Also the relatively dark liquid makes the visible part of the label difficult to read. There is a small measuring cap with lines for the rinse and water addition.  The dilution factor is ~ 1:8 and NOT indicated anywhere. The front label indicates &amp;#34;makes up to 1 gallon.&amp;#34;  Perhaps, but only if the user dilutes the diluted mouth rinse to &amp;#34;half strength.&amp;#34; That is 8 oz X 8 (dilution factor) &#x3D; 64 oz, which is 2 quarts and not a half gallon.  The seller should be ashamed!</li>
    <li> Astring-o-sol has been around for a long time; I remember using it in my teens which means it was available in the mid-to-late 1960&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a highly concentrated mouthwash that goes a very long way. It has a refreshing scent that&#x27;s not sweet, and that makes your mouth feel fresh and alive. The most amazing thing Astring-o-sol does for me is that when I put a drop of it on a new mosquito bite, it ensures that it will soon relieve the pain and eliminate the longer term itch. Mosquito bites really bother me, and I&#x27;ve tried many products DESIGNED for bites, but nothing works as well for me as Astring-o-sol. I recommend it for both breath and bites.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this mouthwash for years. While it is far cheaper if you can buy it in Mexico, it is still worth the money at this much higher price.</li>
    <li> This a tremendous product; a long time ago that I don&#x27;t use it. this refresh the mouth and kill bacteria. Super extraordinary.</li>
    <li> The item has been delivered to Japan in three days .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Mix this item to salt water.&lt;br /&gt;2. Let the nose gargle.&lt;br /&gt;3. Sinusitis heals in about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy.</li>
    <li> have used this product since childhood</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for over 30 years and it still works great. Use in warm water as a gargle or we even use full strength on sores in the mouth.</li>
    <li> i am 84 years old  (but don&#x27;t look a day over 83) and was introduced to to this product at about the age of six -- about 10 years after my parents started using it -- and have used it daily since.  It is a strong, but pleasant, interesting and very refreshing tasting mouthwash that comes highly concentrated and only several drops are used in a small glass of water.

    <li> I have dentures and when I get a sore from the dentures I rinse my mouth with Astring-O-Sol and the next day the sores are gone.</li>
    <li> As expected, kind of expensive!</li>
    <li> Great product. I buy it every time we run out.</li>
    <li> This is far and away the best mouth rinse.  A few drops makes for a great effect.  I have been using it for many decades.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product that beats salt water for a sore throat. My son, who had recently had mono, was dealing with the bad sore throat that typically accompanies it. Recommended salt water gargle didn&#x27;t help. I suggested he try Astring-O-Sol. He reported that his throat immediately felt better and the gargle removed the mucous that was clinging to his tonsils. This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
    <li> I wish I read the directions.  I used this stuff full strength and have to wear a lobster bib all the time now.  I look like Miley Cyrus with my tongue sticking out but my breath is fresh and flamable</li>
    <li> It is worth the buy. Concentrated and it should last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told my fiance to dilute it first but he didn&#x27;t listen and he got stung by a little dosage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great.</li>
    <li> Really strong stuff - - a bottle lasts me nearly 3 months (once a day). Right after starting to use this, my next dental appointment showed 25% reduction in &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; -- the depth of the gum line. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used it daily for the past 20 years and it is good for the breath, teeth, and mouth.  No matter what you do or how you do it, don&#x27;t swallow it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Astring-O-Sol for over 60 years. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. It is very economical and can be mixed to whatever strength I require.</li>
    <li> The power of this stuff is amazing. I don&#x27;t think anything can survive in my mouth (even with just a tiny bit with a lot of water). Seriously, if you go too strong you might burn off a layer of mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to fight sore throats since 1999.  Whenever I feel a sore throat coming on I gargle with Astringosol every few hours.  I honestly have not had a sore throat since I started using this product.  I have to say that it is very strong and make sure you dilute before using.  My kids, other family members, and also friends are now using it.  I&#x27;ve been telling people about it for years.  Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t something you can just pick up from a drug store.  It is over-the-counter, but it&#x27;s not a stocked item.  You&#x27;ll have to have your pharmicist order it or you can get it here on Amazon.  I recommend Amazon because you&#x27;ll get it delivered right to your door, don&#x27;t have to hassle with ordering it with a pharmacist, plus its less expensive!  By the way, one bottle will last you several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash since I was 10 when my grandmother introduced it to me, it prevents gingivitis and heals mouth sores. It is concentraded so you get a lot out of one bottle since you have to mix it with water.</li>
    <li> Have used it for 60 years.  Greatest mouthwash ever!  Very economical because it requires only a few drops in a small glass of water. Unfortunately it is no longer available over the counter.</li>
    <li> Using it in my WaterPik, just about an eighth of an inch in in the mixing cap is all it takes for a full WaterPik tank. I like it and will order more. Thanks to other reviewers as it was their advice that had me pick this. 5 stars if it were a larger container so that I don&#x27;t have to re-order much.</li>
    <li> I have been using Astring-O-Sol mouthwash for a number of years and am completely satisfied.  I have not found a mouthwash that can compare with the freshness and confidence I feel after using it.</li>
    <li> I buy A String O-Sol often, I love it!</li>
    <li> Little known mouth wash and great for gargling for sore throats</li>
    <li> I searched a long time trying to find Astring-O-Sol.  It&#x27;s a great product.  When used properly, it leaves your mouth tingling fresh with a mild Wintergreen flavor.  I&#x27;ve used this product for 25 years and Amazon always seems to have the best price.</li>
