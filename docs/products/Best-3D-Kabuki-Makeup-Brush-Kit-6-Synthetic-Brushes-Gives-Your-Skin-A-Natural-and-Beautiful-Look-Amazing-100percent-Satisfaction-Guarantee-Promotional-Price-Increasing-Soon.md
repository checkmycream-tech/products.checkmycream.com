      <li>Nice packaging.  </li>
      <li>For me they were very easy to work with</li>
      <li>I love how it comes with a nice roll up carry case to store the brushes.</li>
      <li>The leather roll smells like chemical and is made cheaply but it serves it&#x27;s purpose and will be good to use for travel.</li>

      <li>Very cheaply made</li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast and the customer service with this company is amazing!</li>
      <li>First of all I have to say that the Customer service of this company is Amazing!</li>
      <li>and I love the results I got when I used them.</li>
      <li>so I am sure they wouldn’t of come out well</li>
      <li>I feel more sexy knowing</li>
      <li>and I am glad I caught this at the price I did and am able to share my opinion.</li>
      <li>The larger brush in this set is the best of both worlds!</li>
      <li>I love how sturdy every thing is</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>What I don&#x27;t love is that you get 3 of each.</li>
      <li>and I honestly love them.</li>
      <li>Really liking these brushe and the qaulity of them are great.</li>
      <li>and this one is my favorite go to brush now</li>
      <li>but once you wash them its much better.</li>
      <li>I will have a better review up on my channel with a demo and more details.</li>
      <li>I was pretty excited to get these brushes because they look so beautiful in the photos.</li>
      <li>I have tried several others and these put my makeup on nice and even!!</li>
      <li>fast delivery great packaging great brush quality... love the shape especially around the eyes...</li>
      <li>I enjoy how you get three of each since brushes used with cream products get the most wear and tear....especially foundation.</li>
      <li>I think these brushes are able to be easily used for basic or more experienced person that does make-up.</li>
      <li>In most sets you get, you get a foundation, concealer, contour and blush brushes and with these, I don&#x27;t see or understand how they vary from one brush to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadow brushes are also extremely similar and while most sets have a shadow brush, a detail brush and blending brush, these all seem more like blending brushes and there isn&#x27;t a brush that I feel like I could use to get good detail with my shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love full coverage makeup and this brush gives you that flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very hard to find a good brush to blend your makeup well</li>
      <li>and they work just fine it as well.</li>
      <li>I have been using them for a few days and they flawlessly and smoothly put my makeup on.</li>
      <li>and they smelled like cheap plastic.  </li>
      <li>Brushes blend fabulously.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the quality of them are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>They also clean up easily for those that use pigments etc when putting on makeup.</li>
      <li>I got them super fast and they came nicely packaged .</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for this brush simply because I can&#x27;t find its ideal use.</li>
      <li>how well they clean when I clean them</li>
      <li>Everything went on in a single layer these were ust great...</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, I really have been enjoying each of these... and what I&#x27;m finding is that it&#x27;s nice to be able to move onto the next one instead of having to wash them every week</li>
      <li>The shape of them is super unique to anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  </li>
      <li>What I love about it is that I really like both types of brushes in this set.</li>
      <li>Does have a strong odor at first</li>
      <li>and I love that these are soooo soft!!</li>
      <li>The flat top kabuki style is my favorite to buff foundation in.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes they are very soft and the white leather pouch is a bonus these brushes give you amazing coverage</li>
      <li>I love how soft the brushes are.  </li>
      <li>either way the handles of these brushes are better than I have come across so far.</li>
      <li>Super soft and easy to apply my makeup.</li>
      <li>The other kind is a pointed flat paint brush style which is good for precision.</li>
      <li>They really are a great set as far as quality and fall out goes, but when I get a brush set, I want to have brushes for different uses,</li>
      <li>I decided it would be better to use my daughter because I am not any good at the selfie game</li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve had these for quite some time and just was at a loss as to how to properly review</li>
      <li>I feel like it would have been even better to get 6 different types of brushes.</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying 3D shaped brushes.</li>
      <li>I first tried it with concealer.</li>
      <li>Super soft brush set.</li>
      <li>They are super soft.</li>
      <li>They just don&#x27;t seem to be a large difference in the brushes.  </li>
      <li>The smaller brushes however don&#x27;t have much of a 3D shape to them in order to get in any creases like they are meant for, but they work fine as a blending brush.</li>
      <li>The delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>ty so much</li>
      <li>I do have to say that they are very soft and the large brushes work well to apply my foundation.</li>
      <li>I am a 35 year old female that has recently gotten back into doing make-up more.</li>
      <li>My only improvement would be that it is a little more dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will also say that the brushes are soft, the bristles are not stiff which made applying her makeup even easier.</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>All i can is wow</li>
      <li>They are so soft.</li>
      <li>The 3D Kabuki brushes come in a set of six - 3 larges brushes all the exact same and #smaller brushes all of the exact same as well.</li>
      <li>First I will say that I am prone to break makeup brushes, I don’t know whether it is the way that they are made or if I am just rough on things but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve had these for quite some time and just was at a loss as to how to properly review these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that these brushes truly are a great quality brush.  The shape of them is super unique to anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  I like how hey are angled on either side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is with the variety of the set.  They just don&#x27;t seem to be a large difference in the brushes.  The three larger brushes all are so similar in size that I don&#x27;t see them as having different uses.  In most sets you get, you get a foundation, concealer, contour and blush brushes and with these, I don&#x27;t see or understand how they vary from one brush to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadow brushes are also extremely similar and while most sets have a shadow brush, a detail brush and blending brush, these all seem more like blending brushes and there isn&#x27;t a brush that I feel like I could use to get good detail with my shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the quality of them are fantastic.  They really are a great set as far as quality and fall out goes, but when I get a brush set, I want to have brushes for different uses, not all the same size brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Sample Provided for Inspection &amp; Review</li>
    <li> These are AWESOME! They are so soft. I had a chance to get these on a promotional deal in exchange for my opinion and honest review. I think these were wonderful I have been using them for a few days and they flawlessly and smoothly put my makeup on. I use all powder makeup except my eyeliner and these did the trick. Everything went on in a single layer these were ust great...</li>
    <li> Sent them back. They were soft but other than that not good. The cut if the brush wasn&#x27;t even. Random hairs sticking out . Very cheaply made</li>
    <li> I got them super fast and they came nicely packaged . They are super soft. I will have a better review up on my channel with a demo and more details. They have a unique shape that&#x27;s good for getting under the eyes..... I will let you know how well they clean when I clean them</li>
    <li> Usually I don’t do picture reviews but I decided since this is for makeup brushes I would go ahead and do one. First I will say that I am prone to break makeup brushes, I don’t know whether it is the way that they are made or if I am just rough on things but either way the handles of these brushes are better than I have come across so far. Instead of using my face I decided it would be better to use my daughter because I am not any good at the selfie game so I am sure they wouldn’t of come out well and I also only did half her face. Now I did this so that everyone can see the difference between using these brushes to not only do her eye makeup but to do the contouring that we usually do around here. The brushes were very easy to work with and they have a good weight to them. I know no one ever thinks about the weight of a makeup brush in their hands but it is something that I always think about. I will also say that the brushes are soft, the bristles are not stiff which made applying her makeup even easier. For me they were very easy to work with and I love the results I got when I used them. They also clean up easily for those that use pigments etc when putting on makeup. I am very pleased with this set and I am glad I caught this at the price I did and am able to share my opinion. If you are looking for brushes that will stand up these are ones you should consider.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they are very soft and the white leather pouch is a bonus these brushes give you amazing coverage I love full coverage makeup and this brush gives you that flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very hard to find a good brush to blend your makeup well and this one is my favorite go to brush now</li>
    <li> I got mine in the mail 2 days ago and wanted to mess around to get a feel of them before giving a review and I honestly love them.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying 3D shaped brushes. The leather roll smells like chemical and is made cheaply but it serves it&#x27;s purpose and will be good to use for travel. I enjoy how you get three of each since brushes used with cream products get the most wear and tear....especially foundation. Shipping was very fast and the customer service with this company is amazing! I&#x27;ve owned this set for 3 weeks and they have been used almost every day and been washed a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larger brush:&lt;br /&gt;Great for foundation! Foundation brushes typically come in 2 styles. The flat top kabuki style is my favorite to buff foundation in. The other kind is a pointed flat paint brush style which is good for precision. The larger brush in this set is the best of both worlds! My only improvement would be that it is a little more dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smaller brush:&lt;br /&gt;The smaller brush has a very subtle 3D shape to it. I don&#x27;t really care for this brush simply because I can&#x27;t find its ideal use. I first tried it with concealer. It works alright but I feel like the bristles aren&#x27;t dense enough to blend in concealer. I then tried it as a crease blending brush for eye shadow and it is too big. I think it&#x27;s best use is for highlighting the face but I&#x27;m still trying out other uses.</li>
    <li> These are horrible.  The look NOTHING like the picture and they smelled like cheap plastic.  I&#x27;m only giving it one star because I have to.</li>
    <li> PerfecT styling brushes . Everything is legit . The bristles on the brush fees great on my skin . I love how sturdy every thing is</li>
    <li> Really liking these brushe and the qaulity of them are great. Super soft and easy to apply my makeup. There are enough to use for foundation and concealer. I also been using them for my highlighter and they work just fine it as well. I love how it comes with a nice roll up carry case to store the brushes.</li>
    <li> extremely  happy with the come out of these brushes fast delivery great packaging great brush quality... love the shape especially around the eyes...ty so much</li>
    <li> Got my brush set today and I love that these are soooo soft!! I will recommend these to others</li>
    <li> Super soft brush set. Blends well. Does have a strong odor at first but once you wash them its much better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes!! I have tried several others and these put my makeup on nice and even!! I would recommend these to anyone!! Great brushes!!</li>
    <li> I am a 35 year old female that has recently gotten back into doing make-up more. I was so happy to come across these brushes. I think these brushes are able to be easily used for basic or more experienced person that does make-up. I have to say these brushes have motivated me to want to do my make-up everyday! I feel more sexy knowing I can do perfect make-up with these brushes.</li>
    <li> Great buy! The delivery was fast. Nice packaging.  I love how soft the brushes are.  Brushes blend fabulously. You do how ever get  3 of each brush. Definitely recommend buying!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Best brushes ever. Used yesterday to apply my mineral makeup. All i can is wow the difference is wow. I definitely would recommend hese to everyone.</li>
    <li> What I love about it is that I really like both types of brushes in this set. What I don&#x27;t love is that you get 3 of each. I feel like it would have been even better to get 6 different types of brushes. HOWEVER, I really have been enjoying each of these... and what I&#x27;m finding is that it&#x27;s nice to be able to move onto the next one instead of having to wash them every week (yes, I&#x27;m lazy). That&#x27;s shown me that, sometimes, having 3 isn&#x27;t so bad after all! :) I received this product for review, and all opinions remain my own.</li>
    <li> First of all I have to say that the Customer service of this company is Amazing! I was pretty excited to get these brushes because they look so beautiful in the photos. When i did receive them i was a little disappointed! The first thing that i noticed was the horrible smell of oil or cheap plastic and then when i took the brushes out of the packaging, i was realized that they aren&#x27;t nearly as beautiful as they look in the photos. The 3D Kabuki brushes come in a set of six - 3 larges brushes all the exact same and #smaller brushes all of the exact same as well. I was hoping for all different brushes. I do have to say that they are very soft and the large brushes work well to apply my foundation. The smaller brushes however don&#x27;t have much of a 3D shape to them in order to get in any creases like they are meant for, but they work fine as a blending brush. If you are looking for a cheaper 3D brush then the Sigma brush, i would say to spend the extra on the Sigma. If you are looking for back up brushes to keep on hand these might work great for that. I recieved these brushes at a great promotional price in exchange for my honest review, however all opinions are my own!</li>
