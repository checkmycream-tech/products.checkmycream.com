      <li>Amazing product, fast delivery</li>
      <li>(Note: because I have more severe acne, this product cannot clear up my skin on its own, so keep that in mind.</li>
      <li>Cleanses well, extremely gentle for combination skin, exfoliant is mild, but effective.</li>
      <li>Really good for dry skin like mine but haven&#x27;t seen a huge increase in my blemishes</li>
      <li>Great product but not right for my skin.  </li>
      <li>My favorite product for when my skin acts up with adult acne.  </li>
      <li>Washing my face makes me smile.</li>
      <li>so, with high hopes, i tried it, fully expecting it to be better than the regenerist for my particular issues.  </li>
      <li>i feel completely underwhelmed, but can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about the regenerist.  </li>
      <li>It cleans, softens, wards off adult blemishes, and at under $8/tube ( about a 2month supply) is economical in a world filled with designer skin care.</li>
      <li>both!The combination of these two products not only cleared up my problem acne almost overnight, but it also helped to erase and minimize acne scars! :)</li>
      <li>I love this daily cleanser.</li>
      <li>It really works, too (on both fronts).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m under a dermatologist&#x27;s care, now and have a gentle prescription that works for me.</li>
      <li>I really recommend it to whoever  wants to try it.</li>
      <li>Especially when you consider the low price (and that it&#x27;s readily available at most drugstores and even some major grocery</li>
      <li>But with the Olay Total Effects I did not get any pimples and my face feels refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
      <li>This product really keeps my little bit of adult acne under control while being kind to my skin.</li>
      <li>and i LOVE the regenerist pore detoxifying scrub and went to the olay website to see what they recommend for my specific issues, and the survey recommended this total effects cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday and my face is super soft and blemish free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 30 years, old, and I still breakout during that time of the month.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 48 and look much younger, thanks to OLAY products.</li>
      <li>it completely faded my age spots, reduced my pore size, evened out my skin texture....</li>
      <li>My skin has been very clear using this product along with the Total Effects moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Third: I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a major reduction in signs of aging, but so far, my skin definitely looks healthier and brighter overall.     </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is the only thing that has worked for controlling breakouts.  I use it in combination with the Definity correcting protecting lotion (it&#x27;s the only combination that works for me - I&#x27;ve tried using it with other oil of olay lotions, including the blemish control lotion without results).</li>
    <li> I love this daily cleanser. I don&#x27;t have any complaints on this as it works for my skin type. I tried a Biore facial scrub but it did not work for me. I ended up getting small pimples on my face. But with the Olay Total Effects I did not get any pimples and my face feels refreshed and clean after using it. I use this on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> i have oily skin and easily clogged pores.  no matter what oily skin formulations i use, i have the same problem.  i went to a friend&#x27;s wedding and her skin looked amazing so i asked her what she was using, and she (to my surprise) said olay regerist.  so i tried it and i LOVE the regenerist pore detoxifying scrub and went to the olay website to see what they recommend for my specific issues, and the survey recommended this total effects cleanser.  so, with high hopes, i tried it, fully expecting it to be better than the regenerist for my particular issues.  not so.  it&#x27;s a creamy cleanser that leaves my skin oily and i have clogged pores again.  it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, though.  i feel completely underwhelmed, but can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about the regenerist.  it completely faded my age spots, reduced my pore size, evened out my skin texture....</li>
    <li> I really love this product, its amazing. I use it everyday and my face is super soft and blemish free. I really recommend it to whoever  wants to try it.</li>
    <li> This product really keeps my little bit of adult acne under control while being kind to my skin. Very hard to find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Great product but not right for my skin.  I&#x27;m under a dermatologist&#x27;s care, now and have a gentle prescription that works for me. However, for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; adult acne this is a great product.  It&#x27;s just too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> What an amazing product! I&#x27;m 30 years, old, and I still breakout during that time of the month. Olay works well with the toner that I use for my face, and I am going to start using the entire line&lt;br /&gt;because it works well. I have noticed less breakouts and smoother skin when I put my makeup on.</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of products, but this is the only product that actually worked for me.  I also use the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]] with this and I love them both!The combination of these two products not only cleared up my problem acne almost overnight, but it also helped to erase and minimize acne scars! :)</li>
    <li> The product is great. Bought for my husband, who has never done anything to help his skin, I was able to convince him to try it just once. He did, and saw remarkable results in one day. His skin is brighter, tighter (instead of saggy), even-toned and no blemishes. He now uses it once a day and looks years younger. The 3-star rating is due to the cost. After ordering it, I found it at a big box store for half the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> As many of you with skin problems probably know, it&#x27;s usually impossible to treat acne AND signs of aging at the same time--I&#x27;m 31 and have been trying to help stop early/future wrinkles, but the traditional anti-aging products usually have ingredients that make me break out. So I was resorting to having to choose one or the other: did I want younger looking skin OR clear skin? Needless to say, finding this product was a godsend!     It really works, too (on both fronts). What I love THE MOST is that it&#x27;s effective on my acne without overdrying my skin. Whoo hoo! Second: it smells WONDERFUL. Washing my face makes me smile. &#x3D;-) It smells so good. Third: I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a major reduction in signs of aging, but so far, my skin definitely looks healthier and brighter overall.     Especially when you consider the low price (and that it&#x27;s readily available at most drugstores and even some major grocery stores)--this is one of the best products IN THE WORLD!    (Note: because I have more severe acne, this product cannot clear up my skin on its own, so keep that in mind. If you have more severe blemishes, this probably won&#x27;t be a miracle cream. I need more products in my anti-fighting regimin. However, this product is A DARN GOOD START!)</li>
    <li> Whatever year this came out (2005 or so) I&#x27;ve been using it. There is no substitution or store brand comparison. It cleans, softens, wards off adult blemishes, and at under $8/tube ( about a 2month supply) is economical in a world filled with designer skin care.</li>
    <li> Cleanses well, extremely gentle for combination skin, exfoliant is mild, but effective. would reccomend to anyone. Four more words here.</li>
    <li> It is hit or miss for me to find this in stores. I now stock pile it wherever I can find them. I do not know why their aren&#x27;t other products similar to this one. How many people have an issue with blemishes but are also trying to fight the aging process. I use this every night after removing my make up before bed. Love it</li>
    <li> My favorite product for when my skin acts up with adult acne.  Keeps my skin hydrates and vanishes blemishes in just two days! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really good for dry skin like mine but haven&#x27;t seen a huge increase in my blemishes</li>
    <li> Please ask me later.  I have not tried this yet.  I am finishing up the daily cleanser I have been using.</li>
    <li> Best face wash for smooth, clear skin with added benefit of anti-aging! I&#x27;m 48 and look much younger, thanks to OLAY products. I also eat well so that also helps.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have found for my complexion. I cannot find this product in the store so I am glad it is available online! My skin has been very clear using this product along with the Total Effects moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Great product, and I&#x27;ve used olay for years!</li>
