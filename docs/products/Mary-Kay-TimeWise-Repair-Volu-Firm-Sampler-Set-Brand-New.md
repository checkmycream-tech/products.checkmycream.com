    <li> As expected and wonderful price.</li>
    <li> Not at all as pictured. What I received was probably a sample which a Mary Kay rep would hand out. Barely enough for one time applications in a foil packet.  Vastly overpriced.</li>
    <li> Skin feels so clean and clear. Comes in a pretty box great for gift giving. Hint hint. The supplier was very quick with my order!</li>
    <li> I got it for my mom and she loved it!</li>

    <li> This item is a rip off-DO NOT BUY- $8.99 for samples that are given away for free!!!  I want my money back.  This vendor is not to be trusted and I will never buy anything from them again.  They should not be permitted to sell with false advertising!!!</li>

Love Marykay though and the product works wonders on my face,</li>
    <li> Very good product, just what I was looking for. This is what I expert when I order a Mary Kay product</li>
