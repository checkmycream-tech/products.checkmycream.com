      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the hold and feel of this hairspray.</li>
      <li>I am now using two Beauty Without Cruelty Hair Products and am looking forward to experimenting with more of their hair care items.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to fragrances, dyes, and many chemicals in beauty products.  </li>
      <li>It sprays more of a stream than a mist.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this hair spray, I&#x27;ve used it for years.  </li>
      <li>The product is OK but be prepared to utilize another spray bottle.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and so I found myself using more of this hair spray which makes my hair look a bit oily</li>
      <li>but more of a stream.  </li>
      <li>Very mild if any fragrance.</li>
      <li>If you ruff up your style by accident it can be easily refreshed with a bit of water (meaning the hairspray doesn&#x27;t flake off over time).  </li>
      <li>It has a strong hold without being sticky at all.  </li>
      <li>Please BWC, use another bottle with fine mist spray capability.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>The hairspray is fine, but the staying mechanism is not.</li>
      <li>&amp; this is important to me</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also vegan/cruelty free.</li>
      <li>I chose to buy this because it is cruelty free</li>
      <li>It also brushes out easily and keeps my hair looking clean after brushing.</li>
      <li>And yes, the nozzle is clean.</li>
      <li>The hairspray is OK but they really need to improve their spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>I got this because it got a good rating on EWG Skin Deep.</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much from it, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>so it takes some getting used to if you prefer a finer mist, but I think the trade off is worth it.</li>
      <li>It does smell like alcohol at first, but it goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>A good option if you&#x27;re looking for a less toxic hairspray.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use very much to get a sleek look.</li>
      <li>Natural hold and cruelty free.</li>
      <li>but I feel as if I put more of this on than my last hair spray</li>
      <li>There is no left over residue, combs out pretty easily</li>
      <li>Even my two-year old&#x27;s short, baby fine hair stays in a braid all day when I use it on her for special occasions.</li>
      <li>probably because I have such fine hair, so also this product doesn&#x27;t have much holding power.</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable considering you are getting a non-toxic hairspray.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need to use that much.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Beauty Without Cruelty Hair Spray because it has an excellent rating through the EWG Skincare guide for cosmetic products that are \\&quot;safe\\&quot; and don&#x27;t contain dangerous chemicals.</li>
      <li>I love that it is not tested on animals and that this hold is very nice without being stiff and hard.</li>
      <li>Excellent, healthy, all natural, low score on EWG/Skin Deep for bad chemicals, works like a dream for me (light, brushable hold) and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using the Natural Hold Hair Spray, I tend to stay away from hair spray in general because my experience has been that they either</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this hairspray for anyone who is sensitive to perfumes.</li>
      <li>This hairspray does work to hold hair ( a little too strong for me)</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and don&#x27;t need anything that will make my hair stiff</li>
      <li>All natural, no funky smell and</li>
      <li>I was looking for something natural (as natural as hairspray can get anyhow)</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve kept my old tip for years and switched it between bottles).     </li>
      <li>In addition, I have found that using only a small amount goes a long way (a couple of sprays before leaving for work and my hair still looks good at the end of the day).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t deliver a fine mist, instead the bottle&#x27;s nozzle delivers product in one small area which defeats the purpose of this being called a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>With the current spray tip this hairspray isn&#x27;t nearly what it could be.</li>
      <li>These are all listed directly on the bottle and there are specific health concerns involved with Octyldimethyl PABA!</li>
      <li>it was a natural alternative to the standard \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; hairsprays.</li>
      <li>I liked how this product rated really well on the EWG site, but when I received this product I noticed it has several other unknown chemical ingredients listed  on the label that I am not happy about.  </li>

<li> other natural hairsprays out there,</li>
<li> This product has a long lasting hold.  </li>
<li> The hold didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s a minor complaint, is the smell when you first spray it on.</li>
<li> I have not tried this hairspray yet but I ordered it specifically because of the limited use of chemicals as listed on Amazon as well as the EWG.</li>
<li> It also has a weird &#x27;chemical&#x27; smell to it which I&#x27;m sure is not good for the lungs.  </li>
<li> You end up with parts of your hair soaked and other parts not sprayed at all.</li>
<li> Other than being sticky and smelly, it does work well.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get this if you have thick hair and actually want it to hold anything in place.</li>
<li> Also, it&#x27;s sticky and makes my hair slightly sticky.</li>
<li> I was hoping this hair spray would be a little bit stronger.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about the actual \\&quot;safety\\&quot; of this compared to other hairsprays.&lt;br</li>
<li> It DOES hold the style of your hair without making it feel horribly stiff.</li>
<li> that is not the only reason for this mediocre review.</li>
<li> After realizing the discrepancy, and seeing the other review like this, I tried to return it, but was informed that it cannot be returned if it&#x27;s 1-week after purchase which is not great customer service.  </li>
<li> leave your hair feeling so hard you wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to touch it (not that they could</li>
<li> However, I think I prefer sticky over the way my hair gets brittle and hard when I use mainstream hairsprays.</li>
<li> My sprayer was bad and had to dump the product into an old suave sprayer, but besides that the spray holds well</li>
<li> and this at least came close.</li>
<li> This product smells like rubbing alcohol, at least until it dries.</li>
<li> You get all kinds of wonky streams instead of a well directed mist.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t mind that as much as the spray bottle&#x27;s nozzle which is terrible.</li>
<li> Both websites failed to list all of the ingredients.</li>
<li> I am not impressed!</li>
<li> It stinks like alcohol, and has a sticky finish.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s been consistently bad for some time now</li>
<li> Cons: the sprayer nozzle is terrible.</li>
<li> so I will purchase this product again, but will recycle the BWC bottle (with the terrible nozzle) and will use another bottle for this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered the Beauty Without Cruelty Hair Spray because it has an excellent rating through the EWG Skincare guide for cosmetic products that are \\&quot;safe\\&quot; and don&#x27;t contain dangerous chemicals. I&#x27;m very happy with the hair spray. The hold is excellent, and it doesn&#x27;t feel at all sticky. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, and it&#x27;s a minor complaint, is the smell when you first spray it on. It dissipates rapidly, however, so I have no complaints whatsoever. It&#x27;s also not an aerosol. I&#x27;m very happy with the product, and I feel safe using it.</li>
    <li> I have many allergies and skin problems and this hairspray is wonderful and doesn&#x27;t give me any problems.  My sprayer was bad and had to dump the product into an old suave sprayer, but besides that the spray holds well and you don&#x27;t need to use that much.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray, I&#x27;ve used it for years.  All natural, no funky smell and it works great.</li>
    <li> I like this hairspray. It holds well and is not tested on animals. I was looking for something natural (as natural as hairspray can get anyhow) and this at least came close.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I have found, that holds very well. I don&#x27;t have to use very much to get a sleek look. Great for flyaways. It&#x27;s also vegan/cruelty free. This is the hairspray you want to buy if you don&#x27;t want a volumizing hairspray. It is also unscented.</li>
    <li> Excellent, healthy, all natural, low score on EWG/Skin Deep for bad chemicals, works like a dream for me (light, brushable hold) and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it does a very nice job of keeping my fine flyaway hair under control.</li>
    <li> Good hold for a spritz hairspray.</li>
    <li> This hairspray does work to hold hair ( a little too strong for me) There is no left over residue, combs out pretty easily</li>
    <li> I have looked at (and tried) other natural hairsprays out there, and this is the one I finally settled on. I chose it based on the rating on Enviromental Working Group&#x27;s website. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much from it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It holds well, and isn&#x27;t sticky. Doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on my hair, either. The price is reasonable considering you are getting a non-toxic hairspray.</li>
    <li> Natural hold and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Great product that does what I need to hold my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the feel of the hairspray, I found it to be sticky.  The hold didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Pros: This product has a long lasting hold.  If you ruff up your style by accident it can be easily refreshed with a bit of water (meaning the hairspray doesn&#x27;t flake off over time).  It has a strong hold without being sticky at all.  This is a wonderful product and extra great that it&#x27;s cruelty free!  Cons: the sprayer nozzle is terrible. You get all kinds of wonky streams instead of a well directed mist. They had good spray tips many years ago but it&#x27;s been consistently bad for some time now (I&#x27;ve kept my old tip for years and switched it between bottles).     With the current spray tip this hairspray isn&#x27;t nearly what it could be.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the Natural Hold Hair Spray, I tend to stay away from hair spray in general because my experience has been that they either 1. leave your hair feeling so hard you wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to touch it (not that they could even if they wanted to) and/or 2. if you can run your fingers thru your hair after using it, the product basically hasn&#x27;t done anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product somehow defies both of my complaints. It DOES hold the style of your hair without making it feel horribly stiff. In addition, I have found that using only a small amount goes a long way (a couple of sprays before leaving for work and my hair still looks good at the end of the day). I am now using two Beauty Without Cruelty Hair Products and am looking forward to experimenting with more of their hair care items.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray I use, now.  BWC makes wonderful products with a compassionate heart!</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray I use. Great hold and fragrance free. I would highly recommend this hairspray for anyone who is sensitive to perfumes.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this hair spray several years ago and have continued to stay with it.  I am allergic to fragrances, dyes, and many chemicals in beauty products.  Beauty Without Cruelty Hair Spray has no pronounced fragrance, is easily brushed out -- but has a solid hold as it is a spray not an aerosol type.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this hair spray would be a little bit stronger.  I have fine hair and don&#x27;t need anything that will make my hair stiff but I feel as if I put more of this on than my last hair spray and it still does not hold as well.  Don&#x27;t get this if you have thick hair and actually want it to hold anything in place.</li>
    <li> The hairspray is fine, but the staying mechanism is not. It sprays more of a stream than a mist. And yes, the nozzle is clean. You end up with parts of your hair soaked and other parts not sprayed at all.</li>
    <li> The hairspray is OK but they really need to improve their spray bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t come out in a mist but more of a stream.  It basically soaks my hair!  The product is OK but be prepared to utilize another spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I have not tried this hairspray yet but I ordered it specifically because of the limited use of chemicals as listed on Amazon as well as the EWG. Both websites failed to list all of the ingredients. Amazon does not list that it also contains: Octyldimethyl PABA, aminomethylpropanol, and Cysteine. These are all listed directly on the bottle and there are specific health concerns involved with Octyldimethyl PABA! I would not have purchased this product if I would have known this.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was a natural alternative to the standard \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; hairsprays. It stinks like alcohol, and has a sticky finish. I am not impressed!</li>
    <li> I liked how this product rated really well on the EWG site, but when I received this product I noticed it has several other unknown chemical ingredients listed  on the label that I am not happy about.  It also has a weird &#x27;chemical&#x27; smell to it which I&#x27;m sure is not good for the lungs.  After realizing the discrepancy, and seeing the other review like this, I tried to return it, but was informed that it cannot be returned if it&#x27;s 1-week after purchase which is not great customer service.  If someone isn&#x27;t happy with a product they should be able to return it.  I won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I got this because it got a good rating on EWG Skin Deep. However, some of the ingredients listed on the bottle are definitely chemicals, which weren&#x27;t listed anywhere else. I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about the actual \\&quot;safety\\&quot; of this compared to other hairsprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that is not the only reason for this mediocre review. This product smells like rubbing alcohol, at least until it dries. Also, it&#x27;s sticky and makes my hair slightly sticky. However, I think I prefer sticky over the way my hair gets brittle and hard when I use mainstream hairsprays. Other than being sticky and smelly, it does work well. Even my two-year old&#x27;s short, baby fine hair stays in a braid all day when I use it on her for special occasions.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s a pump so it takes some getting used to if you prefer a finer mist, but I think the trade off is worth it. Very mild if any fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I love that it is not tested on animals and that this hold is very nice without being stiff and hard.Have used it now for about 4 years.</li>
    <li> I love the hold and feel of this hairspray. It does smell like alcohol at first, but it goes away quickly. It also brushes out easily and keeps my hair looking clean after brushing.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and so I found myself using more of this hair spray which makes my hair look a bit oily probably because I have such fine hair, so also this product doesn&#x27;t have much holding power. I don&#x27;t mind that as much as the spray bottle&#x27;s nozzle which is terrible. The nozzle delivers a stream of the product. It doesn&#x27;t deliver a fine mist, instead the bottle&#x27;s nozzle delivers product in one small area which defeats the purpose of this being called a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34;. Please BWC, use another bottle with fine mist spray capability. I chose to buy this because it is cruelty free &amp; this is important to me so I will purchase this product again, but will recycle the BWC bottle (with the terrible nozzle) and will use another bottle for this product.</li>
    <li> A good option if you&#x27;re looking for a less toxic hairspray.</li>
    <li> Does what I want it to -holds hair in place with out feeling stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Non toxic - big selling point for me</li>
