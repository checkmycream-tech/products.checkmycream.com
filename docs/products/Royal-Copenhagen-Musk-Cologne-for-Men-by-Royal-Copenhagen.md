      <li>I like the Original scent, but the Musk is the best.</li>
      <li>Very refreshing smell and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>,I love Royal Copenhagen, I just didn&#x27;t realize this was the musk version, which I frankly don&#x27;t like the smell of!</li>
      <li>Smells nice and competitively price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for day or evening, just the right scent that earns me compliments often.</li>
      <li>My husband was so pleased.</li>
      <li>but in the drugstore there were so many musks and so many had a sweetness to them</li>
      <li>Wife loves the smell, what else matters? :)</li>
      <li>I love the fragrence of the RC Musk and so does my wife.</li>
      <li>This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrances.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to give it no stars but couldn&#x27;t because it states you must give 2 or more stars ....</li>
      <li>My wife loves when I use this spray so I do most days.</li>
      <li>Glad I purchased it again.</li>
      <li>I  have used for many years and hope it stays around for many more..</li>
      <li>Love this cologne for my husband.  </li>
      <li>Love Royal Copenhagen musk.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly and packaged safely.</li>
      <li>Now my hubby smells even better on those special dates with me.</li>
      <li>To my enjoyment, he liked it so much he wears it every day!</li>
      <li>Love the scent, but it wears off too quickly.  </li>
      <li>Not a musk smell just a cheap smell.</li>
      <li>My neighbor liked it so much we bought it for him too.</li>
      <li>Copenhagen musk is a great smelling cologne and one splash will last all</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loved the surprise and enjoys the clean, masculine and fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>It has a sweet, musky smell.</li>
      <li>I love it as much as h does.</li>
      <li>All you find at Macy&#x27;s is legacy cologne&#x27;s like Cool Water or Adidas Moves.</li>
      <li>I have read many reviews which complain that this product seems to evaporate too fast.</li>
      <li>Fresh clean aroma.</li>
      <li>Lacks the musky scent,  doesn&#x27;t smell like the original version of Copenhagen Musk more like just regular Royal Copenhagen cologne.</li>
      <li>Great product as usual.</li>
      <li>Price was reasonable through Amazon and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>The notes settle down some not being too mild and leaving a nice finish.</li>
      <li>Thanks Royal Copenhagen!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I found this cologne last year.</li>
      <li>Presentation wise the blue fluid was a richer shade than the aftershave (as expected).Nice sprayer as it was metal and not plastic.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a musk cologne that doesn&#x27;t over power but rather smells clean and masculine.</li>
      <li>Each spray gave me that scent that&#x27;s a cross of a barbershop with fine taste and an aquatic.</li>
      <li>; my husband and I both like it more than many contemporary scents that seem to all smell similar to each other.</li>
      <li>Good value for a hard to find fragrance.</li>
      <li>Very short-lived aroma.</li>
      <li>When someone asks &amp;#34;what you are wearing&amp;#34; then you have to know it is TOO MUCH on the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fragrance is very pleasing.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying this product, Amazon.</li>
      <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, R C Musk lingers just enough to let the interesting woman in your life know you have it on.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery time and properly sealed package; however, this product is not an original.  </li>
      <li>R C scent in Musk is a classic</li>
      <li>And the smell lasts for a decent time.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this mens colognen</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great and if the girls went crazy for me like in the Axe product commercials, I would buy it by the case.</li>
      <li>you really didn&#x27;t expect this to be so different.</li>
      <li>Purchased for an old friend who doesn&#x27;t want to change his cologne after 30 years.  </li>

<li> A little goes a long way and it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> To me Royal Copenhagen Musk smells like an effervescent(aldehydes) ocean of sharp florals,a tad of leather,and some talc powder.</li>
<li> I have worn this musk for years and every other week or so, someone will ask what is that cologne you are wearing, \\&quot;it smells terrific\\&quot;.</li>
<li> This Fragance seems watered down.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find musky colognes these days.</li>
<li> I feel like the dirty, musky, suave-man from the Dos Equis commercial.</li>
<li> Negative 1</li>
<li> We have been unable to find it for sometime.</li>
<li> Too bad this scent is discontinued.  </li>
<li> I felt bad after he opened it.</li>
<li> Dirty, Manly, Musky!</li>

    <li> I have read many reviews which complain that this product seems to evaporate too fast. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, R C Musk lingers just enough to let the interesting woman in your life know you have it on. When someone asks &amp;#34;what you are wearing&amp;#34; then you have to know it is TOO MUCH on the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The R C scent in Musk is a classic and I would not consider anything else. It&#x27;s a good deal too.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrence of the RC Musk and so does my wife. Price was reasonable through Amazon and shipped quickly. I will reorder when what I purchased is consumed.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and if the girls went crazy for me like in the Axe product commercials, I would buy it by the case. A little goes a long way and it lasts a long time.</li>

    <li> Copenhagen musk is a great smelling cologne and one splash will last all day.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is understated which I like..</li>
    <li> Cannot find this product anywhere.  Purchased for an old friend who doesn&#x27;t want to change his cologne after 30 years.  Still smells good.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells wonderful and the seller described the item to a tee. It arrived very quickly and packaged safely. Now my hubby smells even better on those special dates with me.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery time and properly sealed package; however, this product is not an original.  This product is water based and not the Musk product I used to buy.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne for my husband.  Thanks for carrying this product, Amazon.</li>
    <li> My wife loves when I use this spray so I do most days. Very refreshing smell and not overpowering. Fragrance is very pleasing.</li>

    <li> Excellent and exceptional service</li>
    <li> great aroma...I  have used for many years and hope it stays around for many more..It seems that some stores have stopped  stocking it</li>
    <li> This Fragance seems watered down.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it...nothing else needs to be said. She has always been a fan of Royal Copenhagen and decided it would be good for me.</li>
    <li> Great product as usual. Glad I purchased it again.</li>
    <li> It has a sweet, musky smell. And the smell lasts for a decent time. I will regularly buy this now.</li>
    <li> Love Royal Copenhagen musk. Great price.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this in stores and finding it on Amazon was great. It has a good price to go with it.</li>
    <li> ,I love Royal Copenhagen, I just didn&#x27;t realize this was the musk version, which I frankly don&#x27;t like the smell of!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and competitively price. Good value for a hard to find fragrance.</li>
    <li> Too bad this scent is discontinued.  It is the best scent on a man.  My neighbor liked it so much we bought it for him too.</li>
    <li> My dad has been wearing this fragrance for years. It is getting increasingly more difficult to find. So, thank you for carrying this product. My nephew has recently started wearing this fragrance as well so keep it on the shelves.</li>
    <li> Lacks the musky scent,  doesn&#x27;t smell like the original version of Copenhagen Musk more like just regular Royal Copenhagen cologne.</li>
    <li> Dirty, Manly, Musky! It&#x27;s hard to find musky colognes these days. All you find at Macy&#x27;s is legacy cologne&#x27;s like Cool Water or Adidas Moves. If they don&#x27;t have that, they&#x27;ll have Curve for Men (in which Men/Women or His/Hers colognes NEVER smell like they were designed with the intention for men only) But oh no, not Royal Copenhagen! I feel like the dirty, musky, suave-man from the Dos Equis commercial. Don&#x27;t like Dos Equis? Try Sean Connery from his James Bond films or perhaps Chuck Norris.</li>
    <li> We have been unable to find it for sometime. My daughter-in-law found it for me on line. My husband was so pleased. I love it as much as h does. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great &amp;#34;old standard&amp;#34;......happy to see it is still made. Will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Since about 2007 I&#x27;ve been using the Musk aftershave by Royal Copenhagen and I really like it.Finally buckled down and bought the cologne as the thought kept entering my head &#x27;I should have bought this years ago&#x27;.I used to see this cologne years back but in the drugstore there were so many musks and so many had a sweetness to them you really didn&#x27;t expect this to be so different.Presentation wise the blue fluid was a richer shade than the aftershave (as expected).Nice sprayer as it was metal and not plastic.To me Royal Copenhagen Musk smells like an effervescent(aldehydes) ocean of sharp florals,a tad of leather,and some talc powder.Each spray gave me that scent that&#x27;s a cross of a barbershop with fine taste and an aquatic.I&#x27;m not generally an aquatic fan but this stuff smells good with it&#x27;s vintage approach.Like a musk it does develop a powdery note but this isn&#x27;t overly powdery and bright...subtle.The notes settle down some not being too mild and leaving a nice finish.</li>
    <li> I have worn this musk for years and every other week or so, someone will ask what is that cologne you are wearing, \\&quot;it smells terrific\\&quot;. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a musk cologne that doesn&#x27;t over power but rather smells clean and masculine.</li>
    <li> Royal is one of the best fragrance for men. I got hooked on it some 30 years ago. Women find it attracting trust me.</li>
    <li> Just like I remember.  Good scent that I can&#x27;t seem to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> Not a musk smell just a cheap smell. I felt bad after he opened it. Don&#x27;t order it!! I wanted to give it no stars but couldn&#x27;t because it states you must give 2 or more stars .... Negative 1</li>
    <li> This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrances.  It has been around forever but doesn&#x27;t go out of fashion.  The women he works with all like it. Me too. LOL</li>
    <li> Fresh clean aroma. It&#x27;s the only cologne I use.</li>
    <li> I have bought a couple of presumes from this seller , the quality and delivery speed is great. I would recommend buying this item .</li>
    <li> Wife loves the smell, what else matters? :)</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband for Christmas.  This is perfect because I have allergies and this one smells so good and does not bother my sinuses.  Highly recommend this mens colognen</li>
