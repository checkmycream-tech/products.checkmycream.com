<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this to make cold process soap with. I normally buy from another supplier but thought I&#x27;d try this because of the price. There are a lot of bits in it. Bits of wood, sand, dirt and I did find one small bug.  Not a huge deal. Run it through a strainer, cheese cloth or coffee filter when you melt it. It will keep the bits getting into your product or on your skin. It unrefined, it&#x27;s to be expected. If you don&#x27;t want the bits, go with refined. Not sure if I would order again but it worked fine for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a bargain.  Love the multiple use.  Last a long time</li>
    <li> I loved it. It&#x27;s great in my home made soap.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea Butter. It&#x27;s great quality for the price and the fact that it is Amazon Prime is just icing on the cake!</li>
    <li> Loved it! It came in a bag and I broke it up in big chunks and put it in re-used plastic containers put it in the microwave to melt it a little bit to make it smooth. Then I let it cool in the fridge so it could get hard and gave it as gifts to my mom and sisters. They loved it. I will be buying again soon. Its great for your skin and hair. Put it on after you get out of the tub at night and when you wake up in the morning your skin will still feel moisturized. Great as a sun screen.</li>
    <li> With this I can make so many beautiful things with it! Arrived pretty quickly!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I use it to make home brew beauty creams. It comes in a large rather ugly chunk wrapped in saran wrap. I store it in a gallon ziplock bag, which can hold the entire chunk. While it looks rather raw and unattractive, I have found I can use it without filtering it. That is to say, I did not find any chunks or debris in it . . . simply warm and mix it in with other natural ingredients for a natural and wonderful skin product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the product and feel it is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Will surely be back for more!</li>
    <li> Only 4 stars because i didn&#x27;t like that i didn&#x27;t get tracking information. Everything else was great!</li>
    <li> This is a very good seller to buy your Shea Butter from. I&#x27;m use to buying mines from coastal Scent but a friend ask me to try this seller jus once and see if I can work with it. Well I made my different kind of scented Shea Butter and lip Balm and it turned out great so yes I will be buying again soon after this batch is gone.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, weight was accurate.</li>
    <li> The product is so creamy, I use it on my hair, skin.. I even use it on my grandbabies.. luv it. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Smelled horrid and was very waxy.</li>
    <li> It is fabulous!!! It came in a plastic bag but that&#x27;s what I was expecting.  I just put it into a container that I wanted.</li>
    <li> Featured seller, excellent merchandise, and deal a beautiful, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great Shea butter!  Melts wonderfully, no icky smell.  Packaging could be a bit better but for the price who cares?!  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim. I love making lotion bars and I must say .... This is really the Best Shea Butter :) Wow! My lotion bars turned out great! Very happy! My glow looks really good and I look about 10 years younger. After having a baby, I had to figure out what to do to heal my stretch marks. Shea Butter is the key and a good brand of it!!!! Very Happy With This Company!</li>
    <li> Awesome easy to work with</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this! I have been making all kinds of body butters. I was pleasently surprised to use this Shea Butter in my homemade deorderant.</li>
    <li> One word to describe this &amp;#34; Excellent&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> some of the best shea butter i have found and at a great price. works well in several homemade lotions and lip balms</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Worked up well.  Thank you for carrying this.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying shea butter so I have nothing to compare it to, but the quality appears to be great. I tested it right out the bag and it&#x27;s smooth and melts easily when rubbed into the skin. The scent is mild, can&#x27;t really place it...earthy maybe? It&#x27;s not unpleasant. The color is an off white/light grey. I&#x27;ve come across no pieces of dirt, shells, twigs, etc. as of yet. I even broke it into chunks and so far nada. I&#x27;m really happy I don&#x27;t have to filter it because I read that you can lose some of the beneficial properties through the heating and refining process. I can already tell my skin and cracked heels are going to love this stuff. Haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet (transitioning 4a) but I have some recipes lined up to try ASAP.     My only gripe is that it weighed about one oz under 3 lbs. Otherwise I would have given it a 5*. A tad worried that this is the standard for this company (I saw a couple reviews complaining of being shorted as well). Hopefully these instances are the exceptions and not the rule as that would be extremely discouraging. I don&#x27;t think I could support a company that would follow such a business model. On another note, I would be careful buying during the warmer months because they do ship it in plastic bags secured by a plastic tape band...not the most secure method with a product that changes viscosity according to temperature.</li>
    <li> I really loves this butter, It is great quality I was able to make all my body butters and have left overs just for me. It has a great shea smell with out being to strong. Tip to anyone melting it down and mixing it, Leave butter on heat once melted for 20 minutes no more gritty/grainy texture! I only gave this 4 stars for the simple reason it was not a solid form it was a bunch of tiny pieces and I would have preferred larger chunks. Great product!</li>
    <li> As described arrived as expected</li>
    <li> Good service, great pure product. I have used it on just about everything. Hair, underarms, elbows etc.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> GREAT BUTTER, LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I make my own body butter!</li>
    <li> The shea butter came in one giant hunk and appeared to have dark specs of something in it. The smell was so strong and unpleasant that I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it on my skin :-/</li>
    <li> As advertised no issues!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL BUTTER. I LOVE IT FOR MY GOING TO NATURAL HAIR. I ALSO USE IT ON MY BODY AND FEET. I LOVE IT !!!!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the price of this shea butter and good quality to.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter.  It is not white like shown here but it is a good product</li>
    <li> This was good stuff. I would definitely order it again. It lasted a long time, and is VERY soothing for skin!</li>
    <li> Will never stop purchasing. Does wonders for my hair and skin in the winter.</li>
    <li> The quality of this Shea butter is excellent - very smooth with no grainy feel.  I wish I could say that about the shipping.  I lost nearly half of it in the bottom of a greasy shipping box but have contacted the company to remedy this situation.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter. I have used it to make multiple lotions and bath bombs and it is really good stuff.  It arrived in a plastic bag stuck in a zippered plastic bag.  It has a nice smell.  It&#x27;s a plus that it was such a large quantity.  I will be ordering this again soon!!</li>
    <li> Great value and good quality</li>
    <li> I must say, I didn&#x27;t like the color.  It was an off white, almost had a greenish tent to it. When I added it to my leave in conditioner it turned it from white to grey because of it&#x27;s green tent.  It had grey spots.  Horrible smell.  I added some fragrance but that didn&#x27;t help too much. I whipped it with some oil but it was still grainy and after 24 hours of sitting became paste like.  Being my first time ordering Shea Butter, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  But I certainly expected \\&quot;Ivory Shea Butter\\&quot; to be ivory (white) as in the picture.  From other reviews, I believe this product was spoil upon arrival.</li>
    <li> ok I was hoping the color would be lighter. But its smells like shea butter so im happy. And I have noticed a mark I had on my face disappeared so I am even happier with it. It was here before time so that&#x27;s always a great thing with any customer.</li>
    <li> Sadly, I have to say this isn&#x27;t high quality Shea butter. It was dark, dark golden yellow with a orange-ish hue aong with greenish marbling throughout as if multiple batches were mixed together without checking the quality/grade. And yes, I know there are different shades of it depending on the nuts), and had a putrid overwhelming smell that doesn&#x27;t go away no matter how much essential oil or fragrance oil was used in the product I was making. It had a lot of visible dirt and debreis on the surface as well as sectioned cut, then melted, not just a little bit like would be expected. It also comes wrapped up in a bag, opening is twisted and taped closed. As it melted in transit (being delivered to Arizona during middle of summer), it leaked out of the poorly closed package onto other items in my order. Not cool!</li>
    <li> quick delivery.  good product.</li>
    <li> It was molded.This was my first time to order I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Gosh this butter really reeks of smoke! I&#x27;ve had others that he&#x27;s, do have a smokey smell, but not like this! I really need to use a lot of essential oils to mask the smell :(</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in the packaging i will think twice about even using the product. Looks very dirty and its consistency was creamy I didn&#x27;t expect that at all since I ordered raw Shea Butter.  I thought it would be like the Shea I&#x27;ve brought in the  past. I just expected it to been in chunks that way I can mix the Shea with  other oils.  Plus it just seemed unclean.</li>
    <li> This is raw and unrefined, yes. 100% it did have a tad burnt olive smell to it. Which doesnt allow it to take on the smell of and essential oil, unfortunately. Overall it goes on smooth. Very little bits, which doesnt bother me, not a girly girl.</li>
    <li> I have orderd this before and its always bin like a hunk. This order is so soft like i already mixed it up into body butter. It smells fine. N the color is the same. Not sure whats up with that</li>
    <li> This is clearly raw product and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I love it and will be a customer for life. Product arrived on time and my skin looks great from using it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with what I got.  Product was clean and smelt as expected.  Product whipped well for a body butter.</li>
    <li> fantastic ingredient for homemade lotions, shave cream, etc. will continue to buy from this source.</li>
    <li> Excited to use this with my EO&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I brought my last Shea butter from this seller and this shipment was just as good.  I had some family that liked the hair pomade I made with it last time, so I thought I&#x27;d buy more.  Forgot how much it makes, so now I&#x27;m stuck with way too much.  LOL.  Next time I&#x27;ll just buy 1 or 2 pounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Shea Butter!!</li>
    <li> A good product,  came on time and worked great!</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of Shea butter. One bag was OK almost off white but more yellow the other green it looks old and moldy. The pour pattern is different colors of greenish like the top had mold. Not impressed. Update: my products I made with the moldy looking bunch grew actual mold so not good. I can use it for my horses hooves so it doesn&#x27;t go to total waste. Won&#x27;t buy from this vendor again. I doubt how this is processed in Africa is monitored bush people collect and process it up to a degree or totally I imagen. Most probably live without clean envirement or clean water even unfortunately for them. I don&#x27;t blame them. The vendor should of never sent a compromised product out like that. I read one review the green meant green nuts so I thot maybe that not mold. Now I know....Almonds are always the same color as are Brazil or pecans on and on. Why would shea nuts be ivory or green. Its not green green its grey green and now I know its definatly mold. So if you get off color product send it back right away!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have never ordered unrefined Shea butter before and  so I was going according to the reviews. After receiving it I noticed it had a very strong diesel smell to it,not a cocoa smell but diesel,  so I tried masking the odor with a mixture of coconut oil and some lavender essential oil, but didn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed :( I don&#x27;t know if maybe I just didn&#x27;t do something right. Lesson learned. I&#x27;m guessing buying refined would be better.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shea butter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of Shea butter and use it for hair and skin. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the Shea to be packaged in a bag, usually it&#x27;s in a tub or in a block. It was more like big chunks sealed in a bag.  It melts and feels like shea butter I&#x27;ve used before. It&#x27;s an off white color so looks normal. I have to agree with some reviewers on the smell. The smell of the Shea is a bit stronger than I would like. Reminds me of olive oil or butter that has been around for a while. Not bad but just maybe sitting for while. I think the quality of the Shea is not what I usually get. Will use it a little longer to see how I like it.</li>
    <li> Shea butter arrived quickly. I expected the color to be ivory but it was a greenish grey and the smell was awful. I&#x27;ve never smelled shea butter, so I thought that it was expected, especially since it was raw and unrefined. I went ahead and made a body butter with essential oils but the smell of shea way overpowered it.I gave the rest of the shea away since the scent was so powerful that it made me sick to my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased raw, unrefined shea from a reputible source and the color is ivory and the scent is strong but nothing compared to what I purched from SmellGood.&lt;br /&gt;I would advise to NOT purchase this item.</li>
    <li> This item exactly what I thought it would be. It feel soft and very natural unlike another one I used before.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife....she L O V E S  it !!!! Hubby done good!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for me to buy in bulk. I use this product a lot in body butters, lotions, lip balms, deodorants, etc. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This Raw Shea Butter was some of the best I have bought.  Even though it is unrefined, it does not have a dirty appearance and did not feel like I had to melt and strain as in previous ones I bought.  Maybe it is the Ivory part.  Would highly recommend to soap making hobbies and or body butter/lotion hobbies</li>
    <li> The best Shea Butter I&#x27;ve ever ordered. Soft and smelled exactly how its supposed to. - A light nutty and earthy smell. Smooth</li>
    <li> The butter did need to be strained as I saw other people had mentioned. It&#x27;s a semi-solid so it&#x27;s pretty easy to measure and scoop out. The only problem I have with it is the extremely strong odor that&#x27;s tough to mask with fragrances or oils. I understand that it&#x27;s raw, however, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so incredibly pungent. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because it arrived passed the date it was supposed to, the bag had torn open a bit and some of the oils had escaped, and the smell is overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This butter looks horrible some of it almost black.  Not pleased with the appearance of it at all. Looks nothing like they pictures. really made my homemade finished product look bad had to add some color to hide the nasty color of this butter. I will not be ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Shea Butter a few weeks ago, and I am just now getting here in Afghanistan. I must say, I was prepared to receive this product in the plastic bag. Another seller also ships theirs in plastic bags also. When I opened it, it was very hard and cold due to our freezing weather here. Once I let it sit out and become room temperature, it was very creamy and easy to manage. It really feels good on my skin, especially after I shave. I also notice in the mornings, I am still coated and moisturized all over. So far so good and mine came packaged well, smells good, and no discoloration.</li>
    <li> This shea butter was the best I&#x27;ve purchased. The shipping was super fast. The price was incredible for the amount you get. Will order more before the xmas season b/c I&#x27;m making homemade body products. Will purchase from this seller from now on.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is simply fabulous! This company sells their shea butter at an exceptional low price. I am so very happy and will reorder in the future when I get low. It comes in a bag tightly air sealed so all you need to do is transfer some into a jar. Super simple and so worth the savings!</li>
    <li> I love the shea butter I get from this vendor. It&#x27;s soft and creamy, has a nice ivory color and nice light shea smell. I&#x27;ve made a batch of body butter from this order already and its womderful!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m NOT a shea butter expert but I can tell this is good quality and it&#x27;s the only vendor I will be ordering my shea butter and cocoa butter from...especially since the prices are so great as well ! What can I say..I&#x27;m a fan!!&lt;br /&gt;YES it arrives in a plastic bag...I don&#x27;t mind as it keeps shipping costs down ..Plus I repack it into an air tight container.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many shea butters before. Though this states it is unrefined, it does not have the firmness of an unrefined chunk, even right out of the refrigerator. It is not ivory but more of a yellow color. I went ahead and used a pack for my soap process and though the product is fine and a bit softer than usual,, I do believe that it is cut with something.</li>
    <li> I purchased Ivory Raw Shea butter and it&#x27;s awesome. I purchased it to make whipped Shea butter with scent for skin. It makes up beautiful. Nice and Ivory colored. Would recommend. Great price also.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve bought shea and cocoa butters from this vendor and they have always been top quality. the shea has a smoky gray hue sometimes and is not odourless, but it is definitely unrefined and has great healing properties.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this butter. I&#x27;ve ordered twice and never been disappointed. True to weight and lasts a lonnnng time!</li>
    <li> (Jim&#x27;s wife) FROM OTHER REVIEWS, I EXPECTED DIRTY BUTTER, FULL OF BITS, THAT SMELLED DISGUSTING....NOPE...IT&#x27;S VERY GOOD!!  I just removed it from the &#x27;bag&#x27; that it came in, and put it in glass containers and put it in the FRIDGE.  There were no bits of twigs or shells,  whatsoever.  It was usable AS IS, which I have done.  As far as the smell goes...it has a faint olive aroma, which I didn&#x27;t mind at all.  There was no burnt smell like ojon oil has.  One reviewer compared the texture to play doh, and that&#x27;s very accurate.  It melts EASILY, when you rub your palms together....no need to microwave, unless you have arthritis.  I do add a drop of scented oil to it, cause who doesn&#x27;t want to smell good??  This shea butter has restored moisture to my alligator, dry legs...yess!!  I even use it on my face at night.  Oh yes, no more dried out heels for me.  So if you&#x27;re looking for a chemical free, unprocessed, straight up &#x27;good&#x27; value product, with words, or WORD in it that you can pronounce, give it a try...you have nothing to lose but dry skin!  On a final note...there are many simple recipes on the web, for making your own body butter....it&#x27;s a win, win all around.</li>
    <li> Item came in 2 days. No gray color, dirt, or twigs. Took it right out of the bag and put it in containers. Used on my hair before blow drying, which resulted in a smooth finish. Also used in my daily skin routine....loving it so far.</li>
    <li> Shea beauty, really big size and came in a sorta ziploc. I know original Shea butter when I see one and this is definitely it! I didn&#x27;t melt it all, rather I melt small portions which I intend to use at the moment. Clean and a great sealant.</li>
    <li> I bought 3lbs for $13! My friends said it felt more than 3lbs but I wont be sure. It was pretty heavy and the ups tracking said it was 3.2LBSThe shea was smooth and play-doh like; it made me want to play with it and mold it into something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the packaging is not ideal in my opinion. It came in a thick, clear plastic bag with a card on it in CAPS basically said &amp;#34;know how to use shea and strain it yourself&amp;#34;. This bag was in a &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; bag you get from a Chinese food restaurant. and this was placed inside of a cardboard box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shea itself was in three or four large chunk pieces and then filled with smaller bits and crumbles :/ this made it difficult to scoop all the shea out and put it in containers. But I tried to get most of it our the bag then I put it in containers and popped it in the microwave to soften it more to stir it.&lt;br /&gt;Now the bag had tons of shea butter stuck to the bag :/ what a waste! but I decided to shower then turn the bag inside-out and rub the bag on my body (lol). and was able to fully condition and moisturize my self from head to toe with just the bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shea itself seems to be pure shea butter. My boyfriend and brother said it smelled kind of like peanut butter. I think it has a nutty smell with a slightly smoky scent to it which is great because it should (shea nuts are roasted). It is very soft and pliable and the ivory shea is a creamy color kind of like ivory and cream colors combined. My shea butter pretty much looks like the one in the image but a little more cream-colored&lt;br /&gt;I found that I didn&#x27;t have to strain the shea butter because it looks like it was free of debris.&lt;br /&gt;Once I melted it I mixed organic coconut oil and almond oil in it because I use this on my body (especially stretched marked areas) and on my hair (great for retaining moisture)&lt;br /&gt;I used yellow shea butter my roommate got from the same seller on my braid out with flexi-rodded ends and my hair was sosmooth, moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with this shea butter because oiling my hair did not feel efficient for me and the shea I feel like it really retains the moisture. I have dry skin (despite the fact I am a teen) and I put this all over my face after showering, right before bed and my face feels so soft and supple. My skin has been dry and I know shea will nurse it back to being supple.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shea butter! It&#x27;s a great price for the amount you get and the only cons are the packaging issues which really aren&#x27;t that big of a deal. And the shipping time it took is also a con (nearly 2weeks from ATL to SoCal area outside of LA its only a 4 day drive people). I plan to whip this shea butter with my Taliah Waajid hair and body oil and turmeric powder (to lighten stretch marks)</li>
    <li> Came a day before expected, in a clear plastic bag that was heat sealed on both sides. Great texture and ivory color, smelled just like pure shea butter that I&#x27;ve gotten in the past. The only problem was that when I weighed it it was a bit under the 3lb but overall good price and product. I would order again.</li>
    <li> My niece uses all kinds of raw butters in her potions of homeade creams for skin issues- just amazing she is !</li>
    <li> I just received my shea butter. I&#x27;ve ordered from other sellers before. This by far is the most creamy. It also smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I just received my butter. This seems way too soft. It&#x27;s whipped with something added. I&#x27;ll know for sure If i break out.. Organic uncut raw ivory shea butter doesn&#x27;t break me out. I&#x27;ll update it if my opinion changes.  5/3 Update. A Week later and I must update from 2 stars to 5. This is the real deal. I&#x27;m guessing they melted it before they put it in the jar which explains why it was so whipped. It settled and i can see and feel how organic and unrefined it is. If it had another additive my face would break out. It hasn&#x27;t. Even the yellow African butter breaks out my face. My face is still clear &amp; its clearing my eczema wonderfully. I will definitely order from them again. My apologies for the original 2 star rating! Much love!</li>
    <li> Great price for Great product.  I use this in soap making, body butters, balms and such.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started making my own deodorant, lotion, and diaper cream. The little tub of shea butter offered at my local health store seemed really expensive (and it was so little!) So I found this and was really pleased. The shea butter comes raw and unprocessed, but I watched a video provided by the seller on how to process it. It was really easy! I just heated it until it melted (really slowly, on low heat) and then strained it in a fine mesh strainer. Then I poured it in a container and let it cool. Now, it&#x27;s ready to go! It really pays to &amp;#34;process&amp;#34; it yourself.</li>
    <li> Love it, will order more as soon as I can. I was able to make special creams with it, ie. Anti itch, using herbs. Added essential oil for scent.</li>
    <li> I got it and works great</li>
    <li> Always love this product, I have purchased this product several times. It very great on my skin, and in my homemade products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I would recommend  Ivory raw refined Shea butter to anyone looking for a great value.</li>
    <li> It was smooth but had a very strong rancid ordor. Essential oils were not able to mask the scent. Out of frustration I ended up throwing out the remainder of the product</li>
    <li> i read the reviews beofore i placed my order. but this shea butter was really less expensive than others. Though some mentioned that there was debris in it, actually i did not see much. I just opened it to make my CP soap. And it smelled like the pricey butter I bought from other websites selling oils. So i think it is pretty good. I just do not like the package as some have mentioned. If they used a jar or something to pack it not a plastic bag, it would be better.</li>
    <li> I ordered shea butter back before the holiday&#x27;s and it&#x27;s really gritty when making eczema cream because I don&#x27;t melt it (takes away some of the benefits of the shea butter when I do that for the eczema cream).  I ordered this and it&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> This particular batch from this particular seller was the dirtiest shea butter I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a seller. Although, I&#x27;m sure more experienced unrefined shea butter buyers would expect this. It was the only the third time I&#x27;ve bought unrefined shea, but the first two batches I bought from other sellers was pretty clean. Be prepared to strain it. Packaging is a sack, to which a lot of the butter smears onto and clings, making it a little hard to work with but I&#x27;m sure there are those of you who have dealt with this more than me who have figured out a way to extract it without making a mess.</li>
    <li> glad there was an insert for instructions where to go to find out how to use the product.  I wouldn&#x27;t have known how to use it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a Thursday and received it the following Monday. Came in a plastic bag, which was fine because I just transferred to a couple of plastic containers and put it in the fridge. Has a sort of nutty aroma to it, which I happen to like.</li>
    <li> Used it in the home made body lotion, did not have any bad smell, which some other people pointed out,  and it worked great! Will order again</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t pure shea butter; I have a great deal of experience with African Shea butter to know the difference. I will not purchase this again and I do not recommend it to anyone for body products since there is no way of knowing what it has been blended with.  Doctoral Candidate, P Roulier</li>
    <li> Very happy. It showed up on a hot day so I let it cool for awhile the poured, scooped it all into a disposable reusable container and voila !!! I use it on me, the dogs, feet, cuts, hands, everywhere. I love it.</li>
    <li> Definitely a large chunk, I read up that it was best for stretch marks but I had to stop using it because it seemed whenever I used it on my stomache it made me sick.</li>
    <li> I got it, the weight is on point and it is raw shea butter, definitely value for money, I have bought Shea Butter before from other sellers that came in plastic containers but this came in a plastic bag which I believe is a way for us to save money on the final price of the product . I WILL buy again from this supplier. Thanks</li>
    <li> CONS: This product is more gray than white. Definitely not as white as this picturemakes it look. There were actually still a few pieces of bark or shell or something in it.  The scent is stronger than I like. I used it to make a whipped face cream (along with coconut and grapeseed oils), and it took over an hour of adding different essential just to mask the scent. That&#x27;s probably more indicative of Shea Butter in general than it is of this particular brand.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and will leave your skin feeling supple. You can&#x27;t really beat the price, considering how much you get.</li>
    <li> I was using this with EOs and it overpowers the smell of the oils. If you want a shea smell, it would be fine, but it&#x27;s not good for mixing with EOs for scent.</li>
    <li> Beautiful soft Shea butter. Will purchase again. No issues</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived promptly. The shea butter looks like the photo and sealed in plastic. Found instructions how to prepare it. on YouTube. Concerned about the heating method, because it may destroy some of the vitamins, so I used the cold method and used a hand mixer to whip air into the butter so it was soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found a couple different glass containers at Ikea that have very good seals for a very reasonable cost. Put a six month to a year expiration on it, but will have to wait and see how long it will last in cool, dry, dark, storage. Seen the benefit the first time using the shea butter. Good seller, would purchase from again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I thought this would be as soft as my last shea butter batch I had and I was really hesitant to use it because it was so hard but I just mixed mine with an oil and mixed it with an electric mixer to soften it up and it&#x27;s awesome! Truly natural!</li>
    <li> I make my own body creams and skin creams and this stuff rocks.  It is most blendable when left out to get to room temperature but will then blend easily with coconut and other oils as well as essential oil scents.  I like this as the color is more an ivory than some of the yellows I see around.</li>
    <li> Just got my ivory shae butter today. Fast shipment and looks good in the bag. There is no overpowering or unusual smells, just a mild earthy smell. I have thoroughly inspected the bag all around (came double bagged) before pulling it out. Has a very uniform light ivory color all the way around with an exception of about a 3-5 inch section at the bottom that is a slightly darker greyish hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably just dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be processing this (heating and filtering) prior to use as an ingredient in a beeswax &#x27;fixn&#x27; wax that I make. I will update this review after I process so I can review the final product free of dirt and fully refined and filtered. If the slightly darker area turns out to be something other then dirt I will report back as well.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is very light in color (Ivory, but not white). It came in chunks in a plastic bag. I didn&#x27;t weigh it because I don&#x27;t have any instruments to do that, but It was more than enough for me and my sister to split and last the better part of a year. It can be used as is, mixed with other oils and fragrances, or refined. The invoice lists a website you can visit where a video shows you how to refine it. I chose not to and just went ahead and mixed it with oils and fragrance oil. It is wonderful and I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took all other reviews into consideration before purchasing this item, but I had not issues with it what-so-ever.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the 2nd and just received it today! Great timing and the shea butter is nice and soft but clearly unrefined. It came in a sealed plastic bag and I just made about 32 ounces of whipped shea butter with it for my natural hair and still have much much more left. I will definitely be reordering from here again.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is wonderful. I use it on my hair and skin. I make a whipped Shea butter. I use only 8oz at a time whip it with a mixer using aloe vera gel and olive oil. To make a great scent since Shea butter has a unique scent I add ylang ylang and jasmine essential oils.  I store the raw un-whipped butter into the freezer. My last purchase was Nov. 2013. I am about to buy it again since my whole house is using it don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
    <li> I have no problem with the product itself. You should definitely try Shea if you haven&#x27;t yet. But not giving it 4 stars, because the vendor&#x27;s packaging was a disappointment. The shea is on a large plastic bag -- not containers. Just big clumps of Shea in a large plastic bag.</li>
    <li> This is a HUGE block of the raw shea butter.  It took a little time to get used to, but it&#x27;s working pretty good for me.  I use it in conjunction with the African black soap, so my skin is clear and healthy.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this ! Cheapest I&#x27;ve found for this amount . It is the same quality I&#x27;ve paid $16 for one lb from Village Shea that I loved , but needed a larger amount since I use so much.  Very buttery . Great body and face lotion will make your skin look 10 years younger</li>
    <li> Great quality and price!</li>
    <li> Shea butter - homemade whipped shea butter. This stuff is awesome for making my homemade lotions and creams. Love, love!</li>
    <li> I use the Shea Butter in my homemade lotion and lip balm receipes. Great quality. And it is storing and lasting in my pantry.</li>
    <li> I bought these after purchasing the 100% natural (yellow) shea butter. yes, this is from a different part of the tree. yes, this is not considered by purists to be &amp;#34;real shea.&amp;#34; I used them in lotion bars, and they were nicce because they were lighter in color- the white color looked nicer than the yellow of natural shea- and there was no overpowering smell of shea. i would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have ordered from other sellers ivory shea butter but stopped when I started receiving shea butter that is not ivory. Unfortunately,  the shea butter I purchased from this seller was not ivory but  grey.  I cut the part of the shea butter huge chunk ( it is shipped in a large chunk wrapped in plastic wrap and inside of a bag) to get a better look at the product.  The shea butter comes in a large chunk, which is actually a just smaller piece push together. I can almost say with 100% certainty that to bond and make it look like one cohesive piece, shea butter was whipped to as act  almost a bonding agent.  Only one small piece was actually Ivory, the rest was grey. I probably will not be ordering again from this seller again because the product is not what is advertised.</li>
    <li> This is my second shipment for this shea butter - same weight as well. I did consider getting the ten pound package because I would use it that quickly, but I was concerned after another commenter said she bought the smaller package and got a poorer product when she ordered the larger package the second time. This shea butter is beautiful - creamy, clean and rich. I give it less than five stars because this shipment came in just under three pounds - barely but still under and that was including the plastic packaging bag. I do a lot of bulk dividing and always try to ensure the buyer gets at least what he pays for. Cannot expect everyone to have my business standards but I can give my opinion. I will order from smellgood again and hope for a little better.</li>
    <li> Product was as wonderful as I expected and came quickly. I intend to use this to make custom butters and its a wonderful moisturizer. I love the way it smells and feels. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I just got mine in the mail, was super excited as this was my first time ordering from amazon.com. The shea butter came in a large plastic bag. The color was ivory and white...this I&#x27;ve never seen before. It had a marble type of look. So as I usually do, I melted it in a pot on the stove and put it into my containers and refrigerated it. The next morning when I went to use it, it was very oily. Almost like Vaseline. It had some dirt in it as we&#x27;ll. Not enough to get bent out of shape about. I also noticed the residue in the pot and the shea butter had separated from whatever oil was in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this shea butter is either extremely raw and unrefined to the point that you&#x27;d have to manually seep rate the shea butter from the oil, or it&#x27;s not pure and it has been cut with oil. It smells like shea butter an coconut butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the quantity, but I&#x27;m unsure about the quality.</li>
    <li> Lost a star because it just came in a plastic bag, wish it can in something better for storage. Otherwise its great for my homemade products</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as presented. Used it to loosen up my hard lotions. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I mixed the shea butter with oils to make eczema creams, conditioner and hair moisturizers. The texture is great when mixed. It did have some small lumps but I believe that occurred in my mixing process (I don&#x27;t melt it I simply use a blender to fix the texture). My hair is so happy with the pure shea.</li>
    <li> The shea I received was not white, off white, but GRAY! All I can say is cheap is not always the way to go.</li>
    <li> used for making balms and moisturizing creams!</li>
    <li> Great product. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for skin, hair, and deodorant making. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I  use this product from head to toe! It has never let me down and it has made my skin glow, and my hair soft and supple!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!! My skin is Soo soft! Mixed it up like butter with coconut oil and other oils and use it on my skin and hair!!</li>
    <li> This is real shea butter...honest dealings. I weighed it on a scale. It&#x27;s exactly 3 pounds. I appreciate it. It smells and melts like shea butter. Very good price. I recommend this sight. God bless you.</li>
    <li> Love it! This product was all I expected it to be. I have shared with my family and friends. I use it for everything!</li>
    <li> I make a considerable amount of home made soap to give to my friends and family.  This product was unrefined so I had to melt it down and strain it through cheese cloth.  There was hardly any foreign material left in the cheese cloth.  Makes excellent soap!</li>
    <li> arrived in 3 lumps. 2 lumps were perfect but the third lump was very dark with a strong scent of Tobacco. I returned the order.</li>
    <li> My order came in a sealed plastic bag. I opened and weighed it  and it was a little over 3lbs, (3.08lbs to be exact because of the plastic bag). It was important to me that it didn&#x27;t stink like the yellow kind in my local specialty store. This shea was very slightly scented. However I think essential oils will mask this light scent. I melted and strained it and found only 1 piece of a shell and 2-3 tiny pieces of twig. I did sample on my skin after melting and  I am very impressed with this shea butter! I do not anticipate any problems after I begin to use it in recipes. This product deserves 5+ stars. I definitely will order again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product!  It has met my expectations and I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Already made a second order . Heaven in a jar after clearly explained filtering instructions on website . The best I have ever used !</li>
    <li> good quality shea butter</li>
    <li> I adore my shea butter and so does everyone in my family. Now it doesn&#x27;t smell like sexy or even like fresh laundry (in other words in kinda stinks) but it won&#x27;t hurt or be too time consuming to add your favorite fragrance to it. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat 3 pounds of raw shea butter for $7 so I bought it and use it on my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> The shea butter was just what I needed to make many skin care items.  No particles of any sort. Shipped wrapped in plastic bag which I use to keep it in. I have plans to put it in a container.  It does not have to be refrigerated. Best of all was the price, it cannot be beaten. Try it.</li>
    <li> Just used to make a pommade and it was easy to work with and smelled very good.  The packaging is resealable and worked well.</li>
    <li> Very good.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the nice slight nutty smell, the color and the texture. I made some cream with essential oils and was surprised how white it turned out after whipping it. I&#x27;m very happy with this seller and will order again.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought Shea from amazon. The first batch from a different seller was fabulous. This batch... all I can say is icky. It stinks to high heaven and no amount of fragrance will help it. I finally, after 2 full bottles of fragrance got it to smell of something other than vomit. Now it smells like grapefruit vomit, but because there is so much fragrance oil in it, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on your skin. Ugh. Never again from this seller. Disgusting. Now I am out the money for this product, the time it took to make my body butter and 2 bottles of fragrance. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. There is better out there.</li>
    <li> The unrefined shea butter works great for me. At first I had to get used to the consistency of it.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this product except how it is packaged. The product comes in plastic bags with twisty ties. It leaked a small amount into the shipping box and was messy to remove from the bag. Its a very small inconvenience for the good price and quality. I would purchase tho product again.</li>
    <li> Very good for the money!</li>
    <li> Good product. First time buying shea butter. I heat melted it with beeswax and coconut oil to make hard lotion bars (plus essential oils). I did have to strain it as there was some debris that settled to the bottom after melting. Mine was much more yellow than ivory which is not a concern. Arrives in padded envelope inside heat sealed plastic bag. Many sized chunks, small and large. Interesting smell. Would recommend, but strain it if using it melted or in cosmetic products to remove any debris.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was a little nervous placing this order because of some of the previous reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. I am very happy with the product I received. This shea butter has a beautiful,  rich, creamy color and a very light, pleasant, nutty smell.  The last batch I ordered, which came  a different supplier on Amazon,  was almost brown and the smell was overpowering.  This batch is perfect, and so is the price. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Great item comes in big block easy to work with</li>
    <li> What a deal for 3 pounds of shea butter! With natural product&#x27;s you are bound to find bits and what not( but I didn&#x27;t find any), after gently melting it, you could pour it,thru a,strainer. It does have slight smell,nothing some Essential oils can&#x27;t fix. It does come in a bag but I like that ,it makes it easier to scoop out. I made whipped Shea butter without heating it. I also,added a little avocado oil and use it on my face, homemade stuff works better than any expensive bottled lotion.I would rather pay big bucks for things like pure rose oil that naturally fights wrinkles and add it to my whipped Shea butter.Love this Shea!</li>
    <li> Great for DIY skin care products</li>
    <li> good quaity, excellent price. Good service.</li>
    <li> Good quality and would purchase again</li>
    <li> The shea butter itself is what is advertised. However the weight is not! I received just about 2 and a half pounds, not 3!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for decades, and I am always impressed with the raw quality and versatile uses of shea butter.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  High quality and lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> love the coco butter makes a great body lotion</li>
    <li> Worst product I ever had.</li>
    <li> The unrefined version is not as void of smell as more sophisticated packaging. Works just as well, if not better. Bulk allows one to be more liberal with application.</li>
    <li> Great product. Didn&#x27;t know I would have to filter it but that wasn&#x27;t bad. Only took a few a minutes. Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Was a great buy and works very well in my handmade soap</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SHEA BUTTER&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I received my products and it exceeded my expectations.. I wanted to make sure I review</li>
    <li> I received my shea butter 2 days before promised and it was good quality with a subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;I made a batch of whipped shea butter with almond and neem oils because my son has really dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will definetly purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I received the product in a plastic bag, in good condition. Used the online preview to clean excess debris (there was very little ), and have been satisfied with the everything about the shea butter.</li>
    <li> Good butter just as described</li>
    <li> Love it! Great for making lotion</li>
    <li> I love this product, it was package very well and delivered on time. It was package well. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This replaced my yellow shea butter.  It is softer than the yellow and melts faster.  It comes in separate bags, vs one big lump, which I really like.  Smells nice, feels nice.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter I have purchased from this company is just a wonderful, creamy product that I use to make body butter.</li>
    <li> I use to buy the yellow Shea butter but I wanted to try something different.  I use it on my skin, I think melting some to use works better.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!  Mixed with lavendar oil and it feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> Swift shipment and great price</li>
    <li> good deal and works great in my soap</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own shea butter and coconut oil body butter and I love it.  I got the unrefined because it&#x27;s supposed to have more of the healing properties still in it.  It does have a smell to it but I don&#x27;t find it offensive, it&#x27;s a natural kind of nutty smell.  I put peppermint essential oil in the body butter so that is what I smell the most but even if you don&#x27;t use and essential oil i think the smell is fine.  I would recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought this product before but I thought the product was intoxicating!  I love the smell of Shea Butter.  Smelled the way that many describe it to smell...to my daughter.  But to me it smelled like vanilla bean.  She says it smells smokey which is the way it is supposed to smell.  Any way I love how it makes my hair feel and smell.  They delivered it really fast. It came before everything else I ordered from other places!</li>
    <li> Felt great! Very good shea butter will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Thanks for a wonderful item</li>
    <li> Thank you, great deal!</li>
    <li> Wow! Of ALL the shea butter we&#x27;ve purchased over the years, this particular batch is the absolute best! So soft just at room temperature.  This is the first time we&#x27;ve purchased from this seller, but will be reordering from every time from now on!</li>
    <li> Second time I purchased  this.  Reasonably priced.  I will buy again.  The purity is great.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter! I mix it with several other oils and gel to do my twist outs in my hair. The Shea butter at the beauty supply store isn&#x27;t authentic and is often dyed but this product is vastly different. It feels creamy and smooth and is also a great skin moisturizer. It isn&#x27;t too thick and it absorbs easily into my skin. This also comes in a nice size so it lasts for a while without having to repurchase.</li>
    <li> It works great for my homemade lotions and butters.</li>
    <li> I meltdown and mix this with unrefined coconut oil for a great body oil. It&#x27;s incredibly creamy and a really great value for such a good quality product!</li>
    <li> Came with a greenish hue and dirt engrained in it! I have to melt it then let it harden before making my hair products. Will not be purchasing from this seller again!</li>
    <li> works wonders in my lotion</li>
    <li> I have been making my own body cream with shea butter for over a year now and searched relentlessly for an unrefined product such as this.  It&#x27;s like it is fresh from the calabash.  I love the nutty, earthy scent and the wonders it does for my skin.  I am a newly minted Family Medicine Physician, and promote it heavily for my patients suffering from eczema.  Using a hand mixer to blend this with a little virgin olive oil, unrefined coconut oil, and a tablespoon of aloe vera gel goes a long way.  I am African American, but this works for all skin types.  Thank you for this.  I will definitely be purchasing from this seller again!</li>
    <li> It does not look like the picture. The picture shows it white. Mine is dark grey.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I suggest dividing the butter into multiple small packets and freezing them to prevent it from going rancid.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my package on SUPERBOWL SUNDAY that I forgot to weigh it to see if it was a full 3 lbs as ordered.  It was packed in a thin plastic bag, nothing fancy &amp; it would have been a mess in hot weather.  I purchase this along with cocoa butter, coconut oil, sweet almond oil &amp; some essential oils to make body butter.  I threw all the butters in a Kitchen Aid mixer bowl &amp; used the mixer bowl as a double boiler over a pot of boiling water to melt the butters together.  When melted, I put it in the fridge for a few hours until it was starting to solidify, then I put the mixing bowl on the mixer stand &amp; began whipping.  After several minutes, it become light &amp; fluffy like merengue!  I added lots of essential oils because the primary smell seemed to be cocoa butter, which isn&#x27;t bad, but not what I&#x27;m going for.  I scooped the white, fluffy body butter into a variety of containers with lids to save &amp; give as gifts; turned out great!</li>
    <li> Great for making lip balm. Price was great as well.</li>
    <li> I have been reading soap making ,book almost all says to add Shea butter to give moist to your skin it gives moist and makes skin soft so hope to use it soon in any soap that I make .once again thank you AMAZON</li>
    <li> Came quick and as expected</li>
    <li> I have been using raw shea butter for years and this product from Amazon is the real deal because I usually get it from Ghana from a relative and when we run out Amazon is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> Really good amount of shea butter for the price. It is lasting me a long time. Very good with moisturizing my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> This might be my ignorance but it was dirty, smelly and gritty.  Not suitable for any use. Leason learned. Make sure to check what grade it is...</li>
    <li> this is an awesome shea butter. Its very creamy and melts fast. I will be buying more.  I think next time the 10 lb size</li>
    <li> was a lot more gritty than the first order. didn&#x27;t mealt on the skin the same.</li>
    <li> I have always used raw unrefined shea butter as lotion, that is until receiving this batch. It is full of hard, tiny particles that don&#x27;t dissolve with the warmth of your hand. In 15 years of using raw shea butter I have never before had this issue and won&#x27;t be purchasing from this distributor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/6/2015: I decided against returning this product since we had already opened one of the three packages and another was leaking. Instead I took a tip from the comments that the shea butter should be warmed on the stove and strained. Unfortunately for me, I spent time doing that and it&#x27;s still full of hard, tiny particles. Leave this product to the experts and purchase one meant for consumers.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shea butter out there. Light in color and soft and smooth to use directly on the skin and exceptional in homemade lotions and body butter.</li>
    <li> High quality bulk shea butter, perfect for mixing with oils or making whipped shea butter body lotion. Much more fairly priced than others.</li>
    <li> One side of the block of shea butter was black-dirty. I scraped it off, but yuck! &amp; wasted.&lt;br /&gt;The rest was fine.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, I  would have recommended it.</li>
    <li> I had bought shea butter from am expensive shop before. My son has severe eczema and the shea had seemed to help tremendously so I decided to buy some in bulk. I had researched for weeks before picking this company. I knew from comments that it would be grainy and it was, I also knew it would be melted some since I love in the deep south and it was. But let me just say that this has been the best butter (grainy and all) for my son. I&#x27;ve made several oil mixtures with it and it blends so well. I love it. Definitely buying again and again. Thank you for such a great product</li>
    <li> Makes a nice batch of soap</li>
    <li> Probably the best batch of shea butter I have ever purchased. I am pleasantly surprised. It did come in a bag however. I&#x27;m not sure if that is convenient for everyone, but i happened to have an empty 32 oz. jar laying around so I stored 2 lbs. in there and the other pound is still in the bag. Great quality shea butter though. Super soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I received the shea butter in a locked plastic bag with another plastic bag covering it. The shea butter inside ranged from the usual off white color I am used to to a grey-ish murky color. I&#x27;ve bought shea butter from multiple sellers and have never seen the grey tone.  It&#x27;s important for the shea butter I use to be off white and not discolored. I make body/hair products for resale so the color of the transformed products needs to be as closely to white. I also found pieces of debris/nut shell in my butter. I fixed this by straining the melted product. However, I was annoyed by this. Because of issues of sterility,etc. I gave the product a three because of the creaminess, but much could be improved.</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; it&#x27;s million uses. Great price,great product &amp; fast delivery! I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This shea butter has no funky smell like the others and as always gave life to my dry skin and hair. Thank you to the Gahanians who sent this for my family. I hope all of u are well compensated!</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter. I was smooth &amp; very clean</li>
    <li> This shea butter is, indeed, pure. It&#x27;s really soft and easy to work with. I love the product, but my only complaint would be that I wish the packaging would be a little more convenient. It comes in plastic bags, which can be a bit messy to remove. I would have absolutely no complaits if it came packed in tubs.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I&#x27;ve bought it twice and have been very satisfied.  I process it myself and add essential oils to change the smell.  The original smell is not awful, but it&#x27;s not a pleasant body fragrance that you&#x27;d want to smell, or for others to smell on you all day.  Add the essential oil to make an excellent, and fragrant moisturizer.  It&#x27;s great for fading surgery scars and for healing the skin after wearing a cast.  Next time, I will purchase a larger quantity.  Family and friends love it.</li>
    <li> I received the 3lb raw ivory shea butter chunked in a bag, that came in a brown box. Ordered Feb.4th and received Feb.13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not WAIT to get it. So I bought one from whole foods, and it is not even nearly as comparable. What you will find at stores, like &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; food places, will most likely not be natural all organic unrefined raw,etc. I ordered because I have eczema all over my body and I do not want to use the hash steroid creams that are offered for this disease.  So far it has been a major help for my eczema.. my skin actually feels moisturized and although it does get warm to the touch when putting the shea butter on your skin (which can irritate eczema), it is important to just put it on and go stand by a fan or I just put an ice pack on the areas that are hot and within a couple of minutes the warmth goes away.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my skin is much better, breathable, and smooth! Also, I had a huge scar on my knee (from about 2yrs ago) and it lightened up significantly in a weeks time, as well as my stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend, and be patient with it to arrive. Its worth the time and money! Please forward to those of you who know people who suffer from eczema, it is a horrid disease.</li>
    <li> Waxy and too harsh smelling for good quality shea butter.</li>
    <li> AHA!  My treasure here! A true value for a fantastic product.  When this 3# glob of raw shea arrived I was overwhelmed, having only ordered neat little containers of shea in the past. However, using a long handled spoon I filled small plastic &amp;#34;to go&amp;#34; type lidded containers with this wonderful product and placed them all over the house, in the car, in my purse, at bedside, gave them out to friends and thankfully still have plenty left. It is so emollient, so smooth, unflavored, pure and effective that my husband also uses it on his lips and hands and heels. A tiny bit goes a long long way! Nightly I apply a tiny smidge of shea across my fingernails which have in the past always cracked and split and been so unsightly; rub it into cuticle area; am now growing long healthy nails due to shea&#x27;s moisturizing ability.&lt;br /&gt;Prefer this to any lip balm I have ever used. Will buy again - and certainly in this large chunk quantity.</li>
    <li> I had never tried the ivory shea butter so I purchased it. I love it. For me their is no difference between the yellow or the ivory shea butters. The difference is only the color. They both work the same. This purchase came in a timely manner and I just love it and can&#x27;t get enough. My entire family uses it. I mix the shea butter with essential oils and viola I have body butter and hair cream.</li>
    <li> I have purchased raw, unrefined, grade A shea butter from numerous sellers over the years, and this one is perfect. It has the correct smell, texture, and most of all it is clean - meaning without pick-up particles/dust/hair that some sellers send from an unsanitary environment - never again with those seller. This is absolutely safe to use on face, body and hair, not to mention to put in homemade goats milk soap. Unrefined is the best, as it keeps its nutrients and benefits for the body.</li>
    <li> Great product hate the packaging</li>
    <li> This Shea butter looks great, smells great, and feels great. It came in a plastic bag, but I&#x27;d rather pay less for the Shea butter to come in a plastic bag than to pay more for it to come in fancy packaging. Plus it&#x27;s easy to store as I just squeeze the air out and twist the top of the bag.</li>
    <li> It made a ok butter for my products but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase or recommend comes in a bag an its unrefined bit grainy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. It is not as white as the picture, but it&#x27;s a natural product, and that is going vary. It&#x27;s clean, but it does come in a plastic bag, which is a bit messy, but look at the price! Great product, I will buy more for sure.</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering Shea Butter. I love it!! I let my fianc&amp;eacute; try it and I was surprised because he loves it. I will be placing another order soon. I received it on time. This was a good experience so I will continue ordering online. I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s cut with something, but I&#x27;m not sure what.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as white as it is pictured.  It is a grey color.</li>
    <li> I love this and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a bag and in a bunch of chucks just as expected.  Shippment seemed a littled delayed but I also ordered right before christmas.  Will deffently be ordering this product again!&lt;br /&gt;Con: You will need to filter this yourself. (for the price though not really a con)</li>
    <li> Extremely happy. It is smoother the I expected. And mixed very well for my hair cream. Will definitely be repurchasing</li>
    <li> Good quality Shea Butter...and plenty of it!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is wonderful. Expensive creams and lotions list shea butter as an ingredient but they only add a tiny amount of shea butter. This is the real thing. It is ivory color and smells like play doh. I make my own face/body cream and so many people comment on my skin looking radiant. My friends have ask for it so much that I have actually started my own little business!! Shea butter whipped with grape seed oil, almond oil, coconut oil and a few of my secret ingredients have helped me  become a little entrepreneur. Why pay mega bucks for chemicals when nature has the right answer?</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME. I use it in a couple of DIY products and this is very good quality and does a great job. I also like that it came in three 1 lb. packets which is great because I don&#x27;t use that much at a time so less is getting air exposure. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Seems fine, We have used it for a few projects already.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter has been a staple for my daughters hair. I love this product, and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I use it to make a moisturizing mixture for my curly hair, as well as a lighter mixture for body cream.  It glides on silky smooth after being blended with other oils.  Yes!</li>
    <li> I use this in my CP soap.  It does have a little bit of an oder, but with EO&#x27;s in the soap you can&#x27;t tell.  I prefer using unrefined so as not to loose too many of the lovely properties that is in Shea butter.  This is a nice product.</li>
    <li> I thought I submitted my review already but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Anywhooooo.....This product it the BEST!!!!  Smooth, Creamy and all around moisturizing.  Works great on my skin and locs.  I also received the package earlier then expected.  A++++++  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using raw Shea butter and I am very pleased with my purchase. I absolutely LOVE it!!! It smells great to me. It has a warm, nutty aroma that&#x27;s light and not overbearing. I used it to make a homemade hair/body butter. It&#x27;s great. Not greasy at all; it absorbs nicely into the skin. I will definitely buy from the Smellgood company again.  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I ave excessively dry skin, psorisis on my feet, and dry afrcacan American hair, as does my daughter as we&#x27;ll.  we live in as all town in Texas, and would have to drive to Austin or San Antonio to go to an African market.  I have tried the Shea butter at the health food store and it is processed and does not help us at all.  This Shea butter is unprocessed and all natural.  It works  extremely well.  Smell good the distributor is fast and provides a great product.  I would recommend boyhood the product and the seller highly.  Valencia Ford, M.Ed.</li>
    <li> I love this butter.  My daughter and I are natural and I order this to make a  whipped cream.  This works great on our hair.  This works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I will reorder</li>
    <li> I have now become a regular customer as I found theirs to be the best price for a great quality shea butter! Shipping is fast never had a problem!</li>
    <li> So clean! Love the bags it comes in! Just wonderful! Perfect for body butter !  Out of 6 lbs I have only found 4 bugs! ( anyone who uses raw Shea knows that is an amazing low number!</li>
    <li> Using to make lotion with - works great when added to coconut oil &amp; sweet almond oil.  Don&#x27;t love the smell, but with Shea butter, you either do or you don&#x27;t.  Not overpowering, and pretty clean.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Warning: I did find small pieces of shell in it. I had to melt it down and strain it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to get a full bad of shea butter. I love the texture, it is not greasy it more like waxy. Provides great moisture to my natural 4a hair, will order again!!!!</li>
    <li> Real good Shea butter. love It. great buy!</li>
    <li> Awesome for hair. body, and hands.. Great when used after coconut oil on Natural Hair.. We love it..</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin in the winter.  I epil my legs and have done so for many years.  I started developing small bumps on the front of my calves.  I rubbed this in vigorously every night for about two weeks.  Soft and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the winter, I go through 1 pound within 3-4 months.  I use *generously*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very thick.  It helps if you spray your skin with water, then smooth it over the skin.  Or you can get your hands wet, get the amount of shea butter that you need, then apply over the skin.  Using the water helps it go on much more smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also good for burns and insect bites.  I&#x27;m very pale, and I recently burned my arm badly.  I&#x27;ve been applying three times/day, very generously, and the burn is healing nicely.  I don&#x27;t think that there will be permanent scarring.</li>
    <li> Ordered over the weekend and received my package in Colorado the following Wednesday. Exactly as described; needs to be filtered before use. An excellent value, I will not hesitate to order in larger quantity next time.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and really good for dry skin. Protects skin from harsh sunrays in Afghanistan. Product was just as desribed.</li>
    <li> Use this in my soap products.  Like that the color is light and does not darken soaps that are intended to be lighter in color.</li>
    <li> It was 3 lbs as promised. However, it smelled quite like Patchouli which gives me a headache. It also had little wax like beads in it.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of shea butter, and I love this product. It has a characteristic shea-butter scent with beautiful texture. Very occasionally, I need to slowly heat it and strain -- even then, I find only a few stray plant fibers. If this seller has consistent quality, I will order again and again.</li>
    <li> Very nice shea butter. This Is my second order.  When I melt it down and then strain this and notice very little debris, just a few specks of what looks to be pieces nut shell each time I melt down about a cup of it.  I use it straight out of the bag most of the time to moisturize my lips, skin and hair.  I melt it down and strain when I want to make a body butter for family or friends.  It&#x27;s a pale, ivory color and very creamy.  Shiping was fast and it came in a plain, sealed plastic bag with a label advising that it is raw and may need filtered.</li>
    <li> Great product so far, I like tge natural smell of the shea butter snd it shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> Great product and delivered fast</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and the freshness is what grabs you but what it did for my grandson&#x27;s eczema speaks volumes. I mean his mother and I  were at our whitsend even the Dr &#x27;s prescribed remedy was useless but this did the trick not to mention it&#x27;s good for other uses to moisturize my  hands and face. I even use it when I&#x27;m out of lip balm. Will purchase again...</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome and it is very manageable. I use it to make products for my hair so I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Good hair moisturizer and body will continue to use it still have plenty left, will buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I found bright orange price stickers embedded in mine but other than that good</li>
    <li> TThe butter is gray and smells terrible.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for moisturizing my overly drying, Dabetic feet (and the rest of me too!) Good price too!</li>
    <li> Great product! Creamy and moisturizing in my body cream!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product.  Doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes like the yellow shea.  I have no complains on with this batch</li>
    <li> Had a problem with the post office and smellgood worked with me and got my product here! And I love the butter, its awesome! Fresh clean, creamy and such a good price:)</li>
    <li> I think I may have actually gotten cocoa butter instead of shea butter. Either will work for what I am using it for, but there is a strong smell of chocolate (which many would like, but I do not). It was however, clean and melted easy.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for! Great product and exceptionl shipping speed</li>
    <li> great product and awsome service</li>
    <li> Great quality butter. I use it to make other butters and salves. Only problem was it had melted sitting outside while I was at work so I had a solid block in the shape of the bag. But I fixed that by remelting and poring into little silicone molds. Now I have little pieces of shea butter that are easy to measure out for my projects.</li>
    <li> This shea butter was illustrious.  It was very soft and made a great body butter.  The color is more yellowish than ivory.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  Gave some out as gifts to my daughters and they loved it....they asked when would I be getting more.</li>
    <li> great product, great price</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter I have EVER purchased. I love the slightly smokey scent, and while it is a bit grainy, it melts smoothly and is wonderful at holding moisture in.</li>
    <li> My favorite shea butter purchase!  I usually purchase raw organic virgin shea butter, but thought I&#x27;d give this a try and I love it, It&#x27;s not bleached white, the smooth creamy texture feels lovely on the skin.  Packaging is very basic - a slab of shea butter in a plastic bag; but wonderful things come out of unimpressive packages.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews first so I ordered this and was extremely disappointed.  It has a bad odor, is grey and extremely dirty with twigs etc.  I did not expect this.  Will not order from this place again.</li>
    <li> It melted well and softens skin nicely but is grayish not ivory and is unpleasant smelling even with essential oils added.</li>
    <li> this product came in double bags which would be okay but the shea butter sticks to the bag, leaving a lot of product behind. I&#x27;ve used shea butter several times, usually from different suppliers and the particular one had a strange yellow grey color. it seemed to work out okay, but I don&#x27;t think I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Was a little slow getting here. But it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I received 3 \\&quot;tubs\\&quot; of shea butter, but they felt lighter than a pound each. I weighed them on an accurate digital scale, and all three tubs (including the plastic tubs) weighed only 2 lbs 1.75 ounces, while it should have been 3 lbs of shea butter PLUS a few ounces for the tubs. In summary, I received about 2/3rds of what I ordered. If you order this, please weigh your purchase to ensure you receive what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted the seller and hope they will make this right. If they do, I will modify this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update December 17, 2014: 30 days after my order and initial contact with the company, I received another tub of shea butter with a different return address. This additional tub brought my order total up to 3 lbs, which includes the weight of the plastic tubs. That is \\&quot;close enough\\&quot; for me, and we are thankful to finally feel comfortable opening a tub without fear of being asked to return it. I&#x27;m going to update from one star to reflect the correction of the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is fine. It smells like shea butter should, and is smoother than some shea butter I&#x27;ve ordered in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, the company is using a different supplier now that sends the right amount of shea butter. But, I still recommend double checking the weight of what you receive \\&quot;just in case!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Perfect for my natural recipes.</li>
    <li> I liked it and so did my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Best moisturizer ever and it is pure!  I mix it with some coconut oil and couple drops of essential oils and store it in smaller containers.</li>
    <li> A larger quantity than I imagined. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time and was as described.  I used it to make my own body butter and am very pleased with the results.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was hoping for and such a good price. I&#x27;ll be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> This stuff came quickly in plastic wrapping. I make wonderful lotions from it. Its everything I wanted from shea butter :)</li>
