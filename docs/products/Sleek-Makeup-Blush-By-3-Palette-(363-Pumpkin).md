    <li> Such beautiful colors</li>
    <li> I love this Product. Sturdy casing, and really pigmented color. I&#x27;m a NC 50 in Mac studio fix, and this works like a charm. A little goes a long way. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Great blush very pigmented!</li>
    <li> My skin color is a little dark, Hispanic, and I never thought about using this colors, but when I tried them I felt in love with them. Completely different look, younger and mothern</li>
    <li> the colors are gorgeous, but beware - it is VERY pigmented. Use with a light hand!</li>
    <li> I was in the market for blush that would complement my skintone and carry the color throughout the day. The Sleek pallets never disappoint. The pigments are great and vibrant! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I only bought this bc of the orange blush and its amazing. Its very pigmented. The other colors are also very pretty. I will def be purchasing another product from sleek cosmetics.</li>
    <li> The colors pop really well on dark skintone. This is a great blush for the summer time. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with Sleek Cosmetics thus far, great awesome color for Darker skin women and you needn&#x27;t but a hint on your brush!</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for these blushes. I looked at reviews on amazon and YT before purchasing.. They just did not do it for me. They are very pigmented, however they just kind of lay on top of the skin, even after blending. I tried to apply several times with a diffrent brush only for same results. Now granted I do wear a light layer of foundation so maybe that is the problem, but my nars and mac blushes do fine under the circumstance. I may revisit the blushes one day soon and give them another try.</li>
    <li> The Colors are way brighter and pigmented...the picture does not do justice... Absolutely love it !!</li>
    <li> The colors aren&#x27;t true to color and shipping took awhile. honestly not a fan of these blushes</li>
    <li> My oh my, a winnnnnner!  Sheer bold color that is buildable.  &amp;#34;You know you want it&amp;#34; and it will last a long time.  YOUTUBE&#x27;s Goss make-up artist suggested this blush as being one of the best.  He was right!  Enjoy</li>
    <li> bought it for the orange blush. Love it. havent tried the other two yet but Im sure theyll look good as well</li>
    <li> Nothing came broken which is a plus. I have only used the pink blush so far and i love it. so much product!!!</li>
    <li> beautiful on deep skin</li>
    <li> I am using my husband&#x27;s account. I absolutely love this blush palette. It is so pigmented you have to use a light hand. The price is incredible for the quality of the product! I use the pink color more because it is a lil more wearable with my light skin. I am going to order me another one on a different color. I highly recommend this blush!!</li>
    <li> Great palette, I&#x27;m very happy with this set. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This trio is perfect for me.  My color is between NW45 or NC50 and the all three colors looks amazing on me.  Even my husband (the one who only wants me to wear lip gloss LOL), complimented me on my blush.  I was so shocked I had to ask him to repeat what he said, jussttt to make sure...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I love the blush I wear out on the weekend and to work.  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m even thinking about trying another trio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this blush to all my fellow makeup lovers out there.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. my only problem is I was&lt;br /&gt;led to believe the blush on the right was Aruba. It&#x27;s not&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s no fault of the sellers. I still love it though.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it to anyone who&lt;br /&gt;wants Aruba it&#x27;s almost the same</li>
    <li> Love all the shades. They all look amazing on dark skin!&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that the pallete was broken and in pieces when it was delivered. Because this product came from over seas snd took a while to be delivered, there was no need to complain and send it back. So I&#x27;m just using the pallete as is.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this I&#x27;m an African American women but lighter skin and this club lush compliments the skin ladies of color please try it and think if your too light it&#x27;ll be to pigmented.</li>
    <li> Super pigmented shades that are warm an autumnal.  Great price.  High quality.  Lovely compact.  Smooth texture.  Not dusty. Use a skunk or stipple brush if you are fair skinned.</li>
