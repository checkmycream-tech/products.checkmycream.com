<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product and excellence service.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother.</li>
    <li> This Stink!!! Smells Horrible. .eww!!!</li>
    <li> It was as I remembered it.I liked it. I would recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I would order again ,when I run out</li>
    <li> The price was great and I received it quickly and undamaged.  I would definitely do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> When I bought this cologne, I was a little skeptical, as I hadn&#x27;t heard before of any cologne by its name- got it strictly based on its reviews.  However, when it arrived and my wife tried it on for the first time, I was swayed and swooned by its sweet aromatic fragrance!   Good buy!  Hint: smells good when sprayed on, lots better!</li>
    <li> I got this for a relative who has been using it for years. It is impossible to find locally, so I&#x27;m grateful Amazon had it in stock.  It has a great scent.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly what I wanted for the best price ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> Exelent product, fast deliver, and product is extra condition. One word: GREAT  Thanks AMAZON</li>
    <li> my mom&#x27;s favorite and the price/shipping was fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I found that AAA Perfumes Merchants have the best prices and the   best services, i placed my order and i got it the next day!,i could  not believe it. Plus they keep you informed all the time via e-mail  about your order. I had to write back to them  and say how happy i am with their services, i wish everybody would operate the same way.  Anyway , from now on i will use only them , it is just trouble free.  JOntue is not available in store , and if they have it, it is triple   price, i love perfumes and now i know how to get them.</li>
    <li> I have used and loved Jontue for over 40 years and am grateful that I can still get it.  I don&#x27;t understand what possessed Revlon to discontinue it!  However, I try to keep enough on hand to last for several years.  Thank you for making that possible.&lt;br /&gt;Priscilla Flynn</li>
    <li> A WONDERFUL, OLD-FASHIONED FRAGRANCE FROM DAYS WHEN WOMEN PROJECTED A SOFT, FEMININE SIDE</li>
    <li> I was glad to learn that this product is still around, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to smell as strong as I remember it.  Don&#x27;t know if this is old supply or whether it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I am truly thankful that I am able to still get this favored fragrance at a decent price.  It is too bad that some take advantage when an item is harder to find or discontinued.  Thank you for fairness and honesty.  Love this product!!</li>
    <li> This was one of my old favorites. I decided to try it again. It smells as good as I remember and I get lots of compliments. I was worried that it was going to be old but it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Good bargain and delivered way ahead of promised date.</li>
    <li> has a pleasant aroma and in a nice spray bottle. Not to strong or flowery. would recommend this cologne for women.</li>
    <li> I receive more compliments when wearing Jontue than I do when I wear Chanel.  I have worn Jontue for years and will continue to wear Jontue.</li>
    <li> Every bit as good (or better) than the same perfume purchased at local stores. My wife has used this product for many years, and is very familiar with it. She is very happy with her purchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used Jontue in years.  It was one of my favorites.  I&#x27;m glad to see that it is still available.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jontue since it came out in the mid 1970s and was very up set when I could no longer purchase it locally. I was verrrrrrry happy to find it on Amazon and I purchased 4 bottles.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!!! I I wear it all the time and am surprised when some one asks me what I am wearing, Cuz they don&#x27;t know the smell:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)  I love that!!!!!</li>
    <li> Mom&#x27;s happy and so am I with the price.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume delivered quick, can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
    <li> Just a little disappointed.  I wore this in college, and this bottle doesn&#x27;t smell the way I remember it.  Don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or not, but I was a little let down.</li>
    <li> The recipient of this gift was delighted.  Thanks for the prompt service.</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting a good deal...reached for a new bottle out of the cabinet...tryed 4 differant bottles....none of them worked...the spray tip just goes up and down...but nothing come out....turns out...I got really taken</li>
    <li> Awesome delivery time and product.  I would recommend this product to family members. This product is my ultimate perfume. Have been using it forever. As this product is no longer avail in Canada, I thank the United States for still carrying it :-)</li>
    <li> excellent product,i used before, and i love it.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted in a very timely manor.</li>
    <li> as I expected... came very quickly</li>
    <li> Not like the one I have left over in my bottle . Smells like it has a more masculine odor . More like an after shave lotion&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
    <li> This is a fresh clean scent that is not to strong. This was a great price for this product. I would recommend this to anyone who likes soft cologne.</li>
    <li> Came very fast. Product is perfect. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> Jontue by Revlon has been my choice for about 30 years.  My children have grown up with it being the scent that \\&quot;smells like my Mom\\&quot;.  They have asked me not to change and since I can&#x27;t find it in stores, I order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love love love jontue! Shame on revlon for not making it more readily available!</li>
    <li> This perfume is one of the best perfumes I have ever smelled. It smells so pretty If you want a pretty perfume you cant go wrong with jontue. I have to say it is the #1 perfume in my personal perfume collection.</li>
    <li> I love Jontue cologne and everyone always tells me how good I smell when I have it on.  I have been unable to find it where I live, so I was glad to find it on Amazon and appreciated the reasonable price and free shipping.</li>
    <li> For one bottle of Jontue at retail (Walgreen&#x27;s) is $26.00. I bought 2 bottles from you for $16.00. The product is exactly the same! I will never pay retail again! Thanks Amazon! The delivery was quick and no hidden charges. LOVE YOU!</li>
    <li> I have been married for 24 years and every since I have known her, my wife has used this perfume. It is a great product that is subtle and not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Jontue has been my fragrance for years. It is softly romantic, not a \\&quot;knock everyone out of the room\\&quot; scent. It has become difficult to find and I am so afraid it is going to be discontinued. I have tried many times to describe it.  The best I can do is...flowers and herbs with a slight musty scent.  I get compliments all the time.  It is the just right fragrance for the gentle, romantic, feminine woman.  It becomes a signature scent.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  I hope I can continue to get it here.</li>
    <li> Was unable to find Jontue at previous outlets. Delighted to find it online. Many perfumes sour on me and Jontue is one perfume that retains its scent.  Always complimented when I wear it.</li>
    <li> only perfume I wear and extremely happy to find it at such a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I RECIEVED THE WRONG ORDER, I&#x27;VE ALREADY WRITTEN TO YOU CONCERNING THIS. I RECIEVED A DIFFERENT JONTUE PERFUME. NOT THE ONE I ORDERED.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  If she&#x27;s happy.....I&#x27;m happy.  Do I really have to add any more than than??  Didn&#x27;t think so. &#x27;nuff said!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance but this bottle was definitely old.  Did not have the soft floral scent that Jontue has.</li>
    <li> Ok it smells old . I am somewhat disappointed because I use to wear this scent all the time when I was younger.</li>
    <li> My wife has used Jontue for years.It&#x27;s good to know that it can still be found and at such a great price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself, I remember wearing this fragrance in high school, but it is a little loud for me now.</li>
    <li> Jontue By Revlon For Women, Cologne Spray, 2.3 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my Mom as a gift, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I loved this perfume when I was younger. I always got compliments. I was so happy to find it on Amazon. I&#x27;m a lot older now and getting compliments again.  Thank You Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Jontue for many years but then was unable to find it in the stores.  I&#x27;m delighted to have found a source for it again.  The fragrance is short-lived, but I still love it.</li>
    <li> Product was well wrapped and shipping was very timely. A good transaction and my wife is happy also with her gift.</li>
    <li> This was the same Jontue I have been wearing, for what seems like forever! I&#x27;m very pleased with it and I thank you so much for offering it. Most of the stores I have available close by no longer carry it. My husband has Alzheimers, and he can still recognize the scent, even if he&#x27;s not certain that the face before him, is mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jontue since I was a teenager, at least fifteen years later I&#x27;m still using it. Love that I was able to find it for such a great price on Amazon.com You can usually find it at stores for around $25 for 2.3 ounces. Jontue has such an awesome smell, to me it&#x27;s otherworldly. I always get compliments when I wear it. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. This review makes me sound old, but I just turned 30 this year so I&#x27;m not quite ancient yet. But I think it&#x27;s great for any age, which you can&#x27;t say the same about for some perfumes.</li>
    <li> I wore this perfume back in the 90s and loved it – it worked really well with my body chemistry and the scent lasted most of the day. My sweeties definitely used to notice and enjoy this smell on me. This version of the perfume has a slightly more chemically smell when it goes on but that fades in about five minutes. After that the scent works really well with my body chemistry for another hour or so and then the smell is gone. When I first got this bottle, I put some on, waited a few minutes, asked my current sweetie how well it was working with my body chemistry, and got two thumbs up. However, since then, there has not been a day when it lasted long enough to be noticed in the evening. :-(</li>
    <li> Same as the original I still had from the 1970&#x27;s...</li>
    <li> Used this for years.  Can only find online now.  Love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother, who wore Jontue in her younger years (she&#x27;s in her 50s now). She beamed when she found this sitting on your dresser, and says it smells exactly like it used to. I must say that even I like the smell (I&#x27;m 19 by the way). It has sort of a light, powdery feel to it. A little goes a VERY LONG way, so keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent and I&#x27;ve worn it since high school.  Old friends and boyfriends are always delighted to know I still smell the same after all these years!</li>
    <li> The order was simple and came quickly. I was totally pleased. I would like to order it in a smaller size when it becomes available.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly, item as described</li>
    <li> Lovely sort of tropical summer scent. Perfect for a summer evening. I first started using this when I lived in Florida. I love this old favorite!</li>
    <li> I get more compliments on this than any other scent.  Proves old time fragrances are the best</li>
    <li> Very bad.. very very strong..not elegant at all. I made a bad choice. I bought it and never used it again.</li>
    <li> Got it quickly. Great price.</li>
    <li> It remind me of my high school days it has been around that long i love it the smell last a long time</li>
    <li> the quality I have come to expect from Revlon</li>
    <li> As always, Jontue is the best perfume and the only perfume I wear. I&#x27;ve used Jontue now for 42 years.  Im greatful that Jontue is still in the market.</li>
    <li> I order this all the time. Jontue is my favorite and I cannot find it anywhere except Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift. Although I love the fragrance my fiance had a different opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Not the products fault she just has different tastes.</li>
    <li> My favorite 80&#x27;s scent. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this since high school and I still get compliments on it.  It may be not be expensive but I still get asked what I am wearing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not exactly as wonderful as I remember.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or what.&lt;br /&gt;However I would still get it again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and the person I gave it to for christmas loves it. The smell is a little aged for me but she is crazy about it.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  I have used it for many years and it is getting harder, and harder to find.  I am so glad that I was able to get a couple bottles and at a good price.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is light and clean smelling. It is reminiscent of years ago when I wore it. It was a good price and a great size. The spray works well. Overall I am happy with my purchase. I would have given 5 stars but I find the scent does not last long.</li>
    <li> I was starting to wonder if my wife would find this product in the stores. Found product on line, bought many bottles. Smells wonderfull on her, daddy like  too. Made a great gift.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfum.  She is very happy with it.  My senses go crazy when she wears it, so I guess that make me happy also.</li>
    <li> Jontue is light, but lasting. I always get compliments when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I just gave it as a gift to my cousin who introduced me to it way back when.</li>
    <li> I would very much like to return this item.  It stinks.  It doesnt smell like I remember from years ago.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom for Christmas, she loved it very much and it was at a great price :)</li>
    <li> Love it and this is a very good price for this product.</li>
    <li> This fragrance has been one of my favorites for many years and so I decided to treat myself to memory lane. This is an old, traditional, classic cologne that I hope remains.</li>
    <li> I always come back to &amp;#34;my first love&amp;#34; - lol!! Been wearing this since I was a teen And I hope they never discontinue it!!</li>
    <li> Mild, non-offensive fragrance.  Has been my wife&#x27;s favorite for years!!</li>
    <li> In stores it usually cost around $20-30 on average&lt;br /&gt;( for the exact same product &amp; the same size bottle ).</li>
    <li> Have been using Jontue for at least 20 years.  Couldn&#x27;t pass up the price deal.  Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne. I just love it. Everyone always gives me a compliment when I wear this cologne. I am so glad that Amazon offers this Jontue for sale.  I will definitely buy more when I need it. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> My favorite and one and only for years. I hope they never stop making it. I also get compliments when wearing it.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne... Discontinued by Revlon. Great service by this seller.</li>
    <li> Been using this cologne since high school 37 years ago and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else! And to get it at this price - amazing!</li>
    <li> Received as expected and very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.....it has a light subtle fragrance.  The scent doesn&#x27;t over power the senses like some do and I would recommend this perfume to anyone who is sensitive to smells.</li>
    <li> I have used Jontue for years, people ask me all the dtime what I wear &#x27;cause I smell so good.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for someone and they really liked it. im not into perfume but they loved the smell. it was what they expected.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my mom wanted for her birthday.  Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume.  Used to wear it as a young girl and was hoping the scent was still as pleasing many, many years later, and it is.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this old favorite fragrance. I was a little surprised at the big bottle. I was expecting a lipstick size one. I love it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom and it is not available in stores anymore so she absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance for my wife for years!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  Had problems finding this product to purchase elsewhere.  Completely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE COLOGNE SPRAY.  I HAVE BEEN WEARING IT FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS.  ITS HARD TO FIND AROUND HERE.  WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT ON AMAZON.  IT WAS ABOUT HALF THE COST AND WAS SHIPPED FAST.  SO HAPPY TO HAVE SOME TO WEAR AGAIN.</li>
    <li> The wife loves it as always. The scent alone convince our friend to try it also.Compared to other perfumes plus the price factor together with a very romantic scent, got to be a winner.</li>
    <li> The Jontue sent was not the fragrance I am use to. It actually smelled more masculine than female. Tried all new bottles next to my original Jontue. Even my family agreed this was not Jontue. I am very disappointed since Jontue is no longer offered in the stores</li>
    <li> The person I bought this for was satisfied. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and have used it for over 20 years. Scent of carnations when you wear this.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend who loves it. It&#x27;s a legacy item, hard to find sometimes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE JONTUE COLOGNE AND BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS.  ORDERING ONLINE SAVED ME QUITE A BIT OF MONEY AND IT WAS RECEIVED QUICKLY.  i RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS CONSTANTLY AND ASKED THE NAME OF THE COLOGNE.</li>
    <li> I wore Jontue for years considering it my signature scent.  It was very flattering for me and even strangers would tell me how good I smelled.  Nice.  Then suddenly I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores and I started using different colognes and perfumes but never with the same response I received when wearing Jontue.  I was happily surprised to find it on-line and look forward to getting  compliments again.  I just hope Revlon hasn&#x27;t changed the old formula which was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the cologne is dispensed.  The manner in which the cologne comes out of the bottle would be better described as a stream than a spray.  I don&#x27;t know if all of the bottles are like this or the one I purchased is defective.</li>
    <li> I order from this company for my wife and am always happy. The price is great and the service matches.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. A very good springtime smell.  It, is very good, a sweet flowery scent! Very good, you will probably like it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere for this cologne spray and finally found it!! Jontue is one of my favorite fragrances to wear. The fragrance comes on strong when you first put it on but settles down with a soft touch of musk. I get many complements on it.  I will buy from this site again.</li>
    <li> I love Jontue it makes me sexy and it makes my man say baby u smell delicious.  Keep it up</li>
    <li> It was the same product that I have been buying for years at half the price. Could not ask for more. Thank you, Micheline</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for years. This is her preferred perfume and met all her expectations. The price was very good compared to local vendors and shipping was free.</li>
