      <li>My hair never curls easy.</li>

      <li>The first time i used this i got so many complements.</li>
      <li>Purchased first iron for daughter at Christmas, liked it so much that I ordered on for myself.</li>
      <li>God bless all and thanks for reading this review :]</li>

      <li>Heats up quickly and straightens very well in the morning.</li>
      <li>So I have been pleasantly surprised to find this on Amazon at a HUGE savings....</li>
      <li>but this is the first time I&#x27;ve encountered an issue with not receiving my items.</li>
      <li>Some times the light blinks on and off when i turn the cord a certain other than that it&#x27;s a good straightener but not enough for me thinking about getting a solia.</li>
      <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this line of flat irons!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not had any issues with any abnormal malfunctions, it works perfectly just like the super expensive one i used prior to purchasing this one.</li>
      <li>shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Oh well, it&#x27;s probably worth buying the one at the mall because that one really surprised me with the curls.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This one works really well</li>
      <li>My daughter loves blue and this was the best blue (only blue)</li>
      <li>Almost got suckered into buying these at a kiosk in the mall for around $175, then REALLY almost bought one when they lowered it to $99 as we were about to walk away.</li>
      <li>And here, it&#x27;s cheap enough to replace if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>But, after the first use I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Luckily we couldn&#x27;t even afford that on that particular day, which gave me time to Google them on the Internet at home later and see that we could get them for under $30!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to friends.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product if you would like to purchase a hair straightener.</li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s second Colorful Season Hair straightener and she loves it.</li>
      <li>, if anything, it made it feel more coarse and dry.</li>
      <li>My only complaint would be is that the hot plates can crack and break very easily.  </li>
      <li>I first found this item at my local westfield mall.</li>
      <li>Good but not good enough</li>
      <li>My old one was $200, the same exact one, but one of the heat plates fell off.</li>
      <li>It does get extremely hot, even when I turn down the setting it still got unbearably hot.</li>
      <li>At first I was unsure because Someone told me the plates stick if you use product in your hair and are really hard to clean.</li>
      <li>My teen daughter really likes this😃</li>
      <li>I ordered this straightener because my old one broke.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
      <li>After several emails between me &amp; seller &amp; being promised if it didn&#x27;t arrive by \\&quot;several dates\\&quot;  I would be reimbursed or a new one would be shipped but still nothing.</li>

<li> flat iron</li>
<li> This flat iron is the BOMB!</li>

<li> but I thought I would receive a little baggie like in the picture to take it when i travel...</li>
<li> I think that&#x27;s why my hair got dried out.</li>
<li> My daughter has extremely thick and sometimes unruly hair.  </li>
<li> so I was a little wary.</li>

    <li> Good but not good enough i guess. I have this wave in the back of my hair and this iron doesn&#x27;t straighten it completely and it makes me mad i end up having to put it in a pony tail. Some times the light blinks on and off when i turn the cord a certain other than that it&#x27;s a good straightener but not enough for me thinking about getting a solia. God bless all and thanks for reading this review :]</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought.  I was looking for a 2&amp;#34; flat iron but when this came it was only 1.5&amp;#34;.  I returned it.  No issues with return because Amazon is always easy to work with during customer services issues!</li>
    <li> I first found this item at my local westfield mall. Great product, but for 200 dollars? Kidding me! So when the girl wasn&#x27;t looking I scaned/ to a picture of the box and found it here on amazon for this price!!! Can&#x27;t bet that and leaves my hair shinny and no frizzes. Thanks for the fast delivery and great product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s second Colorful Season Hair straightener and she loves it. An Excellent quality item. My wife definitely recommends this item to all the people that need to straighten their hair.</li>
    <li> Love love love this straightening iron. Heats up quickly and straightens very well in the morning. I would highly recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  My only complaint would be is that the hot plates can crack and break very easily.  I&#x27;ve had 2 and both the plates cracked.  They are still usable.</li>
    <li> I had used my boyfriend&#x27;s niece&#x27;s HerStyler that she purchased at the mall for close to 10 times what I paid. I fell in love with it but not that price. I only wished I had looked to see if Amazon had sold them sooner. I&#x27;ve not had any issues with any abnormal malfunctions, it works perfectly just like the super expensive one i used prior to purchasing this one. And here, it&#x27;s cheap enough to replace if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I gave it three stars because its works soo good but I thought I would receive a little baggie like in the picture to take it when i travel... i thought that was rip off.</li>
    <li> My daughter has extremely thick and sometimes unruly hair.  This worked wonderfully on her hair!  Nice and smooth!  We loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Good price too.</li>
    <li> I received my product early, and it works great.  I would definitly buy products from this vender again.  I am very happy that I was able to find what I wanted at such a great price.</li>
    <li> Receive when promised but didn&#x27;t have a travel bag. This my second time buying this product and always had a bag.</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener because my old one broke. This one works really well and its really cheap + shipping was fast. My old one was $200, the same exact one, but one of the heat plates fell off. So far, this one is great!</li>
    <li> Better than the Chi. A quarter of the price. This flat iron is the BOMB!</li>
    <li> bought this for my niece, she said it didn&#x27;t last her very long.... then again I don&#x27;t think any straightening iron has... lol...</li>
    <li> The item was ordered a month &amp; 2 days ago. The tracking number states it was delivered in Brea, CA but I&#x27;m in Miami, FL.  After several emails between me &amp; seller &amp; being promised if it didn&#x27;t arrive by \\&quot;several dates\\&quot;  I would be reimbursed or a new one would be shipped but still nothing. My emails haven&#x27;t been responded since 4 days ago!!!   It was only $45 with shipping but still I refuse to let anyone keep my $. I have been ordering from Amazon for years but this is the first time I&#x27;ve encountered an issue with not receiving my items. DO NOT ORDER FROM 22 STREET FUSION IN BREA, CA</li>
    <li> The first time i used this i got so many complements. It&#x27;s great quality and I&#x27;m in love with it! I highly recommend this product if you would like to purchase a hair straightener.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves blue and this was the best blue (only blue) I could find. It came timely, gets super hot and she&#x27;s been straightening and curling her hair with it!</li>
    <li> product is great ! I&#x27;ve wanted one for a long time. I absolutely impressed with everything about it love love love it</li>
    <li> I saw this in the mall at one of those kiosks and was given a pretty hard sell.  The woman styled my hair and I really did think it worked great, but I didn&#x27;t want to shell out $99 for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it here on Amazon for $24 and was thrilled.  I used probably 3 or 4 times a week and it works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> At first I was unsure because Someone told me the plates stick if you use product in your hair and are really hard to clean. I am African American and usually use a heat protectant after washing my hair so I was a little wary. But, after the first use I was pleasantly surprised. Usually it takes at least an hour and a half to straighten my hair, with this flat iron it took 45 minutes and I was able to get close to my scalp without burning myself. I love it and I&#x27;m considering ordering another for my cousin!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this line of flat irons!!! In the past, I have spent alot for this same flat iron&#x27;s effect. So I have been pleasantly surprised to find this on Amazon at a HUGE savings....AWESOME!!!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Definitely not the same as the ones you find at the mall. Didn&#x27;t make my hair feel nice and smooth, if anything, it made it feel more coarse and dry. It does get extremely hot, even when I turn down the setting it still got unbearably hot. I think that&#x27;s why my hair got dried out. Perhaps I just got a defective one. Oh well, it&#x27;s probably worth buying the one at the mall because that one really surprised me with the curls. My hair never curls easy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get a better price. Is comparable to the Chi iron and does not burn your hair. Highly recommended. Great!</li>
    <li> Purchased first iron for daughter at Christmas, liked it so much that I ordered on for myself. Beats the $200.00 they want a t the mall.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t come with the free travel bag</li>
    <li> My teen daughter really likes this😃</li>
    <li> Almost got suckered into buying these at a kiosk in the mall for around $175, then REALLY almost bought one when they lowered it to $99 as we were about to walk away. Luckily we couldn&#x27;t even afford that on that particular day, which gave me time to Google them on the Internet at home later and see that we could get them for under $30! So ordered 1 for wife and 1 for her daughter, as well as a bottle of their $75 hair serum, and only paid about $65 or so for it all! The girls say these seems to work better than the $175 Croc flatiron I bought my wife last Christmas. Very good, especially for the price!!!</li>
    <li> After my purple hair straightener broke, the wires were coming out after 3-5 years, I didn&#x27;t feel like paying $100 at the mall for another one. I found this online, in blue!!!! I instantly bought it and it has been a dream! The ag is nice to makes sure the hair straightener doesn&#x27;t touch anything when you put it away and I&#x27;m still using the bag and box provided. Great hair straightener, it&#x27;s a great color and gets your hair so straight and leaves it soft. Very happy with this product, no hair damage. :)</li>
