### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It would make a perfect gift for ladies to give to their man.</li>
      <li>and it still works flawlessly.</li>
      <li>That being said, this is the best shave from an electric</li>
      <li>Let me start off by saying that this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in 50 plus years.  </li>
      <li>best of all, mine came in a Camo color-scheme!  </li>
      <li>Excellent workmanship.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re very happy with it.</li>
      <li>The Remington Shaver XR13400UTD is an excellent electric shaver.</li>
      <li>This razor does come with impressive packaging if that is of any importance to you.</li>
      <li>My son thinks it&#x27;s the best razor he has ever used.</li>
      <li>It is however very good at giving that &amp;#34;I</li>
      <li>This neat lithium powered unit does a very good job.  </li>
      <li>This is a great shaver.  </li>
      <li>All in all this is an excellent product to shave with-with or without gel-to get a nice look.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a lot to be said for this razor, and it does seem to be great quality.</li>
      <li>The convenience is great, but it&#x27;s a trade-off.</li>
      <li>kit includes a travel bag that is a very nice addition.  </li>
      <li>my husband does not like the way most of these shavers work, he feels you get the best close shave with a hand shaver with a disposable blade.  </li>
      <li>It comes in beautiful packaging, looks high-quality, and comes with a nice travel bag.</li>
      <li>However, he was impressed with how this felt in his hand, very comfortable and the head rotated nicely to get every angle of your face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>his estimation, it’s a good quality shaver.</li>
      <li>Ergonomic wise, I had lots of problems.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to make consistently good contact.</li>
      <li>It has good battery life.  </li>
      <li>shaver is very light, feels very comfortable in my hand, and the shave is excellent.</li>
      <li>The shaver also comes with a charging stand, which is nice when at home, but kind of pain to have to bring on the road!</li>
      <li>It follows the shape of the face nicely and the carrying case is a nice addition.  </li>
      <li>The camo design was a nice touch.</li>
      <li>, it has a nice presentation.</li>
      <li>He was also thrilled with the travel bag that was included; it&#x27;s well made, has a sturdy zipper and a couple of compartments.</li>
      <li>Now I own the XR1340.  </li>
      <li>is a nice touch.</li>
      <li>If I got this as a gift I would be convinced the person actually liked me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>package of this razor is nice.</li>
      <li>(This is a man&#x27;s razor, but for review purposes, I did a side by side comparison on my own legs in addition to observing my husband&#x27;s results.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well built, attractive, feels good in your hand, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean.</li>
      <li>it was easy to tell that this Remington razor is made superiorly.</li>
      <li>The wet/dry option is great for a quick touch up and although I am not a hunter the camouflage styling doesn’t bother me.</li>
      <li>And this Philips is so far the best in that regard.  </li>
      <li>battery life is substantial.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is easily rechargeable and comes with a cute stand and a charger.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver also comes with a travel bag and an attached trimmer (good for trimming side burns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While that&#x27;s perhaps a fluke occurrence and maybe could have happened with any rotary, it&#x27;s the first time he&#x27;s experienced a shaving injury like that.</li>
      <li>He said the rotary head gives him a very comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>It is a very comfortable shaver to use.</li>
      <li>The Nissan is nice and seems fine, but when you pick it apart against a Honda all the details just don&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
      <li>Norelco has a better idea.  </li>
      <li>All in all probably my favorite electric razor.</li>
      <li>I have used some of the top shavers from Braun, Panasonic, and Norelco (Phillips)</li>
      <li>If giving this razor as a gift you would feel very proud to present it to your husband or boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, with that flex head, it&#x27;s probably the best out there; however, as before, for my ultra-thick beard, blades still work better.  </li>
      <li>the floating, contouring heads are the best yet especially with those 3 all metal precison heads.  </li>
      <li>Weekly: a more thorough cleaning plus lubricate with houshold oil.  </li>
      <li>I have been using electric shavers for many years now.</li>
      <li>charging station would interesting.  </li>
      <li>In our case it is because the shave is so nice and irritation free.</li>
      <li>they end up costing more.</li>
      <li>husband laughed though when he first saw the &amp;#34;Gone Hunting&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I can easily shave three times a day or more.  </li>
      <li>Very comfortable, nice to hold, pretty close shave for an electric razor.</li>
      <li>My husband will enjoy the convenience of being able to use this razor once in a while.</li>
      <li>And this does a good, very acceptable shave.</li>
      <li>My son says this gives him the most thorough and close shave as well as the most comfortable and pain free shave.</li>
      <li>There is no remaining charge percentage indicator, but with a lithium ion battery you can always top off the charge if you will be away from an outlet without a fear of damaging the battery.&lt;br /&gt;Second, to clean the heads you pry a finger nail under one of three recesses and then pry the head off.</li>
      <li>This is a top notch electric razor that offers a good shave, compact size and a travel case.    </li>
      <li>This is a decent price for a really good razor.</li>
      <li>He liked the result, even though the shave itself wasn’t as good as he gets with his regular manual Gillette Fusion.</li>
      <li>The shaver comes with  pretty nice and usable shaving kit bag.</li>
      <li>This one is amazingly light and compact for travel and neat to use in the shower.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There is still a lot to like though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a smooth, pain- and cut-free shave.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Smooth, close and comfortable</li>
      <li>Seemed to fit the hand well.</li>
      <li>When i&#x27;m pushed for time I&#x27;ll use an electric razor, but prefer the smooth shave of a safety razor otherwise,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the primary feature to me is that its water proof--</li>
      <li>So if you are OK with upkeep this is a good choice that can ultimately save you money over blades.</li>
      <li>All in all a good razor so far - even for a guy who does NOT like using an electric razor.</li>
      <li>My son says it is easy and confortable to hold onto, is the quietest shaver he has ever used and it charges quickly.</li>
      <li>so was eager to try this latest offering from Remington, my first ever.</li>
      <li>No electrics I&#x27;ve found can provide as close a shave as the safety razor, but electrics are significantly easier on my skin.  </li>
      <li>but with one significant drawback.  </li>
      <li>The Remington leaves you with a clean shave but not as close as you&#x27;d get going against the grain.  </li>
      <li>What I really like here is 1) very lightweight, easy to travel with unit, 2) fits and feels nice in hand 3)</li>
      <li>The front holding the blades snaps off and you can quickly rinse them under the sink or unsnap the blades and give things a thorough cleaning.  </li>
      <li>It pivots neatly and makes working around the contours of your neck and chin quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I will, however, keep this around for those days when I just need a quick once-over.</li>
      <li>However, it just wasn&#x27;t great enough to convince him to switch to using an electric shaver on a more regular basis.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor relative to the Panasonic that it&#x27;s replacing and the Braun that preceded that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Let me begin by saying I&#x27;ve never really had good experiences with rotary shavers.</li>
      <li>My old shaver had a nice push button to open that I like better.  </li>
      <li>The total package is nice, though.</li>
      <li>Make sure to clean the thing on a regular basiis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think just plugging the charging station right to the unit itself would be plenty.  </li>
      <li>You just need to decide if the cost is worth the higher end features for you.</li>
      <li>I much prefer my norelco charger with a simple plug in port that&#x27;s nice and secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>His sensitive skin had a fair amount of irritation overall, despite the titanium coated blades, which should have been a plus for his nickel allergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve never been a fan of an electric-- so read this review in that spirit.</li>
      <li>Finally, for a thorough cleaning, to remove the rotary elements, you pop off the head, and then slide a uni directional piece of plastic from the top of the rotary elements.</li>
      <li>First off, i&#x27;m not an avid electric shaver.</li>
      <li>The packaging of this razor was first class.  </li>
      <li>Most of the time I use regular blades- usually quicker and a closer shave; however, the Remingtons have worked well for me when I want to mix it up, and this one is definitely the best I&#x27;ve seen.    </li>
      <li>(He still mostly chooses his regular razor over this option.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I have never been able to achieve a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shave with an electric, and this one is no different.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for many years now. I have used some of the top shavers from Braun, Panasonic, and Norelco (Phillips) so was eager to try this latest offering from Remington, my first ever. The Remington looks like a Norelco clone, and feels like one in the hand. I have never been a big fan of the rotary shaver model. My Norelco sits in my office as an emergency tool and my Panasonic is my everyday shaver. In terms of build quality, the Remington seems a step or two below the Norelco, and has real problems around my chin. I have used the Remington shaver for about 2-3 weeks now, and in terms of performance, I would rate it about the same as the Norelco, though with less whisker-pull (a HUGE plus!!!). It is a very comfortable shaver to use. However, the Remington, like the Norelco, just does not get as close as a Panasonic, in fact when finished with the Remington, I now use my Panasonic to finish the job. The total package is nice, though. The shaver comes with  pretty nice and usable shaving kit bag. The shaver also comes with a charging stand, which is nice when at home, but kind of pain to have to bring on the road! You can only charge the shave through the stand. Also, like many electric shavers, and rotary models in particular, the pop-up trimmer is narrow and pain to use. The one thing I really like about rotary shavers like this Remington Model is sound, they are so quiet compared to foil shavers (Braun, Panasonic)! In my opinion, the Camo finish makes it look weird, no cool, not sure if any of the other finishes would be better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the experiences with electric shavers truly vary from person to person, so your experience may very well differ from mine. In any case, remember to not judge and electric shaver after one shave, especially if you are used to blade and cream/gel shaving - it can take a few weeks for your face to get used to the new approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(comparison shavers referenced: Norelco Spectra 8894XL and Panasonic ESLV61)sonic ESLV61)</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  I like the size, the shape and the camo!!  It does a great job on tough stubble and even 2 day growth.  It follows the shape of the face nicely and the carrying case is a nice addition.  It has good battery life.  All in all a good razor so far - even for a guy who does NOT like using an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor relative to the Panasonic that it&#x27;s replacing and the Braun that preceded that.&lt;br /&gt;I have moderately sensitive skin and alternate days shaving with a safety razor and an electric razor.  No electrics I&#x27;ve found can provide as close a shave as the safety razor, but electrics are significantly easier on my skin.  And this Philips is so far the best in that regard.  It does work improve the shave if you use it while your skin is wet and better still if you use a small amount of shave gel (a layer as thick as you would use for a blade razor would be excessive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades have retained their edge very well and the unit is far tidier than prior electrics I&#x27;ve used.  The front holding the blades snaps off and you can quickly rinse them under the sink or unsnap the blades and give things a thorough cleaning.  My only criticism is that sometimes aligning the face to snap the blades back into the drivers can be a bit finicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The articulation of the head works very well.  It pivots neatly and makes working around the contours of your neck and chin quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;And best of all, mine came in a Camo color-scheme!  It positively radiates masculinity and my wife hasn&#x27;t nipped into my medicine cabinet to borrow it for any of her personal grooming!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in 50 plus years.  Smooth, close and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The plastic cover that protects the shaver head has to be aligned lined up and slide onto the head.  Norelco has a better idea.  It just snaps on.  Quicker and easier.&lt;br /&gt;2) To remove the cutters, you have to get a thumbnail under one edge and lift or twist.  A pain vs my Norelco&lt;br /&gt;3) As other have noted, the charging cable only plugs into the charging cradle. With my Norelco, it plugs into either the cradle or directly into the shaver.  A smarter design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Have been using this shaver for over a year now and it still works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> The packaging of this razor was first class.  If giving this razor as a gift you would feel very proud to present it to your husband or boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband laughed though when he first saw the &amp;#34;Gone Hunting&amp;#34; theme and thought perhaps it was part of the Duck Dynasty branding which would be funny since they all have long facial hair, why would they shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit includes a travel bag that is a very nice addition.  You can keep all your items in one place for storing if you wanted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my husband does not like the way most of these shavers work, he feels you get the best close shave with a hand shaver with a disposable blade.  However, he was impressed with how this felt in his hand, very comfortable and the head rotated nicely to get every angle of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station would interesting.  I think just plugging the charging station right to the unit itself would be plenty.  Now I have this clip like thing we have to store when we are not charging it the unit.</li>
    <li> The Remington Shaver XR13400UTD is an excellent electric shaver. The precision plus heads contour for a close shave all over. The wet/dry option is great for a quick touch up and although I am not a hunter the camouflage styling doesn’t bother me. The razor also comes with a carrying case which is large enough to hold the shaver, adapter and a few other travel size toiletry items. This is a decent price for a really good razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric or battery powered shavers but I&#x27;ve got to make an exception here, especially with the high cost of razor blades.  This neat lithium powered unit does a very good job.  If you alternate this shaver with a Fusion razor you&#x27;ve got it made.  The two reasons you need the fusion (if you like a really close shave) is that in the Gillette you can go against the grain and get as close a shave as technology currently allows.  The Remington leaves you with a clean shave but not as close as you&#x27;d get going against the grain.  Also, be prepared at the beginning to experience a little soreness, probably from the unfamiliarity of using a shaver.  This only lasts about 45 minutes and really is no big deal.  All in all this is an excellent product to shave with-with or without gel-to get a nice look.</li>
    <li> I have always used an electric razor, and most of the time they were the Norelco brand (last one was 7310XL and before that a 5861XL) and at other times Remington. To start off with the shaving comfort is comparable (I shave dry), but with a slight edge to the Norelco, it seems like the XR1340 dual concentric blades seem to leave  a slight razor burn. Also while the Norelco took an average of 1min 15sec to get a smooth face, the Remington needed a few more “scrapes” and a total time of 1min 30 sec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics wise I had lots of issues with the XR1340; starting with the charger which is a clamp on shell that you snap around the shaver (vs a simple plug in cord). This clamshell often seemed to work loose from the contacts, the charge light would go out and I had to open it up, re snap it shut and wiggle it on the shaver to re establish charging. There is no remaining charge percentage indicator, but with a lithium ion battery you can always top off the charge if you will be away from an outlet without a fear of damaging the battery.&lt;br /&gt;Second, to clean the heads you pry a finger nail under one of three recesses and then pry the head off. I always got the feeling that I am about to break the head into three pieces (on the Norelco you push a single button and the head pivots open). To close the head back up, you have to align three pins and then evenly push the entire assembly back on. I say evenly because on several occasions I snapped two of the three heads back on and one was left slightly open. This resulted in the shaver shaving poorly and only after shaving for much more than a regular time did I realize that the head was not on all the way. Finally, for a thorough cleaning, to remove the rotary elements, you pop off the head, and then slide a uni directional piece of plastic from the top of the rotary elements. It pretty much snapped and flew onto the ground every time I tried to do this. This was not the problem though, putting it back on was. It only goes back on one way (vs any position in other symmetrical retaining design shavers), and its not a simple task to figure it out. I wish it was color coded at least. At least the cutting wheels are color coded, gray, blue and black, such that you can always return them into the correct slotted cutting head once they become honed into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I got a similar shave, but it took a slightly longer time. Ergonomic wise, I had lots of problems. And finally value wise, unless you have to have the special edition paint scheme this shaver does not offer any features that you cannot get from the XR1370 or even XR1330 (slightly less battery run time) at a substantial saving. If the ergonomics I talk about bother you, I suggest checking out the PT370 (replaced the 7310XL).</li>
    <li> First off, i&#x27;m not an avid electric shaver. When i&#x27;m pushed for time I&#x27;ll use an electric razor, but prefer the smooth shave of a safety razor otherwise,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dug the ergonomics of this model. Seemed to fit the hand well. The camo design was a nice touch. Very quiet motor so no complaints there. Recharge time is good, however I don&#x27;t really care for the little mount that they have you slide the charger in. It doesn&#x27;t seem to make consistently good contact. I much prefer my norelco charger with a simple plug in port that&#x27;s nice and secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On two days growth I did get a little pulling, but I that&#x27;s not all that uncommon for me as i don&#x27;t regularly use electric razors and my skin&#x27;s not 100% acclimated to it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included travel bag is a nice touch. Overall this is a good buy, just wish the charger was a different design.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve never been a fan of an electric-- so read this review in that spirit. That being said, this is the best shave from an electric I&#x27;ve gotten-- the primary feature to me is that its water proof-- meaning you can do a wet shave. However, I have never been able to achieve a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shave with an electric, and this one is no different. It is however very good at giving that &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t want you to think I shaved but I did&amp;#34; look. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into then this is your razor. Make sure to clean the thing on a regular basiis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the gift box the razor came in a tad excessive, also the camouflage razor is ugly as SIN, I can&#x27;t imagine who that would appeal to.</li>
    <li> Excellent workmanship. The shave is not as close as a foil shaver. The quality is certainly there. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Downgraded from 4 stars to one.  Doesn&#x27;t work after 3 months. I have never had an electric shaver fail and have been using them for decades.  I just like to change/upgrade them. In my initial review, I commented on the difficulty removing the head to rinse it.  One time, I placed my finger too far under the head, and the entire top popped off, including the orange rubber rings.  Popped it back in.  Possibly, water got in underneath the ring, though I don&#x27;t see how.  I just know that a battery recharge only lasts for 30 seconds.  Today it went in the trash.  Since this was a Vine review, no warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good shaver but with one significant drawback.  I always wet shave with a gel or low foam type product.  With my other shavers, I pop them open while shaving, rinse the gel off, and close it.  With this shaver, you have to remove the head completely from the body, to rinse it.  That means powering off the shaver, rinsing, and reinserting it.  Since I usually rinse my shaver several times during shaving, it is inconvenient.  If you don&#x27;t use a gel or foam product, and don&#x27;t need to rinse during shaving, the shaver is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is very light, feels very comfortable in my hand, and the shave is excellent.</li>
    <li> My son thinks it&#x27;s the best razor he has ever used. He has been using a Phillips Norelco Aquatec AT815 (avg retail $80). This razor does come with impressive packaging if that is of any importance to you. It has a hard cardboard box with a two sided flip over lid that closes with a magnetic security. Once packaging is removed all that you have is the razor (with slide on cutter head cover), charging base with separate plug in cord, small brush and manual. This particular razor packaging also comes with a three month subscription to an online magazine app. I very much doubt we will even activate it because I am sure it is one of those that once you activate it, it is very difficult to discontinue and it also auto-renews. I&#x27;ve done things like that before and find that they are such a pain to discontinue and then I get put on tons of new mailing lists that I don&#x27;t want either! When I ordered this razor the price was $175, now on 12/25 it is down to $136. I think the razor is over priced, but it does work very well. My son loves how the heads area extremely pivotable. The three heads all pivot individually as well as a threesome on the pivoting neck of the razor heads-all at the same time! My son says this gives him the most thorough and close shave as well as the most comfortable and pain free shave. He gives the razor two emphatic thumbs up! My son says it is easy and confortable to hold onto, is the quietest shaver he has ever used and it charges quickly. He likes the stable razor stand used for charging. **Please note, the razor can not be charged unless it is seated in it&#x27;s stand because the power cord plugs into the stand and not the razor.** the razor is a little slick to hold onto, but it also fits in your hand wonderfully and is well balanced. When I held this razor back to back with the Norelco Aquatec AT 815 it was easy to tell that this Remington razor is made superiorly. It reminded me of comparing a Nissan to a Honda. The Nissan is nice and seems fine, but when you pick it apart against a Honda all the details just don&#x27;t make the cut. Something as simple as the release and closure of the straight cutting edge, the Remington is smooth, solid and fluid; the Norelco clunks erect and folds back to shut like dropping the hood of a car. You just need to decide if the cost is worth the higher end features for you. In our case it is because the shave is so nice and irritation free.</li>
    <li> My husband typically uses a regular razor, as opposed to a rotary. In the past, he&#x27;s had issues with rotary razors burning his face so bad, he just stayed away from them. With his job, and the fact that he shaves daily, the convenience of one of these made him decide to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular one didn&#x27;t burn his face as bad as ones in the past, but it didn&#x27;t get as close of a shave. (He still mostly chooses his regular razor over this option.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package of this razor is nice. It would make a perfect gift for ladies to give to their man. It has a nice carrying case, and the razor itself has several different options to pick one most associated with a guy(golf, hunting, American flag, cars, and computer).</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, nice to hold, pretty close shave for an electric razor. Also no after burn. All in all probably my favorite electric razor. Will it replace my manual? Probably not. But that is me. Two reasons. Manual are still closer shaves and less maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they end up costing more. And this does a good, very acceptable shave. So if you are OK with upkeep this is a good choice that can ultimately save you money over blades.</li>
    <li> Although my husband isn’t a fan of hunting, the design of this shaver didn’t deter him from appreciating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his estimation, it’s a good quality shaver. He liked the result, even though the shave itself wasn’t as good as he gets with his regular manual Gillette Fusion. After shaving (both when he used the shaver on dry skin or on wet with a foam), he had to touch up afterwards.  He prefers his shave wet, which means taking out the blades and washing them, so that is something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still a lot to like though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a smooth, pain- and cut-free shave.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is substantial.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is easily rechargeable and comes with a cute stand and a charger.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver also comes with a travel bag and an attached trimmer (good for trimming side burns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is this shaver will be a better choice for men who will use it for dry shaving.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot to be said for this razor, and it does seem to be great quality. It&#x27;s well built, attractive, feels good in your hand, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean. The choice between shaving wet or dry is a great feature. However, both my husband and I find that it doesn&#x27;t give a particularly closer or better shave compared to other rotary shavers - which is to say, not as close and smooth as the disposable razors we often use. The convenience is great, but it&#x27;s a trade-off. (This is a man&#x27;s razor, but for review purposes, I did a side by side comparison on my own legs in addition to observing my husband&#x27;s results.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also got a patch of intense razor burn/pinching/bruising on his neck on one of the first few uses. While that&#x27;s perhaps a fluke occurrence and maybe could have happened with any rotary, it&#x27;s the first time he&#x27;s experienced a shaving injury like that. His sensitive skin had a fair amount of irritation overall, despite the titanium coated blades, which should have been a plus for his nickel allergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this is probably a solid choice if you know you&#x27;re looking for a rotary shaver. My husband will enjoy the convenience of being able to use this razor once in a while. I&#x27;ll probably even use it on occasion. However, it just wasn&#x27;t great enough to convince him to switch to using an electric shaver on a more regular basis.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying I&#x27;ve never really had good experiences with rotary shavers. I usually use a [[ASIN:B005PUZZR8 Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache Beard and Stubble Trimmer]] for daily maintenance (which leaves just a bit of stubble) and disposable safety razors for when I need a close shave. Just so you know where I&#x27;m coming from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I will say about the Remington Gone Hunting shaver is wow, it has a nice presentation. It comes in beautiful packaging, looks high-quality, and comes with a nice travel bag. If I got this as a gift I would be convinced the person actually liked me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger leaves something to be desired. The shaver can only be charged via its proprietary charger (i.e. no way to plug a cord into the shaver itself), but contrary to everything else in the package the charger seems poorly-thought-out and quickly-made. It also has a tendency to fall over way too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual shaver, it feels really good in your hand, keeps a charge, and follows facial contours pretty well, but here&#x27;s the rub for me: it doesn&#x27;t actually fix any of the things that make me not like rotary shavers (notably the hair-pulling - especially if you skip a day - and the inability to get a really close shave), just make them much less noticeable and/or less frequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does everything better than any other rotary I&#x27;ve used, but I still prefer my trimmer and blades. I will, however, keep this around for those days when I just need a quick once-over. But if rotary shavers are your thing, you&#x27;ve probably found what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my fiance and he loves it! He said the rotary head gives him a very comfortable shave. You can use this wet or dry; he did feel that wet was more comfortable for him (dry left his neck burning just slightly). He was also thrilled with the travel bag that was included; it&#x27;s well made, has a sturdy zipper and a couple of compartments. This is a quiet little shaver, works fast and has a long battery life. We&#x27;re very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a top notch electric razor that offers a good shave, compact size and a travel case.    I&#x27;ve used Remington shavers all my bearded life in conjunction with regular blades.  I have a large face and a heavy beard.  I can easily shave three times a day or more.  Most of the time I use regular blades- usually quicker and a closer shave; however, the Remingtons have worked well for me when I want to mix it up, and this one is definitely the best I&#x27;ve seen.    Of course, they now feature different, decorative designs which I can take or leave.  What I really like here is 1) very lightweight, easy to travel with unit, 2) fits and feels nice in hand 3) the floating, contouring heads are the best yet especially with those 3 all metal precison heads.  Now, my old  Remington SR9130, which I liked a lot, is bulkier(it would indicate time remaining) but with a larger cutting surface area and a larger trimmer, it was less gentle on the face than this one.    I follow the instructions and use in the shower: wet face, apply gel, rinse often under water.  Try not to press hard- that&#x27;s a definite for most electric shaving.  For cleaning, daily: pull the rotary face off and tap or blow out shavings and rinse.  My old shaver had a nice push button to open that I like better.  Weekly: a more thorough cleaning plus lubricate with houshold oil.  I find if one complies with servicing the machine lasts a lot longer.  Usually, I get 2 years(which is the warrenty here) or so out of a machine if I use it regularly.  After that the blades don&#x27;t cut well enough on my beard or the motor&#x27;s weak and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work.    Now I own the XR1340.  After the initial 24 hours of charging, they suggest a full 4 hour charging time for about a 1 hour shaving time.  It does have a small low battery/charging indicator and will work worldwide for voltage.    Overall, with that flex head, it&#x27;s probably the best out there; however, as before, for my ultra-thick beard, blades still work better.  This one is amazingly light and compact for travel and neat to use in the shower.  Finally, it is very cost prohibitive, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the price has been coming down.</li>
