      <li>I didn&#x27;t love them, I thought they looked cheep, but I put them in his stocking at Christmas anyway.  </li>
      <li>I was trying to find a better alternative to the plastic tongue sweepers that my fiance used.</li>
      <li>I would pay more for a thicker one.</li>
      <li>just wish it took off even more than what it does.</li>
      <li>Mine was glad I was already using one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the plastic triangle tongue scrapers before (like the ones you&#x27;d find at walmart), but I found this much more effective in cleaning than the plastic ones and it&#x27;s easy to sterilize and keep clean!</li>
      <li>It is very easy to hold and quick to use.</li>
      <li>I tried other scrapers and picked this one as the best.</li>
      <li>that glides too easily rather than scrapping a goo off.</li>
      <li>bent and easily broke before i threw it away.</li>
      <li>but this is fine.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>So cheap and does the job.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really comfortable</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ergonomic because it&#x27;s super light, and easy to use so puts no strain on either hand or mouth.</li>
      <li>Regular cleaning of the tongue cleaner is easy by applying tooth paste to the tongue scraper and rubbing it between your fingers then a good rise.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I found this one on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I then ordered Dr. Tung&#x27;s stainless steel tongue cleaner, which is a far superior product for just a coulple of dollars more.  </li>
      <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s the right price for a tongue cleaner, and it&#x27;s easy to clean/rinse.</li>
      <li>Bought a whole lot more to give as gifts to family.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a must-have for keeping your tongue clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s all stainless steel, this product is easy to keep clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny I paid for it and more, although it is reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>The scraping edge is more effective than any other scraper I have tried and I have tried three types.</li>
      <li>If they had actually sent what the picture one looks like i would have liked it.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my dinacharya practice and am amazed at how useful it is.</li>
      <li>This was worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Made of stainless steel, it neither rusts nor breaks, and rinses clean under the faucet.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve never used a tongue scraper before, go easy  at first and only scrape lightly and only a couple of times then rinse with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>and after I bought the first one I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store I had purchased it in,</li>
      <li>This is exactly what you think it is, a tongue cleaner</li>
      <li>and I knew exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Sometimes I put it through the dishwasher to expose it to some germ killing hot water..</li>
      <li>My mouth feels a lot fresher since &amp; I would definitely purchase more or as gift&#x27;s for others.</li>
      <li>devise really makes a world of difference first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes a new tongue scraper will have too much of an edge to which I use a fine grit sand paper to ease the edge a bit.</li>
      <li>Most of all, it removes the white film on your tongue easily and well, and gives you total control over the pressure and the angle.</li>
      <li>The plastic ones are more expensive and don&#x27;t do as good of a job.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if I would like it but upon using it just once it made my mouth feel so much cleaner than just simple brushing.</li>
      <li>First this shipped to me fast &amp; before time.</li>
      <li>It also has ends which are not polished or smooth and may scratch your hand if not careful.</li>
      <li>So at only $2.24 right now, it&#x27;s silly not to buy it if you don&#x27;t already own a good one.</li>
      <li>What can you say about a stainless steel tongue cleaner?</li>
      <li>This is a very helpful tool that helps me remove unwanted debris and measure to what extent I am or am not digesting my food.</li>
      <li>I gave them two stars because they feel like stainless steel and arrived on time.</li>
      <li>and it does that job very well.</li>
      <li>I DON&#x27;T THINK IT IS STAINLESS STEEL</li>
      <li>As for me, I prefer the Tongue Sweeper Model P Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner.</li>
      <li>Quality is better than expected.  </li>
      <li>I expected a more substantial item</li>
      <li>The cleaner arrived with two rust spots on it, so I don&#x27;t believe it is stainless steel.  </li>
      <li>This is basic and effective and a year later I am still using it.</li>
      <li>This item is my first and was not aware this was available.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying and using regularly ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lightweight, no bulky add ons getting in the way or making it harder to clean.</li>
      <li>Item was smaller than expected, however it cleans the tongue very well and is easily useable either one-handed or two.</li>
      <li>This is the only thing that actually gets my tongue clean.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous little tool.</li>
      <li>This thing gets way back to the back of your tongue where other scrapers were much to big to go far back in your mouth, so there is no spot on your tongue that you can&#x27;t scrape &amp; clean &amp; I just love this thing.</li>
      <li>In fact the oldest one I have is over 30 years old.</li>
      <li>These really do seem to last forever.</li>
      <li>but I developed a zit like bump on the side of my lips.</li>
      <li>This tongue cleaner gets all the white gunk off your tongue, as far back as you can stand to go, and it rinses right off under the faucet.</li>
      <li>This tongue scraper is the last step to a clean mouth and definitely the last step to getting rid of my oppressive, paint-peeling morning breath.  </li>

<li> Just be careful not to scrape too hard!</li>
<li> The only thing that can go wrong is if you lose it.</li>

<li> That part which cleans the tongue is too small for adults.</li>

<li> It comes with a hard plastic on the ends so that it is easier to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It scrapes the goop off my tongue.!</li>
    <li> The material is too thin, so it bends, and it is not nice to handle since it bends easily. I would pay more for a thicker one.</li>
    <li> I have three of these tongue cleaners. One for home,one for work, one for traveling on the road.&lt;br /&gt;These tongue cleaners will last a life time. In fact the oldest one I have is over 30 years old.The only thing that can go wrong is if you lose it. It cleans your tongue way better than a tooth brush. Experts say that much of bad breath actually comes from the tongue because of its surface area.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used a tongue scraper before, go easy  at first and only scrape lightly and only a couple of times then rinse with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;This devise really makes a world of difference first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes a new tongue scraper will have too much of an edge to which I use a fine grit sand paper to ease the edge a bit. Regular cleaning of the tongue cleaner is easy by applying tooth paste to the tongue scraper and rubbing it between your fingers then a good rise. Sometimes I put it through the dishwasher to expose it to some germ killing hot water..</li>
    <li> Perhaps I have allergy to metal but I developed a zit like bump on the side of my lips. I cant say what caused that reaction.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t imagine not having one.  I&#x27;ve given them to all my close family members.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that actually gets my tongue clean.  Brushing my tongue alone, even with my sonicare, is insufficient.  Mouthwash and brushing is insufficient.  This tongue scraper is the last step to a clean mouth and definitely the last step to getting rid of my oppressive, paint-peeling morning breath.  It&#x27;s worth every penny I paid for it and more, although it is reasonably priced.  I recall it being more expensive when I paid for it--not including shipping it was around $6 or $7, I think.  So at only $2.24 right now, it&#x27;s silly not to buy it if you don&#x27;t already own a good one.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what you think it is, a tongue cleaner and it does that job very well. It is easy to use and easy to clean. It is much better than any plastic or rubber tongue cleaner that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> First this shipped to me fast &amp; before time. This is the best Tongue scraper that I have ever had &amp; the way it is made for some reason it is very easy to handle &amp; very easy to move around your mouth.

I will use this seller again &amp; again, because of very good &amp; speedy service. I am very very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Item was smaller than expected, however it cleans the tongue very well and is easily useable either one-handed or two. It comes with a hard plastic on the ends so that it is easier to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the plastic triangle tongue scrapers before (like the ones you&#x27;d find at walmart), but I found this much more effective in cleaning than the plastic ones and it&#x27;s easy to sterilize and keep clean!</li>
    <li> I have been using this scraper for decades. I tried other scrapers and picked this one as the best. It has many Pros: It&#x27;s ergonomic because it&#x27;s super light, and easy to use so puts no strain on either hand or mouth. It&#x27;s thin and FLEXIBLE, therefore one can have a deeper reach when one presses the ends towards each other, a wider coverage, when one spreads them apart slightly during usage. Made of stainless steel, it neither rusts nor breaks, and rinses clean under the faucet. Most of all, it removes the white film on your tongue easily and well, and gives you total control over the pressure and the angle. It is not bulky in your mouth so does not make you gag. Only minor Con: you need to use both hands.    I gave it to friends and family when they talked about their dentist wanting them to use a tongue scraper. Mine was glad I was already using one. It contributes greatly to mouth hygiene in keeping one&#x27;s breath clean. My husband and my son use it twice daily. For the price, it is the best and most durable tongue scraper. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> These finally arrived today 2/7/2012, date on order sheet was 12/13/11.  Probably sloppy packaging, it was sent to me via USPO  Mail Recovery Center.</li>
    <li> My fiance loves these!! I didn&#x27;t love them, I thought they looked cheep, but I put them in his stocking at Christmas anyway.  I was trying to find a better alternative to the plastic tongue sweepers that my fiance used. I saw a neat little set up of a stainless steel sweeper in a little travel case at work one day (around the sink after lunch). Through all my searches, I couldn&#x27;t find what I had seen at work, but this product was the closest. He has one for home and one for travel, LOVES it.  He tells all the guys at work that they need to get one or two.  I boil them once a month to sanitize them.  As for me, I prefer the Tongue Sweeper Model P Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner.</li>
    <li> too sharp found my tongue bleeding from using this,I used it once and its put away somewhere.  will stick to targets plastic brand.</li>
    <li> This is basic and effective and a year later I am still using it. I expected a more substantial item but this is fine.It is better than plastic and not as good as silver.</li>
    <li> This item is my first and was not aware this was available.  I like the function of it.  I sense a cleaner feeling in my mouth.  This was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> That part which cleans the tongue is too small for adults. Also it doesn&#x27;t clean well. I won&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fabulous little tool. I bought it for my dinacharya practice and am amazed at how useful it is. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if I would like it but upon using it just once it made my mouth feel so much cleaner than just simple brushing. Definitely worth buying and using regularly ... especially if you are a practitioner of yoga or Ayurveda!</li>
    <li> I already had one. Had one for over 7 years now. Bought a whole lot more to give as gifts to family. There were some black discoloration initially, but they wash off.</li>
    <li> The cleaner arrived with two rust spots on it, so I don&#x27;t believe it is stainless steel.  The metal is very thin and narrow.  It works with extra effort but the cleaning edges are a bit too sharp.  I then ordered Dr. Tung&#x27;s stainless steel tongue cleaner, which is a far superior product for just a coulple of dollars more.  I would not reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> IT HAS A METALIC TASTE TO IT...I DON&#x27;T THINK IT IS STAINLESS STEEL&lt;br /&gt;ALSO IT WAS DIRTY, IT HAD SOME TYPE OF BROWN THING ON THE SIDE&lt;br /&gt;OF THE SCRAPER, CLEANED IT OFF AND IT CAME OUT....WAS THIS USED?</li>
    <li> sharp end tips, and sharp blade. rusted within a week of use. bent and easily broke before i threw it away.</li>
    <li> great seller, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These really do seem to last forever. I&#x27;ve got two, one being stored away as a replacement, and it&#x27;s been in storage for at least 20 years. This tongue cleaner gets all the white gunk off your tongue, as far back as you can stand to go, and it rinses right off under the faucet. The design allows it to hang from a toothbrush holder, or towel rack, which is what mine hangs from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight, no bulky add ons getting in the way or making it harder to clean. It&#x27;s a must-have for keeping your tongue clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This is a very helpful tool that helps me remove unwanted debris and measure to what extent I am or am not digesting my food.</li>
    <li> Sensible design, and does what it should. I think it&#x27;s the right price for a tongue cleaner, and it&#x27;s easy to clean/rinse.</li>
    <li> I like it but it came very late. There are small plastic handles on it. It is very easy to hold and quick to use. The scraping edge is more effective than any other scraper I have tried and I have tried three types.</li>
    <li> received on time and item is as expected thank you!</li>
    <li> What can you say about a stainless steel tongue cleaner? Gotta love &#x27;em! Why do folks in India think these things are Bazaar?</li>
    <li> This scraper is a must-have for everyone.  I&#x27;ve been using tongue scrapers for years.  The plastic ones are more expensive and don&#x27;t do as good of a job.  Plus the bacteria accumulates on the crevices of the plastic, so they need to be changed out every couple of months.  I was so excited when I found this one on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve had it for a year and a half now and it hasn&#x27;t changed one bit.  So cheap and does the job.  Just be careful not to scrape too hard!</li>
    <li> I love this Bra! It is the second one I have and it&#x27;s really comfortable and after I bought the first one I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store I had purchased it in, but I found it on here and for much better price ! Now I want another!</li>
    <li> I agree with Harsh. Picture is what I wanted but they have different product and I don&#x27;t like a bit. It has very small narrow bandwidth of cleaning section and edge is too thick and smooth that glides too easily rather than scrapping a goo off. I have been using tongue scrappers/cleaners for 55 years and I knew exactly what I wanted and that is what they have in picture. I feel betrayed since I ordered them for my entire family. It also has ends which are not polished or smooth and may scratch your hand if not careful. I gave them two stars because they feel like stainless steel and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Well made and will probably last forever.  Great price.  Whether it does all that people claim it does, I can&#x27;t comment yet as I have only used it daily for about 3 weeks.  However, my mouth does feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> Hard to find item.  Quality is better than expected.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Since it&#x27;s all stainless steel, this product is easy to keep clean. The Dr. Tung&#x27;s version has rubber which gets a bit mangy over the years. To use this product effectively, you have to push the two prongs inward. But I&#x27;ve become used to it, so there&#x27;s no problem.</li>
    <li> Picture is way different than the actual product itself. If they had actually sent what the picture one looks like i would have liked it.</li>
    <li> it takes off the nasty white stuff that develops on your tongue...just wish it took off even more than what it does.</li>
