      <li>It smells like fresh peaches and feels smooth too.</li>
      <li>greasy!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is unique, but distinctly peach.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to be a super fancy lotion.</li>
      <li>so I figured it might be small, but it was actually a very good size.</li>
      <li>Container is a little smaller than I would have liked, but this is a good hand cream with adorable packaging.</li>
      <li>but i definitely will be buying more when i run out!</li>
      <li>The scent, like other reviewers had mentioned, smelled really pleasant and a bit tangy like peach soda.</li>

      <li>And this little hand cream comes in handy for that.</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as much lotion as it looks, so I&#x27;m using it sparingly.</li>

      <li>INSTANTLY AND FEELS SILKY SMOOTH:</li>
      <li>aoooooo much.</li>

      <li>its smooth and not to harsh.</li>
      <li>My hands stay soft all day -- even after washing dishes.  </li>
      <li>and it leaves my hand supper soft</li>
      <li>It really do mell like white peach.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super duper uber amazing, just like a basic hand lotion, so I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s worth repurchasing for such a small amount.</li>
      <li>&amp; it doesn&#x27;t take much to rid yourself of dry skin.</li>

    <li> Tiny jar.  Great hand cream.  Nice sweet scent.  I brought it to work, and all the women loved it, but kept remarking that the jar looked like a breast.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how big it was going to be so I figured it might be small, but it was actually a very good size. It&#x27;s beautiful looking, and just completely adorable. The lotion smells very good also, it has the scent of a peach smoothie. It also came with an extra little gift and that was so sweet &amp;#60;3 I would definitely buy more, and definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I live in a very cold region of the US, and the weather is not kind to my skin. This cream is thick and smells like real peach. The fragrance does not smell fake or perfume-y at all! My hands feel so soft, and the packaging is just too adorable. Definitely a conversation piece! You will not regret buying this hand cream... I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Well, more like juicy peaches but I love it. Container is a little smaller than I would have liked, but this is a good hand cream with adorable packaging.</li>
    <li> i love this product it smells great and it leaves my hand supper soft i would defiantly buy this product again.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME THIS GOD. SURELY, I WILL CONTACT YOU AGAIN. ALL OK</li>
    <li> it was a christmas give for my sister and she loves it! it smells so good. it easy to carry around at well</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom. The shipping was a little pricey in my opinion, but I&#x27;m glad I did purchase it. Shipping was decent. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong ,but is very nice. It&#x27;s very smooth and light and bot heavy.</li>
    <li> really cute and smells SO GOOOODDDD</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a soft scent and the entire case is adorable; that&#x27;s the reason I bought it. but i definitely will be buying more when i run out!</li>
    <li> At first sniff it smells good but then when I applied some on my hands the smell seemed to have transformed into this very synthetic, plastic like, fake apricot scent. It was so horrible that I had to wash my hands.  Cute packaging although not the most hygienic.</li>
    <li> love this lotion, smells so good.  case is super cute, but bulky. Great gift.  Don&#x27;t expect it to be a super fancy lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream, it smells great, it makes my hands soft, and the packaging is way cute. The only problem is, is that it is a pretty small package. It&#x27;s not super duper uber amazing, just like a basic hand lotion, so I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s worth repurchasing for such a small amount. Great product though!</li>
    <li> i love the scent of this lotion. its smooth and not to harsh. my mother love it im definitely going to order another one soon :)</li>
    <li> It smells delicious, just like peach smoothie. I got mine way before the estimated delivery date (it was scheduled to arrive August 1st-26th) and it arrived somewhere in late July. It also works very well and you only need to apply a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> Excellent... my girlfriend like it very much.</li>
    <li> It is smaller than i expected but it smells just like peach! And the package is so cuteeee! You must buy it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. The scent, like other reviewers had mentioned, smelled really pleasant and a bit tangy like peach soda. Mine did not come in any plastic/paper packaging. If it is being given as a gift I suggest you tell them that it is specifically for their hands. My mom applied it to her face for a while and one day complained that it made her complexion look dark (haha). Anyways, now that she knows she really likes it. I tried it too and it did noticeably make my hand a lot softer, not unlike normal lotion. It is small, think tennis ball small, but you really are paying for the unique qualities. I thought it was well worth it and will probably buy again. Oh and the date on the bottom should be the manufacture date not expiration.</li>
    <li> the hand cream has a super cute shape, also love the peach flavor～smells so good! love it love it !Recommend~</li>
    <li> As if the cute jar and fresh peach scent weren&#x27;t enough, this cream actually works.  My hands stay soft all day -- even after washing dishes.  The cream absorbs quickly and completely, with no waxy film or greasy palms. This is a gradual improver that produces naturally-soft results.  Will definitely keep using for as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely [not too overpowering but light and peachy, the packaging is adorable and my hands feel nice after applying. The scent lingers for a while after you apply it which is nice because I loooove the smell. The cream is very thick and rich so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bought it b/c a friend recommended but it didn&#x27;t turn as expected in terms of quality. Also  the price is higher than the average of the other wellknown brands. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Really your hands feel softer after applying... and with regular use I notice the fine wrinkles on my hand have lessened.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fragrance :)</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizing lotion. Cute packaging. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This is a very good smelling and moisturizing handcreme. The packaging is very originell. You only need a small amount and it penetrates quickly into your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for my mom as a birthday gift because she loves peaches.&lt;br /&gt;It smelt exactly like real peaches and left your hands super soft and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;I have other tonymoly products and this one is just as nice.Even when the lotion runs out you can just use the cute container and that&#x27;s the best part haha.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to moisturize well, but it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time.</li>
    <li> SMELLS AWESOME LIKE PEACH BUBBLEGUM! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABSORBS INSTANTLY AND FEELS SILKY SMOOTH:D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS HAND CREAM :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WISH IT WAS AVAIL IN A BIGGER CONTAINER!!</li>
    <li> Feels great too! I love this product and tony moly in general. Just wish it was a little bigger container.</li>
    <li> I got one for myself and my best friend. We hate feeling dry when we are out. And this little hand cream comes in handy for that. Also it smells really nice, so that&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely manner and the quality is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t have as much lotion as it looks, so I&#x27;m using it sparingly.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very smooth and the scent smells really nice. Could smell the sweet peach scent. feels nice on my hand too.</li>
    <li> Smells like peach. I bought two. One for me and one for my friend &#x27;a birthday gift. She loves it and I love it aoooooo much. I only use for my hand. I will buy it again. Took a long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream! It smells just like fresh peaches and the container is just too cute. You should get this too!</li>
    <li> i love the smell and texture of the cream. one thing i don&#x27;t like it is kind of pricy. that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> i love how it smells and how its shaped. Only used it once and it makes my hand feel softer already</li>
    <li> I bought several for my friends and myself, everybody loves it!  It makes the skin smooth, not oily and smells so....good!!!</li>
    <li> This is another Tonymoly product I bought for the packaging &amp; ended up loving it. The scent is amazing (it smells practically edible!) &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take much to rid yourself of dry skin.</li>
    <li> other that the adorable container, this lotion smells just like peach milk tea. mmmm</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Not sticky and moisturizes well. Took a long time to get shipped though. Also overpriced for what they actually sell it for in Asia.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this just cause it&#x27;s cute and I love peaches but the lotion is actually amazing. First off the smell alone will make you want to use it, it has the fragrance of the yummiest peach candy you could dream of. Second the lotion actually makes me hands feel soft and smoother and look brighter. Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> Everyone I shared this with loves the smell.  It really do mell like white peach.  And my hands love them too</li>
    <li> It smells like fresh peaches and feels smooth too. If you like a strong peach scent, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> So moisturizing and so peachy!! The smell is to die for!!! It&#x27;s not your ordinary lotion either. It gives you a lot of moisture without feeling sticky. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> The cream is nicely thick, and moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is unique, but distinctly peach.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is so cute!&lt;br /&gt;Its perfect!</li>
