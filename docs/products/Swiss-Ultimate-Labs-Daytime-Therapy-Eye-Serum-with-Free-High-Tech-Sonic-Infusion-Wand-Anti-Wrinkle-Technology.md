      <li>I must be the first male to review this product.  </li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s in a long, narrow tube, it also stores nicely in my bathroom caddy.</li>
      <li>I have been using this daily since November and really like it.</li>
      <li>am a young woman in my 30&#x27;s</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Really love this product and will be ordering more. I use the applicator and it&#x27;s great for reducing the &amp;#34;puffy under eye&amp;#34; area. Also, avoids tugging on the delicate area under the eyes. They serum works great. Very happy with the diminished fine lines &amp; wrinkles. There are so many products out there- it can be overwhelming. This one works!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference in diminishing wrinkles, which is why I bought the product.  I gave it a 1-star rating because the cream was still useful  as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily since November and really like it. The dispensed amount is perfect for both eyes. It&#x27;s part of my morning make-up routine, step one. It does not adversely effect my eye makeup in any way. It&#x27;s a great day cream and I will order again.</li>
    <li> Only product that helps my dropping lids and I have tried everything.  In the before and after life only one day and one treatment has passed.  I love this cream</li>
    <li> Well it came not sealed,cover was cracked label sticker was on inside.Still waiting to notice difference. ..do see wen I put on under eyes,then wash off...I get dried up again uhgggggg</li>
    <li> This is my second tube. It really does blur the lines. It makes a nice easy to use addition to my daily routine. Delivery system is great. I do wish you could see how much is left, It lasts for at least 2-3 months if not longer.</li>
    <li> I loved the nighttime  eye serum so much that I would give the day serum a try. It fulfills its promise..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 10 days now, and I have definitely noticed an improvement of fine lines around my eyes. The serum comes in a really nice tube that dispenses just the right amount that you need. The serum is creamy and is unscented. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have found this serum to be a perfect serum for my very delicate and sensitive eyelids.  I think it is a good lubricant and have had no adverse reactions at all.  My skin is smooth and unwrinkled. I use it morning and night for excellent results.</li>
    <li> I have seen a softening of my crows feet after applying the serum in the morning the last three days. I will keep using it for the recommended 27 days to see how far this serum will go in erasing these lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. I like the measured syringe-like dispenser. It dispenses enough for under both eyes and more. Included in the packaging is a way to measure your wrinkle-erasing &amp;#34;progress&amp;#34; with pictures and good product instructions. I really appreciate this.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate how soft and smoothing this is. I&#x27;ve been using it on the skin under my eyes and it makes my skin so much softer. I think it&#x27;s really helped with smoothing out and softening that skin. I also like how it has no smell, no color, and no odor. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and was afraid this might have an odor but it doesn&#x27;t at all. It also comes in a unique and handy dispenser. It dispenses just the amount I need so there&#x27;s no guesswork on how much I should use for each application. Because it&#x27;s in a long, narrow tube, it also stores nicely in my bathroom caddy. All in all, I really like it!</li>
    <li> This eye serum is the best!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning after shower, and I see the difference. My crow feet under my eyes are almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;I am a young woman in my 30&#x27;s and I have a few wrinkles on my forehead and under my eyes. This eye serum works like magic. It does the job.&lt;br /&gt;I love this serum.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> I love how little you can use for results.  It comes right to your door, no lady pushing the deal, bc its so good and I don&#x27;t see any wrinkles like before!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2MOP40274DEI8]]I am living proof that the Swiss Ultimate Serums work. I will use these forever. I have seen a noticeable difference in the wrinkles under my eyes. And it&#x27;s so easy. I am committed though, and apply everyday. So glad I found this stuff!</li>
    <li> I must be the first male to review this product.  I got this for my nearly 40 year old better half.  Not because she has too many wrinkles, but because I wanted to get her something that would get her to stop complaining about aging.  The results are amazing!...not that she needed it, but it even has given her more confidence. She applies it and a few minutes later….I can see the difference. I highly recommend it. Definitely going to order more!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical because of the playfulness of the packaging, but after a month of use I&#x27;m a believer. This serum is wonderful as many others here have noted! The tube dispenses just enough, one pump for each eye, and after daily use there is definitely more visible firmness and smoothness. It&#x27;s supposed to be fragrance free but there is a slight scent, a very faint kind of floral/botanical which doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive nose. Best of all, my eyes are sensitive and I&#x27;ve had zero redness or stinging! I absolutely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I gave this a good try. Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in any of my problem areas. Was hoping for improvement in my crows feet and fine lines around my eyes. But nada. I did like the way it felt and it absorbed well. So I gave it 3 stars for that. I won&#x27;t buy it again though.</li>
    <li> I only used it few times but I liked it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
