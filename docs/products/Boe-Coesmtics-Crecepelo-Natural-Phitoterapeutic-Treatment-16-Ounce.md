<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Loved this product! Will order again!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Great for winter months and even summer.  Smells awesome.  I like to put some in my hair, let a little water get on it but don&#x27;t rinse all the way out, then comb through with my finger comb for natural hair det angling , add a little more conditioner, sit under dryer with plastic cap holding my hair up, rinse 20 to 30 minutes later then proceed with my Next steps.  Made my hair so much stronger and it&#x27;s growing in nicely.</li>
    <li> This product is great for relaxed or natural hair. I would recommend mostly for African American hair due to the conditioner being so heavy. Does not weigh my hair down at all. As far as growth, I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 mos so, I can&#x27;t tell yet. Will update soon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! It leaves the hair smooth like butter and the longer it sets the better.Dominicans include treatments with their products not just leave in conditioners. This is a treatment that should be used after the shampoo. What this does it deep condtions the hair to make the detangling,combing out process easier after the shampoo which if your growing your hair long this is right in your alley becuase this will assist you to have less hair \\&quot;breakage\\&quot; (not shedding there&#x27;s a difference)! This is why the product is named Crece Pelo&#x3D;Hair Growth. If you have \\&quot;Afro-textured\\&quot; hair do not be afraid to use this product. Dominicans have a varity of hair textures and their hair products are reflective of this. Think of this product as a training wheel to help the detangling process!</li>
    <li> Loved this item will purchase again, my hair is growing and is shinny, I will try other produce make by them</li>
    <li> I read great reviews on this product but It just didn&#x27;t work well for my coarse natural hair. I will try in the near future maybe my hair will love it by then. But, it&#x27;s always great to try products for yourself no matter what the reviews are like because everyone hair is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update I tried the product today after using a clarifying shampoo and product worked great. I have coarse natural hair and this really made my texture a lot softer. 12/29/13</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff! It really does give the hair moisture. I mean my hair is soft and hydrated after I use this. The smell is very nice and the consistency is THICK which I love. I will always keep this product on hand and use as a weekly deep conditioner. My hair smells so pretty after I flat iron and even into the next two to three days. Just try it and watch the love affair began.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this is the same&lt;br /&gt;Formula from&lt;br /&gt;Before that left my hair so conditioned. It&#x27;s cool if you need to comb out your hair.</li>
    <li> Had to return conditioner as the ingredients listed on jar was quite different from what was listed on Amazon.  On Amazon the ingredients listed were all natural.  The jar I received had too many questionable ingredients that were not natural, so based on those ingredients I had to return without trying.</li>
    <li> It has a perfume scent, but it is nice and heavy. Great for detangling 4b African American hair. I&#x27;ve also noticed less breakage when using this. I took some very old kinky twists down after about 2.5 months and all I had was hair shedding, not a bunch of strands all over my floor. Before that my hair was breaking like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this alone or as an ingredient in my homemade deep conditioner (combine a tbs of crece pelo with 2-3 indian herbal powders (shakaki, cassia obogata, bhrami, etc.), a tablespoon of shea moisture deep conditioner, and 2-3 oils (e.g. castor, jojoba, amla, etc.) aloe vera juice and distilled water. If this is too much prep work for you, just use by itself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to purchase another bottle of this. My hair is extremely dry, and this makes my hair boucy and full of life! I LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> Very nice conditioner and love the price at Amazon</li>
    <li> Crecepelo Tratamiento Fitoterapeutico Natural Phitoterapeutic Treatment is in my top three best dominican hair treatments. I really do luv  Crecepelo hair care line. Its all over u tube for the best and most favorite Dominican hair care product available. I know Silicon Mix is the most popular Dominican hair treatment on the market. Where ever I go to  purchase Silicon Mix, there is always Crecepelo right next to it. Some people prefer it over Silicon mix. It makes the hair grow a lot faster than other treatments. Your hair stops breaking off and is silky, and soft to the touch. It stimulates the scalp to produce speedy hair growth. While your hair is growing, it protects your hair from being damaged. If your hair is overly dry-damaged, breaking, unmanageable and takes forever to grow, Crecepelo is the right Dominican hair treatment for you. I only purchase the largest size. I use plenty of it on my now.... fast growing, thick, long past the middle of my back, hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment I can\\&quot;t live without. For best results, use the shampoo, treatment, rinse, leave-in. The entire line is the best way to go. Purchase the largest size for best value. As soon as you start using it, others will want to tap into your supply, so, stock -up.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product, smells amazing and it works!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product for years. I am always amazed by the results which is immediately seen in my hair. I put the creme in my hair while using a plastic heat cap for a deep condition. I wash out my hair after an hour. This strengthens my hair and promotes growth.</li>
    <li> Great product, jus wish came in bigger size.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I like the consistency.  It is a nice, thick deep treatment.  My hair is fine, naturally curly, and damaged by bleach.  My hair seems to like this product.  I would repurchase.  I also had no problems with this seller.</li>
    <li> Be warned - ingredient list does include  PEG-12 Dimethicone (which is a water soluble silicon), Glycerin, and Silk Proteins.  These aren&#x27;t listed on the ingredients list on the site and those who do not want silicons and sulfates should be wary.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deep conditioner!!!! I have to get some more! It&#x27;s incredible &amp; leaves hair soo soft 🙌</li>
    <li> the best product for hair i have ever seen. honestly, it is 100% natural, it makes not only the hair grow, but make it healthy. no words to describe how happy i am with it!</li>
    <li> I boutgh this just to try becaus all reviews that i read were 5 stars, and i proved it , this item is amazing, since the first day that i used it i could feel the difference and Im doing my new order now, because i really feel great with this, my hair is healthy,  long , and the smell is so good</li>
    <li> Thick and I love how it helps deep condition my hair. Will purchase again, I like this and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months regularly</li>
    <li> This gave my hair a little bit of moisture and slip, but nothing to write home about. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again. It is nothing compared to Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle Moist.</li>
    <li> I really, really, really, really, like this stuff. It has a good slip and it make my hair feel soft. The bonus is it cause my hair natural coil but I get shrinkage.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. The smell is lovely! I just don&#x27;t understand the reviews about the smell being loud. Well to each it&#x27;s own. And it makes our hair feel nice.</li>
    <li> I am not new to using dominican hair products, I&#x27;ve been using them for about 15 years. I used them when my hair was relaxed and they did wonders. I am currently natural and I am 3c/4a combo. I decided to try this brand because of all the reviews. It is amazing. I usually use the Salerm wheat germ treatment but this rivals that. It&#x27;s been 4 weeks since I started using it with my hair steamer and it&#x27;s helped stopped the shedding jaws suffering from. I was experiencing some shedding out of the blue. I could touch my hair and strands would fall. Not anymore!!! A little goes a long way so I&#x27;m almost 1/2 done with the 16oz jar and I have abnormally thick hair !</li>
    <li> It made my hair so soft and detangle easy. As for my daugther hair manageable easy to get finger detangle</li>
    <li> My husband is the owner of this account and I am very disappointed in this product. I only give it a 1 because of the pretty green jar. This stuff has  stearyl alcohol, isopropyl Myristate, propyle glycol, peg 12 dimethicone,  hydrolyzed silk, parfum panthenol, glycerin, poly quater nium 11, quaternion 80, DMDM hydantoin, citric acid, dis sodium edta, Behentrimonium methylsulfate.  These are ingredients that were never listed on the list of ingredients on your very own site. If these had been mentioned, I would have never purchased two jars of this product, this was very deceitful of you all. Even though you are not the manufacturer, the reproach is on you in the customers eyes.  You&#x27;re advertising this product under false pretense. I suggest that you all converse with the company and get this resolved. Your information is very misleading to people like myself who are looking for products that are not harmful to our hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product! My hair loves it.</li>
    <li> My hair loved this product. Reduced hair breakage, helped with growth and made my hair so soft after each application.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I stopped using this. It&#x27;s the best deep conditioner ever. The conditioner is thick and creamy, great for thick or course hair. The smell is floral in scent but its not very over powering. When I used this consistently my hair was very healthy and long.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered the Kanechom deep conditioner (Youtube referral), and this was the product that was introduced to come along with it.  I am grateful that I have this product.  It is soothing to the scalp and silk on my hair and, although, I do not co-wash daily, I co-washed with this product, and it smells A M A Z I N G!  I will co-wash with this weekly to give my hair a treat (normally it&#x27;s bi-weekly).  The moment I put this on my hair, it defined my 2b African American waves, and I didn&#x27;t want to take it off.  It left my hair very soft, and tangle free.  By the way, for some reason I used this before the Kanechom just because of the smell.  I&#x27;m rating Kanechom next....hmmm....</li>
    <li> I love the smell and this product makes my hair super soft and super defined. My hair loves it!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful conditioner it provided  my hair with so much moisture. I used it before a blow out and it came out fabulous!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell whether my growth is due to  Crecepelo alone, as I alternate it with another deep conditioning treatment.  I can surely attest that my hair is certainly softer and more manageable after each use</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling soft &amp; shiny! The smell is amazing.. It also lingers after you wash the product out. Can&#x27;t wait to see the growth!!!</li>
    <li> I saw this item in my local beauty store and decided to try it - best decision I ever made! It has conditioned and grown my hair so much. Afterwards, I bought the shampoo, rinse and conditioner. These products don&#x27;t fool around-they deliver! I don&#x27;t intend to run out - will order more. Amazon, please don&#x27;t ever discontinue these products- I&#x27;d cry if you do!</li>
    <li> I use this conditoner as a deep conditioner for my natural hair.  I like to wear a conditioning cap, and sit under the dryer for 15 minutes. Crece Pelo makes my hair soft and moisturized.  I get wonderful results for wash and go style. I did notice that the ingredients on the jar was not the same as the container that I saw at the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair soft and manageable however i have to use a few more times before i can tell whether my hair cares for it! Natural 4C Kinky Coily Hair!</li>
    <li> Great for light detangling, however left a film in my hair and did nothing for my curly hair - would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and is amazing for my naturally curly hair. I&#x27;m African American and I am finding that dominican hair products work better for my hair than AA hair products. I had to use it more than once and after I used it the second time I fell in love. It didn&#x27;t have much slip though because the consistency is extremely thick but detangling wasn&#x27;t bad. It left my hair feeling like silk. I am IN LOVE !!! I plan to keep purchasing this product. I have even started to mix it with another deep conditioner and I have been experiencing nothing but strong, healthy, thriving moisturized hair.</li>
    <li> The best treatment that I ever used</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the shampoo, rinse, and leave in and just love it! In May of 2011 my hair was short but without paying attention, I noticed that I had problems reaching the ends until it hit me! My hair was already passed the back of my neck already down to the shoulders. WOW!! My kids and my friend has also noticed the growth and are now using the products also which has left me without and now purchasing again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fantastic, and the texture of my hair has improved. It barely breaks or falls which is great!I am completely satisfied! Thanks!</li>
    <li> My mouth is open, because this product really work. My hair is growing in little bit time. Using together with the drops are fabulous.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product. It helps hair grow and leaves it super soft and smelling great! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on in the Dominican Republic, but this hair conditioner is on point.  By itself, it&#x27;s a good conditioner, but I mix it with the Silicon Mix conditioner and my hair was banging.  My natural (African American) 3C hair felt and looked like satin after a blow out.  My hair has never looked or felt like that in my entire life.  I was mesmerized.  It was a hair miracle.  I also used the Aztec Secret Indian Clay as a hair mask/shampoo.  This combo is everything.</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel like silk very fragrant though</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars because the 1st few times I used this it made my hair sort of hard &amp; a little dry but now that I&#x27;m almost 8 weeks post Ive been using it &amp; its kinda strange it doesnt make my hair hard or not even a little dry I dont know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m later in my relaxed stage or what? Its kinda weird. Anyway will still use it until its gone dont know if I will buy this again or not.</li>
    <li> Awesome thick great for my relaxed 4b hair. Softness and moisture last through the week. ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> I absolutely have fell in love with this conditioner!!!!!! There isn&#x27;t one thing that I don&#x27;t like about it, my favorite quality that it has that no other conditioner has that I have ever used is the consistency. I have 4c hair so I section my hair and apply the conditioner to each section. And typically conditioner  runs everywhere especially when I comb through my hair, but crece pelo is so thick that it didn&#x27;t drip from anywhere not even once. I am completely sold on this product it will forever be in  my hair routine. It smells great and makes my hair feel like cotton, I recommend everyone try this product at least once!</li>
    <li> Awesome treatment leaves hair soft silky and abundant hair feels awesome</li>
    <li> This product was heavy and very thick. (in a good way).It went on easily but did not leave a coating on my thick shoulder length relaxed hair. I left it on for 15 minutes under a plastic cap. Two of my kids complimented me on the smell of it but I prefer a lighter fragrance for my hair products. The good news for me was, once I rinsed it out, the smell didn&#x27;t linger much.&lt;br /&gt;This product is made of natural ingredients and comes with an expiration date. I&#x27;ll report back later with more of the long term results, and I would order again.</li>
    <li> This product is really great, I have tried other products and this one as a deep condtioner is great. Kept my hair straight for more than one day.</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner is okay. It&#x27;s not as fantastic as I thought it was going to be based on the reviews I read. The conditioner is creamy and thick with great slip. If I can find this product on the ground, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Must use with moisturizing conditioner afterwards-not too keen about buying from this seller again though.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes hair wonderfully!!! The best!! Will order again!!!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair soft and conditions well.....</li>
    <li> today was my first day using the product on me and my daughters&#x27; hair.  We&#x27;re African American with traces of Cuban in us.  My mother is black and my father is Cuban and black and we all have long hair that has different patterns. My hair is a thick wave pattern, my oldest daughter natural hair is a thick tight curl pattern, and my youngest is a loose curl pattern.  In addition, me and my oldest are transitioning from relaxed to natural, and all of our hair tends to get really dry and suck up moisture, so I&#x27;m constantly worrying and trying to protect our hair from severe tangles and damage.  So I&#x27;ve been on mission to find something healthy to help combat that.  Anyway I heard many great things on youtube about this product and decided to give it a try.  And I must say that I&#x27;m impressed.  Initially I was worried because our hair didn&#x27;t have that slippery smooth feel to it.  But once I began combing our hair, the comb glided right through it.  It is also very thick for hydration but doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  And it smells like a fragrance or perfume, which I love</li>
    <li> I tried the silicone mix and the silicone mix bambu from this same manufacturer. Did not care for the bambu and the original was just OK. but this Crescepelo is so far the BEST product i ever used; the smell is great and it met all my expectations. LOVE IT! I bouhgt this big jar after receiving the smaller one i bought a week before; i had to have more. Will definetly be buying more and more of this AMAZING product going forward. My thick, wave, hair looks so nourished and silky - i could never ask for anything better than this product! Dominican Republic rocks when it comes to hair care. Kuddos to them.</li>
    <li> This is a very popular Dominican Salon product. I was pleased with it, though it has a strong scent. Not an artificial scent, I guess its whatever natural product is in it. It smells like a green plant. It has a very thick rich consistency, I used it for the first time and it definitely adds moisture to my hair. This is a great detangler and allowed the blowdryer to slide through my hair easier. I usually use Kanekom and I think I like this one better. This product can also be mixed w/Silicon Mix brand. I flat ironed my hair, and my hair did not revert at all and my hair texture is 4B high porosity that just going outside it frizzes, so this really passed the test. I will buy again. Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOVE THIS SUFF!!!! I naturally have very,very,very dry,tight, kinky,curly mixed hair. African American and Puerto Rican mixed, hair so its a crazy mess to say the least!!! This is the best deep conditioner I have found to work for my hair. Its thick, creamy and very strong smelling like perfume, but after the results I got I didn&#x27;t mind about the smell.  It leaves it buttery soft and moisturized!!! I am so happy I found this because nothing else seemed to work for this nest on the top of my head!!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. I ran out so I had to buy some more. This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Really liked how it made my hair feel a good deep conditioner. Pleasant smell. Can&#x27;t say if it actually assist with haute growth because purchased at product junkie faze.  Lol</li>
    <li> I swear by Crecepelo! I am natural hair diva and this is my base conditioner for all my mixtures. It&#x27;s strong plant base conditoner and can be mixed with Olive Oil, Carrot Oil, Coconut oil etc! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> excellent hair product. It really leave the hair soft and very manageable and smells good and clean. I will do recommend this product specially for relaxed hair....good for all type of hair.</li>
    <li> This softened my hair and improved its pliability beyond what I expected for a first time use.  With the leave-in drops, my hair smelled good for days, remained soft for over a week, and the breakage I seemed to be experience was minimal.  It really seems to have sealed the cuticles.  Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I have been looking for something for hair growth and that doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard and brittle after use. This stuff works, it smells great and it leaves my hair feeling soft and looking healthy. I will not use any other conditioner except maybe a protein treatment every few weeks. My only complaint is that it is a little pricey compared to other conditioning agents but you get what you pay for and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this! It smells great, and leaves my hair feeling smooth, and sleek. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year, and just had to buy my second container.</li>
    <li> The whole CrecePelo line is fabulous for your hair.. and yes, it does seem to make it grow faster. This is an incredible treatment. If you hair is damaged and overprocessed, you shoudl try this. If you just want soft, manageable, NICE smelling hair, try this. I love how my roller sets come out after  I use this conditioner!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how manageable my hair is after using this product, I&#x27;m still would like to see hair growth.</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this product. I was a bit skeptical I have to admit. I have done endless google searches for a super thick, super creamy, heavy, almost sticky deep conditioner with no avail. My Natural, Virgin, Afro Textured hair (mostly 4c textures all throughout and a bit of 3c-4b) needs a super creamy, super thick conditioner that will coat and soak into the hair; and really stretch the tightly coiled ends. Eventually after watching several YouTube recommendations, I decided to give it a try. Let me tell YOUUUU, if you are not hip to the Creco Pelo, you better to get this stuff! My coarse, tangled freshly shampooed 4c hair was easily detangled in 2 paddle brush passes after slathering this on my hair. I mean I couldn&#x27;t believe it.No more tugging and fighting my hair. It decreased my normal routine by 3 hours! This is the conditioner I have been searching for for 5 years of being natural! This conditioner &amp;#34;laid my hair down&amp;#34;. Almost like a relaxer would flatten your hair it has the same creamy consistency. Now for someone with 4c hair this is a BIG DEAL. Even after 10 minutes under the dryer and rinsing out, my hair was still laid down this way and bouncy. I am hugely impressed. It really improved the condition of my hair. It has more elasticity, shine, and feels clean and moisturized without being heavy or weighed down. This is the first time I&#x27;ve only had to use ONE product to deep condition my hair. Usually I&#x27;m making concoctions, mixing, trying to find the perfect balance of moisture and protein. But this is it. I can&#x27;t wait to find more Dominican hair products and go to Dominican salons because La Dominicana&#x27;s get it! *I will say that after rinsing my hair felt a little stiff. But not dry. This could be because I did a protein treatment before using Crece Pelo, so it was protein overload. But it was quickly softened with a hydrating leave in conditioner. **Also it smells like soap. Like straight up soap. But the fragrance coming off my hair all day is clean fresh and floral...FYI</li>
    <li> Is part of the complete treatment to make your hair grow and stop the breakage of the same.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner and its a part of my bi-weekly regimen. It has a nice smell and a great slip. If your looking for something to help your hair growth, this is it.  Update. 7/15/13 It has been over a year since I first used this condish and I&#x27;m still loving it. People keep asking me what am I putting in my hair and I tell them a lil bit of this &amp; that. My hair is growing like crazy. I will continue to use this as part of my regimen.  2/11/17-I stopped using this condish about 2 years ago. I stopped because I was looking for something more organic. I think My hair is missing it I believe; I&#x27;ve been having a lot of shedding &amp; cant figure out why. My hair is still growing &amp; moisturized but I believe I need to incorporate this back in my regimen. Thinking about.</li>
    <li> I had heard so much about this product so I decided to give it a try it smells wonderful but it&#x27;s very strong so if you do not like strong smells in your hair this product is not for you. I have only used product twice and I have notice some growth with using it I would definitely recommend this product. There is a expiration date on product so you have to make sure to pay attention to That overall I give it two thumbs up by far one of the best leave in conditioners I have ever used!</li>
    <li> love how soft it makes my hair and it smells oh so good. i have coarse curly hair, and my curls were getting nappy and weakening, and this product has returned life to my curls so im very happy about that. would recommend this product to anyone. i have been applying this to my hair after shampooing, and leave it on for about an hour. i then wash it off and condition my hair.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this! I use it in my natural curly kinki hair. It is the best product I have tried for my hair type and so inexpensive. I love this! Sorry miss Jessie! I&#x27;m trading you for this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about Crecepelo and when I ordered it I was sent the wrong product.  I was able to contact the seller and within days I got the correct product and I got to keep the one they mistakenly sent!  I will definitely keep using this shop and this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent, excellent, excellent.</li>
    <li> This is a great deep conditioner!  It really strenghtens my type 4b natural hair and makes soft and very manageable!  I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars b/c its not all natural and it could use more slip, but it makes your hair so manageable that it doesn&#x27;t matter. Great product!</li>
