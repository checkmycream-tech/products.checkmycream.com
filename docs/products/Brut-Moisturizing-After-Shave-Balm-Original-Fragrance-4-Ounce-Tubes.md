    <li> The balm is mice, but the fragrance is too mild.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have found it to be just right for sensitive skin . . . no alcohol sting . . . and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The scent does not overwhelm and fades quickly to where the smeller has to be pretty near to you to appreciate the scent.  The women who have told me they love the scent, also give close hugs when they see me so they can appreciate the scent each time we meet.</li>
    <li> Fair price and prompt delivery on a product that is hard to find at the local stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizing balm, with the classic fragance that brings back memories of Braniff International and idyllic sunny afternoons.&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t forget... never get out of the boat.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this anywhere local and always end up buying a bunch of them at a time online. No alcohol, no burn, and quickly soothes razor rash. And the great smell of Brut!</li>
    <li> This aftershave balm is an excellent substitute for liquids that have an alcohol base.  It is soothing and refreshing,  without being oily or sticky.  Much better for your skin, especially if it&#x27;s tender, than liquid aftershaves.  The  price for four was very reasonable.  Would definitely recommend this product and buy it again.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this lotion. Alcohol free, came as described</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product on-line for my father for a year now.  He hasn&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores around our area.  He loves it!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, however, two of the four tubes were received damaged. I&#x27;m still waiting for the replacements!!  I sent a notice to the vendor, a couple of weeks ago, along with photos of the damaged goods. I haven&#x27;t  received a reply.</li>
    <li> This is my after shave lotion for 22 yrs&lt;br /&gt;Rite-aid and walgreens and walmart do not stock this item anymore.  I have to buy on line.</li>
    <li> Excellent, and hard-to-find.  Brut emailed to inform me that ths stuff is in production right now.  So there you go!</li>
    <li> This balm really works well with a nice aroma but they are hard to find in stores now. Do a search for prices though. The shipping can add up. Four packs are a better deal.</li>
    <li> Dh loves the brut after shave balm because it does not burn his skin. We buy it in bulk as we cannot find it anywhere but online.</li>
    <li> Does the job without drying out your face. The fragrance is pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
