<li> One of the few perfumes I am not allergic to.</li>
<li> Gloria Vanderbilt perfume must be going by the wayside because there are very few stores that I can find it in my hometown.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s really not very strong, but thats a edt for you.  </li>
<li> Very confusing.</li>
<li> But I prefer the lotion and the dusting powder (which is way too expensive and too hard to find.)</li>
<li> I am disappointed that I order perfume and got toilette.  </li>

    <li> Lovely classic fragrance. Not at all overpowering like Juicy Couture or whatever it is and the others just like it. Thank heavens for the older scents!!</li>
    <li> this perfume is a unique scent .. the price is great ... and worth every cent..this perfume is a little acceint but worth it..</li>
    <li> Excellent price, excellent product, excellent delivery.  Gloria Vanderbilt perfume must be going by the wayside because there are very few stores that I can find it in my hometown.  This site is a wonderful place for me to buy my perfume.  Everyone knows me by this scent, including my grandkids.  My grandson must have smelled someone else wearing Gloria Vanderbilt because he told his Mom....&amp;#34;I smelled Grandma!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Given as a gift 20 years ago and have never changed!  Always get compliments</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this scent for 30 years; wish I could buy it in a store. But I prefer the lotion and the dusting powder (which is way too expensive and too hard to find.)</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that I order perfume and got toilette.  But since I can&#x27;t find the perfume I will be happy with this.</li>
    <li> Was happy with the purchase. Thank you</li>
    <li> My mom loves her Gloria Vanderbilt perfune and accompanying lotion. She loves the fragrance, and so do the grandkids when they get her hugs. It was the perfect gift for mother&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> I like the scent.  My mother used to use this and it brings back old memories.  It&#x27;s really not very strong, but thats a edt for you.  I wasen&#x27;t paying attention to the way it was presented.  They did not put Eau De Cologne on the label.  If they had done that, I wouldn;t have bought it.  Pretty tricky advertising.</li>
    <li> Delightful.. One of the few perfumes I am not allergic to. Elegant, but sweet.</li>
    <li> Really good product and fast service</li>
    <li> This product arrived in time for Christmas. No problems with packaging. Price was just right. THanks for a wonderful new year!</li>
    <li> Long-lasting evening fragrance that suits any occasion. I like Vanderbilt for the length and softness of smell.  However, a man did run across a college campus years ago just to smell me.  Feels great!</li>
    <li> This was shown as \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; but it is really eau de toilette. Beware that it is labeled EDT and perfume. Very confusing.</li>
    <li> Great buy and it was shipped for free immediately.  Thank you.</li>
