      <li>If your guy with cracked fingers is unsure, then give him a nice hand massage with it before he goes to sleep, and he&#x27;ll be hooked...</li>
      <li>love love love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>this is a huge tub of shea!  </li>
      <li>when I used this on most my body it gave me a headache.</li>
      <li>I love scooping rather than squeezing.  </li>
      <li>I love this body butter.</li>
      <li>now.the whipped lotion is great too,not real greasy like a lot of body lotions out there.</li>
      <li>The name &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; is appropriate.</li>
      <li>Feels fabulous!</li>
      <li>Much better than lotion or oil.</li>
      <li>I love the Body Shop&#x27;s Shea Body Butter.  </li>
      <li>I am so in love with this body butter.</li>
      <li>Love this product and I never knew this size existed.</li>
      <li>:)   </li>
      <li>I am allergic to so many ingredients that are in most creams and this one is fine for me.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I realized I made a mistake when looking for the Brazil Nut body butter and got this (which I quickly gave away to avoid the hassle of retuning which...</li>
      <li>This is awesome for extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>so they get smooth again, which feels better for him and his woman appreciates too :)   </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s fantastic on the feet too.  </li>
      <li>it smells great, very simple and not too overpowering and moisturizes like a charm</li>
      <li>So smooth and</li>
      <li>and I believe it is no longer available in the retail store.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a soft buttery cream lotion instead, and it smells nice and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to reapply, which is incredibly abnormal (especially for my feet) as I live in AZ.</li>
      <li>Though the scent is pleasant, it would be extra nice if they made this exact product in a nuetral or masculine scent to give specifically as a guy gift.</li>
      <li>I purchased the 13.5oz on Amazon for about $23.00 with shipping, worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s actually worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Worth the expense.</li>
      <li>This stuff is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Anyway, just put it on at night before you turn out the light, so it can soak in overnight, and the next morning the skin will be really smooth.</li>
      <li>Such a big package is so great for me, since I always run out of this thing.</li>
      <li>My skin is sooooooooooo much happier!</li>
      <li>I loved raw shea butter, but I have to admit,</li>
      <li>I brought the jumbo size because I received the small size in a gift box and loved it.</li>
      <li>it keeps your skin soft for a full 24 hours, doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance</li>
      <li>It moisturizes well, smells good and goes a long way because you only need a bit each time.</li>
      <li>I always get the large container since i use it twice a day.</li>
      <li>FINALLY, I have found a product that moisturizes my dry skin, smells good and does not leave an oily/greasy sheen or feel.</li>
      <li>Getting it melted and on my body was too much work</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>size was a gift last year; lasted through last winter and most of the spring.  </li>
      <li>Anyways, good brand, huge volume, just know it&#x27;s not even a tenth as sweet as the Brazil Nut body butter and has some odd crushed nutty sesame seed smell at the back end with that flowery body that ruins it for me.</li>
      <li>The lotion is amazing on dry skin, but it is so perfumed that I have to be careful when I use it.</li>
      <li>I tend to have dry skin, especially in the winter and have tried many products.</li>
      <li>I will not be buying it again and will warn others who are sensitive to perfume to avoid it.</li>
      <li>skin is usually very dry, and this body butter nourishes it better than any other cream, body butter or any product ever could.</li>
      <li>Ounce per ounce compared to other body lotions, butters, moisturizers, etc., The Body Shop Body Butter is worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>It brings my dry winter skin right back to life.</li>
      <li>It really works on dry skin, so I will selectively use it until it is gone.</li>
      <li>It is thick, rich, creamy and ultra-moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>You really only need to use a little bit, it&#x27;s rich and goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>It is very thick and does feel just a little bit greasy when first applied, but absorbs quickly and completely and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the money, a little goes a long way!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always ashy and I live in a dry, DRY state.</li>

    <li> This stuff is great for winter hands. Fixes chronic winter rough dry skin on my hands and fixes the nasty winter cracks in my hubby&#x27;s fingertips so they get smooth again, which feels better for him and his woman appreciates too :)   :)   This product is not supposed to be a thin daytime lotion. It&#x27;s like a soft buttery cream lotion instead, and it smells nice and isn&#x27;t greasy. If your guy with cracked fingers is unsure, then give him a nice hand massage with it before he goes to sleep, and he&#x27;ll be hooked... Though the scent is pleasant, it would be extra nice if they made this exact product in a nuetral or masculine scent to give specifically as a guy gift. Anyway, just put it on at night before you turn out the light, so it can soak in overnight, and the next morning the skin will be really smooth. For bad cracked fingers it may take 2 or 3 nights.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best lotion ever but it was partially exploded on delivery and was wrapped in plastic wrap that was covered in lotion. Also I did not get it in 2 days as guaranteed by amazon prime membership. The only reason this gets 3 stars is because this cream is hard to get and I believe it is no longer available in the retail store.</li>
    <li> So smooth and the scent is awesome.have been using a few years now.the whipped lotion is great too,not real greasy like a lot of body lotions out there.</li>
    <li> I love the Body Shop&#x27;s Shea Body Butter.  I use this on my driest spots in the winter.  It is very thick and does feel just a little bit greasy when first applied, but absorbs quickly and completely and leaves my skin so soft.  It is meant for very dry skin, does wonders on knees and elbows, it&#x27;s fantastic on the feet too.  The smell is soft and clean, very subtle and doesn&#x27;t compete with perfume or other scented lotions.  The 7oz. size was a gift last year; lasted through last winter and most of the spring.  You really only need to use a little bit, it&#x27;s rich and goes a long way.  I purchased the 13.5oz on Amazon for about $23.00 with shipping, worth every penny.  And, it will probably last until this time next year.</li>
    <li> This body butter is thick - you scoop it out with your fingers to apply. This is awesome for extremely dry skin. I always get the large container since i use it twice a day. It has a faint scent - not overwhelming or perfumy.</li>
    <li> Love this product and I never knew this size existed. I ordered on Thursday and received  it on saturday. I&#x27;m thinking I should order another one.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this body butter. It smells great and feels even better. I am allergic to so many ingredients that are in most creams and this one is fine for me. Try it today. You wont be sorry!</li>
    <li> Product  met my expectations. It moisturizes well, smells good and goes a long way because you only need a bit each time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 9 years and it has truly kept my hands supple, smoothe and youthful.</li>
    <li> QUITE FLOWERY!  And not in a good way, it nauseates me.  To be honest, I realized I made a mistake when looking for the Brazil Nut body butter and got this (which I quickly gave away to avoid the hassle of retuning which...I&#x27;m not sure they allow).  Anyways, good brand, huge volume, just know it&#x27;s not even a tenth as sweet as the Brazil Nut body butter and has some odd crushed nutty sesame seed smell at the back end with that flowery body that ruins it for me.</li>
    <li> I love this body butter. It brings my dry winter skin right back to life. It&#x27;s concentrated so a little goes a long ways. Works great on hands too.</li>
    <li> I tend to have dry skin, especially in the winter and have tried many products. No matter which products I&#x27;ve tried, inevitably my skin just soaks it up and looks like I never put anything on. I have tried Lubriderm, Vasoline Intensive, Curel, and Eucerin, to name a few.  I even told my doctor I had &amp;#34;alligator&amp;#34; skin on my legs! LOL.  She gave me a prescription for a product which worked, but I decided I did not want to smell like a medicine cabinet…boy was it stinky. I final resorted to using Vaseline (which works), but hated looking like a wanna-be body builder with all the shine. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cousin told me about the Shea Body Butter at The Body Shop and though doubtful, I decided to try it. FINALLY, I have found a product that moisturizes my dry skin, smells good and does not leave an oily/greasy sheen or feel. It also has a very nice smell. I would definitely recommend this product to try if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> love love love this stuff!  it keeps your skin soft for a full 24 hours, doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance it&#x27;s worth the money, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I would give this stuff 6 stars if I could. I hope Amazon keeps this always. The BEST lotion every. I&#x27;m always ashy and I live in a dry, DRY state. I loved raw shea butter, but I have to admit, it&#x27;s HARD (no, like a rock). Getting it melted and on my body was too much work so I tried this and it is awesome. The name &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; is appropriate. It feels like whipped butter. Much better than lotion or oil. It moisturizes long-term and I don&#x27;t have to reapply, which is incredibly abnormal (especially for my feet) as I live in AZ. This stuff is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff and will reorder again!</li>
    <li> This body butter is wonderful.  I brought the jumbo size because I received the small size in a gift box and loved it. Still loving it!</li>
    <li> Such a big package is so great for me, since I always run out of this thing. I use so much.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is usually very dry, and this body butter nourishes it better than any other cream, body butter or any product ever could. Even medical products. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Ounce per ounce compared to other body lotions, butters, moisturizers, etc., The Body Shop Body Butter is worth every penny.  It is thick, rich, creamy and ultra-moisturizing.  My skin feels like silk after this soaks in.  It has just enough scent, too, not the nauseating amount some products have.  I can&#x27;t recommend this body butter highly enough!  It works, and that is not something a lot of products can claim.</li>
    <li> I initially balked at the price of this product but it&#x27;s actually worth the money.  I love scooping rather than squeezing.  It&#x27;s so easy to use.  It has visible and feelable (if that&#x27;s a word) results.  It smells delicious and makes buttering up an absolute pleasure.</li>
    <li> The lotion is amazing on dry skin, but it is so perfumed that I have to be careful when I use it. I am semi-sensitive to smells and when I used this on most my body it gave me a headache. It really works on dry skin, so I will selectively use it until it is gone. I will not be buying it again and will warn others who are sensitive to perfume to avoid it.</li>
    <li> this is a huge tub of shea!  it smells great, very simple and not too overpowering and moisturizes like a charm</li>
    <li> Feels fabulous! Smells wonderful! My skin is sooooooooooo much happier!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very moisturizing. Worth the expense.</li>
    <li> cremoso, gostoso demais</li>
