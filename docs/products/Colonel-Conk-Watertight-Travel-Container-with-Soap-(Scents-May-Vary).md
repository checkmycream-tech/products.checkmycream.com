<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great container for travel. good lid</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a rave review is that my husband hasn&#x27;t been away. I hope he&#x27;ll give me feedback at the end of July when he&#x27;s gone most of the month.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this sooner. This the perfect item to carry on a business trip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military and must travel. This allows me to get a great shave and feel great even when deployed without having to deal with the hassle of inferior foams.</li>
    <li> I bought this just before a trip and was really pleased with it. It&#x27;s just big enough to hold a bar of soap as shown and so it&#x27;s pretty compact and fits well with all the other \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; stuff in my bag. It cleans up easy and seems like a pretty solid little container, especially considering the fact that it barely costs more than a bar of their soap. Mine came with the lime soap, I haven&#x27;t used it yet. (Had a bar of the bay rum I wanted to try.) No complaints, I like this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a travel container for my travel shave kit. The container is great, but the soap not so good. Little lather and the soap dries my beard and skin out. I threw the soap away and replaced with a good shave cream. I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Purchased this to use when traveling. love that the container is watertight, and so compact.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, and is affordable.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells great too. Only drawback is its a little messy, but its also a quick clean up.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough about this water tight, screw on lid, travel or every day use soap container. You would be foolish if you did not purchase this item. ITS A WINNER!!</li>
    <li> This worked great for me. I purchased it in a hurry before heading to Ireland for a 2-week business trip. I had converted to the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; way of shaving last year but this was the first time I was going on a long trip.  This was the perfect travel shaving soap and case!  Most importantly, it isn&#x27;t throw-away.  The 2.25 ounce Col. Conk soaps fit perfectly in this (and that&#x27;s exactly what comes with this case).  While I was hoping for a different scent (and would have liked the option to pick which), the one I received was lime and I have grown to like it.  In the end, I would recommend this to anyone that needs shaving soap on the go.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable how hard it is to find a good travel container for shave soaps. For the money, this one is the best I found. It closes tightly, &amp; seems to be durable. The only problem may be that it seems to be fit for the 2.5 oz Col. Conk pucks. I don&#x27;t know if other soaps will fit but as I&#x27;m a fan, It&#x27;s not a problem for me. Other glycerin soaps could be melted down in a microwave &amp; poured in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been packing around a metal bowl I&#x27;d gotten as part of a gift set for a better part of a year.  I&#x27;ve been &#x27;meaning to&#x27; find a travel case and finally saw this one and for $5 I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with a lime green colored soap, one I&#x27;ve not used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case has worked well for me so far, much better than the &#x27;metal bowl in a zip lock&#x27; method I have employed for a bit.  While I didn&#x27;t buy it for the wording on it the print was scratched off in spots when I got it, so if branding is your thing it probably won&#x27;t last long bouncing around in a necessities kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving since September (about 8 months) and this was the soap I elected to buy.  Most people have said theirs came in the Almond scent, but mine was Bay Rum.  I loved the scent from day one.  I get a nice lather from it, not too foamy.  I found that lathering directly on my face worked best.  Another complaint was soap on the threading, but that only happened until there was a hollow in the middle of the soap from use.  All in all, shaving about 5x a week, I still have a few weeks of soap left, so it lasts forever and costs way less than the neon goop from a can.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these, the soap is great, it really made a difference to my shaving with double edged razors and aerosol shaving gel (gunk). What ever scent I received, I think it&#x27;s almond, but can&#x27;t really pick it, I hate the smell! I&#x27;ve bought the lime flavored separately, and love it.     So come on Amazon, lets have a choice on what flavor we buy!</li>
    <li> I use my travel soap anytime I am away from home and need a shave. I&#x27;m quite pleased with ability to continue to wet shave with soap and brush while I am traveling. After using this container for about three weeks straight I can say the only downside is the foam spillover that happens on the threads. It&#x27;s easily wiped off with a towel. The Amazon description fails to mention that the scent of the soap is a random selection of Col Conk&#x27;s varieties (Line, Almond, Unscented, or Bay Rum). Unlike the previous reviewer, I find this soap to be soothing to my skin. It provides a think lather that works well with daily  straight razor shaving. Couple this with either a travel shave brush or a plastic shave brush tube and one can say goodbye to wasteful containers of travel sized shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This would be good to travel with, it&#x27;s intended purpose, but it&#x27;s a little small to use for normal everyday use. The scent is more on the medicinal side too - I definitely would say it smells great. When using it with a brush, it lathers well, but since the container is so small and has no side walls, the lather is lost when whipping it up (no side walls to keep it contained). I ended up popping the soap out and using it in a bigger soap bowl. As for the shave, its fine. I&#x27;ve used better and worse.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a trip to San Francisco. I did not want to carry my usual shaving cream and bowl, as I like to travel light. This soap smells amazing, I got the almond flavor which smells, like fresh marzipan, and it leaves my skin moisturized and soft. It lathers up real nice and all you got to do is rinse off the lather once you&#x27;re done shaving. I originally purchased this for my trip but now I use it on a regular basis at home.</li>
    <li> Picked this up specifically for travel. Was a bit larger than I expected but the size is actually nice. I also ordered another Colonel Conk soap and it can also be placed in the container, so once the soap is used up you can continue to use the container. Looking forward to shaving with this for the first time later today.</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with this soap.   It is the first time I tried this soap. Previously I was using canned shaving foams. Compared to them this is a shaving revolution for me.  While shaving the soap really lubricates the skin for a nice clean shave. I never had a problem until so far.   I purchased two of these. One arrived with bay rum scent and the other with amber. They both smell very nice. The bay rum has a cleaner fruity fragrance. The amber has a woody flower fragrance. The amber smells slightly brighter and stronger.  The travel container works fine. I use one at home and one while traveling.</li>
    <li> This does a fine job of holding your shave soap while traveling It does spill over the sides with use, but you can just wipe if off. This is fine as it keeps the size of the container to a minimum.</li>
    <li> Container works great as does soap got the amber bar not what I had hoped for but chances you take on random scent.</li>
    <li> This is what you want in your Dopp kit. I ordered this along with 3 bars of the Colonel&#x27;s Lime Shaving Soap and got a 4th bar of Lime. The container is very neat and waterproof. The soap has excellent smell and consistency, with just the right adhesion to the skin for shaving. It doesn&#x27;t go away while you are still lathering.</li>
    <li> I bought this for possible use during travel.  The case is a slightly smaller than most other shaving soaps, and it has a snug screw on lid. Ideal for taking on a trip. However, I tried it a few times and was disappointed. The lather it created was typical.  The shave I got from it was OK.  However the lather seems to dry out very quickly.  Much more so than any other soap I used. I had to re-lather my face 3 or 4 times during one pass of a shave.  The scent is OK, but a little on the medicinal side. This is an OK product, and I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone.  However, for trips I now use the travel size tube of Proraso shave soap, which I like much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I originally gave this 3 stars.  However after using it for a while, I&#x27;m liking it more that I did at first.  I like Proraso better, but this is also a good soap, and suggest you try it.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap container is compact, closes well and is easy to pack.  Good lather and comfortable shave.  I purchased it specifically for traveling.  I also used it at home and found it satisfactory.  I like the almond fragrance although I did not choose it.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for my travel kits, so far they work well for the intended purpose. The body and lid are made of a hard, relatively thick plastic and look as if they&#x27;ll hold up well. The lids screw on nice and tight and seal well. As others commented, there is a random selection of shaving soap included, I received a lime and a bay rum. The soaps are pleasant and produce a good lather, I use both of these types for shaving at home.</li>
    <li> Colonel Conk Watertight Travel Container with soap, yes, indeed was ordered by us in Nov.2010 as you have pointed out.  We also ordered 15 bars of the soap and could clearly tell the difference of a bar of soap without a traveling case and one with one. AGAIN, WE NEVER RECEIVED the one we ordered with the case. Just because you acknowledge we ordered one is certainly no proof we received it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic little travel container, about the size of you palm, and fits  the soap perfectly. It really is watertight and smell good. Best way to start you day is with a manly smelling shave that feels better than crud in a can.</li>
    <li> the case is perfect.  i face-lather so i dont really care about soapy water dripping from it.  i only wish we could choose the soap that comes with it.  it&#x27;s completely arbitrary, i got the lime one, which is fine, but i kinda wanted the bay rum, but whatever.  regardless of the scent, it&#x27;s a great soap.</li>
    <li> Creamy long lasting lather and leaves skin feeling soft</li>
    <li> This is good travel shaving soap.The only reason for the 4 stars is because you cant choose the flavor you get. They ship whatever they want in that respect. Would like to have a choice on that. Will buy a diff. brand and use the micro wave to liquify in a paper type cup to refill these when they are used up.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the container, for which I am satisfied.  However, the Colonel Conk soap in the container leaves much to be desired.  Since you don&#x27;t get to pick the scent, I was \\&quot;awarded\\&quot; the Amber variety.  Which, is exactly like a bar of Dial Gold soap you could pick up at the grocery store. Got a decent shave, but it dried my face out pretty bad.  All in all, I got what I paid for (a travel container with some cheap soap).  Could&#x27;ve been better, but wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I got the line fragrance and when I use my Best badger brush and foam up in my shaving cup it gives me a good shave.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for the travel container, not knowing what soap was in it. I was expecting it to be plain and unscented. When I got it home I discovered that it was in fact almond scented and smelled great. Good soap and container at a great price, I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The shaving soap is fine, Col. Conk is pretty good shaving soap, and the container seals tightly, so that it is good for packing away.  My issue is that the lid is so close to being big enough to make lather in, but you can&#x27;t.  So, unless you bring a separate mug/bowl, or lather on your face, this container gets annoying.</li>
    <li> The perfect way to carry your shaving soap while traveling.  For the price it is a real good deal, and it works just great.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the travel container. Never used col conk shaving soap before but I must say that it was a great bonus. I received the Amber, and  it is a great soap for the price range. And everyone complaining about the fingerprints on the soap, they have to take the soap and put it in the container before they ship it, so of course their will be fingerprints. It is not a big deal. Great Container and Great Soap. Shave on!!</li>
    <li> Nice case but soap does not foam up almost at all.  The cheap soaps are better, like the travel container once I changed the soap.</li>
    <li> this product is made the man serious about a soft clean shaven face even when he is away from home. Great for keeping the skin conditioned and the face feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap about 6 months ago to use when I travel.  Over that time I have used it about 3 times with mixed feelings.  The soap smells good and comes in a nice travel sized jar.  But the lather I get from this soap isn&#x27;t as thick as others I have used.  One great thing I love about the soap is how the soap sticks to the lid so you can use the container as a bowl if you don&#x27;t have anything else.  I would recommend this product to someone who travels a lot but would not recommend as your everyday soap.</li>
    <li> After all the hype, I was pretty dissapointed.  They sent me the lime scent, which reminds me of a fancy urinal cake.  I might have liked theay rum.  It worked well but i found &amp;#34;La Toja&amp;#34; to be better, perhaps because I face lather.</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these so far. The first was crushed during a recent trip, and now I make sure that the soap container is packed more in the center of my bag.&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells good. The soap forms a thick foam that works well on your skin to lubricate the razor.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I found this shaving soap to make more of a watery suds than a rich lather. Smells nice, but the best I&#x27;ve found so far is the Poraso. Also the travel container just gets soapy water all over the place since the soap comes right up to the lip of the container.</li>
    <li> i hate bay rum. but i just got it for the case, to hold my east african shea butter. The bay rum came out in one chunk. i was hoping for a tighter twist seal. Still better than empty cases i could find.</li>
    <li> Everything that I thought it would be. Its easy to build a quick lather on the brush without using a bowl. It comes in a plastic white container that is perfect for travel or daily use.</li>
    <li> Needed some soap for a motorcycle road trip to use with my safety razor so I ordered this. Works great, foams up okay and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this like many people did, for the container and as an extra get a shaving soap. I got the lime scented one. The scent is not amazing nor it isn&#x27;t bad. I don&#x27;t like the lather this soap makes. I&#x27;ve tried Proraso Menthol soap, Proraso Sandalwood soap AND cream, and lavender cream from the art of shaving and all of them were better than Colonel Conk&#x27;s Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this ain&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s not great either.</li>
    <li> All the Conk soaps are more than adequate, but the container is really aces, compact, tight closing so no leakage for travel kit, and whether you refill it with Conk or something else, will last forever.</li>
    <li> Discovered colonel conk early in my wet shaving obsession. Cheap, slippery, and in this case portable. I usually travel with their bay rum soap, but took a chance in this random puck and got almond. Not bad at all.</li>
    <li> This self-contained shaving soap and bowl is very convenient for travel. It is exactly what I wanted and functions adequately for shaving needs when on the road.</li>
    <li> Ok lather.  Not a lot of scent (I got &amp;#34;lime&amp;#34;).  I like lather and scent together - ok for the price but will probably go with a better known brand next time. Came in a nice plastic travel container.</li>
    <li> Perfect way to travel and still get a good close shave with my double edged razor and brush.</li>
    <li> THE CONTAINER IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH FOR A BRUSH TO BE MANIPULATED INSIDE THE CONTAINER.</li>
    <li> Ok I only use this when on the road but it seals tight and works well so if you like to seal up your soap this is great.</li>
    <li> I knew it was a gamble, but I was hoping for anything but the lime... of course I got that one. It&#x27;s my first shaving soap, but I managed to get a decent lather on the third try. I can even do it in the lid, but it&#x27;s a little more difficult that in a mug. The Van der Hagen shaving soap from Walmart lathers better (for me) and fits perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows a beige container, however in reality it is white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had gotten Bay Rum (also read somewhere that it lathers better) it would have been 4 stars. It&#x27;s still a great travel container.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No burn and doesn&#x27;t leave his face feeling tight and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loves the travel size to pack in his webbing and the watertight container makes shaving in the bush a breeze.</li>
    <li> Very happy , came on time and was what I expected</li>
    <li> A little to small to build up a lather but I just spin the edge of the brush to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Nice travel soaps for the road, ready to go.  But when you&#x27;re used to Proraso at home, well it does the job but I&#x27;m spoiled now with my proraso system</li>
    <li> This is a great pre-wash or cream enhancer.  I don&#x27;t think it stands up enough on it&#x27;s own to be a realistic cream-- maybe in a bind.</li>
    <li> Not just for travel! I use this to make lather and I bought it because it will hold the Van Der Hagen Glycerin shave soap when the Col. Conk soap is gone.  I have two  of these containers one to hold a cake of the Col. Conk Glycerin Lime.  When I&#x27;m done making lather I just rinse off the threads and screw on the lid. Alas all tidy and clean!  TIP TIP TIP  When you finally get ready to replace the soap cake score the side of cake with a tiny grove to let the air trapped under the soap cake out when you press the soap down into the container.  With this container you don&#x27;t need a shaving mug to make lather!  Just load a brush up with the soap and make nice warm lather on your face. I have a mug and I use it to keep my brush and lather warm after I lather my face.  Read that review for the cup Col Ichabod Conk Multi-Brown Color Ceramic Shaving Mug on Pedestal as listed on Amazon.  The mug will also hold the same cakes of soap as the travel container if you want make lather in a cup.</li>
    <li> I received this one yesterday and the smell and texture was superb. I hope to be using this one when my Damascus Razor arrives later this month. I tried it with a lesser quality straight razor and it worked perfectly. I have several variation of shaving soap and this one looks good. But time will tell when I receive my higher grade razor. Shaving with a Straight Razor seems like it would be a chore in the morning, But reality is I have enough time in the morning these days to enjoy a good shave. Straight Razor Shaving is definitely an art, and it use to be a way father and son spent right of passage years ago when the first shave was a household thing. Maybe recreating that in 2012 -2013 will be an excellent nostalgic event. Also a good reason for Grandma to use that new Camera. With that said, I love the art that use to be a way of life.</li>
    <li> Nice lather. Pleasant light scent.  As others have stated, would be nice if one can choose the scent he desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portable container it comes in makes for nice travel and is great for storage after soap is gone, for  tiny screws and other small hardware kept in tool box,&lt;br /&gt;men&#x27;s valet for cuff links, tie tacs, rings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in effect you dont just get the soap, but an added little trinket box.</li>
    <li> I really love this travel container so I gave it a five rating. It is light weight and lid secures tight. The cake of soap supplied fills this container so I cut the cake in half, placed it inside container and microwave for about ten seconds. Let cool and you have enough shave soap to last for a two week vacation.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Good froth, I like the case. Clean up is a snap. What more could you ask for in shave soap?</li>
    <li> A very affordable alternative to sprays and it provides a good shave experience. Compact size helps when packing and thus this item is convenient for travel too.</li>
    <li> A little to big for travel but it does the job. I recommend it if you want to have a pleasure shaving session on your travels.</li>
    <li> I liked this soap okay, but to be honest, I like the better quality soap I usually use more.  SO I took the soap that came in this case out and put mine in.  Much better.  This case has made my travel shaving simple.</li>
    <li> Very good soap that lathers very well and easily. I was sent a random scent (Amber, whatever that is or means) that is ok. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it either. Other than the scent, it was a very good soap.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this soap, it&#x27;s ok but nothing special as it&#x27;s glycerine based.  Love the container as I can put a different shea butter soap puck in it and makes for great travel.</li>
    <li> Col Conk. Manly, cheap and gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product mainly for the container since I did not know which scent they were going to send. It&#x27;s a surprise, weird huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the scent of the soap I received smelled like strawberries or some kind of red coolaid smell which I did not dig in any kind of way but the scent wore off so quickly that it was negligible. Little Girl smell aside the soap lathered well was not hard to clean up after the shave also it traveled well which was the whole point in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very best shave lather I have gotten is from Taylor of Old Bond. Go there if you don&#x27;t mind paying 17 bucks a tub and smelling like a pile of all day pretty boys.</li>
    <li> Wet shaving on the road has its own difficulties, but I was hoping for a good travel soap. This isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s not great.&lt;br /&gt;I got the amber and the soap quality is alright. Doesn&#x27;t seem to lather up that much, but works out alright. But that leads to the other problem; because this is basically a travel soap dish, you can&#x27;t really work up a good lather without it falling all over your hand. There&#x27;s no sides to contain it.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll switch to a good cream I can put in one of the plastic cups at the hotels and use that. This works, but not all that well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was going on a vacation and couldn&#x27;t very well tote my shave mug around with me. For the price this is an excellent shave soap. Especially considering the travel packaging. Typically a good soap costs between $10-$20 so I give it leeway on the fact the soap rises above the lip of the container causing a little bit of a mess while lathering. The container is obviously plastic and it&#x27;s durable so no trouble there. Only downfall really is the scent I got. (Lime) That&#x27;s obviously up to preference and it clearly states they vary. Overall though great product for the wet shaver on the go.</li>
    <li> The lather doesn&#x27;t last for me.</li>
    <li> This Colonel Conk Watertight Travel Container with Soap is a very good shaving mug essential when you travel. It is very nostalgic, esthetically pleasing and durably manufactured. What I like best about it is that you can close it with its lid after use and it stays watertight. You dry the outside and then you can keep it anywhere in your luggage without getting your clothes, papers or whatever wet. I like to lather up with a mug and brush and have been doing so for years. I have a small collection of shaving mugs and shaving brushes and I continue to add to them from time to time. The Colonel Conk Travel Shaving Mug is a great find. It is very practical and attractive.</li>
    <li> Every time I get shaving supplies from Colonel Conk I am amazed by the amazing quality at a bargain price point.  This is no exception.</li>
    <li> excellent case for shaving soap</li>
    <li> Container is perfect and the soap (green, lime? I can&#x27;t smell things as well as most) is nice. Small container reminds me that many prefer to &amp;#34;load&amp;#34; the brush with soap and then build a foam on the face. No room to work a lather in this unit. Great travel soap, and nice to have on the ready if needed at home.</li>
    <li> This is my first disappointment with a product ordered from Amazon.  The soap arrived in time but when I opened the container there were fingerprints all over the top of the soap.  This makes shaving with soap less than appealing.  I am choosing not to return the soap as I will scrape off the top layer and the return is a hassle around Xmas.  I do want to express my disappointment with this item.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for travel! It fits a regular Col. Conk puck. I ended up with Lime but this is ok. It would have been nice to choose the scent, but don&#x27;t that keep you from getting this little gem.</li>
    <li> I was blown away instantly by the difference between this shaving soap and other shaving creams. You should have a badger brush in order to use the soap but wow, its incredible.  You have never used anything like it before, its so warm to your skin its almost warm and its very smooth. I have never felt anything so slick on my face.  Also, you get an insane amount in this container. You use only a tiny bit every shave and the 2.25 oz seems like it never goes away. I can see months of use out of this one product container.  An instant buy!!</li>
    <li> My husband is a confirmed shaving soap user and has - until now - just packed his shaving mug. However, we don&#x27;t need that extra weight for international travel, so we bought this. We&#x27;re hoping it doesn&#x27;t leak and holds enough soap to last at least five weeks. (It seems as if it should.)</li>
    <li> A good lathering soap but I bought it because of the travel container. It has a treaded lid that keeps it from leaking in my shaving bag.</li>
    <li> I travel everywhere with this soap.  Big enough to build a lather, not too big for a Dopp.  Recommended for road warriors.</li>
    <li> I usually carry my shaving soap in some odd-sized container that I get from my wife.  I never thought about your watertight travel container.  Love itl</li>
    <li> A great shave and a convenient, sturdy container.&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice to be able to pick which &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of soap it came with.</li>
    <li> A really good shaving soap. Nice smell and rich lather. Jar seals tight and doesn&#x27;t leek. I use it at home as much as when traveling. Have to use my smaller brush, which is for traveling anyway.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have pointed out, you cant pick which soap you get. I ended up with lime. I did not care for the lime, too strong, smelled like dish soap, so I threw it out. Container works excellent! I took some Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat and put it in here. Now I can take my favorite soap with me wherever I go. I use the lid to lather in.</li>
    <li> Lather holds up well. The travel container is nice. Definitely a keeper in my arsenal of shave soaps.</li>
    <li> When traveling, it&#x27;s not easy to take your soap mug so this is a great alternative.  Small enough to carry in your carry on luggage.</li>
    <li> It a bar of soap that smells nice when you shave and the girls love it.... that make it even better.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice travel item that I carried with me on my business trips for about nine months.  The theft of my suitcase during a car break-in has me ordering a second.  I found it indeed waterproof and conveniently sized for my shaving kit and the lather and scent were OK with me.  I&#x27;d just tighten the lid, wipe it off and stick it in the bag.  Never a problem and it helped me keep up the shaving brush shaves while on the road.</li>
    <li> My husband loves how Colonel Conk leathers, I love how his face feels so smooth after he shaves using it.  We picked up this particular Colonel Conk soap for the container, it is watertight and good to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a collage of three photos numbered 1 through 3 under customer photos:&lt;br /&gt;Photo #1 show the opened container.&lt;br /&gt;Photo #2 shows how the soap is attached to the container, it is attached to the cover (not the bottom as I expected from the stock photo).&lt;br /&gt;Photo #3 shows the soap on digital scale: the unused container is 3.8 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you pick one of these container soaps you don&#x27;t get to pick the scent. We got  \\&quot;Almond\\&quot; scent. The scent is just okay, but the container and the soap are very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> I received my travel soap as promised. The item was well packed. My initial usage yielded a nice foamy lather and a pleasant scent of bay rum. I havent used cake shaving soap in many years and I am pleased with the results in using this product. It is something I will happily re-order when the time comes and would recommend it to my friends should they ask. The product was as advertised and that is a pleasant surprise these days.</li>
    <li> Great little holder for soap while traveling. A bit hard to create lather in but if you lather your face, this is PERFECT. The best part is that a standard 2.25oz puck from Col Conk fits perfectly. I actually think that the interior shape of this cup is the same as the puck.</li>
    <li> I ordered Col Conk Travel Container along side of the Parker PTB Straight Edged Shavette. I used the free shipping and got both items within 2 days of my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Conk Travel Container to be used while I travel, so it won&#x27;t get much use. But, the concept behind the soap puck being attached to the bottom of the lid is genius. This leaves the deep bottom piece available for the creation of lather with your brush. I ended up getting the Bay Rum scent and I am fine with that. The smell of Bay Rum from the dry soap is faint and light, so I&#x27;m thinking the lather smell won&#x27;t be much different. It shouldn&#x27;t overpower any other cologne or aftershave you apply after shaving. From what I understand, when you order the &amp;#34;Colonel Conk Watertight Travel Container with Soap&amp;#34; you&#x27;re taking your chances on what scent you will be given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for the pure ingenuity of packaging, I give &amp;#34;Colonel Conk Watertight Travel Container with Soap&amp;#34; 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The scent that came with this is called &amp;#34;Amber&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a clean, natural, woodsy scent that I love.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers quickly and easily and gives good cushion to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;The container has a screw top lid and is water tight.</li>
    <li> I picked this up because I recently started shaving with a double-edge razor, and wanted to continue using mug soap and a brush.  Col. Conk&#x27;s travel soap seemed like the way to go.  The convenience and the actual shave experience is all pretty good - it lubricated the blade well enough, and I had no problems achieving a decent lather.  I even liked the Bay Rum scent that I received (which I guess was the luck-of-the-draw.)  My first shave with this soap was in New York.  I noticed that it didn&#x27;t want to rinse cleanly, and suspected that maybe it was the local water.  So, I tried it at home, and had the same result (I&#x27;m used to Detroit water, and the water here is pretty soft.)  I&#x27;m sure that this will last quite a long time, as I don&#x27;t travel too frequently.  If/when it does run out, I might look for a different brand to refill it with.  Not necessarily because this was bad.  It just wasn&#x27;t great.  Since it is very convenient, I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this product for a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It is transportable on a flight&lt;br /&gt;2) It does a good job at getting your skin ready to shave&lt;br /&gt;3) You are able to tightly seal the container, dry off the exterior and your are ready to go</li>
    <li> Functional and suited to travel</li>
    <li> As advertised, but small for many of my soaps</li>
    <li> The container is just as advertised.  Not too small but perfect size for travel.  The soap itself is very nice too.  I&#x27;ve used the soap before with good results.  I lather up right on my face so the container and the soap take the brush very well.</li>
    <li> For some reason when I bought this container, I was expecting to be able to keep the puck of soap in and satisfactorily brush up a lather for a good shave on the road, however this has proven not to be the case. Attempting to lather the puck in this case leads to a mess, but I&#x27;ll chalk that up to not using the case for its simple purpose: being a watertight travel container.</li>
    <li> A great scent (lime)You have to word at brush to get more lather but you are rewarded with a close shave.</li>
    <li> After being highly disappointed with the Jagger shaving soap I ordered; this was an inexpensive and very satisfying alternative in a convenient and clever container for home and travel.  It makes great suds with very little effort and has no obnoxious smell. I get a great shave with it and then it rinses quickly and leaves no residue.  I will be ordering more of this I&#x27;m sure!</li>
    <li> just as described.  great product</li>
    <li> Great travel soap. Just right size.</li>
    <li> The soap is fine, but i can&#x27;t get it out of the container.  Makes it hard to use the brush.</li>
    <li> Cheap and perfect for traveling. After a few uses, it&#x27;s holding up well and the soap is my favorite. Everything I expected and more</li>
    <li> This is my travel shaving soap, It could be dripping wet but when I screw the top down the inside of my sundry bag stays dry. PLEASE ANY OTHER SCENT THAN BAY RHUM! Seems every Col Conk has bay rhum as the included scent.</li>
    <li> Good soap, lathers well, and travels in a watertight container. Will definitely buy again but I see this one lasting a long time since I don&#x27;t travel as much as before.</li>
    <li> The purpose of this product is to allow for a brush shaver like myself to travel with brush and soap. It remains dry and protects clothes in the suitcase from moisture after shaving on travel morning.</li>
    <li> Traveled well! Excellent soap for shaving. Mine cane with lime scent. One star off for no choice of scents, but I line all of this products scents. Priduct itself deserves 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Nice travel case for the soap. Easily refillable with other brand soaps that cost less. Close the lid, rinse the container, and you&#x27;re set for the next time.</li>
    <li> for those of us who shave this way this is perfect for on the go shaveing fits easy in the shave case</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the scent or the quality of lather I have gotten with a brush with this product</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted for my Col. Conk soap. I was very pleased to see that they make a shave soap container for my travel bag. When I travel I lather either on my face or in my hand or a mug or bowl (if there is one in the hotel room I staying at ).</li>
    <li> Wish you could choose your scent.  That being said, I have not tried a Conk soap I do not like.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I&#x27;d have the travel container since I&#x27;m on the road half the time with work. The soap in mine started getting stuck in the bowl part of it when I open it. Somewhat annoying. Still usable but you end up with soap on the threads of the container after you use it and have to rinse it off.. or fiddle with it and try to get the soap disc out of the bowl an stick it on the cap side. At first I didn&#x27;t like the soap as much as Proraso.. but after I realized it needed more water I like it. I still think Proraso is slicker, but the Proraso doesn&#x27;t rinse from my Merkur nearly as well as this stuff does. So that kind of evens the two products out in my opinion. You&#x27;ll use much less water and time for rinsing your blade.</li>
    <li> Compact, smells great, looks like it will work well for travel; our son has not used it for shaving yet so I don&#x27;t know how that is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a DE wet shaver and would have to settle for the awful canned stuff when on the road or looking to shave after a workout at the gym.  This product worked well for me; the soap is ok but as mentioned the scent is the luck of the drawl. The container is great and will be reused with my preferred scent/ brand when empty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure which variety of soap I got in the container, but whatever it is, the smell and texture are great. As another reviewer mentioned the soap is nice and foamy. That&#x27;s exactly what I want from my travel soap. The lid stays on, unlike the [[ASIN:B001MEXZS2 Travel Size Proraso Shaving Soap with Eucalyptus Oil and Menthol - 2.5 oz]]. I cannot figure out why anyone would make a travel soap without a screw tight threaded lid. I&#x27;m pleased enough with this soap that I&#x27;ll be trying some of the other Col. Conk shaving products for my double edged shaving lifestyle. I use this soap in conjunction with [[ASIN:B0036BF97Y Muhle Pinsel Round Shave Brush Travel Holder]], which works great for keeping my brush intact and well formed. The container is a bit small for the circumference of my badger brush, but just the right size for traveling in my hygiene kit - overall I&#x27;m quite pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This was a convenient way for me to beginning using a shaving brush &amp; soap when shaving.</li>
    <li> The scent is enjoyable and nice for the fall or winter time.  The container is easy to travel with, but because of its size it gets sudsy and a bit messy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for travel.  The soap makes good lather for shaving.  The screw on top keeps everything protected in my carry-on.</li>
    <li> Just the best for travel. I will order more to use at home now.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of very pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well and provides a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting - not even half through it after a year of use.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality travel container too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, you may want to consider a shave cream instead.</li>
    <li> works great, makes a good shave</li>
    <li> I received the amber scent in mine. Probably the one I wanted least when I ordered, but I was surprised how nice it smelled when I got it. Since I had already purchased a bay rum scented puck, I&#x27;m completely happy with getting the amber. Be aware that this will only fit the standard 2.25 oz. Colonel Conk&#x27;s pucks, so you probably won&#x27;t be able to reuse the case easily if you decide to go with a different soap brand.</li>
    <li> I got Lime, which I would not have purchased on my own, but I loved it! Nice slick soap and easy to lather. Solid, so it goes through TSA easy and seals up tightly.</li>
    <li> nice traveler, screws down</li>
    <li> This shaving soap didn&#x27;t lather very well, was almond scented (you don&#x27;t get a choice of scents), and was just all around a bust. On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t cost much, so I didn&#x27;t feel bad tossing it in the trash after my vacation was done so I didn&#x27;t even have to cart it back home with me.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome sauce. I got the lime soap which my girlfriend seems to love smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I travel 14 days at a time and this little soap case is sturdy and since the lid actually holds the soap the deeper diah part serves to whip up some creamy lather with my Col Conk travel brush.</li>
    <li> A great stocking stuffer. My husband has not used it yet, but plans to when we travel. It will sure come along on our cruise we are planning for the summer</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely and helps give a smooth shave. Good price. I got almond as the random scent and I really like it.</li>
    <li> Bought primarily for the waterproof case, to use when traveling.  The soap lathers and shaves well.  Just what I needed</li>
    <li> For me the soap is terrible. I can&#x27;t get a good lather at all.</li>
    <li> Received promptly, and looks to be just what I expected. I&#x27;ve not had opportunity to travel much with it yet.</li>
    <li> I did not particularly care for this shaving soap, as it did not lather up as well as the Van Der Hagen shaving soap does, but I did keep the nice plastic travel container as it was the main reason for buying this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent little travel case for the soap cake that makes wiping it off quite easy.  Packs nicely as it isn&#x27;t much larger than the actual soap cake and  the quality of the soap promotes a very nice smooth shave even without shaving oil.  I actually enjoy using this soap when I go travelling.</li>
    <li> Bought this item to use when I travel since it has a screw-on lid to keep things tidy. I am not disappointed as it has worked out very well for tral and is a good size for the shaving kit.</li>
    <li> Have no issue with the shipment or the time in which received; just wish you could pick your scent. Also, the puck gets hard to remove from the container once it gets wet, sort of adheres itself to the container...but all in all great way to carry your soap when you travel</li>
    <li> I have been using a brush for many years but when I traveled I just rubbed soap on my face. Now I can enjoy lathering with a brush on the road with this wonderful soap.</li>
    <li> Soap is good, nice scent.  I have tried to travel with this but it does appear to be &amp;#34;drip-proof&amp;#34;  I would leave a bunch of water in it and pack it in the suitcase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the small aerosol shaving &amp;#34;sprays.&amp;#34; And I use soap and a brush at home. With a small travel brush, this fits nicely in my travel kit and smells a great deal better than the &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; in the can.</li>
    <li> For the price, this product is very good. The soap is much better than those purchased at drug stores, and the container is surprisingly well made. The scent selection is random however, and this turned me off to the seller, which supposedly is Colonel Conk! The soaps are clearly labeled on the bottom of the packages, they should be offering a scent preference to buyers. Perhaps I&#x27;m too particular with my shaving products, but I like my scents to match!</li>
    <li> I love Colonel Conks glycerin soaps. I travel a bit so i appreciate this soap being in a watertight container. I wish it was a little bigger container than the soap its a little hard to get a good swirl with the brush but for a travel soap it really meets all the needs.</li>
    <li> I like the soap, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, but the soap has separated from the base/lid, so it sticks in the container sometimes. Best to completely dry it out before closing, but not always possible when traveling.</li>
    <li> I got this soap for the container, but I was very pleased with the soap as well. I use it in my rotation of three other soaps. It lathers very well, has a pleasant scent (got the Bay Rum), and rinses off easily. I take it with me on the road, and it has become one of my favorite soaps.</li>
    <li> I can not get this soap to foam up or create a lather.  Have tried several times but it seems more like hand soap for lather/foam.  Everything else is good, but I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> So I needed a shave soap for on the go, and this seemed the simplest option. When it arrived I received bay rum, which is a nice scent. After using it I find it dries the heck out of my skin, which is strange, normal Col. Conk soaps don&#x27;t, I can only guess that it&#x27;s a different formula, but what ever it is my face does not agree with it. The case is nice, white and does what it&#x27;s supposed to,and most shave soaps should fit just fine. Just remember to dry your soap before sealing it or the soap will expand and get stuck in the other end of the case.</li>
    <li> Colonel Conk did a great job with the Watertight Travel Container...the soap does not lather properly and has a funny smell... with that said...I  would buy this product again...throw the soap away...keep the Container and buy some better soap.</li>
    <li> The item pictured is not what I received. I received this:&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/Colonel-Ichabod-Conk-Almond-Shave/dp/B0007P2OMK/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_hpc_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0WQ64TA86YFBBNZGR7NA&lt;br /&gt;which is a very nice soap and I am happy to have it, is not in a water price container. It is also $1.60 cheaper so apparently I got ripped off. The two stars are for the quality of the soap I received, I cannot comment on the travel container as I did not receive one.</li>
    <li> I am new to wet shaving so am now in a bit of an experimental phase. BTW, I have found wet shaving  great and will not return to the modern safety razors. I have found this glycerin based shave &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; to be quite excellent. It lathers nicely, has little or no odor and seems to be mild on my somewhat sensitive skin. My beard is thick and quite wirey. The blade moves along my skin with no pulling while using this product. I don&#x27;t think I could expect any better performance. The water tight case is a real bonus. It is a perfect product for travel.</li>
    <li> Lathers good , but makes a big mess until the soap wears into the dish . When traveling , give a little extra time to dry before you throw it in your bag.</li>
    <li> Great for taking your shaving soap on the go.  Mine came with Bay Rum, which is exactly what I wanted.  One problem could be that the lather spills over the side of the container, but that&#x27;s not a big deal</li>
    <li> If you like you&#x27;re soap puck, this is the way to travel.  I&#x27;ve been using Col Conk soap for a while now.  On a recent trip I tried using a travel can of goo (shave gel) and my face was a wreck for a week.  Bought this travel container and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good travel shaving soap. this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this item, coupled with a shaving brush makes for a good trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no areosol cans of shaving cream!</li>
