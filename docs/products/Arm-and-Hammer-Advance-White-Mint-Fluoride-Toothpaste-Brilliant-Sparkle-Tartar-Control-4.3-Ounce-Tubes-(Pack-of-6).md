### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is delicious.</li>
      <li>I tried all of the over the counter toothpaste for whitening, and this is the best for me.</li>
      <li>This is the one that works best for me in terms of abrasiveness, texture, flavor, aftertaste.  </li>
      <li>This item was advertized as the brilliant sparkle arm and hammer toothpaste that I can no longer find in stores around me but looove.  </li>
      <li>This flavor has a good frosted mint flavor.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste tastes so good.</li>
      <li>I tried another variety of Arm &amp; Hammer and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good tasting.</li>
      <li>This seems like a great deal if you don&#x27;t read the fine print.</li>
      <li>It is the best toothpaste I have found for really and truly cleaning your teeth.</li>
      <li>It tastes as good as it can, minty but smooth.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is ok but not as good as the original A&amp;H gel.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: When I wrote this review, I decided to order from the supplier &amp; was glad I did.</li>
      <li>My favorite toothpaste ever.</li>
      <li>Lord help me because this is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite and he refuses to change.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste it makes my mouth feel so refreshed at all times :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad to have found this toothpaste online.  </li>
      <li>My teeth are stained from tea and coffee &amp; this toothpaste removes most of the stains.</li>
      <li>Arm &amp; Hammer is my favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>The ítem was delivered on time, have a good taste, my Family like it very much</li>
      <li>This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have an overly strong flavor and my teeth feel nice and smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Using it to brush my teeth yields the perfect amount of foam ( not crazy, but enough to make me feel like I am cleaning)</li>
      <li>Our teeth are white and our dental check ups have been great since we have used Arm and Hammer</li>
      <li>how clean it gets our teeth.</li>
      <li>Funny how I never would imagine feeling so strong about a toothpaste, but</li>
      <li>This toothpaste leaves your mouth minty fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I love the mint taste of this particular toothpaste.</li>
      <li>none the less, this toothpaste is great.</li>
      <li>Does not leave your mouth as fresh, even after mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Also it seems the paste has more grit to it, and does a better job of cleaning than the average toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>First it is paste like, so I love that, not a big fan of the gels.</li>
      <li>Arm and Hammer Advance White Brilliant Sparkle toothpaste has been my family&#x27;s toothpaste of choice for a few years.  </li>
      <li>It really cuts the plaque and brightens the appearance of the teeth.</li>
      <li>However, I got what was pictured, which is advanced white breath freshening with baking soda.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a better whitening effect compared as reviewed by other users.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste lightens my teeth 2-3 shades which is better than any of the other whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>The other non-minty one is even more epically salty.</li>
      <li>Recently I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in my local supermarkets, so have had to purchase it online.</li>
      <li>definitely gives me the fresh from the dentist feel in my mouth.</li>
      <li>I would rather have paid a little more to get the larger tube.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only checked the store where I normally purchase it.</li>
      <li>have ordered this a few times and its always worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t see a better whitening effect compared as reviewed by other users.</li>
    <li> Arm &amp; Hammer is my favorite toothpaste. It really cuts the plaque and brightens the appearance of the teeth.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste ever. Funny how I never would imagine feeling so strong about a toothpaste, but none the less, this toothpaste is great. First it is paste like, so I love that, not a big fan of the gels. Using it to brush my teeth yields the perfect amount of foam ( not crazy, but enough to make me feel like I am cleaning) It tastes as good as it can, minty but smooth. Doesn&#x27;t leave a peroxide taste in your mouth. With time, my teeth feel cleaner and stain resistant. definitely gives me the fresh from the dentist feel in my mouth. My teeth feel polished and shiny and less stained.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of toothpastes, both natural, organic health food brands and conventional brands.

    <li> Arm and Hammer Advance White Brilliant Sparkle toothpaste has been my family&#x27;s toothpaste of choice for a few years.  This toothpaste lightens my teeth 2-3 shades which is better than any of the other whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m online checking to see if it&#x27;s still manufactured because I haven&#x27;t found it on the store shelf in over 3 months..I&#x27;ve only checked the store where I normally purchase it. My teeth are stained from tea and coffee &amp; this toothpaste removes most of the stains. My daughter&#x27;s teeth get very white when she uses it.  This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have an overly strong flavor and my teeth feel nice and smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to have found this toothpaste online.  Now, I just have to decide if I should check other local stores or pay shipping fees. hmmmm....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: When I wrote this review, I decided to order from the supplier &amp; was glad I did. Two years later, my local stores are stocking this toothpaste again.</li>
    <li> My family has used Arm and Hammer toothpaste for years and we like the taste and how clean it gets our teeth. This flavor has a good frosted mint flavor. Our teeth are white and our dental check ups have been great since we have used Arm and Hammer toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to comment that we did try the peroxide Arm and Hammer toothpaste and we couldn&#x27;t use it as it caused our lips to breakout. He have had no issues with this frosted mint flavor.</li>
    <li> The tube is smaller than the last ones I purchased.  Another instance of cutting quantity to keep the price the same.  I would rather have paid a little more to get the larger tube.</li>
    <li> This item was advertized as the brilliant sparkle arm and hammer toothpaste that I can no longer find in stores around me but looove.  However, I got what was pictured, which is advanced white breath freshening with baking soda.  I am giving 3 stars because I do believe that it has helped my teeth get slightly whiter in the week that I have used it, but I&#x27;m not happy that I didn&#x27;t get what I thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> It really works! I tried all of the over the counter toothpaste for whitening, and this is the best for me. I&#x27;m not switching to anything else and have been using this brand for years.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tastes so good. It is delicious.</li>
    <li> I have six kids and bought a tube each so they can stop loosing and fighting over the tooth paste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is ok but not as good as the original A&amp;H gel.  Bring back the gel!  Does not leave your mouth as fresh, even after mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I love the mint taste of this particular toothpaste. I tried another variety of Arm &amp; Hammer and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good tasting. Also it seems the paste has more grit to it, and does a better job of cleaning than the average toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Tastes like salt.  Lord help me because this is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite and he refuses to change.  The other non-minty one is even more epically salty.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste it makes my mouth feel so refreshed at all times :)&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this a few times and its always worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do drink coffee and stuff and my teeth are very white and I get compliments all the time... I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste leaves your mouth minty fresh and clean. I prefer baking soda toothpaste and this one does not have the peroxide.</li>
    <li> This seems like a great deal if you don&#x27;t read the fine print. The tubes are the smaller size.</li>
    <li> The tubes were small!!!</li>
    <li> The ítem was delivered on time, have a good taste, my Family like it very much</li>
    <li> I had to order my toothpaste via Amazon as for some reason I can know longer find my toothpaste on the shelf? It is the best toothpaste I have found for really and truly cleaning your teeth.</li>
