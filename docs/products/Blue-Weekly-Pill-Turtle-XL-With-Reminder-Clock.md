      <li>I love the pill box!</li>
      <li>Great price, fast shipping and good product!</li>
      <li>My husband is great about remembering to take his morning medications, but it&#x27;s easy for him to forget in the evenings.  </li>
      <li>After awhile of trying to figure out what kind of shenanigans she was up</li>
      <li>It is easy to set, and keeps good time.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>the internet and Amazon had the best price by far.  </li>
      <li>that, unless they are under bright light, I can not tell the difference.      </li>
      <li>in all I&#x27;m very pleased and will buy more for sure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to keep an eye out for a smaller one to use when I travel, but it&#x27;s good for home use, good price and good quality.</li>
      <li>all was on more then 4 med.</li>
      <li>I, like many people, NEVER need to be awakened to take my pill.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>If you need more alarm than pill box, this may not be for you.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Many battery powered alarms have a high pitch which keeps someone with hearing loss from being able to hear it, but for me it works great.  </li>
      <li>so I would be able to easily tell them apart.</li>
      <li>This is a great pill reminder to have at home, not to carry in your purse, as it&#x27;s kind of big.</li>
      <li>turtle shape is good, because it can&#x27;t get hung up on anything on/in the shelf, and I do agree with the one of the reviewers here, that it would be nice if their were one more LED that lit up the day, but then it is only 7 bucks!</li>
      <li>Easy on and off mode.</li>
      <li>Additionally, while it is easy to set the alarms, I have no idea how to cancel one.</li>
      <li>Sturdy, easy to use, and practical</li>
      <li>The time and alarms are relatively easy to set; I did need the instructions, but it was not complicated.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to set up and use.</li>
      <li>Easy to set clock and 4 alarms.</li>
      <li>SO IT IS EASY TO MISS.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>IT IS EASY TO SET THE TIMERS.</li>
      <li>and they are slanted for easy accessibility.</li>
      <li>This works fine and easy to set the clock.  </li>
      <li>You can fit up to 26 or 27 Tylenol caplets in each compartment</li>
      <li>However before I ordered I e-mailed  the seller and asked them to make sure the two would be distinctly differant colors</li>
      <li>Moreover, I hoped that the user could choose between having either an audible alarm sound or a visible flashing light.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with device</li>
      <li>He is happy to have a blue one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually really impressed with this design, for no more than it cost.</li>
      <li>I got this for my grandmother and at first she said it was ok.</li>
      <li>but it was not user friendly for the elders</li>
      <li>I am still debating whether or not to try to clean it up &amp; see if it will be useful.  </li>
      <li>item arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d really love to see more sizes as this one was a bit too big for the amount of pills I take each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The condition was fine but way too large for what I need.</li>
      <li>It is nice, hope it can be smaller size.</li>
      <li>If you need a pill box with multiple alarms, this will work nicely.  </li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s pretty spacious if you take a lot of meds.</li>
      <li>For most people, I do expect this device works out quite well in keeping medication administration times very regular</li>
      <li>Would recommend as a good item to buy for anyone having trouble taking medication</li>
      <li>If I really needed that, I could always try one of the more expensive and more sophisticated designs here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The green box we received, and were alllowed to keep because shipping the return was more than the cost of the product, worked fine.</li>
      <li>This is fine for pill storage, but the timer is so quiet I rarely hear it when it goes off.</li>
      <li>Such would be wonderful for the deaf as well as those who are hard of hearing.  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s start on a positive note:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>By the time we were aware of the problem my return window was way passed, and who knows how much this screwed up my grandmother&#x27;s health.</li>
      <li>I like the larger size compartments which easily hold the number of pills I need</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big and easily fits the 20+</li>
      <li>, this is too large to travel with.</li>
      <li>It was just too large for our needs.</li>
      <li>(Provided they keep this device reasonably nearby their person at all times and remember to habitually,</li>
      <li>I can change the time it goes off, but not whether or not it goes off, which is VERY irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perhaps there is someone who sells some sort of alarm with a flashing reminder light that can catch the user&#x27;s attention in an instant, thereby reminding the user to go look at the unlit display on the &#x27;Turtle&#x27;.</li>
      <li>, I wish it had a back light on the lid itself.  </li>
      <li>really didn&#x27;t need but got the instructions with the unit;</li>
      <li>so they only sound when you want them too</li>
      <li>pills I take daily (and could even fit more).&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product is well made at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>VERY HELPFUL .</li>
      <li>; THE ALARMS...?!??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to be able to turn the alarm off on the days that I remember my pills without assistance, but apparently that&#x27;s not possible.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, but included batteries were dead!</li>
      <li>Compartments are big enough to carry many pills almost and size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ever many times you need it to go back on duty, for the next alarm.</li>
      <li>The LCD screen lights up which is useful at night when it&#x27;s totally dark.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty simply really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered it for my 94 year old father and there is no way he could hear the alarm.  </li>
      <li>For me, the volume is perfect...but for the elderly or hearing impaired, it wouldn&#x27;t be loud enough.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think the alarm is loud.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> He kept forgetting to take his pills.  Set the alarm for bedtime &amp; now he HAS to pick it up to stop the alarm (&amp; so takes his pills) AND it keeps him on bedtime (when he&#x27;s behaving!)</li>
    <li> item arrived quickly. Time will tell if the pill turtle will hold up to every day usage. The compartment lids seem rather flimsy like they&#x27;ll only take so much opening and closing before they snap off. But hey, for the price I can&#x27;t complain.\\&quot;   Date: May 22, 2010     Rated by Buyer: John L.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on the small size. However, when it arrived it was green, not blue as shown, and much larger than advertised. Seller was cooperative and refunded our money. The green box we received, and were alllowed to keep because shipping the return was more than the cost of the product, worked fine. It was just too large for our needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some reviews are complaining about this product! I just got mine and it&#x27;s everything i hoped for if not even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Option of setting 4 different alarms a day.&lt;br /&gt;- If you didn&#x27;t turn off the alarm for any reason it will turn off automatically after a couple of minutes but will actually keep on flashing to notify you that you&#x27;ve missed it, which is really useful when you forget if you actually took the pill or not.&lt;br /&gt;- The LCD screen lights up which is useful at night when it&#x27;s totally dark.&lt;br /&gt;- Alarm is not so loud nor low. Just perfect unless you&#x27;re deaf.&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to use. I set mine up without even reading the manual.&lt;br /&gt;- Compartments are big enough to carry many pills almost and size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;d really love to see more sizes as this one was a bit too big for the amount of pills I take each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m very pleased and will buy more for sure.</li>
    <li> This was much larger than expected. The condition was fine but way too large for what I need. It is a great price for the size and quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my wife&#x27;s father, he take a lot of pills everyday, so I thought this item will organize his time cure, he got so happy with this item</li>
    <li> The pill box \\&quot;alarm\\&quot; works great, but one of the pill box doors broke in a day or so... Kinda weak plastic, other than that it works good...</li>
    <li> This is fine for pill storage, but the timer is so quiet I rarely hear it when it goes off. I&#x27;m only 30, so I can imagine that older folks might have issues hearing it as well. (or possibly mine is slightly defective).</li>
    <li> This was useless.  The alarm is so low that I could barely hear it.  I ordered it for my 94 year old father and there is no way he could hear the alarm.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to help me keep track of my medications daily. It has four alarm times that can be entered and, once set, it doesn&#x27;t have to be reset each time. The alarm is loud enough to be heard in another room unless a person has hearing loss.  Many battery powered alarms have a high pitch which keeps someone with hearing loss from being able to hear it, but for me it works great.  The alarm does blink if a person doesn&#x27;t hear the alarm and will continue to blink until you hit the \\&quot;alarm off\\&quot; button.  Great price, fast shipping and good product!</li>
    <li> Works great! Great price! Keeps me on track with medication times. The alarm is loud enough that I can always hear when it goes off even if TV or radio is on.&lt;br /&gt;You can set the alarm to go off four different times throughout the day. When it is time for your medication, the alarm will automatically will beep for one minute then stop..Or, I can also hit alarm the alarm off button to stop it. It will not go off again until your next scheduled time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if your trying to maintain a medication schedule for multiple medications. Also, You could also use the multiple alarm feature for any scheduled reminders such as maintaining a meal times.</li>
    <li> Great buy, reminds our son to take his medicine every morning!</li>
    <li> I rate this 3.5 stars. I didn&#x27;t bother to read the dimensions of this product before ordering. It is much larger than I expected. It is 8 inches long, about 4.3 inches wide and about 1 inch in height. Pros: You can set up to 4 alarms to ring automatically daily or for one time alert. The volume on the alarm is good. Easy on and off mode. You can fit up to 26 or 27 Tylenol caplets in each compartment so it&#x27;s pretty spacious if you take a lot of meds. I lowered the rating because I wanted something smaller that I can also use when I travel, this is too large to travel with. Also, I&#x27;m not sure how Secure the lock on the lid is, wish they had a different locking device perhaps a button you push in. I wouldn&#x27;t throw it in my bag, afraid it will open and all my pills will fall out and get mixed up. The raised letter marking showing day of week is difficult to see in the dark, I wish it had a back light on the lid itself.  However, it is good for your bedside table. BTW, it was extremely difficult to open the battery compartment. I had to wait for my husband to come home and open it. You have to remove the film from the battery area in order to set up the clock and alarm. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with device and I&#x27;m keeping it. I&#x27;m going to keep an eye out for a smaller one to use when I travel, but it&#x27;s good for home use, good price and good quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great pill reminder to have at home, not to carry in your purse, as it&#x27;s kind of big. It&#x27;s about 8 inches long and 4.50 inches wide.  It is easy to set, and keeps good time. The only down side is that the alarm&#x27;s sound is very low.  Seniors with a hearing problem would hardly hear it.  The good thing is that when it rings the clock area lights up, so if you keep it close to you there is no problem.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The product is just as stated, I have not had a medication accident since I recieved the turtles. I bought two one for day and one for night pills.      However before I ordered I e-mailed  the seller and asked them to make sure the two would be distinctly differant colors so I would be able to easily tell them apart. They replied no problem.  I was sent a green and a blue that, unless they are under bright light, I can not tell the difference.      I do worry this could lead to errors in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the pill box! The compartments are much larger than my old pill box. Comes with batteries. Easy to set clock and 4 alarms.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, easy to use, and practical</li>
    <li> This product, the pill holder with an alarm, is great. The only drawback to this product is that, sometimes the holder will open and my pills spill into my purse. Otherwise I love it.</li>
    <li> My husband is great about remembering to take his morning medications, but it&#x27;s easy for him to forget in the evenings.  Since getting this, he hasn&#x27;t missed any.  The alarm is loud enough, but not too loud.  Easy to set up and use.</li>
    <li> This works fine and easy to set the clock.  The only down side is that the beeper reminder is not very loud.</li>
    <li> The pill organizers work great for our senior citizens,  Helps the to remember to take their medication of a timely manner.</li>
    <li> This is PERFECT for what I have been looking for.  Our son, who is 17, suffers from a seizure disorder and on top of that has dyslexia and has a hard time remembering to take his medicine.  This is PERFECT for him.  This will help him be consistant in taking his meds to avoid the seizures.</li>
    <li> This was not quite what I was expecting.  I, like many people, NEVER need to be awakened to take my pill. Rather I&#x27;m supposed to wait until after I&#x27;ve finished sleeping and then take it.  Therefore, I was hoping that this device&#x27;s &#x27;flashing reminder&#x27; was, for example, an ATTENTION-GETTING little red light that could be seen as one walked past.  Moreover, I hoped that the user could choose between having either an audible alarm sound or a visible flashing light. Such would be wonderful for the deaf as well as those who are hard of hearing.  For most people, I do expect this device works out quite well in keeping medication administration times very regular (Provided they keep this device reasonably nearby their person at all times and remember to habitually, AND without fail, check to see if the little black flag at the top of the display is blinking), .  Perhaps there is someone who sells some sort of alarm with a flashing reminder light that can catch the user&#x27;s attention in an instant, thereby reminding the user to go look at the unlit display on the &#x27;Turtle&#x27;.</li>
    <li> It is nice, hope it can be smaller size.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start on a positive note:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s big and easily fits the 20+ pills I take daily (and could even fit more).&lt;br /&gt;- The time and alarms are relatively easy to set; I did need the instructions, but it was not complicated.&lt;br /&gt;- I like the fact that it turns off after a minute or so and then keeps blinking instead.&lt;br /&gt;- For me, the volume is perfect...but for the elderly or hearing impaired, it wouldn&#x27;t be loud enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor issues:&lt;br /&gt;- The battery slot is almost impossible to open. I eventually has to use to a pocket knife.&lt;br /&gt;- My other pill box has insertable dividers, to keep morning/evening pills separated; and given the large capacity of each slot, this would be a big benefit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAJOR ISSUE: Either my unit&#x27;s &amp;#34;ALM OFF&amp;#34; button doesn&#x27;t work as it should, or there&#x27;s a fundamental flaw with the design, because THERE DOESN&#x27;t SEEM TO BE ANY WAY TO &amp;#34;UN-SET&amp;#34; THE ALARMS...?!??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to be able to turn the alarm off on the days that I remember my pills without assistance, but apparently that&#x27;s not possible. I also thought I&#x27;d use one alarm as a morning alarm on weekdays only...but once set, I&#x27;ll get it on weekends, holidays, forever and ever. I can change the time it goes off, but not whether or not it goes off, which is VERY irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If customer service or anyone else wants to contact me and tell me if I&#x27;m doing something wrong, I would appreciate it and would be glad to edit my review accordingly)</li>
    <li> This is a bigger pill box so there is plenty of room for big sized meds,vitamins etc. I think the alarm is loud. I put it in a bathroom and even with the door closed I could hear it. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> When I opened the container, the items were obviously quite old.  I had ordered 2 of these.  They both were &amp;#34;new in package&amp;#34; but the packaging had wear on it.  They come with batteries and one was fine and works as expected, the other was old enough that the batteries had leaked inside and was unusable out of the box.  I am still debating whether or not to try to clean it up &amp; see if it will be useful.  I left this feedback for the seller and they did try to contact me, I assume to remedy the situation and probably offer to send a new one.  If this was a more expensive item I would probably do that, but it turns out this alarm isn&#x27;t useful for my mom, so I am moving on to a different product.  If you need a pill box with multiple alarms, this will work nicely.  If you need more alarm than pill box, this may not be for you.  Since it isn&#x27;t that expensive we gave it a try.  I may end up using it for my supplements instead of mom&#x27;s medicine.</li>
    <li> still working like a charm</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, but included batteries were dead!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd one of these that i have had.  I love it.  It keeps me on track with my schedules and my medications.</li>
    <li> alarm is so quiet it is of no use.Very disappointed</li>
    <li> This pillbox is not the easiest one to fill. The end compartments interfere with the ability of the abutting compartments to open. Additionally, while it is easy to set the alarms, I have no idea how to cancel one. I had to set two of them to the same time to stop the second alarm (of four) from sounding. Still, it does help me to take my meds every day which is the reason I purchased it.</li>
    <li> The order has arrived in time(Amazon.com!!!).Like advertised but too big to carry.It is not practical to take it with you when you travel somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mahir</li>
    <li> Yeah - it would be great if it yelled at me in a Siri voice, and slapped me upside the head, to remind me to take my meds, but seriously folks it&#x27;s only 7 bucks or so!!! Give it a break!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t need but got the instructions with the unit; one trick for responding to an alarm is to hit \\&quot;ALM OFF\\&quot;, and then to immediately push Mode once or how ever many times you need it to go back on duty, for the next alarm. Pretty simply really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The turtle shape is good, because it can&#x27;t get hung up on anything on/in the shelf, and I do agree with the one of the reviewers here, that it would be nice if their were one more LED that lit up the day, but then it is only 7 bucks! If I really needed that, I could always try one of the more expensive and more sophisticated designs here on Amazon. I&#x27;m actually really impressed with this design, for no more than it cost. Regular pill boxes cost the same down at my local pharmacy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son. It is great. the alarm has helped him to remind him to take his pills. it is also small enough to take on the camping trip. love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a blind women as a reminder to take her medication.  It was very complicated for her.</li>
    <li> I have actually had this pill reminder for sometime and recently bought a couple as gifts for friends.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I would do without the \\&quot;timed\\&quot; reminders that it is time to get my meds.&lt;br /&gt;I have it set for the two times I use it, and could set it for up to four times. I use it when traveling, as it is a convenient size to pack.</li>
    <li> If I had to do over again I would not get this.  I have since started using my iPhones reminder feature.  I wanted something that would remind me and it does when I am at home.  If I am not home when the alarm sounds it is not sounding by the time that I get back.</li>
    <li> VERY HELPFUL . I SOMETIMES FORGET TO TAKE MY HEART MEDICINE 2X A DAY. THE ONLY THING I WISH IS THAT THE ALARM WAS LOUDER. IF YOU ARE NOT IN THE ROOM YOU WILL NOT HEAR IT. OTHERWISE IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT. IT IS EASY TO SET THE TIMERS. ALARM SHUTS OFF AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE SO IT IS EASY TO MISS.</li>
    <li> I have very good hearing.  With the Pill Turtle three feet away from me I could almost hear it.  I bought it for the alarm!&lt;br /&gt;Am returning it.  So sad.</li>
    <li> Works well for not forgetting afternoon medications.  Would recommend as a good item to buy for anyone having trouble taking medication</li>
    <li> The product is well made at a reasonable price. Elderly people will have difficulty hearing the very low high pitched alarm. Unfortunately we will not be able to use it.</li>
    <li> i got this for my sister for Christmas because she has MS and constantly forgets to take her meds... she loves it, and uses it daily!!!</li>
    <li> The price was very reasonable.  I like the larger size compartments which easily hold the number of pills I need and they are slanted for easy accessibility.</li>
    <li> I love it I actually boughtb2 one for my hubby</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one for years that I bought a a home store, BB&amp;B,  They no longer carry it and my husband wanted one for himself.  I search the internet and Amazon had the best price by far.  He is happy to have a blue one.  The fact that it has a clock and 4 reminder alarms that you can set, turn on and off so they only sound when you want them too is a bonus for us.</li>
    <li> I got this for my grandmother and at first she said it was ok. She didn&#x27;t love it because she thought the alarm was slightly annoying and she didn&#x27;t need it, but she has been forgetting to take her medicine about half the time for a several years now. The alarm really isn&#x27;t that bad though and it stops in a reasonable amount of time and switches to a light. Honestly we all thought  it was just wonderful for awhile. after a few weeks though we realized she had been having issues with her pills, we were finding that some days had the wrong ones in them, and we kept finding pills on the table and floor. After awhile of trying to figure out what kind of shenanigans she was up to we realized that the wednesday tab on the pill turtle was broken and wouldn&#x27;t stay closed. So every time she dumped her day&#x27;s pills into her hand, the wednesday pills would fall out as well either into her hands with the others (a very dangerous problem considering that she is on blood thinners) and if she noticed she would just put some pills back in (rarely the correct ones). When my mom figured out the problem my grandma said &amp;#34; Oh yeah that one day has never stayed down it just pops back open,&amp;#34; but she isn&#x27;t a complainer so she hadn&#x27;t mentioned it to anyone until then. By the time we were aware of the problem my return window was way passed, and who knows how much this screwed up my grandmother&#x27;s health. So frustrating!</li>
    <li> I purchased I think 4 from amazon and 2 from wal-mart&lt;br /&gt;I hosted our family reunion and I created gift bags for the 6 elders in our family all was on more then 4 med. which they took 1 to 2 times a day and I thought this would be a great item for the to help them keep up but it was not user friendly for the elders so it was a waste of money for me so...no i would not recommend it</li>
