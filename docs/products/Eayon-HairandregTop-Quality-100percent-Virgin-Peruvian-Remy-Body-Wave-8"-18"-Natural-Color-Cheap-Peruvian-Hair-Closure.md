<li> Oh very little shedding.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;m keeping these suckers, I&#x27;ll work with it.</li>
<li> Use it  at least 3 rows up.</li>
<li> Hair shed bad.</li>
<li> this hair &amp; the hair base can&#x27;t wait to make my lace unit !!!</li>
<li> Worst inconvenience had in my life and will never order again.</li>

    <li> The hair is mega soft, and it stays straight through the rain. The knots on the closure is darker than my scalp. So i had to do makeup method using really light poweder. Such a pretty unit. Love!</li>
    <li> I have had this closure for 9 months. It is doing well, I&#x27;ve bleached the knots twice, I&#x27;ve bleached the hair itself twice, and I&#x27;ve dyed it black 3 times. I wash it every week with silicon mix shampoo and conditioner. I will say that once I bleached it, it did lose its loose wave pattern, but it&#x27;s still holding up. I have experienced no shedding, I did sew ithe onto a wig and I love it, although it only holds a curl for about 4 hours</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been able to manage this hair very well. I&#x27;ve washed and dyed this closure and its still like new. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t hold a strong curl like my other hair. But it could be my flat iron. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> hair has a lot of gray hairs though.&lt;br /&gt;but i&#x27;ll dye it&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much for the good customer service</li>
    <li> Even though the shipping sucked..it arrived 2 days after expected shipping date. Ordered may 2nd got here may 8th. The hair it self is soft, medium luster,thick and nice size. Its about 12\13in in natural state stretched measured 14/15in, good buy cant wait to sew it in and dye it</li>
    <li> I purchased this closure on Thursday.  It arrived on Friday thanks to prime.  It came out of the package with no smell, very few gray strands and very soft.  I washed it and conditoned it and got even softer.  I will install it today.  Oh very little shedding.  only one or two strands during washing.  NO shedding during combing and brushing.</li>
    <li> Worst inconvenience had in my life and will never order again.</li>
    <li> I absolute LOVE this hair &amp; the hair base can&#x27;t wait to make my lace unit !!! Hair is so so soft &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell !!!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying from this vendor again !!!!! The packaging was something to be desired but afterall it is just&lt;br /&gt;packaging  !!! :-)</li>
    <li> If you have fat feet don&#x27;t get these. I have fat feet but I&#x27;m keeping these suckers, I&#x27;ll work with it. The buckle is attached to something else.</li>
    <li> Good quality , nice texture .</li>
    <li> I needed a closure for my virgin Brazilian extensions. This piece blended very well. I have washed it and I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding. There are a few short strands throughout but all in all its a great piece.</li>
    <li> I just got it. I will say this. Don&#x27;t use it in the back. Use it  at least 3 rows up. It will nap up. Not bad hair at all . No shed. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Not sure what the problem was for other users but I have ordered hair from this vendor on three separate occasions and all I can say is that This hair is great!  My experience has been good and I&#x27;ve had no problems when washing the hair.  Perfect and the best deal going....  I&#x27;ll be ordering again for sure!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a lace-front closure.  I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.  It looks really natural and full.  The color blended well with the Peruvian extensions I bought.  I love how there are little highlights in the hair as well.  I will be purchasing a second piece for another style with color.</li>
    <li> The hair is beautiful .And the closure actually looks better in person . I have not installed it . This closure is better quality than one I paid more the twice the price of this one . Will buy again .</li>
    <li> OK quality had for over a month now little tangling but doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for anything</li>
    <li> Its amazing. It looks great. Feels great. Smells wonderful. Soft. No tangling or shedding. Best online hair purchase ever.</li>
