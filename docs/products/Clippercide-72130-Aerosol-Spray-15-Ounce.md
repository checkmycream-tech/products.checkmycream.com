      <li>Works spray pattern is fairly wide but flow is strong enough to clear and lubricate.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I found that after a while,not only did my electric trimmers gum up and rust(sometimes completely shut!), they also would nick me and my skin would get infected.</li>
      <li>All that&#x27;s needed is a few short blasts to loosen every thing up and a clean cloth to wipe it off.</li>

    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
    <li> Has a weird smell and foamy discahrge isn&#x27;t powerful</li>
    <li> Works well. We use it on both dog clippers and people clippers. Make sure to read the instructions for how to best utilize the product for sanitation purposes.</li>
    <li> Last forever , oils and disinfects all at same time. Used this for years and it last for years .</li>
    <li> I know of no product better.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is totally unoffensive. I trust that it&#x27;s effective (along with keeping blades free of debris) and the size is the perfect balance of economic size that&#x27;s still easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Very much recommended.</li>
    <li> Huge can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should be a no brainer to use this stuff to keep your clippers like new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also makes them smell like a barber shop.. if you like that</li>
    <li> Removes everything from the blades and makes them shiny. All that&#x27;s needed is a few short blasts to loosen every thing up and a clean cloth to wipe it off. Even worked on some dirty clippers that I threw into storage.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> keeps my Wahl Peanut running smoothly and disinfected. It&#x27;s a must for electric shavers</li>
    <li> A little on the pricey side but it works great and has 5 in 1 can&#x27;t go wrong there.</li>
    <li> This product works ok.  Very strong alcohol smell,  Seems to do the job and the price was right.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> best clipper spray there is. i&#x27;m a pro groomer.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean up after I cut my hair.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful for all my clippers and sprays like magic.</li>
    <li> Perfect  as advised. The spray is a lot bigger in person that what you think .... so there is plenty in this bottle...especially for personal use. Great value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product works great</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, it does a wonderful job cleaning my clippers and other grooming tools a must must have.</li>

    <li> This performed in every way.  Keeps my clipper cool and clean without a greasy residue.  I could use this spray and keep on cutting.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Keeps my Norelco fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Works spray pattern is fairly wide but flow is strong enough to clear and lubricate.&lt;br /&gt;Good size.</li>
    <li> This is the type of spray salons use to treat and condition their electric clippers. I found that after a while,not only did my electric trimmers gum up and rust(sometimes completely shut!), they also would nick me and my skin would get infected. Not so with this! Just spray and they are disinfected/lubricated.</li>
    <li> This item works very well, has a strong spray stream and good price point. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
