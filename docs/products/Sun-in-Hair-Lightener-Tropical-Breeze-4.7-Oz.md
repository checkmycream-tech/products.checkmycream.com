<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love using sun in on my hair.  It realy works well with the hair dryer for me.....thank you for the product.  II</li>
    <li> Luv it, the delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> As a young child I had almost white hair, by the time I was a teen it turned a beautiful medium golden blonde. Then by my late twenties it became what I would call a rather unattractive dishwater blonde/light mousy brown. I began using regular sun-n which helped a little but not enough. When I found the super sun-in I used it and I love it!  It turns my hair back to the beautiful golden blonde it used to be when I was in my teens and early twenties! I usually use it once or twice and that is enough! I have been using it for almost twenty five years now with no damage or trouble with my hair and I am always getting compliments on the color of my hair. It gives it a beautiful golden shine. About two years ago when I turned 52 i started getting a few gray hairs creeping in on top.The lady who cuts my hair just told me to keep using the sun in instead of dying it and the lighter shades would help the gray hairs not stand out. She is right after I use the sun in you cannot see any gray hairs. I don&#x27;t know how much longer I&#x27;ll be able to get away with this, but I&#x27;m happy for now!</li>
    <li> I used to use this as a teenager and had great results! Just got some in the mail to try again and am already noticing my hair is lighter!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use Keratin in your hair with these products though. Helps to restore any damage in can do. Also remember to not use too much. It DOES contain hydrogen peroxide, so if you use too much at once you are going to damage your hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazingly with a blow dryer, it works and all but will damage your hair so bad, do not buy! Go have your hair professionally done. My hair is so damage from this product. I used to have beautiful hair and now I have to start from scratch again to renew it:( taking forever. DON&#x27;T BUY! You&#x27;ll be sry, I sure am.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Gives me a nice honey blonde color (I have natural light brown hair) without frying my hair and smells great.</li>
    <li> The people are honest and good, if made mistake they will fix it, not like others that say they will and don&#x27;t! The item I got was very colorful and pretty, just wrong item, but loved it. No ones fault easy mistake, They do have great items for sale. You cant go wrong with these people.. I know I am now a believer and love their stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you And God bless</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice and it is already lighter. It&#x27;s also reAlly easy to use. The only downfall is that it takes forever to dry!</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair and after using this product for a few weeks, my hair is slighter and feels the same as before. Great way to avoid bleaching and still have great summery highlights.</li>
    <li> Not the one I wanted but still works</li>
    <li> Makes the dishwater blond light blond again!</li>
    <li> Is not the product pictured.</li>
    <li> I have brown hair, it turns black in the winter. Never dyed my hair before my life. I used this from June or July to September. I have gotten so many compliments. It brings out the natural red highlights I had in my hair and I got asked even by my own mother and best friends if I dyed my hair. My boyfriend keeps saying &amp;#34;wow you have so much red in your hair&amp;#34; I love it. I normally use it after showering and it&#x27;s heat activated so I would blow dry my hair and go have fun in the sun (if I&#x27;m outside that day) it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
    <li> Worked really well with my hair</li>
    <li> I am medium- dark ash blonde. I used to have very light blonde hair. But it is getting darker. I changed my hair color into red then it was hard to turn to blonde. I colored it to light brown and let it grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spreyed a little to front hair  and used hair dryer nothing changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I spreyed more and went to pool stayed 30 min! it looks very natural just like in the pic. Only with one try. I liked it. :)</li>
    <li> Great stuff, especially if you don&#x27;t want to color your hair!  This is like rushing up the sun!</li>
    <li> i have very dark hair and it really worked it turned it a light brown and it didnt damage my hair at all it acually conditioned it i would get it again the only side affect i can see is that i seem to have lost the abillity to use puncuaition i dont know why</li>
    <li> Good seller&lt;br /&gt;And good product</li>
    <li> I use this product only on my crown twice a week and develop it with a blow dryer.  Works great!</li>
