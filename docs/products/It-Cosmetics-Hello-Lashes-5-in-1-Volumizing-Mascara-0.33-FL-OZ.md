      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>oh so nicely.  </li>
      <li>The price was the best I found anywhere and would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>(IT&#x27;s available at Ultra - the full-coverage CC Cream is also amazing!)</li>
      <li>Great Product &amp; Quick delivery</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does provide incredible length to medium to long lashes and provides a beautiful fluttery effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smudges very, very easily.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good mascara!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.  </li>
      <li>IT mascara is the best I&#x27;ve used so far to lift and separate without clumping your lashes.  </li>
      <li>Also with this formula and brush the lashes can be fanned out full or swept outward towards the corners of the eye for a real sexy look.</li>
      <li>Long gorgeous lashes, no irritation, just perfect.</li>
      <li>Love it and love it more that it is not tested on animals!</li>
      <li>I liked that it comes off easy with just soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I liked that it went on easy, didn&#x27;t clump.</li>

      <li>I really love this mascara, it plumps, thickens, and curls my lashes</li>
      <li>okay.</li>

      <li>so you can see what just one coat of this magic stuff can do</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>why do I love this?  </li>
      <li>I love the bulb tip to push up my lashes after applying a coat.</li>

      <li>So many compliments</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s more of a plastic bristle.</li>
      <li>This formula holds the lashes up all day and the eye appears to be opened wider giving you a fresh, rested, bright eyed, look.</li>
      <li>is my biggest complaints about most mascaras</li>

      <li>Great for purse, gym bag, office back up.......</li>
      <li>The brush is amazing at getting every lash covered and if you hold the brush vertically and use the ball to lift ur lashes straight up you can throw ur lash &amp;#34;breaking&amp;#34; curler in the garbage.</li>
      <li>it performs better and give a nice long, natural and beautiful effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It eliminates my having to curl first, and I can see my lovely curled lashes.  </li>

      <li>Worth the money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t live up to its claims.  I find other mascaras at half the price do a better job at adding volume.  I&#x27;ll stick with my Clinique product in the future.</li>
    <li> its just like the mascara I buy in the drugstore, nothing special.</li>
    <li> The product showed up with no tip on the mascara. When I called them they were very defensive, wanting me to turn around and pay to ship it back and at that point they would make there determination. Needless to say they said I returned it used and empty? well I said it was broke when I got it, I had it sent back within 2 weeks or so and if anyone uses mascara, it is, I think impossible to EMPTY a tube of mascara in that time. Then they added that the box was tore up, well I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to come broke. Not a nice company at all!!!</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! My lashes look considerably thicker and longer. Does not flake off to give that raccoon look mid day💕</li>
    <li> I found this comparable to Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash Mascara, but for over $20 a tube and I didn&#x27;t care for it. I found the brush to be nothing special and it didn&#x27;t do anything to build my lashes in length or fullness. At the slightest sign of moisture or sweat on my face and the mascara left black dots on my eyelids and under eye area. It ran and I had raccoon eyes. It took only seconds for this to happen. I don&#x27;t know if it did condition my lashes because I didn&#x27;t use it for any length of time due to the product running. I only used it for about a week and then I&#x27;d had enough, so if it does encourage your lashes to grow, I didn&#x27;t notice anything in the short time that I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a HUGE fan of It Cosmetics. I love the powder, the blush, the brow power and I had really high hopes for this product, but it did not meet my expectations and was nothing like the other products in measurable quality. I am very disappointed as I thought this product would be as fabulous as the other It cosmetics, but this is one I&#x27;ll have to pass on.</li>
    <li> The Applicator takes a little getting used to, but I rea like this mascara. I had a tiny spot mid left eye without lashes. I dont know why, they just stopped coming in there. It had been there for about 6 years.  After a month using this, I&#x27;m actually growing new lashes there. I&#x27;m astounded!! I love the way the mascara feels, as well.&lt;br /&gt;It is not waterproof, nor is it smudge proof.</li>
    <li> Great mascara!  Makes my eyelashes long and full!</li>
    <li> I have learned that a good mascara is well worth the extra $ - it has kept my lashes much healthier. When I&#x27;ve gone back to a discount brand, they seem to break off when I wash. As to the IT brand, I really Love IT! The mascara is highly pigmented, so one coat of black is really noticeable. They separate and curl up like nothing I&#x27;ve ever experienced before. I am a contact lense wearer, so I&#x27;m very careful not to rub my eyes, but I have never had a bit of flaking or smearing. I did not purchase from this provider, so I cannot speak to that (IT&#x27;s available at Ultra - the full-coverage CC Cream is also amazing!)</li>
    <li> Hello Lashes came as a gift when I bought other products from It Cosmetics. The mascara did not have enough products to apply at the lashes.(Maybe because it was a free gift?) Anyways, when I swirl the brush in the bottle to get more mascara on the brush, the little ball tip gets chunky but nothing at the main brush part.&lt;br /&gt;I tried two days and threw it away cause it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> First - It helps to use Latisse to get your lashes as long as possible - I order the generic of it (Careprost or one of the many others) on line for very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The IT mascara is the best I&#x27;ve used so far to lift and separate without clumping your lashes.  I usually first put a tiny-tiny bit of lotion on my lashes, then curl,  then apply the mascara.  Works for me.  I like the comment someone made about finishing off the application with a water proof mascara  as that would definitely end the raccoon ideas that (if you&#x27;re not careful) can appear by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;One other important tip about using this or really any other mascara is: WARM IT UP FIRST.  Run the tube under very hot water, dry it so you don&#x27;t get water mixed in with it - and it will apply beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;Patti</li>
    <li> Love this. Lashes are long. Someone asked me if I had false eyelashes on! I recommend</li>
    <li> This mascara gets everywhere.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was going to make a difference in my lashes. It was clumpy and akward. I do not think it worked any better than the cheap store brands. Keep your money.</li>
    <li> HELLO Lashes is right.  This stuff builds up the lash and then the little ball tip really adds length to the ends of the lashes.  I&#x27;m sold , totally sold.</li>
    <li> Love it and love it more that it is not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> My lashes look really long, long, long!  It&#x27;s as though I curled them with an eyelash curler (which I gave up years ago)!  Terrific mascara!  Very happy with this purchase and will buy again!</li>
    <li> I liked that it went on easy, didn&#x27;t clump. I liked that it comes off easy with just soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;But I have long eyelashes and it didn&#x27;t stay firm enough, so my longest lashes bent forward at&lt;br /&gt;the tips.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest mascara I have ever used. I love the applicator. Seriously, buy this stuff.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara, very easily applies to all the little bitty lashes too! It can make pretty good lashes out of not much!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my eyes itch a little, but I have sensitive eyes. Good mascara.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara, but I have to wear a sealer with it because it smears too much during the day.  When I wear a sealer, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this mascara for a longtime and amazon has it for a little bit cheaper than buying right off the website. This mascara does work!</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara, it plumps, thickens, and curls my lashes oh so nicely.  The only con on this product is the wand.  Twice so far, within weeks of opening, the tip of the wand (the ball) snaps off into the bottle.  While it is still usable and performs just as good, the little ball makes it easier to get those little bottom lashes.  Overall great product, and I will buy again, but I wish the wand was a bit more sturdy.</li>
    <li> I put off buying this because I had read a few bad reviews both here and on QVC. Now that I have used it I think those reviewers are CRAZY! Like other peices of the It Cosmetics this is outstandingly different! I hate clumpy mascara. I have bought so many brands that have advertised no clumps only to have then do so. The texture of this mascara is so different. It is thick but glides in the lash giving each hair a rich luxurious coat. The other thing that is different is the brush. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the usual bristles. I think it&#x27;s more of a plastic bristle. It has a ball shape at the end. That seems to get to the corner lashes best. I need to take time to watch the videos QVC has about it. As for me I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Worth the money. So many compliments</li>
    <li> I have very long eyelashes and wanted something that was going to make them look even longer. The problem with my lashes are that though they&#x27;re long; they&#x27;re very thin. So I wanted them to look fuller as well. Looking up what I could do without having to weigh between buying expensive and unsure growth serums, or get impossible results that could happen right away - I turned to mascara (I never use to wear any). A distant acquaintance recommended me this product, and I immediately stepped on board upon admiring her eyelashes that were absolutely so stunning that she could do make up commercials herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent almost $20.00 on this little tube, and it was a most horrible decision. It made my eyelashes look just as thin, and it took a long time for it to harden so my lashes could keep its shape. It didn&#x27;t make them look any better. The brush/ball itself had small plastic bristles, and it looked like there wasn&#x27;t enough product going on the brush... which is suppose to be the point of mascara. It would also clump horrendously on the ball. I found this to be very unimpressive. The shipping was very fast, and it got to me okay. I just can&#x27;t say anything positive about this product. Overall, if you want fantastic mascara for good pricing, length, and volume: Maybelline Lash Stiletto.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, and they have a lengthening formula so my eyelashes are longer too!</li>
    <li> The it mascara is good, but not the best!  It leaves clumps, you must use a mascara comb with it.  On the plus side, the tip is great for lower lashes.</li>
    <li> Pretty good mascara! I love the bulb tip to push up my lashes after applying a coat. The only thing is that my eyes are sensitive to it if I put too much on. Other ladies might not be as sensitive as I am. I do reorder it because I love the brush for my thin lashes!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of mascara  and found this one to be the best !!!!  The price was the best I found anywhere and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something new and this did exactly what the label indicated it will do. People think my eyelashes are false, but there mine. I will always have this as a back-up when I don&#x27;t want to wear my cover girl one.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I must say the shipping was slow and the product must of been sitting for a bit but it&#x27;s doing what IT commits do best.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used and will not use any other. I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding a mascara that doesn&#x27;t smear under my eyes, creating &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;.  This one does not smear.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.</li>
    <li> I cannot see that the mascara itself is any better than some brands I have used, but the wand is a breakthrough in design.  It has a tip with bristles longer than the rest, and works so well for the outside corner of my eyes and for separating clumped eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product! I do like this product, but it smudges under the eyes too much to be of any use to me.  By lunch time I am trying to fix my raccoon eyes! You do have to get used to the brush and it&#x27;s definitely manageable. I like the ingredients as well, but I wish it didn&#x27;t smear. The Midwest has too much humidity in the summer for this product. I do love some of the other IT Cosmetics products, but this is not the one for me!</li>
    <li> Just the best. I was a Mabelline pink and green mascara user forever. Bought these on a whim, and was so impressed. Long gorgeous lashes, no irritation, just perfect. I loved it so much I have given it as a gift -- the recipient loved it, too.</li>
    <li> This product did deliver. If you want immediate results, this is the one. Easy to use and almost no clumps. It didn&#x27;t require a lot of product use.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara.  The brush has a rounded tip that helps to get bottom, nose corner, and temple corner lashes separate and lengthened.  Highly recommend trying.</li>
    <li> After menopause I noticed that my lashes weren&#x27;t as long or thick as they use to be. I found that I couldn&#x27;t afford the lengthening serums.  So after researching online I started conditioning them with coconut oil at night and wearing Hello Lashes 5 in 1 mascara for enhancement during the day.  I&#x27;ve been using this method for 1 month and my lashes are softer, thicker and longer then they ever were to begin with. The brush is amazing at getting every lash covered and if you hold the brush vertically and use the ball to lift ur lashes straight up you can throw ur lash &amp;#34;breaking&amp;#34; curler in the garbage. This formula holds the lashes up all day and the eye appears to be opened wider giving you a fresh, rested, bright eyed, look. Also with this formula and brush the lashes can be fanned out full or swept outward towards the corners of the eye for a real sexy look. You can layer this mascara for an ultra glam, fake lash look and it does not clump, which makes it worth it&#x27;s weight in gold right there. It lasts all day, does not flake but will smudge if you rub ur eyes, cry, swim etc. (let&#x27;s be real) and is not highly difficult to remove. I highly recommend it and will definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> It runs so bad !! Hate it</li>
    <li> Perfect mascara.  Great little ball brush at the end to apply products where you want it and help build layers for really dramatic  lashes.  LOVE the small size....Great for purse, gym bag, office back up.......</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews,  I was skeptical and wasn&#x27;t sure how this might perform compared to other \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; brands.&lt;br /&gt;There were some reviewers complaining that the \\&quot;ball\\&quot; tip kept coming off.  I was hoping I would not have a disaster at my hands when this arrived and now I have had it for a while, I am pleasantly surprised by its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be disappointed:&lt;br /&gt;if you expect to swipe this mascara onto your lashes with no smearing or flakes to fall on your bottom lashes or around your eye after a half day of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have short stubby or sparse lashes,  this mascara will provide you with short spidery lashes at its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why its awesome:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does provide incredible length to medium to long lashes and provides a beautiful fluttery effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is phenomenal when layered with other products.  Example,  Base, Mascara and a waterproof coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal experience is when a few waterproof coats are applied,  this stays put.  When it is time to wash off,  it washes off effortlessly without any lash fall out.  Gentleness is the key and each time I have no residue after.  I use normal cream cleanser and it washes it off completely.&lt;br /&gt;No need for harsh eye makeup remover or any in fact,  even with waterproof coating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important facts to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wipe excess goop from the wand... it performs better and give a nice long, natural and beautiful effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be gentle when you take out the wand and put it back,  as it is a bit flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my lashes to be noticeable but beautiful and when I wear this,  I am never in need of a liner.</li>
    <li> I do not wear mascara well.  There were clumping issues.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It smudges very, very easily.  Within a few minutes of application I have black under my eyes.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I try several.  I&#x27;m a huge make up fan. This is extremely recommended!</li>
    <li> did not last long, started drying out shortly after delivery</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom. She loves this mascara. She told me that finally she has nice lashes, when she wears it. I think I&#x27;ll need to buy another for me sometime. Lol. Would recommend buying.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for quite a while.  If you want you eyelashes to look twice as long, this is the mascara for you.  It has the little tip on the end to help get the small eyelashes.  This mascara is the best.  It does not smudge on you. Great Great Great!!!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It took some time to get used to the wand, but I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on qvc and purchased it instantly but to my disappointment it did not make my lashes any longer than what they are. I&#x27;m thinking the models had to be wearing fake lashes. Believe me I wanted this to work. With my excitement I threw away the packaging so now I&#x27;m stuck with it. Wahhhhhhhhhh:(  I&#x27;m giving this a two star for the reason that it&#x27;s not bad, just didn&#x27;t deliver on what it was suppose to do and that was longer looking lashes.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve added a photo so you can see what just one coat of this magic stuff can do (one eye has nothing the other this mascara).  I wear contacts and have had any other problems like with some brands.  Mascara rubbing off under your eye as the day goes on is my biggest complaints about most mascaras but this one stays put.  I&#x27;d recommend to anyone looking to try a new mascara.</li>
    <li> The application brush is awesome&lt;br /&gt;Very happy and will continue to use&lt;br /&gt;This mascara</li>
    <li> This is fair mascara.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.  The ball at the end is hard to use and I kept poking myself in the eye!  But the formula is good for lengthening lashes.  You can find my full review of this product here: [...]</li>
    <li> I did have higher hopes for this. I love the brush but it&#x27;s too goopy and thick and I end up wiping it in a cotten cloth to wipe off the excess. If this came in a waterproof formula I would like it better.</li>
    <li> it doesnt work like they showed on tv!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt curl them, unless i curl them FIRST&lt;br /&gt;i would not recommend it</li>
    <li> wish I would have known it wasn&#x27;t waterproof..&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t order again. easily runs and smears.&lt;br /&gt;the small tip gets clogged up.</li>
    <li> NOTE: I ordered direct from QVC so this is specifically for the \\&quot;hello lashes\\&quot; product itself ordered on that site.&lt;br /&gt;But I felt the need to provide this input because this mascara DOES work as described IF you use it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do I love this?  Because I have the typical Asian stubby downward pointing lashes.  They are thick enough but you can&#x27;t see them.  Heck, even I can&#x27;t see them when I look directly in the mirror at less than 1 foot distance. Sad. I gave up on mascara many years ago because I was tired of having to first curl them a LOT.  And despite all that effort the curl fell by mid-day anyway no matter what formula I used.  Eyeliner became my only friend because it simulated a lash line.  Or at least that is the effect I was aiming for.  So when I say this thing works, it does. For me.  But I had to learn to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT -- take a very close look at the brush. i read other reviews and found there is a reason the brush is designed the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 facets to it.  Obviously the tip/ball.  But the regular brush section has different height bristles for a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The lower height side delivers the first strokes of mascara and allows you to get very close to the base of the lashes without depositing smears on your lid.  So apply using the shorter bristles and sweep to the ends of your lashes.  Practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Then turn the wand to the longer bristles to continue sweeping the just deposited mascara to the very ends of your lashes.  The long bristles will keep it from clumping.  Practice.  I find my lashes start to curl upward at this point.  Swoony!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The ball (make sure you don&#x27;t have excess mascara on it) is used to lift and separate and reach inner and outer lashes.  Hold it vertically and push those lashes up.  They really curl at this point.  Enough to make me gaze lovingly at my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I need to point out that I DO NOT NOT NOT use a lash curling device during any of this.  This is straight \\&quot;hello lashes\\&quot; application only.  One application on each eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional info:&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t pump the wand up and down vigorously before application. I haven&#x27;t needed to because the wand seems to hold a lot properly.  Maybe one pump after first pulling the wand out to begin.  Gently remove excess from the ball (I just wipe gently on the lip of the tube). I find that this one pump is enough for me to apply to 1 eye, all the 3 steps I outlined above.&lt;br /&gt;- I have not needed or desired a second application, but I have read that you can.  It might even say wait 1 minute between applications.  Maybe I&#x27;ll attempt a second coat some time to see the effect.  But I am very happy with just the one.&lt;br /&gt;- I do notice my lashes growing a bit longer.  I was not really counting on that benefit since I was just keen on the short term effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT.  I hope they never stop making this formula or wand.  It eliminates my having to curl first, and I can see my lovely curled lashes.  It stays put all day.  My lashes are still curled the next day (even more so) when I am too lazy to remove it for the night.  Bad habit, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps and works for you!ring any of this.

    <li> Total waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product &amp; Quick delivery</li>
    <li> For the first time in my entire make-up-wearing life, I am buying a THIRD tube of a specific kind of mascara. I have been searching for the perfect mascara for decades and this stuff is IT (that was a pun). The previous reviewer is correct: you MUST use it right. Use the side for applying a base of mascara and then the tip to smoosh your lashes upwards. You do NOT need a curler, your lashes are volumized and lengthened and it lasts all day without flaking of smudging. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find anything special about this mascara.</li>
    <li> Mascara was clumpy and my wand came without the advertised ball on the end for separation. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I returned this item...it seemed like the mascara was previously opened it was so clumpy and dried out..i didnt order a replacement so im not sure if thats just how the mascara is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s magnificent!!! My lashes stands out.  Get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> After 5 hours it crumbles under my eyes leaving a dark circle. It goes on great, so I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I could have purchased something similar, or maybe even better at any drug store.  I do like the wand which gets the little hairs, but outside of that, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I purchased both mascara and liner on QVC a while back but only tried them today.  Although they were never opened both products were dried up and  unusable.  So, don&#x27;t waste your money!    My L&#x27;Oreal mascara works much better and it runs out (eventually) rather than dries out way too soon!</li>
    <li> Not worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I was looking for length and volume. I saw it demonstrated on QVC. I ordered and found the brush is too flexible. I can&#x27;t get a grip on my lashes. Then, it smears. Doesn&#x27;t flake. I believe it is too emolient. I will stick to THEY&#x27;RE REAL.by benefit.</li>
