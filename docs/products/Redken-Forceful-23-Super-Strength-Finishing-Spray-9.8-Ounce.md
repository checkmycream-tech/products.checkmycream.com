<ol>
      <li>....works great!</li>
      <li>Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>the prices look wonderful, but I have found out</li>
      <li>great  hairspray</li>
      <li>Love this hairspray!!</li>
      <li>I also have problems with tolerating the smell of most hairsprays that I have used, but this one has a great scent!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your hair and is a great static guard.  </li>
      <li>Love this spray!</li>
      <li>and I really liked it so</li>
      <li>Nice hold from a woman with very fine hair</li>
      <li>Great spray, keeps hair in place but is still flexible and soft, has a great smell.  </li>
      <li>Arrives quickly and always in great shape.</li>
      <li>/&gt;About two months ago, my stylist used a different spray (that smelled really good) and she told me it was wonderful, terrific, best thing on the market</li>
      <li>I thought the price was also fair and adequate.</li>
      <li>My all time favorite hair spray.</li>
      <li>The top of the can was not locked in place, so at some point it sprayed out.</li>
      <li>Love the hair spray, but the hair spray doesn&#x27;t spray well.</li>
      <li>It could be much better.</li>
      <li>It was okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again at the price.</li>
      <li>Redken Forceful 23 Finishing Spray is one of the best for hold without the stickinessof other sprays.  </li>
      <li>received it very quick.  </li>
      <li>as strong as air.</li>
      <li>I was using a can of ultra fine Tresseme a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is light</li>
      <li>I like this product its a light weight spray.</li>
      <li>Does not make my hair stiff or sticky, yet is holds the style perfectly!</li>
      <li>Love all of Redkin products!&lt;br /&gt;So much easier to find on Amazon!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight, sprays well especially like then turn top.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sprays and this one is far superior to other brands.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not wet when it hits your hair, which is great when I flat iron my bangs.  </li>
      <li>For instance, Redken Rough Paste (#12) smells great - so this product can definitely be improved as well.</li>
      <li>Love this DRY spray</li>
      <li>The scent is very subtle, and because of the very fine mist that comes out, one can lasted more than two weeks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Redkin is a professional produce and worth every $$.&lt;br</li>
      <li>my hair and this spray doesn&#x27;t leave so much residue so that type of styling works well.</li>
      <li>Not too heavy on my hair, and smells nice too.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Forceful 23 for all hair divas that require lift and hold for their hair styles.</li>
      <li>Even with some of the other top brands such as Schwarzkopf Osis, which is priced comparably with Redken, these downsides are there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is a little strong though</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair shiny and not stiff.</li>
      <li>This is a soft hairspray.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, Redken makes the hair look more natural, not too shiny, not too sticky while holding its style firm enough.</li>

<li> Finally a dry hair spray that WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
<li> but if I find I need additional hold, I spray once then let it dry</li>
<li> This product meet my needs with a long, lasting firm hold.</li>
<li> Meanwhile, I have tried other brands for the spray, and just got disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Due to it being flammable, I can&#x27;t return it.  </li>
<li> My only complaint was that when I got the package, the packing was somewhat wet with hair spray.  </li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair.  </li>
<li> I have searched long and hard to find a product that would provide me with the hold I need without making my hair as hard as a rock.</li>
<li> That way I get maxiumum hold without the hair looking stiff or over-sprayed.</li>
<li> Poor service.</li>
<li> When it ran out, I tried the product I had previously been using and was very unhappy</li>
<li> so I bought a bottle -- and hated it.</li>

    <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used. I finger-style my hair and this spray doesn&#x27;t leave so much residue so that type of styling works well.</li>
    <li> holds nothing. as strong as air.</li>

    <li> received it very quick.  Love the hair spray, but the hair spray doesn&#x27;t spray well.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this on me quite a while back and I really liked it so a bought a bottle. When it ran out, I tried the product I had previously been using and was very unhappy so I reverted back to this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two months ago, my stylist used a different spray (that smelled really good) and she told me it was wonderful, terrific, best thing on the market so I bought a bottle -- and hated it. Reverted back to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light but if I find I need additional hold, I spray once then let it dry and then spray again. That way I get maxiumum hold without the hair looking stiff or over-sprayed. I wish it were cheaper since I keep looking at the brands in the superstore where I shop and the prices look wonderful, but I have found out this is one area I want splurge on and get what works.</li>
    <li> I have been using Redken products (paste, shampoo, etc.) for a long time, and ahve been using this spray for a while now. Meanwhile, I have tried other brands for the spray, and just got disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, Redken makes the hair look more natural, not too shiny, not too sticky while holding its style firm enough. That is a big plus. Even with some of the other top brands such as Schwarzkopf Osis, which is priced comparably with Redken, these downsides are there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just taking one star off for the smell. It could be much better. For instance, Redken Rough Paste (#12) smells great - so this product can definitely be improved as well.</li>

    <li> great  hairspray It leaves your hair shiny and not stiff.</li>
    <li> Great spray, keeps hair in place but is still flexible and soft, has a great smell.  I would receommend it and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this DRY spray....works great!</li>
    <li> This is a soft hairspray.  Not sticky. I will purchase again.  I thought the price was also fair and adequate.</li>
    <li> Love this spray! Not too heavy on my hair, and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every hairspray out there and I always come back to Redkin 23.  I normally curl my medium length hair and this spray keeps my shape all day and never leaves it stiff.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite hair spray. Does not make my hair stiff or sticky, yet is holds the style perfectly!</li>
    <li> Finally a dry hair spray that WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;Good bye Tresseme!  Hello Redkin 23!!  I used Tresseme for yewrs and always felt like I had Helmet Head, even with a lighter application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not wet when it hits your hair, which is great when I flat iron my bangs.  The scent is very subtle, and because of the very fine mist that comes out, one can lasted more than two weeks. I was using a can of ultra fine Tresseme a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redkin is a professional produce and worth every $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this produce and toss everything else!</li>
    <li> It was okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again at the price.</li>
    <li> Redken Forceful 23 Finishing Spray is one of the best for hold without the stickinessof other sprays.  I&#x27;ve tried many sprays and this one is far superior to other brands.</li>
    <li> Product received with smashed cap.  Cannot use, at all.  Due to it being flammable, I can&#x27;t return it.  Sent information, but have yet to hear from anyone in regards to replacing my item. Poor service.</li>
    <li> Nice hold from a woman with very fine hair</li>
    <li> Keep buying it. It&#x27;s light weight, sprays well especially like then turn top. Arrives quickly and always in great shape.</li>
