<li> I just wish it raised up higher and that the base was bigger and more balanced.</li>
<li> well I cant afford to loose by restocking fee</li>
<li> They are fragile not sturdy my Missing parts for 2 chairs.</li>
<li> Just what I expected.  </li>
<li> Other than that, no complaints.</li>
<li> Chair in general is not good quality.</li>
<li> As a Hair Dresser of 36 years this is by far the worse investment I have ever made for my salon.</li>
<li> but I have received in black color</li>
<li> A little advice, set this chair up in a well ventilated area.</li>
<li> gave away the old black chair with the round base to someone else at the shop.</li>
<li> All my customers think I am crazy for not sending these things back</li>
<li> Send the complaint tru amazon and never got a response.</li>
<li> threads mean that task took 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> my back hurts from trying to turn these stupid things.</li>
<li> I returned it and took a hit on the shipping which I&#x27;m not happy a about.</li>
<li> It was a little difficult to remove the protective packaging from the base, but we managed.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;I swapped the round base with the chair that I already had that has the 5-point base.&lt;br /&gt;Standard</li>
<li> The chair got here on time and works ok,as soon as we unwrapped it we saw that the protective rubber that goes around the base was broken.  </li>
<li> I wonder if the bad smell will go...</li>
<li> Very disappointed</li>
<li> It was awful.</li>
<li> The worst salon chairs I have ever ordered!  </li>

    <li> this is the most stinky thing I&#x27;ve ever got...looks nice but the whole room is smell so bad. I wonder if the bad smell will go...</li>
    <li> My daughter needed a hair stylist chair to use after she graduated from Cosmetology school.  This was an inexpensive chair compared to higher priced ones on the market.  It has served its purpose well as a hair stylists chair for a period of months while our daughter worked out of our home.  Now that our daughter has moved on to working at a nice salon, the chair is no longer needed and sits in my garage unused.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it.  I recommend this brand for a hair stylist who is just starting up and doesn&#x27;t have much money.  The chair is sufficiently comfortable in it&#x27;s padding, it swivels nicely, and it can be pumped up to various elevations to fit the need of the hair stylist.  Not a bad investment for a beginner hair stylist with little income.</li>
    <li> the Hydraulic barber styling chair was above expectation. I had already purchased 2 at a higher cost with lower quality.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend it to anyone. My wife actually use this one herself in her shop and she considers it at the QUEEN CHAIR!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.  Arrived on time and easy to assemble and durable.  The color was a little off red more of a orange but it works.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to assemble. It is exactlywhat my sister wanted for cChristmas :) It is 2 legit 2 quit!</li>
    <li> Easy to put together, great price, good quality :-)</li>
    <li> It was a little difficult to remove the protective packaging from the base, but we managed. I purchased the salon chair as a desk chair so that I could have the foot rest and the added height. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> The worst salon chairs I have ever ordered!  They are fragile not sturdy my Missing parts for 2 chairs. None of the holes line up with screws.. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> We purchased this chair for our daughter who graduated from beauty school.  I is a great chair!  The quality for the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> Why I have ordered a red one but I have received in black color now it is a pain in the ????? To return back and also it is not included any assembly instructions why please</li>
    <li> I would never recomend this chair .Yes it looks nice but in picture only .First off I thought I was getting RED this is an orange color.Next they do not turn at all my back hurts from trying to turn these stupid things.As a Hair Dresser of 36 years this is by far the worse investment I have ever made for my salon.All my customers think I am crazy for not sending these things back well I cant afford to loose by restocking fee so I am stuck with JUNK.DO NOT BUY!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for a close friend... She almost cried at how immensely awesome it is</li>
    <li> i love the chair ...so glad i chose this one..thanks so much. i been waiting on the day to get my styling chair and my clients are so much  more happier now they have a comfy place to sit.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this chair. It is great for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome color, solid, clean, well built.&lt;br /&gt;I have others at the shop crying to borrow my new red chair. LOL&lt;br /&gt;I swapped the round base with the chair that I already had that has the 5-point base.&lt;br /&gt;Standard threads mean that task took 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;I gave away the old black chair with the round base to someone else at the shop.</li>
    <li> Decent quality. Pumps up very high. Easily tips towards the front when sitting. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good chair. Decent quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this beautiful chair for my sister and she loves it!! She is also my stylist and this chair is so comfortable, I highly recommend this styling chair.</li>
    <li> The chair got here on time and works ok,as soon as we unwrapped it we saw that the protective rubber that goes around the base was broken.  Send the complaint tru amazon and never got a response. Will not buy from these guys again.</li>
    <li> It does its job. I just wish it raised up higher and that the base was bigger and more balanced. Other than that, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This chair is a good chair for the money spent basically. I wish it raised a little higher and the foot rest felt a bit steadier, but overall good buy.</li>
    <li> A+ will buy again seller....</li>
    <li> Bought this chair for my boyfriend. He&#x27;s a barber. He just needed a chair for The house. It was delivered quickly and pretty easy to set up. A little advice, set this chair up in a well ventilated area. Sooo stinky! It was awful. The assembly instructions could have been better. Pretty nice chair</li>
    <li> This chair is not red it&#x27;s more like neon orange also footrest is unstable  . Chair in general is not good quality. I returned it and took a hit on the shipping which I&#x27;m not happy a about.</li>
