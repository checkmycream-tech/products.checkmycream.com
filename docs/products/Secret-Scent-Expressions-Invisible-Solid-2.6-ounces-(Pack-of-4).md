### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And great moisturizing!</li>
      <li>Excellent deodorant smells great all day, needs lower price.</li>
      <li>This antiperspirant included the best of all features - there is no drip, the product does not melt and evaporate like the gels, the fragrance is very, very nice and the product works well to handle perspiration.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to buy it, though, because it works and smells great.</li>
      <li>Ordering it on Amazon is great, you get a 4 pack...</li>
      <li>I have tried all kinds of deodorant, but none have worked as great as this one.</li>
      <li>like Scent Expressions because it works, has long-lasting protection, smells great and even gives off a pleasant scent when you sweat.</li>
      <li>Smells good even after working all day.</li>
      <li>never thought I&#x27;d be attached to a deodorant, but I still haven&#x27;t found a suitable replacement.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I love the 4-pack.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I am sure there is better price somewhere online, I just can&#x27;t find it.</li>
      <li>Love this but can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore &amp;#34;(</li>
      <li>I feel completely confident when I leave the house for work each day.</li>
      <li>Honestly this was originally called &amp;#34;asian pear&amp;#34; then changed to &amp;#34;truth or pear&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Truth or pear&#x27;s fresh clean scent has become my new favorite and it smells so good on its own</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and never detracts from the fragrance of my perfume or lotions.</li>
      <li>People have told me that I smell great when the only thing I&#x27;m wearing is this deodorant.</li>
      <li>The scent was fresh and light without that overly sweet smell that fragranced deoderant develops as it starts working.</li>
      <li>Love the scent alone, and even more when mixed with my body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>I bought this item because I couldn&#x27;t find my favorite deodorant at my local store any more.  </li>
      <li>Pretty sure they realize how rare this particular scent is.</li>
      <li>The best scent Secret ever put out..</li>
      <li>And it is definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>its the only one deo that has a great smell just like a perfum or splash all of my friends loved it and its Secret</li>
      <li>It even gets me through a night with hot flashes.</li>
      <li>The first one worked and the rest were defective.</li>
      <li>; and I first purchased it because it was like heaven in your nose.</li>
      <li>Secret&#x27;s Truth or Pear smells more like a nice body lotion.</li>
      <li>I loved the solid stick in this scent and purchased it on amazon because it was the only place I could find it not in gel form.</li>
      <li>they have several scents available.</li>
      <li>that really works</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>: The company that makes this product line has priced it too high, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Love this scent and is getting harder and harder to find at a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>I live in Afghanistan, shipping to APO was no problem.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t figure it out until the first one was gone 5 months later.</li>
      <li>love the scent - hard to find in the stores</li>
      <li>a side note: I cringed at spending over $20 at one time, but found that it is much cheaper to buy in bulk than at a local drugstore.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even buy Secret brand deodorant products anymore because I am so upset with them for taking away this scent and because according to my boyfriend, none of their other scents are as good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the cheapest product, but far from the most expensive.</li>
      <li>The scent is a bit odd for a man to wear, but it sure does beat the usual stink.</li>
      <li>The company only makes it in the clear gel form now, which never seems to dry correctly for me..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> We have had such a hard time finding this at any of the stores - Fred Meyer, Safeway, Target, The Market at Anacortes.  So I decided to try on line and found it - YAY!  I wonder if Secret is discontinuing this scent?  I hope not!</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It&#x27;s not too strong and never detracts from the fragrance of my perfume or lotions. People have told me that I smell great when the only thing I&#x27;m wearing is this deodorant. I love the 4-pack. I live in Afghanistan, shipping to APO was no problem.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product! This review applies to any of the Secret Scent Expression solids - they have several scents available. While the gel works, I don&#x27;t feel it performs quite as well as the solid.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have tried numerous types of deodorant - different brands; regular &amp; clinical strength; solids, gels &amp; sprays. This is by far the best. For me, the protection lasts over 24 hours. It&#x27;s not the cheapest product, but far from the most expensive. And it is definitely worth the price. I have tried Secret Clinical strength and was extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I like Scent Expressions because it works, has long-lasting protection, smells great and even gives off a pleasant scent when you sweat. I feel completely confident when I leave the house for work each day. It even gets me through a night with hot flashes. I will continue to use and recommend.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note: I cringed at spending over $20 at one time, but found that it is much cheaper to buy in bulk than at a local drugstore.</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant included the best of all features - there is no drip, the product does not melt and evaporate like the gels, the fragrance is very, very nice and the product works well to handle perspiration.  I would definitely purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Truth or Pear for years.  Love the scent alone, and even more when mixed with my body chemistry.  I never stink!  But stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  I have been looking every time I go to Target, CVS, Walgreens, etc. For months.  Running low on my supply!  Ordering it on Amazon is great, you get a 4 pack... but they also charge over $6 per stick.  Pretty sure they realize how rare this particular scent is.</li>
    <li> Excellent deodorant smells great all day, needs lower price. Smells good even after working all day. I am sure there is better price somewhere online, I just can&#x27;t find it.</li>
    <li> Secret never disappoints with their flavorful scents! Truth or pear&#x27;s fresh clean scent has become my new favorite and it smells so good on its own that you may get compliments even if you&#x27;re not wearing any other perfume!</li>
    <li> I had been looking high &amp; low for the \\&quot;truth or pear\\&quot; scent of Secret deodorant. I&#x27;d only found it in the gel form which I did not care for. On a whim I decided to check on Amazon and low &amp; behold - there it was!  I ordered enough to last me the next 27 years and could not be happier. Amazon rescued me from having to decide between a scent I could not abide and whether just to scrap deodorant altogether. Thank you, Amazon.</li>
    <li> PROS: I don&#x27;t usually like scented deodorants/antiperspirants because they often have that telltale metal-like deodorant smell mixed in with the scent. Secret&#x27;s Truth or Pear smells more like a nice body lotion. And unlike some \\&quot;fruit\\&quot; scents that make me smell like I jumped in a vat of Starburst candy, the scent is not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The company that makes this product line has priced it too high, in my opinion. You have to buy it in a four-pack to get it for under $5 a container. The company&#x27;s other similar antiperspirants (solids, gels) are at least a dollar less than the Scent Expressions line. I will continue to buy it, though, because it works and smells great.</li>
    <li> The best scent Secret ever put out..I started using back in 2004 or 2005. The company only makes it in the clear gel form now, which never seems to dry correctly for me.. and I don&#x27;t like the consistency of the gel. I loved the solid stick in this scent and purchased it on amazon because it was the only place I could find it not in gel form. Honestly this was originally called &amp;#34;asian pear&amp;#34; then changed to &amp;#34;truth or pear&amp;#34; and I first purchased it because it was like heaven in your nose. I don&#x27;t even buy Secret brand deodorant products anymore because I am so upset with them for taking away this scent and because according to my boyfriend, none of their other scents are as good.</li>
    <li> love the scent - hard to find in the stores</li>
    <li> its the only one deo that has a great smell just like a perfum or splash all of my friends loved it and its Secret that really works</li>
    <li> Not just for the ladies. I have tried all kinds of deodorant, but none have worked as great as this one. The scent is a bit odd for a man to wear, but it sure does beat the usual stink. Only down side is that it will stain your shirts.</li>
    <li> Secret needs to bring back this scent</li>
    <li> Love this scent and is getting harder and harder to find at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I couldn&#x27;t find my favorite deodorant at my local store any more.  Only one of the 4 dispensers worked. I paid over $20 for one deodorant. The first one worked and the rest were defective. I didn&#x27;t figure it out until the first one was gone 5 months later. Such a rip-off. Be leery of this business and don&#x27;t buy defective products like I did.</li>
    <li> Oh, how I miss this scent. Secret stopped making it and slowly I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in stores. Amazon was my last resort. And now they don&#x27;t have it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I&#x27;d be attached to a deodorant, but I still haven&#x27;t found a suitable replacement. All the current Secret scents smell like garbage. :( BRING BACK TRUTH OR PEAR!!!</li>
    <li> Sadly I cant find this scent anywhere anymore. The scent was fresh and light without that overly sweet smell that fragranced deoderant develops as it starts working. I am very sensitive to scents and this is one of the very few that doesnt bother me. And great moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Love this but can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore &amp;#34;(</li>
