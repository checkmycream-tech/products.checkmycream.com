      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I tired it.</li>
      <li>Using it diligently and carefully (just a light layer on the dark spots, continually), there was definite improvement.</li>

<li> After a few weeks, you will see the dark spots lightening and breaking up.</li>
<li> Cream is heavy</li>
<li> When I ordered this product I was a little skeptical</li>

    <li> This product works!!! Not even the more costly creams can compete and I speak from personal experience! I am very happy I gave it a go.</li>

    <li> This product really works, but you have to be patient, using it daily.  After a few weeks, you will see the dark spots lightening and breaking up.</li>
    <li> be careful to apply only where you want it. It will irritate your skin everywhere that it is applied to. It does work though. Good product.</li>
    <li> My wife is happy with the product and is planning to order some more. Thank You</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. As an African-American woman with menopausal acne, I was looking for something to erase the resulting dark spots. The cream that I had been using for years helped with my overall skin tone, but it did nothing to erase the dark spots. I read the reviews about this cream on Amazon and decided to try it. After only two weeks, this cream has erased dark spots that I had had for months. It is also helping with new acne by preventing dark spots from forming in the first place. With continued use, there is some peeling, and care should be used with this product. Using it diligently and carefully (just a light layer on the dark spots, continually), there was definite improvement. I also used Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar as an astringent / toner, and I think that helps too. Great cream!</li>
    <li> Wow. I have tried several products over the years, and I have had microdermabrasion, glycolic peels, you name it. Nothing has worked as well on a dark spot I have on my cheek as this product. I have only been using it for a week and I can see a difference!</li>
    <li> Cream is heavy and I didn&#x27;t feel I saw any changes.  Stopped using after a while as I didn&#x27;t like how it felt on application.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. The instructions are all in Spanish and I am not close to fluent enough to understand. I tried the product and nothing seems to have happened, i.e., whitening or spot removing. I&#x27;ve used other products that I purchased on Amazon that worked fine. Was trying to save money with this product, instead, I threw money away.</li>
    <li> Been using no result yet</li>
    <li> I have tried several spot removing cream and they did not deliver. When I ordered this product I was a little skeptical but I&#x27;m glad I tired it. I have dry/sensitive skin and when my mom and I applied this cream for the first two days it did cause redness and a light rash. I stopped using it until my rash went away and again when I applied it I noticed the redness but it eventually went away along with my dark spots :D Don&#x27;t not be alarmed if you see redness after applying the cream on your dark spots it will go away in about 2 days and yes this stuff works! I saw complete results after one week of nonstop application and another good thing about this product is it doesn&#x27;t enlarge the pores and a little goes a long way :) This product is AMAZING!!!!!!</li>
