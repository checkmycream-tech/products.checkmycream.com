<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Came very quick in the mail.  I was very skeptical at first because I have very thick curly, kinky, frizzy hair.  I had a Brazilian treatment in the salon back in February and it was the best treatment I had ever had.  I was looking to get the same results but for a better price and this stuff is really good.  I would say amazing but I started to run out of the product before I was done with my whole head, so I had to stretch out what I had left to the rest.  Not all of my hair was saturated with the product.  My hair is down to the middle of my back also it&#x27;s thick, I did place another order and bought 2 bottles.  I waited 24 hours to wash my hair, let it air dry and was very happy with the results, little to no frizz, nice waves and soft. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent of the product, it has like a lemon smell.  Very happy will continue to order.</li>
    <li> This product works very well! After the 3 days when I washed my hair , it was shiny, soft and straight ! There is a month , that I applied this product in my hair, and now I will buy other IQ Natural , but the big size , because I have long hair .</li>
    <li> Great product. I had very good results with my hair.love it. Five stars from me</li>
    <li> i bought this product in hope to save the time on straightening my hair every week   i read the product description and read the review .. thought it was great   used it on my hair, did it with the iron the smell was awful and hurts the eyes    left it for 2 days as described when i washed it as if i didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I first tried the store bought 30 day system. It worked okay. It smoothed out some frizz, but I still had frizz and poof when I let my hair dry naturally. I wanted it gone completely. I wanted something that would work as well as if I&#x27;d paid $300 at the salon. This stuff did it! I followed the instructions completely. I waited the full 72 hours before washing my hair. It was easier to do than when I used the 30-day product, that one made my hair waxy and gross, it was really hard not to wash it. This stuff didn&#x27;t make my hair feel over saturated. I have waist long hair and I used the whole 3 oz. bottle. It was plenty. After three days I used a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, let me hair dry naturally and OMG! My hair is transformed. It&#x27;s the hair I&#x27;ve always wanted. It&#x27;s straight, but not stick straight. I have zero frizz, no poofiness after letting it dry naturally. I cannot believe it. I have lots of hair, it&#x27;s mostly thick, some strands are really fine, but then I have some strands that are so thick and kinky. I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair that&#x27;s roughly 4\\&quot; past my shoulders and frizzes as soon as the humidity goes past 65%.  Straightening my hair using just a straight iron is an hour long process and since I get up at 4:30am for work I typically just wash it then pull it up into a bun.  When I came across this product on Amazon I thought it&#x27;d be the perfect solution for me while deciding on whether or not to go through with a Brazilian Blowout at a salon.    The process itself is simple.  Wash hair with provided clarifying shampoo 2-3 times, blow dry without combing and apply treatment starting at the nape of the neck being sure to cover all strands.  In the bottle the treatment has no chemical smell present, but by the time I had 2/3 of my hair coated I had to stop the process and step outside.  My eyes, nose and throat were burning terribly and that was with my bathroom window open, overhead exhaust fan and a regular floor fan on.  After 5 minutes I felt fine and was able to finish the process.    The directions state to let the treatment sit on the hair for 30-40 minutes before blow drying; I waited 40 because of my hair&#x27;s thickness.  While drying then straightening I encountered the same burning sensation as mentioned above but my hair DID look fantastic upon completion.  I woke the next morning with just a couple of kinks that easily straightened with my straightening iron, and a head full of frizz-free hair.  Perfect!  Or not.    The heat and humidity that day were brutal - high 90&#x27;s with 80% humidity.  My hair remained pin straight until it started to rain, that is.  I watched the weather prior to leaving for work and left prepared with an umbrella as well as a hooded sweatshirt.  No water whatsoever touched my hair but within a mere minute of being outside in the rainy weather my hair began to frizz.  Shortly thereafter it became kinky.    I didn&#x27;t give up hope though.  I waited the full 3 days before washing my hair and was highly disappointed at the result.  I knew within moments of stepping out of the shower that this product essentially did nothing.  Frizz was present at my part and on the underside of my hair.  Blowing it dry obviously didn&#x27;t help and though when I straightened it it looked great it turned wavy/frizzy once I stepped outside.    Off to the salon I go.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida... need I say more.  After having several $500 treatments I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works like a dream at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders on my hair. I had wavy/curly hair, and now it is soft, silky and straight!!! Never did I think that I would ever be able to wash my hair and be able to walk out the door without having to do anything to it. This Karatin product changed my life lol. I left it in for 48hrs and used a flat iron that went up to 410, and ended up with great results. I highly recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> this product works great, use in well vented room, burns eyes, use a cloth to cover if you can</li>
    <li> I just bought this product last week, I was reading all the reviews about and it sounded good, but then again everyone has different types of hair.I thought i give it a try. I have home done highlights and very wavy hair. My hair was always dry and frizzy when i would blow dry it and straighten and it would take hours to do it. I used this product just this pass weekend and OMG i LOVE how my hair feels and looks. It really took more then half the time to blow dry my and it was straight. I took my hair straightener over my hair just a few time to make it more straight and just to curl my ends under. I definitely would recommend this product. The only down side to it is the smell of the actual Keratin treatment part, make sure you open a window or something because it did bring tears to my eyes, just like when you peel an onion. Other then that I can&#x27;t want to reorder this product again.</li>
    <li> I have curly/kinky hair that&#x27;s both chemically relaxed and coloured and have been using relaxers for at least 20 years. I had been hearing a lot about the benefits of using keratin treatments and straighteners on chemically relaxed and coloured hair and after doing some research online and reading up all the reviews, decided to give this one a try.  First of all, it is really easy to use and apply just by following the directions included in the package and also the bevy of directions provided by other users of keratin straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;The application part is easy - yes, you do notice the fumes and get a bit of eye irritation but I kept a fan blowing on me the entire time, which I think helped with the ventilation. However, when it came time to blow dry, then it became a bit too much, so I had to go outside to blow dry my hair. I noticed immediately that my hair was soft and the new growth was straight. After flat ironing my hair, it became even straighter and my hair felt extremely soft and very voluminous, although it also looked like straw, so I was a bit worried that I&#x27;d somehow botched things up. I kept the product in my hair for the instructed 24 hours, during which time I did flat iron my hair a couple more times before heading out, which resulted in my hair looking like a big shaggy wig (think Tina Turner) - soft and fluffy to touch but still looking like straw. After exactly 24 hours (almost to the minute) I washed and conditioned my hair using the Nunaat Keratin Shampoo and Keratin Conditioner, blow dried my hair out, then added a little of the Brazilian Hair Treatment Keratin Recharge and flat ironed my hair, holding my breath the entire time in anticipation of what the final outcome would be.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let&#x27;s just say that I was FLOORED!!! My hair is not only still super soft, but also voluminous, bouncy, shiny and straight. In fact I don&#x27;t remember my hair ever looking this great except when I just stepped out of my hair salon!! I cannot stop lookingat my hair and for sure, I am now totally SOLD on this product and in fact i just ordered another system for when next I need to apply to my hair. I read online that this should last anywhere from 3 weeks to 6 months depending on the product quality and hair, so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see. Until then, I&#x27;m just gonna keep on touching and loving my sleek, salon-quality hair!!&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did find was that this bottle may not be enough for someone with longer than chin-length hair. I have short hair and used almost the entire bottle of the keratin treatment, so someone with longer hair might be wise to buy 2 of these or get the bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions except that my flat iron can only go up to 430, not 450. I&#x27;m still happy with my results and would purchase this product again.  My very naturally curly hair had already had a salon keratin treatment that was wearing off. This treatment made my hair smooth and shiny again. It didn&#x27;t completely straightn my hair, it still has some waves but no frizz, which is what I wanted. When I want my hair straight I can blow dry it straight in a lot less time than before the treatment.  UPDATE: 1/18/2012  Two months later my hair still has no frizz. If I let my hair dry on it&#x27;s own it&#x27;s got more of the wave back. If I blow dry my hair it stays straight. I&#x27;ve been very happy with my hair since using this product, it&#x27;s been as effective for keeping my hair smooth as the $250 (Global Keratin) treatment I had that first introduced me to what keratin can do, and only about 1/10 the cost. When I re do the treatment I&#x27;ll use the correct 450 degree flat iron.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Brazilian Keratin\\&quot; treatment, include formaldehyde, a chemical the EPA and OSHA consider a carcinogen.  Please research prior to buying anything with called Brazilian Keratin.</li>
    <li> Me and my mom have used this product for years. Our hair is wavy, and after applying Brazilian Treatment, the hair would stay straight for about 3 months. Make sure to apply right amount because once I over-applied it once thinking I would get better results and my hair looked oily all the time for a while and started having white powdery things.</li>
    <li> Worked only till the next wash.</li>
    <li> It is really good. My hair look smoothing and when i used my iron it is so easy get a nice look... I love it...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. I have thick, wavy, coarse hair. I followed all of the instructions to the &amp;#34;t.&amp;#34; What a waste of 30 bucks!</li>
    <li> You really need to have the windows and fans going when you apply this product! I really hate the smell, and the fumes sting the eyes and make them tear up...but the results lasted for over four months and last through the super humid, east-coast humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the negative reviews weren&#x27;t following the directions exactly since I have VERY curly hair and it works. Each stage of the application has to be put on completely dry hair. When you do wash your hair, which shouldn&#x27;t be every day, use the sulfate-free hippie shampoo and conditioner, and only use conditioner the first two times you wash it.</li>
    <li> Took about 75% of curl away. I have a sensative scalp and followed a dye process with this. It locked color in for sure but it did burn my scalp.</li>
    <li> I was greatly impressed with the process and the results, I am african american with very curly frizzy hair, not kinky, but thick and long. Washing and blow drying and flat ironing my hair is a long and hard process (normally). That is why I wanted to try this produck if it would make my hair more manageble but not take away my natural curls would be great, I do like to wear my naturally curly hair as well. The whole process took me around 4 hours like my normal wahs blowdry flat ironing process. so I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry to wash it out again in three days. I wahsed it out in six days, but to my surprise the whole process was only an hour and a half!!! I combed through my hair in minutes with literally less than 10 strans of hair in the comb. it dryed in 15 minutes and the rest of the time I flat ironed it. it transformed my hair like I have someone elses hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy happy happy!!!</li>
    <li> O.K when I first saw this product I was a bit skeptical but being it was cheep I gave it a shot. I had the salon Keratin straightening, for 300.00 done in March and it was MOSLTY out of my hair. I have to say the stuff was very powerful and had to keep going outside to get air, at one point my eyes were tearing, next time I will wear a mask. I followed the instructions as directed, if possible have a friend help, because it was a bit difficult doing it on my own.  If you have long hair you may want to consider buying two bottles because I ran out, or be careful and conserve. I was just drowning my hair. I started this process on a Wednesday night and I left it in till Saturday. It became VERY greasy by then, but I planned it out knowing I wouldn&#x27;t be going anywhere.  After my wash using the shampoo and conditioner, I blew dried my hair I cant say its pin straight, but it definitely was A LOT easier to dry, less frizzy and I had no use for my hair straighter. Will keep you all posted on how long it lasts.... D</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t neccesarily straighten my hair but it made it super shiny and super healthy looking. It&#x27;s also not as curly as it was before I used this. I have (or well had) super curly hair. This stuff made it nice and wavy and shiny and it&#x27;s ten thousand billion times easier to straighten too. It&#x27;s so much more manageable and healthier I love this stuff. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I do recommned this product, I just used it a week ago and it left my hair nice and shiny, soft and a lot easier to manage. My hair is thick and curly, but now with this treatment is so easy to take care of it. My friend did it for me and follow the direcctions and I didn&#x27;t washed it for 3 days, after I washed my hair was still looking good. I will buy again.[[ASIN:B004RJ874Q IQ Natural 3PC Brazilian Keratin Complex Hair Straight Guard System~ 6oz. Great with CHI straightener]]</li>
    <li> Excelent product my hair look great!!!</li>
    <li> I have kinky african america hair... this product soften and loosen my curl pattern making my hair much more manageable.  The downside the smell was almost unbearable I had to blow dry my hair outside!</li>
    <li> thought it was a little small for the amount try to look for a larger amount for the same price</li>
    <li> Great product. lasts about 2.5 weeks.</li>
    <li> the vitamin conditioner was very watery tried shaking vigorasly to no avail it had seperated so I would not use this again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used IQ Natural&#x27;s Brazilian Keratin Hair Straightener four times. My hair is very thick and tends to be wavy and a little frizzy if left undone. I needed something to tone it down and help me shorten my styling time in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t always come with a tinting brush, so you might need to have one on hand.&lt;br /&gt;- The fumes are strong and you will want to be in a well-ventilated room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are what you&#x27;d expect for a product at this price point. My hair stays reasonably straight for about two to three weeks and slowly begins to revert back to wavy. I noticed that even after my hair begins to curl again, it&#x27;s much less frizzy. Be sure to follow the directions as they are printed and wait 72 hours before wash it out. Also, the results will last longer if you use sulfate free shampoo after application.</li>
    <li> The straightening process is involved and lengthy, but well worth the work.  I have very curly, long, and dry hair, and the treatment not only straightened my hair but it also made it silky smooth.  The process is easy to follow, but the  most difficult part was having to leave the treatment in my hair for 24 hours.  Make sure that you are in a well-ventilated area and maybe run a fan while you apply and blow-dry your hair.  Otherwise, I was pleasantly surprised and will use this treatment again. I purchased this treatment at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and the thoughts in this review are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this product 3/20/14 which was a few days before the said delivery date, that&#x27;s a plus.(Did the treatment on 3/21/2014) The instructions were simple, easy to read and execute. I had to sit next to a window with a fan while applying, blow drying and straightening due to the fumes burning my eyes, nothing too harsh though. I used my hair straightener at 450 degrees( I would recommend for thick hard to straighten hair) and left the product in for around 35-38 hours. I also ran my straightener after I woke up the morning after applying. Washed out the morning 3/23/2014 and it came out much more tamed, my tight curls are now loose waves, and straightening will be MUCH easier. Definitely buy it if you want your frizz to be gone! Buy it from the actual website though, it&#x27;s cheaper there. Hope it works out for everyone!</li>
    <li> it was okay. This stuff had my eyes burning and it gave off a strong smell. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s suppose to happen.</li>
    <li> So far, it seems the product is working reasonably well for my step-daughter&#x27;s thick, coarse hair. However, we ran out of product before the top layers were saturated. As a result; the top layers didn&#x27;t receive the full benefit of the treatment. The instructions tell you to saturate all of the hair so, they should provide enough product to do so! Another concern; it really burned her eyes. I wonder how good this product can really be for your hair if the fumes burn your eyes! Young girls with unruly hair want it to be perfectly stick-straight. The salon charges upwards of $200 for these treatments so, this would be a reasonable solution if they gave you enough of it.</li>
    <li> Lasted me about 2 months when combined with a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. The smell is strong when applying it so make sure to use a well ventilated area.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Relaxing my hair only dried it out.  I never wore my hair out when it was curly.  It was always one big puff.  Now I love my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt; Asian mixed Caribbean Islander.</li>
    <li> fast delivery on time I will recommend to all buyer who wants to buy the item they want.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would group my tiny curls together/help to define them.  It did not do that at all.  In fact, because it just barely loosened my spirals to right S shapes, the hairs are less curved around either than before.  So, my curls are harder to see through friss and puff but on the plus side I have slightly fewer tangles.  Also, it made my hair feel smoother and softer to the touch but did not give my hair more movement.&lt;br /&gt;I had 100% natural-state hair (relaxer hair cut off years ago, no flat ironing until I did the keratin process, no blow dryer prior).  I wanted to be able to avoid gel usage so that I wouldn&#x27;t wash my hair almost daily, drying it out.  It didn&#x27;t make my curls wavy per se, so that&#x27;s good.  But would I go through this LONG process again for such minimal results?  No. It was so hard to work with my hair since it was clarified then blow dried to the bone without any moisturizer added.  Even if tangles and thickness hadnt elongated the process, I would not do it again.  Oh and in regards to the burning of eyes, it was only an issue for a few minutes total...mainly while applying and blow-drying at the front of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those if you looking to straighten, I did test a piece of my hair.  It turned out very smooth-looking and bone straight.  But that was ample frizz...as if a static electricity issue.  It looked much smoother than when I flat ironed years ago before I ever tried any keratin, but I think that is mostly due to the fact that my hair has mostly been left alone for the past few years...and the type of iron plays a role.  Still, the treatment did add a little softness and smoothness to my hair.  Oh and when I WET the hair after flat ironing it, it curled up immediately...so at least for me, this was no sort of an anti-reversion chemical.  With anti-humidity creams applied, my hair curls very little, to moderately - making a loose very stretched curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I could still smell the bad odor of the treatment when I washed my hair on a couple of days afterwards.  But the smell might be gone now.  I didn&#x27;t notice it outside of an actual wash.atment when I washed my hair on a couple of days afterwards.  But the smell might be gone now.  I didn&#x27;t notice it outside of an actual wash.</li>
    <li> The product&#x27;s smells and texture of the hair after finishing a procedure, was kind of uncomfortable them I washed my hair after about 3 hours and the results was terrific.&lt;br /&gt;I am kind of desappointed because the amount in each bottle was less them 2oz. It&#x27;s to spencer for what I got.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading all the other reviews.  There were some negative ones, but overall most liked it.  First, the stuff is extremely toxic.  My eyes were so irritated and wouldn&#x27;t stop burning.  It was worse than cutting an onion.  Second, I followed the directions exactly as it states and my hair is frizzier and dryer than before I started.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Wow! This Keratin treatment is life-changing. My oldest daughter has naturally thick, coarse hair that gets frizzy, especially on the sides &amp; in the back. She has long hair too, so her styling routine takes her a good hour for blow drying &amp; straightening. She had really been getting tired of her hair maintenance routine, but I didn&#x27;t want to do a treatment that would be harsh on her hair, adding more damage in the long run. After applying this easy three step treatment, she can now wash &amp; go without using a dryer OR a straightener!! The best part, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s been about a month now &amp; she hasn&#x27;t had to use a blow dryer or flat iron since. I highly recommend this treatment for anyone with hair like my daughters. You&#x27;ll absolutely love it! I received this @ a discount for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair was trashed from too much bleaching coloring etc... She has naturally super curly afro-type curl but very baby fine caucasion hair. This product straightened it COMPLETELY I mean no bend at all-stick straight and made it look shiny and more healthy. But lo, only a couple weeks later is was curly frizz again.</li>
    <li> Good product but the bottles are very small.</li>
    <li> I got this for both of my teen daughters who have very naturally curly hair that they usually straighten with an iron. We followed the direction explicitly because we had done a lot of research on the salon process including not touching the hair with water after the treatment for at least 3 days. We purchase a hot straightening iron for the required 410 degrees heat and were very careful in the process.     After three days, they washed their hair and when wet it now is in very loose waves almost like it was chemically straightened. They both say their hair is some much softer, conditioned and the texture is incredible. They say styling their hair is 100% easier and even though they still need to use a straightening iron for flat straight hair, they&#x27;ve cut the styling time in half.      They both want to reorder as soon as the treatment wears off (we&#x27;re 1 month into now and it&#x27;s still working).</li>
    <li> I purchased this awhile ago and frankly afraid to use it on all of my hair.  I had a horrible experience with another product or I should say the stylist hadn&#x27;t a clue what she was doing and turned my hair into a nightmare.  I did try it on my bangs and didn&#x27;t leave it on nearly long enough but it did work for a short time and wasn&#x27;t bad looking at all.  The product seemed perfectly safe to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as I have thick wavy hair that tends to get frizzy.  I did this treatment with a friend (I did her hair and she did mine).  We followed directions exactly.  After 3 horrible days (hear felt YUCK!) we washed.  I got out of the shower with my same waves.... UUGGHHH.  WIsh I could have had my 3 days back!!!  Pay the money at the salon.</li>
    <li> i wasnt really satisfied. i didnt feel any change in my hair and right after aplying my hair were like dirty from wax</li>
    <li> Great results for the price! Just follow the instructions completely.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the shampoo, conditioner and the treatment formula though.</li>
    <li> Terrible smell made me wash my hair sooner than I should... I didn&#x27;t like this product at all!</li>
    <li> I  ordered this straightener as I have in the past but the Keratin bottle was empty, and the protective seal was missing.&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting to be compensated.</li>
    <li> For a few weeks it will make the work, but there are much better options out there!&lt;br /&gt;God it&#x27;s price it does a little bit of a job for your hair, not much.</li>
    <li> excellent product and excellent seller. Thanks!</li>
    <li> it s really bad i didnt see any difference</li>
    <li> Product is easy to use for a person who is able to do hair. I suggest being in a VERY well ventilated area. I opened up my windows and put my fan on high facing the window. Once your at the point where your blow drying the product in your hair the fumes get very harsh and made my eyes burn. I had to take a break every once in a while. I also have well controlled asthma and had to use my inhaler after doing the application. If you can have someone else do this for you, I would and have them wear a mask so they are not breathing in the fumes. This beats paying thr $250 + tip at the hair salon, so i will continue on doing the applications myself. Also the bottles are VERY small. I have short hair and used about 1 1/2 ounces of Keratin. If you have long hair you should order two, or order the bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> I have long layered hair, that becomes one big friz ball with humidity. It was easy to apply, wash, dry, apply, dry and flat iron. It has been 5 weeks and 10 washes later, and my hair is still straight and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Only my ends stayed straight for a few days. It did not work on my roots very well which are pretty curly. Its a waste of money.</li>
    <li> My hair is not curly per say, it has more of a frizzy wave if I do not blowdry and flat iron. This has cut my time to 5min to do my hair when it use to take 20. I love this and will do it again when my 3 months are up!</li>
    <li> I just received the item today and haven&#x27;t used it yet but I wanted to point out my up and down of the product so far. After I use the product I&#x27;ll be sure to update. But IM VERY PLEASED with how fast the shipping was. On the downside, the \\&quot;6 oz\\&quot; title was misleading, because I look at the bottle to find that its only 2 oz each bottle, which 2x3 is 6.. I was just expecting a 6 oz bottle and that was very misleading and disappointing to me because I have VERY thick hair.. Hopefully 2 oz will do the trick!</li>
    <li> My hair is not straight but not wavy either, also it doesn&#x27;t shine and not matter what i do to it, like treatments to moisturize and what not nothing worked! Until I found this product (which a friend recommend it to me) I bought the larger size kit (not this one) and I had a lot left! My hair is short only up to my shoulders. The size of this kit that is only 2 oz. After the treatment my hair was so shiny, soft and beautiful!!! I even went to Florida in August 1 month after I did the treatment for the first time and it looked amazing, even after it rain on us and the heat dry my hair!!!  Received many compliments. Now during the summer it lasts 2 months maybe and you need to do a recharge which it is also sold in Amazon. During the winter I would say 4 months. Leave it in your hair for the two to 3 days not before and try not to sweat or even if it gets a little wet go over with the flattening iron. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I have applied a lot of BKTs to my hair, and this one was great.  Some people said that it fried their hair, but I just didn&#x27;t have this issue.  Frizz free and shiny like always.  Super fast delivery too.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> no es lo que esperaba . ; : _ ! &amp;#34; $ % &amp; / ( ) &#x3D; ? ¡</li>
    <li> The product is good and the seller shipped it as indicated.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that I have medium length hair and this quantity wasn&#x27;t enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are really small, they seems like those samples that you get in a beauty shop....Just be aware that you are buying a 6oz product!! if you compere this quantity to other products IQ Natural become really expensive!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve used it and it does a pretty good job for the price. I am mixed, African American, Caucasian, Native American and have naturally very curly spirals and it brought that down to waves. It&#x27;s a lot easier to blow dry and straighten, and less frizzy. The only thing is you have to sit in a well ventilated room when applying the product because the chemicals make your eyes and nose burn and water!</li>
    <li> This product worked as advertised.  However I recommend when applying don&#x27;t apply heavy on the scalp especially if u have oily hair.  My hair looked greasy at the scalp after blowing it out with the product still in my hair. Two weeks later my hair does feel healthier and softer.  Also it blows out and drys faster.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;I love natural products and this fit the bill.  My hair was severely damaged due to a bad perm.  Then I had it straightened.  This product helped revive my undamaged hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, leaving hair soft, smooth and shiny, recommended !!!</li>
    <li> My mom has fine hair and she liked it, but it didn&#x27;t leave your hair smooth and shiny like it&#x27;s supposed to. It looked a bit dry. My mom said it helped &amp;#34;defrizz&amp;#34; her hair, but I didn&#x27;t much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2011.. It works perfect for me.. I used to do it every 4 or 5 months and I&#x27;m very happy with it.. My hair is naturally curly and it used to freeze but since I&#x27;ve been using this product, my hair is not just more straight every time I put the product on it, but is shynier and longer.. I never had my hair that long in my whole life.. I&#x27;m relly really happy, althouth the product is very very strong that your eyes and throat hurts thats why I recomend to do it in ventilated area.. besides that the product really works.. I recomend the product 100%</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair that is hopeless to style and frizzes at any sign of moisture. This product is really simple and easy to use. It&#x27;s pretty much like dying your hair but you don&#x27;t wash it out and you straighten it after. Whenever I use it I don&#x27;t use the shampoo because it works perfectly fine without it. I&#x27;m a broke college student so I can&#x27;t afford to pay $200+ at a salon. This is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> I received the item in time but I had no idea that you felt like dying trying to go through this process. My eyes were burning, my scalp was hurting, I was not able to breath. Keratin cannot be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result? Mediocre straightening. If you put heavy conditioning on your hair the result would most likely be similar. I am skeptic.</li>
    <li> This product is the best home done..brazillian straightening system i&#x27;ve used. It has left my hair supersmooth. No fuzz. My mornings are so much easier and faster</li>
    <li> I have paid $100s of dollars on professional keratin treatments so I decided to try one at home and save lots of $$$. This is the second time I have used this product and it is just as good as the salon treatment! As other reviews may have stated, the odor is strong but you can wear a mask while applying it. The fumes are mainly bad when you are blow drying it and using your flat iron for the final step. The fumes were always bad at the salon too so what is the difference. I have very wavy/ curly hair especially in the summer  and in the deep south it is a nightmare with the humidity. These treatments not only straighten my hair but cut down on the prep time in the morning &amp; frizz. I do recomend waiting the full 72 hours before washing your hair post treatement. Do it on a friday so you don&#x27;t have to be at work, as it tends to look a bit greasy during the 72 hours. Hope this review was helpful!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve used IQ Keratin treatment and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Not only is it super affordable but it has honestly transformed my hair.  I have very curly coarse hair that I&#x27;ve never been able to truly control.  Now, I have soft, looser curls that look healthy and shiny.  If I want to straighten my hair (used to take me and hour and a half), I can do it in 20 minutes and it lasts for days.  Directions are easy to follow but do use a ventilated area, I had eye irritation both times.</li>
    <li> I really like this treatment it makes my hair shiny and straight this is my second time and every 3 months i will do it a gain..</li>
    <li> I bought this for the price.  It is a good price, but I had purchased one before called Silk on Ebay and the results lasted longer and it worked better.  This lasted maybe a week.  Not worth the cheap price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking I could get a cheap hair fix because my beautician was out of the country.  I have had several brazilian treatments over the last few years so I am familiar with the process...forget about it the steps in the process took all day and my hair is short.  The instruction don&#x27;t indicate that you should not use rollers, hair pins, or ties on your hair for 72 hours but I knew not to do so.  I washed my hair twice over the first three weeks of doing this treatment and by then it had completely washed out...leaving my hair dry and breaking.</li>
    <li> I started looking for a keratin treatment to relax my hair and cut down my time getting ready. I&#x27;m a full time athlete, part time in school &amp; I balance a part time job. With that being said; I&#x27;m like a barbie, I value looking good.. So trust me girls when I heard of a magical little treatment that would cut down my time getting ready, I jumped on it!! I wanted something natural that wouldn&#x27;t do much damage and this product takes the cake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hoping in the shower I used the shampoo it came with and jumped out. I followed the directions to the T. But with wait time - I waited three days instead of the 46 hours as it states. Better safe than sorry, Right? - I was IMPRESSED! The treatment left my hair soft, shiny and took my CRAZY KINKY CURLS to a soft beachy wave look. Now it only takes me ten minutes to straighten my hair bone straight. But I could sport the beachy waves and be just as happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons!! ~THE SMELL! It killed me. I had to stop three times well putting the treatment in my hair.. I was gagging and my vision got blurry a few times. If I purchase this again I&#x27;ll have to put the treatment in my hair outside. The smell was intense and burned my throat badly. It smelled full of chemicals, Thank god I was home alone when I put it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I still am in love with this product. Is it true, Beauty is pain? (; I&#x27;ve had the treatment in my hair for a little over a month now and its still holding up great. Good luck beauty&#x27;s! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This company is advertising falsely due to bottles that are shown are not same bottle or size. It is a rip off. I recieved three 2 oz bottles that had purple cover wrapping on them. I almost did not have enough to complete my clients hair and the it&#x27;s advertise is suppose to be a 6oz bottle of products but they are not. I will never order from this company again due to false advertising and you do not get your money worth from the size of the bottles. I will be contacting amazon about this company. I am completely dissatified with this company and my product.Stylist Mrs. Kem</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of Keratin since 2008.  Been through Marcia Teixera, Keracare, Encanto and others.  I must say that I never understood some women&#x27;s negative feedback on applying straightening Keratin on hair until I used this one. My hair did get straight, but it is now dull, dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> I had my hairdresser apply this product today and he ended up washing it out after both our eyes and throats started burning.  BEWARE: this is unequivocally a CHEMICAL process.  I was trying to avoid another relaxer but at least with relaxers your hairdresser has some professional knowledge about the product.  I give the product 2 stars because it DID soften the waves of my fine, mixed African American/Mexican hair.  However, I won&#x27;t be using the product again due to the harshness of the chemicals in the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent price. The product is too efficient and too useful.&lt;br /&gt;It has satisfied my expectations. . . . . .</li>
    <li> I was leary about buying this and doing it myself but I am satisfied with it and would buy again. I followed the simple instructions that came with it and it all turned out awesome. It has left my hair soft and managable which I haven&#x27;t felt in awhile. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but will update when I see a change. The intrusctions were easy to follow and the product was easy to handle. I received at a discount in return for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m brazilian and I was looking for something similar we have in Brazil to straight my curly hair. So, this product will not straight your hair, jus a kind of relax treatment.</li>
    <li> I was not prepared for the fumes, so do this in a well ventilated area. I was happy with the results. I followed the directions and my hair was much easier to straighten after that. However, it lasted for about a month. I had to do a few minor adjustments, which I wont encourages you to use, like using a hot comb(I am African American. all others don&#x27;t use hot combs if you want to have hair left)instead of a Chi flat iron which is kinda costly. I didn&#x27;t blow dry at the last stage because, from experience naturally drying is better but takes FOREVER. So please follow the directions. I hear the more you use this product the longer it last. We&#x27;ll see. I really wanted to use something other than relaxers,( see the movie \\&quot;Good Hair\\&quot; w/ Chris Rock) but eventually I will probably make the life style change and just go with the way God made me kinky and curly. cuz this is just to much time, money and energy. but like I said It&#x27;s Okay.</li>
    <li> The product is  not bad. But as Brazilian, I am used to use the original ones, more stronger. My hair is curly and the product just worked on my hair for one week. Usually Brazilian Keratin to keep on your hair for about 3 months. I don&#x60;t know because I bought the small one and that wasn&#x60;t enough for my hair...and my iron goes up to 400 (420). After 1 week my hair was curly again, with less frizz, what is not bad. But I like my hair straight. I could buy this product again if I want to something \\&quot;light\\&quot; for my hair. I think I need go back to Brazil again to use the best ones :( I confess I was scary to use this product, since nobody knows about it, and when I missing the application brush I thought \\&quot;Oh, no..it already started wrong\\&quot; but after email, they sent to me the brush, what I appreciate.</li>
    <li> It works very good but don&#x27;t last long...about 1 month and my hair is already back to my waves.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is great hair product.</li>
    <li> long story short my hair was short puffy nasty looking where if you touched it you would probable get cut i went to the salon and they recommended me to get a keratin treatment it sounded really good until they told me it cost $250 i found this and decided to give it a shot...it took me about 2 -2:30 hours to finish is time consumming but very easy even a dummy can follow these instructions. its been about 4weeks now and my hair looks shiny, silky, and straight like the chinnese people kinda straight i love it i defenately recomend it..oh yea my hair is shoulder length and this bottles are supper small it was berly enough to finish my hair so if you have long hair you need to get the one with 8oz or more</li>
    <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;My hair is something after keratin</li>
    <li> This product almost made me go to the hospital. It burned my eyes and my throat so bad. I didn&#x27;t get any in my eyes or mouth just on my hair. I also had the window open and door but that didn&#x27;t help. It was so bad I had to rinse it out without letting it stay in the full amount of time. I was choking and couldn&#x27;t breath. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It was not the way I expected. It just made some of my daughter&#x27;s freezy hair softer and a little more manageable but not at all straight. But to be fair my daughter who is 14, was not so patient so I couldn&#x27;t iron her hair in very small sections and as precise as I wanted to do it so maybe that&#x27;s the reason I didn&#x27;t get the result I wanted so I give this product an okay to be fair.</li>
    <li> This was the first at home keratin kit that I purchase and applied to my hair.  The process took several hours and I HATED not being able to wash or pull back my hair for three days, however, the results were great! My hair was much, much smoother and I was able to blowdry in half the time.  Downside is that it absolutely did not last &amp;#34;months&amp;#34; and yes I was very careful to use all the correct shampoos, stay out of salt or chlorine water. I&#x27;m confident that I couldn&#x27;t have done anything more to make my results last any longer.  The results lasted about 3-4 weeks.  Although I did love the results, I&#x27;m not willing to spend the time or money (long term expense of purchasing every month) to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It definitely fights frizz on a temporary basis I can apply it and have it last WELL for about three months. My hair is naturally curly Im Puerto Rican and Black and i love my curls I do thats why i was looking for something perhaps not as strong at the real Brazilian Blow Out seeing as how I have heard that that can kill your curls and permanently straighten hair. For me this product works how I wanted it to it tames my curls and make my hair generally easier to deal with wether that be straightening it because it cut the time in half from how long it use to take. But with this product I can wear my hair natural with out having to use products like leave in conditioner or gel. I definitely recommend having long curly hair can be a pain to deal with this makes it a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S The smaller 3pc set docent have alottt of product in it and if you have courser or thick hair it might run out i recommend investing in the bigger size or perhaps buying to if you have very long and thick curls. But shoulder length hair or shorter you should be fine. :) Hope this helped.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been extremely busy and just getting around to reviewing this product. First of all, I&#x27;m an African American Woman with coarse hair. On that note, if you fit into the same category, do yourself a favor and do not order this product! It does not work on hair that is thick and coarse! Use at your own risk! I didn&#x27;t bother to contact the seller because I was too pissed and felt that I wasted too much time putting something in my hair which didn&#x27;t deliver or do what it was promised to do! In fact, this product did nothing at all for my hair. It did not straighten my hair at all; even after flat ironing it!</li>
    <li> Was much smaller then I thought</li>
    <li> The fumes are the worst and they burn your eyes. .  I did my hair almost 2 months ago and it is still straight.</li>
    <li> Just follow the instructions and you will be amazed. Another thing, use another hand for help. Still this size (2 OZ)  is hardly enough if you have relativity long hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Global Keratin (now called GK Hair) for three years, but was frustrated with having to pay so much for the product.  So...I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I am SO disappointed.  I realized it wouldn&#x27;t be as good as GK - you get what you pay for...but this has made my hair more fuzzy than before I applied it.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see what my own conditioner does to the hair - the vitamin conditioner included in the package was AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not suggest anyone use this product if you have used other straightening systems successfully - you will be horribly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have hair a little past my shoulders and medium thickness, and there  was not enough product in this to cover my whole head. If you have long hair get the bigger size. Not sure how it works since there wasn&#x27;t enough product to follow the directions.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m not sure I received the same instructions as everyone else. A lot of other reviewers are mentioning 72 hours before washing the product back out, and my included instruction card only has 24 required hours. Considering I paid for this product, and it&#x27;s the same as what everyone else used, I am going to wait to wash it out for another 48 hours because I refuse to have wasted this purchase completely. But then maybe that explains why the temperature of the straightener was given in celsius rather than the normal fahrenheit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it says \\&quot;Clarifying Shampoo is only to be used during the process.\\&quot; Does this mean that I can ONLY use that shampoo while doing this? Or that I only use it ONCE during the process? This was very poorly worded... Also, I would hesitate to use it again because it striped my hair to a hay texture when I used it the first time and it felt TERRIBLE. Is that really necessary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As previous reviewers have stated, if you have long hair... Mine is shoulder blade length when dry and medium thickness... You&#x27;ll need more product than what they provide. I managed to coat my hair to what I though was acceptable... But I would have preferred to have more to feel more comfortable with the level of saturation of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this with the results, as I&#x27;m only 24 hours in to the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, VENTILATION!! My eyes were so miserable that I had to go stand by a fan at high blast. Ugh.</li>
    <li> I am amazed how awesome this product was. I started my transformation on saturday morning and i didnt wash my hair until Tuesday morning. I let it stay in my hair for the whole 72 hours. I must admit i was a little worried about it at first. I am truly amazed at how it worked just like the salon but for a quarter of the price and I did it myself. definitely will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have short, very thick, wavy to curly hair. Like, think Aon Flux short. I have done salon keratins and then have done a full professional set I bought from Sally. Both worked great BUT salon is too expensive and the full set from Sally ends up leaving me with a ton of product that I have to just throw away. I was looking for a small set and saw this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, I was skeptical since there was no neutralizing step. But I washed my hair for the first time today and it is PIN STRAIGHT without even using a flat iron!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did do a full flat iron several times (when I would wake up, after the gym, after being outside in the humidity) during the 72 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was just enough product for me so I do not see how someone with longer hair could use this size, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I had to do the flat iron with the product step outside. My eyes and throat were burning like crazy in my bathroom with the exhaust fan on.</li>
    <li> This is soooooo worth the money. LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!!I followed the instructions exactly as per leaflet enclosed.From the very first feel under the shower the hair felt truly silky and smooth.I have done keratin treatment in parlors in Dubai BUT it was never as good.No hair fall.....very smooth n defizzed....just a gentle blow dry with a wide brush.....READY to go!!I have now ordered a bigger pack for the next use after  2 to 3 months probably.</li>
    <li> I have to order two sets of these because my hair is long. Just follow the directions to the letter. I made that mistake with another Brazilian one last year and there were some wet spots of the keratin the hair dryer missed and when I ironed it, it fried my hair and the hair strands snapped. But, this one just had a little bit more breakage than normal.</li>
    <li> Bottles too small. I would have to purchase 3 kits for my hair. Too costly, had to return.</li>
