      <li>This is so nice, I can use at night without feeling I&#x27;m leaving &#x27;greasespots&#x27; on my pillow, and during the day under powder makeup, and it never creases or &#x27;sits&#x27; on the surface.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use I like it very much and gonna be my best product</li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t find a better moisturizer for the price.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Smell is ok.</li>
      <li>Just make it more widely available! :)</li>
      <li>So many friends and acquaintances have recommended St. Ives moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It is very light and absorbs very quickly.</li>
      <li>Now to be fair, I use an anti wrinkle cream first.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and it got to me quickly!</li>
      <li>My neck and face feel very soft from this, and I also put this on my hands and it feels very amazing.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it and will continue to use this as I have been pleasantly surprised and happy</li>
      <li>They are strong supporters</li>
      <li>GREAT light lotion, especially for those of us who have acne breakouts with many of the &#x27;greasier&#x27; moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>I use this for a night moisturizer and really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
      <li>For my use, I have been putting on more than plenty as it is very affordable.</li>
      <li>Nothing extraordinary either way.</li>
      <li>When I look closely at my skin it looks and feels different, more youthful and more elastic.</li>
      <li>I have had a very good experience with this moisturizer over this past winter.</li>
      <li>I can report that it is slightly scented and may be a good choice for anyone who is bothered by too much of a strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>or so it has done a really nice job of softening my skin and there is nothing left to give an undesirable leftover.  </li>
      <li>exactly what we wanted</li>
      <li>I put this on my face the first night</li>
      <li>How many times is a product changed to become &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; and it actually loses the very qualities you liked about it in the first place?  </li>
      <li>like it&#x27;s really doing something.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do everything it says.</li>
      <li>It is not sticky and it is really moisturizing</li>
      <li>I have a very oily T and U zone.</li>
      <li>After about 15 minutes, I gently pat off the excess.</li>
      <li>I put on as much as I want and by bedtime or in an hour</li>
      <li>I really think this has helped me the way I was hoping it would.</li>
      <li>Also if you have very oily skin use JOJOBA Oil it really works.</li>
      <li>for what would be a more normal use, I have an oily face but dry everywhere else.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and it goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Then, I dampen a towel, put it in the microwave just long enough to warm it, and then put that over the cream on my face.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my face any more or less oily.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that it contains no SPF protection, as many facial moisturizers now do.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this cream was given a high rating, couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores, so I ordered it here.  </li>
      <li>Several times during the day, I massage small amounts into my hands and they always feel better!</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to think of this; but my therapist gave me a list of things that MIGHT be beneficial and said to try them.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping,great product,would definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>and I did have some breaking out on the sides of my face, but when I applied it earlier that night, a few hours later where it was oily, it became more oily due to the moister.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I want to give some advice with this product, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and have noticed a few things. I have a very oily T and U zone. T zone is the forehead and down the nose, and the U zone is underneath your nose and up the sides of the nose. I have very bad oily places there and needed to start a new skin care routine in hopes that maybe I could clear it up. I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to spend money on collagen masks and a different type of moisturizer. I put this on my face the first night and I did have some breaking out on the sides of my face, but when I applied it earlier that night, a few hours later where it was oily, it became more oily due to the moister. So if you have oily skin use a tiny bit, not a lot, but a tiny bit. My neck and face feel very soft from this, and I also put this on my hands and it feels very amazing. So just be careful while using this. Also if you have very oily skin use JOJOBA Oil it really works.</li>
    <li> So many friends and acquaintances have recommended St. Ives moisturizer.  They are strong supporters and I thought I would try this facial moisturizer to see if I could see any differences from my usual moisturizer. (Shiseido and Lancôme). Price point is dramatically lower, let&#x27;s hope this works!</li>
    <li> exactly what we wanted</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t find a better moisturizer for the price.</li>
    <li> Clearly not a great cream.  Bought it on a recommendation for Amazon.  But it&#x27;s too oily and sits on the face instead of sinking in.  Doesn&#x27;t really do everything it says.</li>
    <li> OK -- this moisturizer is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for about ten years, maybe longer. I have combination skin, so I find some facial moisturizers to be way too heavy and greasy, while others go on and then seem to disappear like water, leaving the skin thirsty again. This St. Ives has a gorgeous, light, almost souffle-like consistency that keeps your face looking and feeling wonderfully hydrated and soft. I am constantly complimented on my skin, and this is why. You can cheat and put it on other parts of  the body -- the cleavage and the booty -- for smoother and softer skin there as well. If I can&#x27;t find this Collagen Elastin formula at the drugstore, I literally panic because nothing else works this well for the price.  The only drawback is that it contains no SPF protection, as many facial moisturizers now do. But I wouldn&#x27;t want to change the formulation just for that. How many times is a product changed to become &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; and it actually loses the very qualities you liked about it in the first place?  Don&#x27;t change this product, St. Ives! Just make it more widely available! :)</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer!  Feels great going on, not too greasy.  My skin feels great after applying...like it&#x27;s really doing something.</li>
    <li> This has a really pleasant scent that reminds me of dandelions.  That&#x27;s it. Nothing extraordinary either way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use I like it very much and gonna be my best product</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer ever, I use it day and night and it does hide my wrinkles</li>
    <li> This is a good cream to maintein the collagen in the skin. It has a good absorption. It is not sticky and it is really moisturizing</li>
    <li> I goes on very smoothly</li>
    <li> I use this for a night moisturizer and really enjoy it. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it got to me quickly!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Smell is ok. I had hand surgery on both hands at the same time and needed something to help with the healing. I really think this has helped me the way I was hoping it would. For my use, I have been putting on more than plenty as it is very affordable. I do this when I don&#x27;t have to do anything else. After about 15 minutes, I gently pat off the excess. Leaves my skin nice and soft. All the working parts in my hands have been disturbed. As they heal, they want to draw up. Several times during the day, I massage small amounts into my hands and they always feel better! I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to think of this; but my therapist gave me a list of things that MIGHT be beneficial and said to try them. Other things I have found on Amazon which were on that list to try and have, also, been helpful are: Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream, Best Bentonite Clay (Guthrie, Oklahoma - GREAT PRICE). I didn&#x27;t mention the fact that it feels ever so nice on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for what would be a more normal use, I have an oily face but dry everywhere else.  I usually put  this on my arms and neck in the early evening while watching tv.  I put on as much as I want and by bedtime or in an hour or so it has done a really nice job of softening my skin and there is nothing left to give an undesirable leftover.  I never find any traces of it on the sheets or pillow cases.  I love this cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my oily face, I do put it on my face just because it feels so good.  Then, I dampen a towel, put it in the microwave just long enough to warm it, and then put that over the cream on my face.  WOW! it feels just like expensive spa treatment.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my face any more or less oily.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this cream was given a high rating, couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores, so I ordered it here.  My skin still feels tight after using it, and it burns when I put it on after using my anti wrinkle cream.  Now to be fair, I use an anti wrinkle cream first.  This isn&#x27;t the only cream that does this to me.  I was pretty disappointed.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping,great product,would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> GREAT light lotion, especially for those of us who have acne breakouts with many of the &#x27;greasier&#x27; moisturizers.

I strongly recommend it and will continue to use this as I have been pleasantly surprised and happy I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you St. Ives</li>
