      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Speaking of the product,I love the Redken style 12 straightening lisage and it works wonders for my hair!</li>
      <li>and my hair looks amazing.</li>
      <li>But I think most good heat protectant serums paired up with the Align will do the job.</li>
      <li>Also smells nice &amp; leaves my hair shiny.</li>
      <li>Made hair look kind of greasy.</li>
      <li>Like another reviewer mentioned, I examined the pump and noticed that it came off easily which is not the case with ANY health and beauty product as they always do a good job ensuring their products can&#x27;t be tampered</li>
      <li>and you want your hair to look beautiful and straight and smelling great, then this is the right product for you!...</li>
      <li>But Redken align by far has been the best.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of very good high end products:</li>
      <li>There is no quality control and no way to ensure you are getting an authentic product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Next: excellent products.</li>
      <li>What I also love, is it has hear protection in it</li>
      <li>This is the second time i&#x27;m buying from this seller and every time I buy from them, I am happy!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Glad to have found this product again.</li>
      <li>price was great wife really likes the product</li>
      <li>I love this product and appreciate being able to order it on line at my convenience.</li>
      <li>I just love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to cautiously use this yellowish stuff as it seems to be working ok, and i&#x27;ve already purchased it...</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m well acquainted with the look, smell and texture of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>then I took off the cap and popped the pump off easily</li>
      <li>At my office, I run my fingers through it again and spray lightly.</li>
      <li>This one seems to be working great on my short hair.</li>
      <li>Own a business I feel it is important to ship the exact right product as shown online&amp;#34</li>
      <li>This is the original formula, a balm.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and smooth, LOVE!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost been a week, and though I would never go this long, my hair just held and looked great.</li>
      <li>All the new ones are lotion and not as effective.</li>
      <li>One good pump is all I need for my fairly short, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Redken has a good standard.</li>
      <li>Okay, much was her technique.</li>
      <li>star: quick delivery (3 business</li>
      <li>Hope it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>i have frizzy fine hair and this lotion worked to prevent frizzing in the misty weather at the beach where i live.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought hundreds of items on Amazon, including this exact product</li>
      <li>when cocktailed with Aragan oil makes hair soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>And smell pretty too.  </li>
      <li>So i&#x27;ve ordered this product three times online and naturally jumped on the cheap $8/unit price.  </li>
      <li>I also wasn&#x27;t sure when I&#x27;d get my product &amp; there was a slight delay because of the holidays and when I contacted the seller they offered to resend the product free of charge.</li>
      <li>Always liked redken, tried switching to cheaper products not worth it.</li>
      <li>(but I want the real thing)</li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing comes close to Redken Align.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair straight and silky.  </li>
      <li>Normally the product is white with a sweet smell,  These bottles arrived wih product that was yellowish and had a less sweet, more chemical smell.  </li>
      <li>I mix a little American Crew Defining Paste and some Forming Cream, then add the Redken to the mix, and it does a good job of straightening out my rogue curls.</li>
      <li>highly recommend you do not buy this off of Amazon regardless of seller.</li>
      <li>Seems to work ok but leave my hair a little &amp;#34;crunchier&amp;#34; when it dries.  </li>
      <li>I had to call her to find out what the products were that she used when she cut and styled my hair last -- a rare thing for me to do.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and makes my curls nice and straight</li>
      <li>Do not like the new formula.</li>
      <li>I still had some of my old product left in the bottle, when the new bottle came in I could tell right off the bat</li>
      <li>/&gt;This just goes to show, ALWAYS ALWAYS buy directly from a salon or salon store.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my curly hair manageable when I try to straighten it or leave it natural.</li>
      <li>With a hair dryer, it makes the big curls straight for 9 hours.</li>
      <li>This product eliminates the frizz and makes my hair so straight that I do NOT need to flat iron it!</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a  straightening lotion that actually works, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>While i typically love this product, I&#x27;m sketchy about the seller (Eligab Wholesale Emporium) or at least the batch, of this last order of mine.  </li>
      <li>You barely need one pump, and I have a lot of hair!</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been buying Redkin products for years, normally I buy through my salon, but I was running low and didn&#x27;t have a chance to get down there</li>
<li> so Redken 12 has been my go to for protection when I flat iron daily.</li>
<li> It lasts all day, does not leave a residue, and works well with a flat iron.  </li>
<li> Not weighing it down and not sticky... just allowing the natural curl to relax a bit and be styled and not flattened out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very surprised that Amazon allows this to be sold, especially considering the past reviews.</li>
<li> I have wavy to spiral hair down to mid back.</li>
<li> With this product, I can put it in damp hair, run my fingers through to style, and let it dry on my way to work.</li>
<li> I paid $15.97 for this and assumed I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about a fake product considering it was almost full price compared to what you pay in a salon.</li>
<li> Sticky and didn&#x27;t do what I expected it to.</li>
<li> Product and delivery was what was expected.</li>
<li> I received the item, I opened the box and just set it aside with my other toiletries in a cabinet since I didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
<li> My hair is very thick, and soft.</li>
<li> because i&#x27;m still skeptical about what i&#x27;m really putting in my hair.  </li>
<li> It also does not way my hair down.</li>
<li> This supplier had hands down the lowest price I&#x27;ve ever paid for this.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all.</li>
<li> I like this product - I have really thick, semi-curly hair, and this stuff helps me blow it out &amp; flat iron it.  </li>
<li> well how could they tamper a sealed container, (because you have to rip that little flap off of the nozzle)</li>
<li> I have thin, brown hair that is part frizzy and part big waves and curls.</li>
<li> A few issues getting it on time</li>
<li> Manages curley or wavy hair, not too heavy, washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;Great for styling men and women.</li>
<li> Helps tame friz.  </li>
<li> After asking why I didn&#x27;t receive the product shown (described) on their website, I was sent this rude email from Hair Care Expo~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You opened with &amp;#34;I</li>
<li> I have extremely thick hair and have tired dozens of straightening lotions, creams, sprays, etc.  </li>
<li> I put some on my hands to test and could tell this was a fake.</li>
<li> It was yellow in color and smelled awful.  </li>
<li> The wrong product was sent redken 8.</li>
<li> But, living in a humid climate can make for bad hair days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice smell and styles well</li>
    <li> I am looking to buy this Redken product now after my stylist used it. (but I want the real thing) I had to call her to find out what the products were that she used when she cut and styled my hair last -- a rare thing for me to do. It&#x27;s almost been a week, and though I would never go this long, my hair just held and looked great. Okay, much was her technique. The first way to beautiful hair is a great cut. Next: excellent products. My hair is very thick, and soft. But, living in a humid climate can make for bad hair days. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of very good high end products: Aveda, Nexxus styling gel, It&#x27;s a Ten mousse (should have gotten the leave in stuff) Paul Mitchell mousse (eh). But Redken align by far has been the best. It straightened and was coupled with a heat protector serum. But I think most good heat protectant serums paired up with the Align will do the job. I have used and loved Chi, Fredrick Fekkai, Keihl&#x27;s Sik Groom. Any of these and you are good to go. (after drying and ironing).</li>
    <li> So i&#x27;ve ordered this product three times online and naturally jumped on the cheap $8/unit price.  While i typically love this product, I&#x27;m sketchy about the seller (Eligab Wholesale Emporium) or at least the batch, of this last order of mine.  My star rating is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+1 star: low price&lt;br /&gt;+1 star: quick delivery (3 business days)&lt;br /&gt;-1 star: excess packaging (had about 4 layers- only needed one or two.  Didn&#x27;t like wasting all the plastic&lt;br /&gt;-1 star: color and smell.  This is what makes me think it&#x27;s a knockoff.  Normally the product is white with a sweet smell,  These bottles arrived wih product that was yellowish and had a less sweet, more chemical smell.  Something appears to be fishy....&lt;br /&gt;+/- 1 star: performance.  Seems to work ok but leave my hair a little &amp;#34;crunchier&amp;#34; when it dries.  I&#x27;m undecided whether i want to give this a + or -, but for the purposes of this review, i&#x27;m going to keep this as a - because i&#x27;m still skeptical about what i&#x27;m really putting in my hair.  I will continue to cautiously use this yellowish stuff as it seems to be working ok, and i&#x27;ve already purchased it...</li>
    <li> I have curly hair so Redken 12 has been my go to for protection when I flat iron daily. This supplier had hands down the lowest price I&#x27;ve ever paid for this. I also wasn&#x27;t sure when I&#x27;d get my product &amp; there was a slight delay because of the holidays and when I contacted the seller they offered to resend the product free of charge. Excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> The wrong product was sent redken 8. Not what I ordered at all.  I was extremely disappointed. I didn&#x27;t ship back because I knew there was a fee</li>
    <li> After asking why I didn&#x27;t receive the product shown (described) on their website, I was sent this rude email from Hair Care Expo~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You opened with &amp;#34;I Own a business I feel it is important to ship the exact right product as shown online&amp;#34; so I said &amp;#34;IF you owned a Salon&amp;#34; you would understand that when purchasing a &amp;#34;SALON EXCLUSIVE&amp;#34; line which redken is that the packaging changes without notice to us and we get whatever we get. Redken says that is Redken Align 12 then that is what it is we can not control that. If you want the same packaging every time you purchase a product you should either try Suave or other grocery store brands, or pick a Salon Line that is still privately owned and does not have a cooperate giant that changes its ingredients all the time trying to squeeze every ounce of profit out the their products until they destroy the products reputation to the point of discontinuation, in which time they release another product and start the whole process over (that usually has a different name but has a former formula as an original discontinued product).</li>
    <li> Have been using Align 12 for three years...definitely works!</li>
    <li> i have frizzy fine hair and this lotion worked to prevent frizzing in the misty weather at the beach where i live.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  You barely need one pump, and I have a lot of hair!</li>
    <li> I paid $15.97 for this and assumed I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about a fake product considering it was almost full price compared to what you pay in a salon. I have been using this for years and purchased dozens of bottles along the way so I&#x27;m well acquainted with the look, smell and texture of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the item, I opened the box and just set it aside with my other toiletries in a cabinet since I didn&#x27;t need it. I&#x27;ve bought hundreds of items on Amazon, including this exact product so I did not expect to have to examine it closely. When the time came to use the product, I took it out and looked at it and saw it was yellow. I smelled the product and it did not smell good, compared to authentic Redken products which smell great. I put some on my hands to test and could tell this was a fake. Like another reviewer mentioned, I examined the pump and noticed that it came off easily which is not the case with ANY health and beauty product as they always do a good job ensuring their products can&#x27;t be tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you do not buy this off of Amazon regardless of seller. There is no quality control and no way to ensure you are getting an authentic product. I&#x27;m very surprised that Amazon allows this to be sold, especially considering the past reviews. I contacted Amazon and received a refund and they said they were submitting feedback on the product/seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Redkin products for years, normally I buy through my salon, but I was running low and didn&#x27;t have a chance to get down there so I decided to purchase through Amazon.  Whoever is the supplier for this product is NOT TO BE TRUSTED!  I still had some of my old product left in the bottle, when the new bottle came in I could tell right off the bat this was not what it was supposed to be.  It was yellow in color and smelled awful.  I thought to myself well how could they tamper a sealed container, (because you have to rip that little flap off of the nozzle) then I took off the cap and popped the pump off easily and it was simple to tell this was not a quality Redkin product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasted money, and time, and loss of a buyer!! Hope it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just goes to show, ALWAYS ALWAYS buy directly from a salon or salon store.  Inspect your products, never trust an online source unless it&#x27;s trusted by Redkin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes.</li>
    <li> Redken has a good standard. Always liked redken, tried switching to cheaper products not worth it. Would recommend keep your price low- will workout well for customers</li>
    <li> price was great wife really likes the product</li>
    <li> Sticky and didn&#x27;t do what I expected it to. Made hair look kind of greasy.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and smooth, LOVE!</li>
    <li> This is the second time i&#x27;m buying from this seller and every time I buy from them, I am happy! I&#x27;ve had no problems with this seller and I get my products on time!...Speaking of the product,I love the Redken style 12 straightening lisage and it works wonders for my hair! If you have curly hair like mine and you want your hair to look beautiful and straight and smelling great, then this is the right product for you!...Don&#x27;t ever think about buying this from a hair salon but instead, buy this product from this seller! I give the seller and the product 2 thumbs waaaaay up!</li>
    <li> I have wavy to spiral hair down to mid back. It is also coarse and frizzy. This product eliminates the frizz and makes my hair so straight that I do NOT need to flat iron it! It also does not way my hair down. What I also love, is it has hear protection in it so it saves me from adding another product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff.  It&#x27;s great for my hair and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Styling products are very personal! This one seems to be working great on my short hair. Not weighing it down and not sticky... just allowing the natural curl to relax a bit and be styled and not flattened out. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have thin, brown hair that is part frizzy and part big waves and curls. With this product, I can put it in damp hair, run my fingers through to style, and let it dry on my way to work. At my office, I run my fingers through it again and spray lightly. It gives me control over the big curls and allows me to hide the frizz. With a hair dryer, it makes the big curls straight for 9 hours.</li>
    <li> I love this product and appreciate being able to order it on line at my convenience.</li>
    <li> recommondation from my stylist.  when cocktailed with Aragan oil makes hair soft and smooth.  And smell pretty too.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the original formula, a balm. All the new ones are lotion and not as effective.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair and have tired dozens of straightening lotions, creams, sprays, etc.  Absolutely nothing comes close to Redken Align.  It is worth the cost.  It leaves your hair straight and silky.  It lasts all day, does not leave a residue, and works well with a flat iron.  I don&#x27;t even use a heat protector because Align takes care of everything.  If you are looking for a  straightening lotion that actually works, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I mix a little American Crew Defining Paste and some Forming Cream, then add the Redken to the mix, and it does a good job of straightening out my rogue curls.</li>
    <li> Keeps my curly hair manageable when I try to straighten it or leave it natural.</li>
    <li> Glad to have found this product again. Love it.</li>
    <li> One good pump is all I need for my fairly short, curly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all. Helps tame friz.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Product and delivery was what was expected.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years. Manages curley or wavy hair, not too heavy, washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;Great for styling men and women.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years.  Definitely helps making comb through easier</li>
    <li> A few issues getting it on time but I love the product!!</li>
    <li> It was what I am used to.  Do not like the new formula.</li>
    <li> I like this product - I have really thick, semi-curly hair, and this stuff helps me blow it out &amp; flat iron it.  Also smells nice &amp; leaves my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!! I would not be without it! A little goes a long way and makes my curls nice and straight and my hair looks amazing. I truly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> He uses it since2 years.</li>
