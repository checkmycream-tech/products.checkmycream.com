      <li>Does clear skin problems like pimples, not greasy and leaves  </li>
      <li>There is a slight sulfur smell, but its a clean feeling after shower or bathing.</li>
      <li>This routine is done morning and evening and in a couple of days my acne shrinks considerably.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been to four different doctors, none of whom suggested anything more than changing to different dandruff shampoos, leaving the shampoo on for ten minutes before rinsing, and all that other nonsense, when I&#x27;ve never presented one flake in all those years.</li>
      <li>I love that I can use it on my face or back if I get a small breakout and in 1 day, it is gone!  </li>
      <li>Pair this w bye bye blemish and teen has clear skin</li>

<li> It&#x27;s good but remember to wear deodorant and cologne cause the smell isn&#x27;t bad</li>
<li> I plan to use it diligently since many other soaps just made matters worse and left my skin greasy and problematic.</li>
<li> Having a scalp condition that ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has ever worked for (4-5 tiny patches on my scalp that get an excessive build up of oil)  - not dandruff H &amp; S, Selenium sulfide, or coal</li>
<li> and I couldn&#x27;t imagine washing my long hair with a bar of soap.</li>
<li> At that point, I recall seeing it before, but I have long hair</li>
<li> (Though I would take efforts to prevent dog from licking it off,  had some strange urine and stool from her during the couple days afterward)</li>
<li> and it isn&#x27;t overpowering after her face is dry.</li>
<li> I use it every time I shower and have no issues with dry skin or irritation.</li>
<li> There is absolutely NO DRYING whatsoever with this soap</li>
<li> The container is not much of use.</li>
<li> The jar is so you can soak the bar and wet the soap, thus activating the ingrediaents.</li>
<li> ( Don&#x27;t use in SENSITIVE areas, if you know what I mean, use a 3 day treatment and Dove soap.)</li>
<li> And the other location too.</li>
<li> No more inflamed, red and scaly spots on my face, and I can grow a beard now without any skin issues.</li>
<li> The sulfur smell is very very minimal and once rinsed you can&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
<li> /&gt;The smell is slightly of sulfur.</li>
<li> My hair was a greasy smelly mess.</li>
<li> but it is not a strong scent either.</li>
<li> That smells like raw garlic.</li>
<li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and still have cystic acne break outs at least once a month.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t think of another worse word.</li>
<li> But I&#x27;ve smelled worse: Neem oil comes to mind.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not great smelling</li>
<li> The medication (oitment he recommended was crazy expensive.</li>
<li> It stinks</li>
<li> There&#x27;s sulphur in it, so it does smell a bit but not too bad.</li>
<li> Not just a pimple or two but those nasty cyst-like bumps.</li>
<li> It was horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The container is not much of use. You hold the soap in warm shower for 10 seconds and it works. Soap has contained my occasional acne.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recently told me I have Tinea Versicolor. The medication (oitment he recommended was crazy expensive. So I&#x27;ve been using Sal 3 which seems to be helping a lot. My skin feels soft and clean. It&#x27;s like a face scrub for your entire body!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful for face, body and hair!</li>
    <li> This soap works very well.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and leaves it very smooth. The sulfur smell is very very minimal and once rinsed you can&#x27;t smell it at all. Have already ordered more.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s sulphur in it, so it does smell a bit but not too bad. I have definitely seen an improvement in my skin which is clearing up rapidly. I know they mention that you can use it on your scalp, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I thought I&#x27;d try that since my scalp is oily (although I don&#x27;t breakout there). My hair was a greasy smelly mess. So great on skin, gross in hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fighting rosacea, the acne kind. This is helping immensely to exfoliate flaky skin, and reduce infection and inflammation. The jar is so you can soak the bar and wet the soap, thus activating the ingrediaents. I though this would cause the bar to get used up really fast, but it&#x27;s not bad. Now I put water to about 1/3 full. Still works, and I don&#x27;t have to pour out as much water (and soap) when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> strong sulfur smell even after you rinse, but definitely helps skin ailments</li>
    <li> I shower every day n my kp is better</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered this wonderful soap years ago. I have suffered with weird itching and scalp rashes for many years now. It has been relentless. There had not been a minute my scalp wasn&#x27;t itching unmercifully. I&#x27;ve been to four different doctors, none of whom suggested anything more than changing to different dandruff shampoos, leaving the shampoo on for ten minutes before rinsing, and all that other nonsense, when I&#x27;ve never presented one flake in all those years. The itching never stop. It was horrible. I can&#x27;t think of another worse word. I tried every medicated type of shampoo I could find. And I was actually looking for yet another thing to try when I came across this soap. At that point, I recall seeing it before, but I have long hair and I couldn&#x27;t imagine washing my long hair with a bar of soap. I put it in my cart then took it out and left it on my someday list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I couldn&#x27;t take it another minute more. I was looking for another remedy. I remembered this soap. I finally gave in and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day it arrived I procrastinated through another day of suffering because I still couldn&#x27;t wrap my itchy head around a bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I tried it. I was quite surprised how easily I was able to shampoo my hair with it. I had it immensely sudsy and left it on while I bathed the rest of my body, tending to another itchy area that was driving me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came time to rinse, I was impressed it rinsed off quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is slightly of sulfur. But I&#x27;ve smelled worse: Neem oil comes to mind. That smells like raw garlic. I had tried that too. If you want to talk about a lingering odor, don&#x27;t get me going about Neem oil :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the itching stopped. I wanted to see how much longer it would be like that. One day passed. Two. Three. On the fourth day I shampooed my hair with the soap anyway. Same thing. I&#x27;ve washed my hair with the soap four times now. And the other location too. No problems with itching. I feel around my scalp with my fingertips in search of remnants of the rash. I barely find any bumps at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so immensely relieved to have finally discovered a remedy for my own problem. I thank God for it. I will buy this again. Even if I don&#x27;t need it, I&#x27;m going to try to always have it on hand...just in case.</li>
    <li> Greatest thing since Sebulex shampoo went off the market!, Lathers well, works and feels better than the copycat shampoo that is nothing the same.</li>
    <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and still have cystic acne break outs at least once a month. Sal3 works quickly. With in a week I noticed clearer and softer skin. It&#x27;s not great smelling but it is not a strong scent either. In addition to my face I find it is a great over all soap. Seems to neutralize body odor  as well.</li>
    <li> Fast service. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using SAL3 for a couple of months now and it has completely resolved my seborrheic dermatitis on my face during the first week of use. No more inflamed, red and scaly spots on my face, and I can grow a beard now without any skin issues. I use it every time I shower and have no issues with dry skin or irritation. I wish I had discovered this product more than a decade ago! My prescription strength cortisone and ketoconazole creams now sit in a drawer unused.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but remember to wear deodorant and cologne cause the smell isn&#x27;t bad but it isn&#x27;t good. The soap is great but the smell is slightly odd, to any guy you should be fine. I&#x27;m fine bearly notice it but just wear cologne and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> This works very well for my cystic acne; I try to use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Does not help and makes my face stink for hours. I tried it for a month.</li>
    <li> Does clear skin problems like pimples, not greasy and leaves  you feeling very clean.  My dog had what I thought maybe the beginning of a mange outbreak, I washed her with the sulfur soap twice, not rinsing it off the 2nd time, drying her with a towel.  I put insecticide in her bedding and areas she roams. She no longer has the problem.  (Though I would take efforts to prevent dog from licking it off,  had some strange urine and stool from her during the couple days afterward) I recommend highly these soaps as they definitely  were effective against issues I been struggling with for several years.</li>
    <li> This soap really gives you a clean feeling. I use it all over my face and body and its not over drying. My house will never be out of this soap.</li>
    <li> Having a scalp condition that ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has ever worked for (4-5 tiny patches on my scalp that get an excessive build up of oil)  - not dandruff H &amp; S, Selenium sulfide, or coal tar- I figured I would try this cleansing bar.  I used with a shampoo brush and WITHIN THREE USES, I NO LONGER have the issue!!!!!!!!  I do not even have to use every day and the condition is NOT coming back!!!!!  I never even thought to used a treatment with Salicylic Acid before and I am so glad I came across this soap on here!  I love that I can use it on my face or back if I get a small breakout and in 1 day, it is gone!  There is absolutely NO DRYING whatsoever with this soap and it smells really good.  I already purchased additional bars to have as back up.</li>
    <li> Simply put, SAL 3 works. Occasionally my hormones run rampant on my face. Not just a pimple or two but those nasty cyst-like bumps. I stop my current skincare routine and just use this cleansing bar along with my Clarasonic cleansing brush. I soak the bar for 20 seconds in the container provided to activate the sulfur, apply to my brush and cleanse for 2-3 minutes.  I find that leaving the suds on your face for a couple of minutes ( if skin is sensitive you might want to skip this step) is an effective way to ensure the active ingredients penetrate the pores. I rinse thoroughly and apply a light moisturizer. This routine is done morning and evening and in a couple of days my acne shrinks considerably.  Great body cleansing bar too!</li>
    <li> I just received this item and used it twice and already notice a diffference with my dermatitis and my scalp issues. I plan to use it diligently since many other soaps just made matters worse and left my skin greasy and problematic. When you have skin textures that are different throughout your body, I&#x27;m hoping this product will heal my scaly skin. There is a slight sulfur smell, but its a clean feeling after shower or bathing. The lather is helpful when you leave it on a few minutes and rinse to feel very cleansed and a mild body mosturizer will give you an all over satisfying skintone.</li>
    <li> Pair this w bye bye blemish and teen has clear skin</li>
    <li> I am medication that causes me to be susceptible to Candida, Thrush, Acne. etc This soap is the best for in the shower and clearing up skin fungal infections. ( Don&#x27;t use in SENSITIVE areas, if you know what I mean, use a 3 day treatment and Dove soap.) Expect to have more skin peeling when drying with towel vigorously. This works very well.</li>
    <li> The size of this soap is like for premautre babies</li>
    <li> Very misleading! It came in a soap form. But the image is a plastic jar....so ? The actual soap didn&#x27;t hurt or help the cause,,,,except for extra dryness!  Anti-fungal ingredient was not a valid consideration, meaning that specific claim was absent in value results.</li>
    <li> This made my skin smooth -- however, my acne got worse. I asked my dermatologist and various others, and bar soaps are well known to cause acne. The chemicals that keep the bar soap in bar-form will clog your pores. If they had a liquid version, I would be willing to try it, but dont buy this to treat acne.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter who is allergic to benzoyl peroxide. It seems to work fairly well. It stinks but it&#x27;s sulfur and it isn&#x27;t overpowering after her face is dry.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t  see any changes  at all</li>
</ol>
