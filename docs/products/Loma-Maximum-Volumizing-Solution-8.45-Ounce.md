    <li> A little is all that is needed to give hair body and some volume.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  It curls my hair really bounce and gives it a soft feel.  But I think sometimes it dries my hair a little.  It could be just the weather.</li>
    <li> Great brand.. This product keeps hair soft with added style holding ability</li>
    <li> Works well and is not full of junky inredients.</li>
    <li> Great product liked a another loma product better but is discontinued this is a good second will buy again like this product line</li>
    <li> This product is great on your hair</li>
    <li> Got this at my hair sylist a year ago.  Great to put near roots when wash your hair, to put on when dry also to restyle. Can put in on and crunch to add body. Love that you can get it on Amazon for half the price. One of my friends liked it after trying it and just bought it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product did NOT give my hair volume, it WEIGHED it DOWN!</li>
    <li> Great for softly adding shine &amp; texture to dry hair.  Only wish one product could be found to style as well.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this product to boost the volume of my hair, since we have a similar hair type, (fine).It does seem to make my hair appear fuller for a while. My complaint is that it makes my very hair dry. I&#x27;m thinking that since my ends are pretty dry anyway, that if I try it again, I&#x27;ll just apply it to my roots. A warning to anyone who uses a flat iron-DON&#x27;T use it with this product! I did and it sort of fried the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> runnier than I thought it would be.  I was looking for a paste</li>
    <li> Shopped all over before ordering online.  Expensive but happy to have it after delivering to sister&#x27;s address in U.S. and she mailed to Canada.</li>
    <li> Wrong product was sent ! Asked for firm hold gel and got volume maximizing which was useless and a waste of money. Careless and sloppy to send completely wrong product . Would not use again .would cost almost as much as the product is worth to ship it back.</li>
    <li> a nice lift for flat hair.  It still got flat a few hours later and felt greasy.  I will wait till I use this up to see if it was decent enough to repurchase.  Good for saving a blowout.</li>
    <li> great hold. Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out. i have thick mixed hair and a little goes a long way...Too much can cause build up though</li>
    <li> I have very soft and thin hair.  this product works great</li>
    <li> Better than most hair jells I&#x27;ve used... Really excellent.</li>
    <li> Very good...recommended it to two friends and they bought it also.</li>
    <li> Life saver for my grand daughters hair that is thin and tangles!</li>
    <li> I love the Loma products! This definitely gives my limp hair some extra volume!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years.  It give your hair volume w/o making it too heavy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> telling my hair dresser about it!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years but when I moved could not find anywhere local to buy it.  Thanks Amazon for making it easy for me to continue using the product that I love</li>
    <li> A little dab will do yah ! Love it !</li>
    <li> Product is good but I am not seeing the &amp;#34;volume.&amp;#34; I like that it is organic though...</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This gives my hair so much more body.  I use it after every shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair was like straw using the new volumizer.  Please bring back the Loma Intent formula.  In the meantime I have to switch brands. Goodbye Loma...</li>
    <li> Great product for styling. I have short fine hear &amp; it gives me a lot of volume. I just use a dab cause a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave the hair sticky!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and makeup artist.  Loma is and has been one of the main products I use for any type of hair, it&#x27;s great if you know how to handle hot tools such a s flat iron and or blow dryer.</li>
