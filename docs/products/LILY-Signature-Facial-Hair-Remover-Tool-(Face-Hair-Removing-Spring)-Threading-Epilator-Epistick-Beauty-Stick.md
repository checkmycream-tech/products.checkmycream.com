### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works wonderful for &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>wife tried it out and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While it won&#x27;t be used all the time, it&#x27;s been a great addition to her tool box</li>
      <li>Use is fairly self explanatory though.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>and that is a good deal...</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, after using it a couple times, she thinks it&#x27;s a great alternative to using tweezers to get hairs more than one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not the most pleasant experience if you have thicker hair like I do,</li>
      <li>Good.&lt;br /&gt;but need to learn how to use it effectively</li>
      <li>probably more suited for women</li>
      <li>You will love it....</li>
      <li>I think it works better for finer hair.  </li>
      <li>My wife used it with pretty good results.</li>
      <li>This tool works better on fine hair.  </li>
      <li>, you end up wiith a baby smooth face and your makeup looks soo much better and out in the sunshine, you no longer look like a powdered fuzzy peach.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t be quite as precise though.</li>
      <li>This thing is quick, easy and painless.</li>
      <li>this little spring is kind of amazing.  </li>
      <li>The best part about it is you can pull multiple hairs at once vs tweezing which only gets one at a time.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>May has well wax, because it is much quicker!</li>
      <li>I works exactly as described.</li>
      <li>At first, has no idea how to use the thing.  </li>
      <li>Once I figured out how to use the thing, it works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>and it works much better for coarse hair.</li>
      <li>Simple and... sorta easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same pain as waxing and all that, but i&#x27;ve never tried that before so it was all new to me.  </li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Experiment with how much you need to bend the device for it to grab.</li>
      <li>My GF received this as a gag gift from a friend, so we didn&#x27;t think much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bellabe works very well.</li>
      <li>Very compact and doesn&#x27;t rust to my knowledge.</li>
      <li>When I first got it, I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to use it, but it took less than a minute to get that taken care of.</li>
      <li>now, in a short time, and thru a little self training, i have successfully removed all the unwanted hair on my face.  </li>
      <li>I received this handy little tool in a brand new condition but without any instructions.  </li>
      <li>Quickly and with much pain, not only does it remove hair, but leaves your skin clean of any type of residue or wax from other means of hair removal.  </li>
      <li>The coil is not as small to be able to clean eyebrows but work on areas where there is no need to line up such as mustache, cheeks, chin, etc</li>
      <li>for the success I&#x27;ve had with using this and getting rid of my unwanted facial hair!!!</li>
      <li>Works as advertised but certainly not pain free.</li>
      <li>I was actualy surprised at how well it wotked.  </li>
      <li>Anyway I dare not use it because the spring looks old and rusty.</li>
      <li>It is almost completely painless as well.  </li>
      <li>Finally, got smart enough to try this and</li>
      <li>Takes a little bit of practice to use it on yourself at first, but definitely doable.</li>
      <li>It felt a little strange at first.</li>

<li> Not particularly great but not bad either.</li>
<li> I thought it would be pretty quick, but it is time consuming and painful.</li>
<li> She said that the pain was minor and it appears to have done the job as advertised.</li>
<li> Over all the tool does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but does not replace all your other facial hair accessories.</li>
<li> wish it would have come with instructions as how to use it, but after a few minutes of trying different methods I finally figured out to to use it.</li>
<li> The secret is to pull as fast as possible to not feel the pain.</li>
<li> i have been let down time and time again by my little electric facial shaver.  </li>
<li> The minute I placed this tool against my skin, it deposited HUNDREDS of little, coarse, black whiskers.</li>
<li> /&gt;Update: I then bought the Bellabe which is less expensive, is made in USA, the spring is shiny and new.</li>
<li> Took it out of the box and little specks of black hair fell out.</li>
<li> I got this little guy to extend the life of my chest/arm waxes</li>
<li> Quality little product just takes some getting used to.</li>
<li> It hurts little bit though.</li>
<li> Obviously, someone else had used it and not only did they repackage it for sale, but they repackaged it DIRTY.</li>
<li> I little painful at first</li>
<li> As long as you go slow until you&#x27;re use to the prickly feeling, it isn&#x27;t painful really.</li>
<li> it pulls and creates a little prickly feeling, but, at least for that</li>
<li> If you want to remove hair at the cost of just a few tears this is the item for you!  </li>
<li> Much less painful than an epilator and takes about the same amount of time.</li>
<li> A little painful since its pulling the hair out.</li>
<li> It was HORRIBLE and GROSS.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit painful for thicker hair</li>
<li> Painfully but it does it!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> crap this thing works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Holy crap</li>
<li> This was the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon.</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as said even if you had direction which I had to look up.</li>
    <li> PEACH FUZZ GONE!!!  and that is a good deal... this little spring is kind of amazing.  i have been let down time and time again by my little electric facial shaver.  Finally, got smart enough to try this and now, in a short time, and thru a little self training, i have successfully removed all the unwanted hair on my face.  it pulls and creates a little prickly feeling, but, at least for that, you end up wiith a baby smooth face and your makeup looks soo much better and out in the sunshine, you no longer look like a powdered fuzzy peach.  Yay!!! for the success I&#x27;ve had with using this and getting rid of my unwanted facial hair!!!</li>
    <li> At first, has no idea how to use the thing.  It says on the box that a manual comes inside.  Well mine didn&#x27;t, so had no idea how to use it.  Had to google it and watch a video.  Once I figured out how to use the thing, it works pretty well.  The best part about it is you can pull multiple hairs at once vs tweezing which only gets one at a time.  Can&#x27;t be quite as precise though.</li>
    <li> I was actualy surprised at how well it wotked.  It is almost completely painless as well.  Much less painful than an epilator and takes about the same amount of time.</li>
    <li> I received this handy little tool in a brand new condition but without any instructions.  It did work &amp; does what it suppossed to do.  It hurts little bit though.</li>
    <li> It works to get out those stray hairs.  I think it works better for finer hair.  probably more suited for women</li>
    <li> This very simple tool works just as you&#x27;d expect. Not the most pleasant experience if you have thicker hair like I do, but it does work.</li>
    <li> My GF received this as a gag gift from a friend, so we didn&#x27;t think much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after using it a couple times, she thinks it&#x27;s a great alternative to using tweezers to get hairs more than one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it won&#x27;t be used all the time, it&#x27;s been a great addition to her tool box</li>
    <li> My wife used it with pretty good results. She said that the pain was minor and it appears to have done the job as advertised. She has finer hair, so that probably helped.</li>
    <li> Holy crap this thing hurts!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy crap this thing works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried it out and it worked great.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same pain as waxing and all that, but i&#x27;ve never tried that before so it was all new to me.  The wife said she would continue to use it, so it must work well enough.</li>
    <li> Its supposed to remove hair, it does. A little painful since its pulling the hair out. Not particularly great but not bad either.</li>
    <li> This was the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. The minute I placed this tool against my skin, it deposited HUNDREDS of little, coarse, black whiskers. It was HORRIBLE and GROSS. Obviously, someone else had used it and not only did they repackage it for sale, but they repackaged it DIRTY. UGH!!!!!</li>
    <li> It felt a little strange at first. Once I figured out the routine, It was simple and painless. I works exactly as described. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> This thing is quick, easy and painless. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave any unwanted marks on my skin. When I first got it, I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to use it, but it took less than a minute to get that taken care of. Beats the heck out tweezers or waxing.</li>
    <li> Quality little product just takes some getting used to. I got this little guy to extend the life of my chest/arm waxes and it&#x27;s paying off. Takes a little bit of practice to use it on yourself at first, but definitely doable. Pain isn&#x27;t even a factor, no better/worse than using a standard pair of tweezers. I figure it&#x27;s saving me ~$20 a month in manscaping so I&#x27;m all about it.</li>
    <li> I would give the threaders a five star but it won&#x27;t grab the thicker hairs on my upper lip and chin. It works wonderful for &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;. As long as you go slow until you&#x27;re use to the prickly feeling, it isn&#x27;t painful really. Experiment with how much you need to bend the device for it to grab. Turn it away from face or towards face when grabbing. You will love it....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit painful for thicker hair but, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> This misses a lot of hair, so it can actually take awhile to get it all. I thought it would be pretty quick, but it is time consuming and painful. May has well wax, because it is much quicker!</li>
    <li> Gross. Took it out of the box and little specks of black hair fell out. Anyway I dare not use it because the spring looks old and rusty. Not at all like what the pictures depict.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I then bought the Bellabe which is less expensive, is made in USA, the spring is shiny and new. Bellabe works very well. The Bellabe is a must-have!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, Would recommend.Very compact and doesn&#x27;t rust to my knowledge. I am looking forward to using it on my back next</li>
    <li> It really works. I little painful at first but you get used to it</li>
    <li> Good product. Works as advertised but certainly not pain free. Taking off 1 star because the box said it came with a manual, but it did not. Use is fairly self explanatory though.</li>
    <li> Simple and... sorta easy to use.  If you want to remove hair at the cost of just a few tears this is the item for you!  Quickly and with much pain, not only does it remove hair, but leaves your skin clean of any type of residue or wax from other means of hair removal.  Saves you tons of money and its reusable.  Cant beat that!</li>
    <li> It does what it supposed to do and removes facial hair. Painfully but it does it!&lt;br /&gt;The pain level is the same as threading facial removal. The secret is to pull as fast as possible to not feel the pain. I like the concept, but it may not be idea for all facial areas. The coil is not as small to be able to clean eyebrows but work on areas where there is no need to line up such as mustache, cheeks, chin, etc......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would have come with instructions as how to use it, but after a few minutes of trying different methods I finally figured out to to use it. Over all the tool does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but does not replace all your other facial hair accessories.</li>
    <li> Good.&lt;br /&gt;but need to learn how to use it effectively</li>
    <li> This tool works better on fine hair.  If you have coarse facial hair, it takes forever to get them all and I also had to do a bit of follow-up with tweezers afterwards.  I bought the Olymstore(TM) Spring Facial Hair Removal Tool Facial Epilator Hair Remover Stick Beauty Tool - 5pack and it works much better for coarse hair.</li>
