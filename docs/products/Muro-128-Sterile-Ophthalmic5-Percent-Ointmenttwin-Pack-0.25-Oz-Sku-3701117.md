### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best part was getting 2 for the price of one!</li>
      <li>My dog needs this for her eyes and this is the best product!  </li>
      <li>For my corneal mapdot fingerprint dystrophy, adding Muro128 to my Restasis routine was the difference between blurry vision and almost perfect vision.  </li>
      <li>Muro 128 is a very good product.  </li>
      <li>Bausch &amp; Lomb Muro 138 opthalmic ointment is great.  </li>
      <li>stuff is great.</li>
      <li>Bought this twin pack as it&#x27;s a great price and</li>
      <li>Some good reliable merchants from whom I have purchased this product are Mr.Medical, Pharmpak.  </li>
      <li>and this twin pack is nice (one for home, one for travel).</li>
      <li>I find the twin pack the most cost effective.  </li>
      <li>But perhaps make sure that it can be shipped without freezing.</li>
      <li>better</li>
      <li>but it seems to be somewhat better for me.</li>
      <li>I have tried many over- the-counter ointments and NONE of them work as well as this one does.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Muro 128 for many years for my eye condition.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by my eye doctor, one tube costs more than $20 in the drug store--so getting two for this price is a bargain.</li>
      <li>By purchasing it online via Amazon, I am able to purchase it at almost 1/2 price.</li>
      <li>I think between the night goggles and Muro 128, I will be able to get through a night.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>For any person needing this for chronic eye problems, you can&#x27;t find a better price.</li>
      <li>when I opened my eyes in the morning because this outer layer was sticking to the inside of my eyelid better than it was to my eye.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, it&#x27;s eventually better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>After much blinking and a minute or so, the sensation fades away and then I&#x27;m good all night.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s (dealer) prices are much, much more attractive than the local drugstore.</li>
      <li>A great moisterizer for the eyelashes that is actually made to get in your eyes.</li>
      <li>This seller offered a better price than some stores, and it arrived fast.</li>
      <li>motivated me to try the Akorn version which performed adequately.</li>
      <li>Apparently anyone can sell on Amazon, but not everyone on Amazon is an upstanding honest merchant/seller.</li>
      <li>The pain and tearing was intense, and I was basically out of commission until it healed - anywhere from an hour (epithelial cells heal very quickly) to a week.  </li>
      <li>During the time when I was using this ointment her disease seemed to progress and we experienced 2 ulcers within a few months.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for your having this available for purchase.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m simply not prepared to face that kind of pain for something that may not work.</li>
      <li>Use it right before bed because the ointment coats your eye, decreasing the clarity for a while.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend using it right before you put your contact lenses in--too oily for the lenses.  </li>
      <li>The quality is always consistent.</li>
      <li>Better than generic.  </li>
      <li>So ask your eye doctor first.  </li>
      <li>This is so much better than the generic stuff which burned my eyes.</li>
      <li>It does a great job of soothing the severe dry eye issues, and I will definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>I have a serious eye condition this product is great for use at night.  </li>
      <li>Several times a month I would wake up with intense stinging pain because the top layer of epithelial cells on my corneas would stick to my eyelids and lierally</li>
      <li>but since it comes in such a very smal tube, I am thankful that I am able to purchase a twin pack.</li>
      <li>This product really works great for Dry Eye Syndrome, I have used it for several years and would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It certainly does the trick.</li>
      <li>A bit more costly than VIsine and other cheaper products</li>
      <li>The doctor highly recommended this product to keep his eye lubricated.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen him since, and he said that the epithelium is lying much more smoothly than before, but it&#x27;s not entirely better, so I will probably have to continue to use the ointment for as long as I live.</li>
      <li>When I used the first new tube, within seconds, it felt gritty in my eyes.  </li>
      <li>The first night I used it, I only got up once to reapply.  </li>
      <li>rip off, exposing the sensitive nerves underneath.  </li>
      <li>I opened three new tubes and found the same with each.  </li>
      <li>It really helps with my dry eyes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had dry eyes for a long time, and I apparently \\&quot;loosened\\&quot; up the outermost layer (the epithelium) of my right cornea as a result of getting a palm frond in it 30 years ago.</li>
      <li>I bought a new tube from my local drug store - same experience.  </li>
      <li>consistency of the ointment is just right - not too heavy.</li>
      <li>it is tremendously epxensive (usually $23-$28 for one 0.25-oz. tube).  </li>
      <li>For a real review of this product, see my other reviews of Muro 128 and the generic sodium chloride 5% eye ointment.  </li>
      <li>It is very difficult to find a good price on in this area.</li>
      <li>and I noticed an immediate difference between an old tube (probably purchased 6-12 months previously) and the new tube.  </li>
      <li>The other two said \\&quot;anterior basement dystrophy\\&quot; and \\&quot;Map-Dot-Fingerprint dystrophy,\\&quot; which are apparently the older and newer names for the same condition.</li>
      <li>I still have dry eyes, but this product protects those sensitive cells while I am sleeping.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This ointment was prescribed by my opthamologist.  I have DES and Cogan&#x27;s Dystrophy so if I don&#x27;t use this ointment at night, I wake up with my eyelids stuck to my eyeballs and I tear my cornea.  I have tried many over- the-counter ointments and NONE of them work as well as this one does.  I have been using it for over a year.</li>
    <li> This ointment was prescribed for our dog by her Vet for her degenerative Corneal endothelial dystrophy.  We go through a lot of this ointment and I found another brand cheaper on the internet, supposedly the same sodium-chloride 5% solution.  During the time when I was using this ointment her disease seemed to progress and we experienced 2 ulcers within a few months.  After doing some research, I found others who had the same results.  After switching back to Muro the eyes have stabalized again and her ulcers have cleared.  If this is prescribed, do not be fooled, all brands are not the same.  I will never buy anything else but this Muro brand again.</li>
    <li> A great moisterizer for the eyelashes that is actually made to get in your eyes. I&#x27;ll try to never run out.</li>
    <li> I have recurrent corneal erosion.    This product helps though pricey.    The Muro 128 ointment does not sting my eyes the way the generic does or the way that the drops do.</li>
    <li> I have had severe dry eyes for several years now.  I&#x27;ve been using Retasis during the day and OTC ointments at night.  Well, lately, I&#x27;ve been getting up several times a time to reapply ointment.  My eyes get so dry they stick, are painful and feel like sandpaper scraping over wood.  I read reviews on this for dry eye therapy and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  The first night I used it, I only got up once to reapply.  The second night, I never had to reapply.  I can see a definite improvement.  I ordered some goggles used for dry eye therapy and I haven&#x27;t received those yet, so I think between the night goggles and Muro 128, I will be able to get through a night.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> and this twin pack is nice (one for home, one for travel). Sometime I feel like I like the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; better but I always end up returning to Muro. Is it just in my head? Don&#x27;t know but it seems to be somewhat better for me.</li>
    <li> Muro 128 is a very good product.  I use it every night when I take out my contact lenses.  It really helps with my dry eyes.  I do not recommend using it right before you put your contact lenses in--too oily for the lenses.  I find the twin pack the most cost effective.  Even my eye doctor recommends it.  My aunt who had cornea transplants turned me on to Muro 128.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the generic stuff which burned my eyes. Bought this twin pack as it&#x27;s a great price and have used the Muro 128 previously but this twin pack (both tubes) feels like I have shards of glass in my eyes after application. I apply it and as soon as I close my eyelid, I feel pain. After much blinking and a minute or so, the sensation fades away and then I&#x27;m good all night. I visited my ophthalmologist today and he said it sounded as though the product may not have been in a stable shipping environment and perhaps the sodium chloride crystallized and that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;glass shard&amp;#34; feeling I&#x27;m experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s eventually better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so I&#x27;ll order again. But perhaps make sure that it can be shipped without freezing.</li>
    <li> A bit more costly than VIsine and other cheaper products but this stuff actually works and Amazon&#x27;s (dealer) prices are much, much more attractive than the local drugstore.</li>
    <li> My son has a serious eye condition.  The doctor highly recommended this product to keep his eye lubricated.  It certainly does the trick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. The quality is always consistent. This seller offered a better price than some stores, and it arrived fast. Expiration date was 2 years away. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> For my corneal mapdot fingerprint dystrophy, adding Muro128 to my Restasis routine was the difference between blurry vision and almost perfect vision.  When I stopped using it, the blur (couldn&#x27;t even drive) returned. It cleared again after using it for four nights and every night thereafter.  Use it right before bed because the ointment coats your eye, decreasing the clarity for a while.</li>
    <li> I was actually shocked to see the price of Muro 128 ointment come down.  I bought it cheaper than the generic ointment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product that works for my severely dry eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I put it in before bed and it lasts thru the night.</li>
    <li> My dog&#x27;s veteranian told us to only use the B&amp;L name brand.  I tried generic (cheaper) brand and it felt gritty.  My dog stands there and lets me put in his eyes  without compaint and then goes to the cookie box.  Recommend seller as the price for this product varies a lot between sellers.</li>
    <li> I hate spending so much for what is essentially buffered salt (though buying it here in a two-pack saves a lot over drug store prices, when they even have it in stock), but I probably will be doing so for the rest of my life. I&#x27;ve had dry eyes for a long time, and I apparently \\&quot;loosened\\&quot; up the outermost layer (the epithelium) of my right cornea as a result of getting a palm frond in it 30 years ago. At least that&#x27;s how the third ophthalmologist diagnosed the source of my problem. The other two said \\&quot;anterior basement dystrophy\\&quot; and \\&quot;Map-Dot-Fingerprint dystrophy,\\&quot; which are apparently the older and newer names for the same condition. Whatever the cause, the result was that about five years ago I started getting \\&quot;epithelial erosions\\&quot; (i.e., tears) when I opened my eyes in the morning because this outer layer was sticking to the inside of my eyelid better than it was to my eye. That exposes the nerves underneath, and there must be one heck of a lot of them because the pain was unbearable. My doctor recommended that I start putting Mura 128 in my eye just before going to sleep every night, and the problem has not recurred. I&#x27;ve seen him since, and he said that the epithelium is lying much more smoothly than before, but it&#x27;s not entirely better, so I will probably have to continue to use the ointment for as long as I live. I&#x27;ll take that because the only treatment for the condition, regardless of its source, is to burn of the entire epithelium with a laser and hope that it grows back without the problem. I&#x27;m simply not prepared to face that kind of pain for something that may not work.</li>
    <li> i use for dry eyes at night and it works well. consistency of the ointment is just right - not too heavy.</li>
    <li> My dog needs this for her eyes and this is the best product!  Have tried generic products and they seem to be &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but the Muro 128 is easier to apply and my dog&#x27;s eyes don&#x27;t seem to get irritated as they did with the generic product.</li>
    <li> This ointment is rerquired as per my physcian.  It does what I need done but since it comes in such a very smal tube, I am thankful that I am able to purchase a twin pack. from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My ophthalmologist recommended that I use this nightly for dry eyes.  It is very expensive at the drugstore. You get two here for much less than the store.</li>
    <li> For any person needing this for chronic eye problems, you can&#x27;t find a better price. Almost half what we pay in our local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> This product really works great for Dry Eye Syndrome, I have used it for several years and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the standard for relieving morning Fuch&#x27;s fuzziness. No reason to try anything else. It will work for you or none of them will.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it&#x27;s the only ointment that soothes my eyes at night.  The best part was getting 2 for the price of one!</li>
    <li> I have been using Muro 128 for many years for my eye condition.  I have never had a problem until the last batch I bought in Oct 2013.  When I used the first new tube, within seconds, it felt gritty in my eyes.  I buy Muro 128 in bulk and I noticed an immediate difference between an old tube (probably purchased 6-12 months previously) and the new tube.  I opened three new tubes and found the same with each.  I bought a new tube from my local drug store - same experience.  I do not fault the Amazon distributor as I had the same experience with Muro 128 from two different sources.  I checked the expiration dates - all boxes 02/16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This motivated me to try the Akorn version which performed adequately.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my eye doctor, one tube costs more than $20 in the drug store--so getting two for this price is a bargain.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my Ophthalmologist, so I bought it here for half the price of local stores! It does a great job of soothing the severe dry eye issues, and I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Thanks for your having this available for purchase. It is very difficult to find a good price on in this area.</li>
    <li> Bausch &amp; Lomb Muro 138 opthalmic ointment is great.  Better than generic.  But this is an eye medicine recommended by an opthalmologist.  So ask your eye doctor first.  WARNING- I ordered, paid for, and was invoiced for the Twin Pack of the Muro 128- 5% ointment.  I was sent a single tube.  Hopefully the merchant will respond to my calls and emails and remedy the situation.  I will update this review in a week and let you know what happens.  For a real review of this product, see my other reviews of Muro 128 and the generic sodium chloride 5% eye ointment.  4/16/13.  5/28 merchant has not remedied the situation.  But accused me of lying.  I have now LOST money  the transaction with OTCRx4U merchant/seller. DO NOT use them!  Some good reliable merchants from whom I have purchased this product are Mr.Medical, Pharmpak.  Customers....please read those seller reviews and heed them. And likewise please always rate your help experiences with sellers.  Apparently anyone can sell on Amazon, but not everyone on Amazon is an upstanding honest merchant/seller.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with extremely dry eyes for years, especially at night while sleeping.  Several times a month I would wake up with intense stinging pain because the top layer of epithelial cells on my corneas would stick to my eyelids and lierally rip off, exposing the sensitive nerves underneath.  The pain and tearing was intense, and I was basically out of commission until it healed - anywhere from an hour (epithelial cells heal very quickly) to a week.  Since I started using this product, I do not have this problem any longer.  I still have dry eyes, but this product protects those sensitive cells while I am sleeping.  I use it religiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is...it is tremendously epxensive (usually $23-$28 for one 0.25-oz. tube).  By purchasing it online via Amazon, I am able to purchase it at almost 1/2 price.</li>
    <li> I have a serious eye condition this product is great for use at night.  It does not sting like the drops.</li>
    <li> Expensive but it helps my eyes</li>
