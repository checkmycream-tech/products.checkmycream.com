      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I feel like I would be better off just using water.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use many eye makeup removers because they irritate my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Then keep it somewhere safe.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff -- Have issues with dermatitis on my eyelids, and this never irritates or bothers it.</li>
      <li>Oh those commercials with the beautiful white roses, and the dyes and perfumes they throw on them, so convincing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great on my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes either.</li>
      <li>My wife is very happy with this, all natural, gentle make-up remover.  </li>
      <li>yet I have to SCRUB to get my eyes clean</li>
      <li>Also it does a CLEAN job of cleaning my make-up off.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more natural product, but this just didn&#x27;t do a good job of taking off mascara (regular, not even waterproof mascara!)</li>
      <li>The Simple product causes no irritation, is effective and inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>I only wish more retailers carried it.</li>
      <li>I first found this makeup remover at Target, but had to look for it elsewhere when they stopped carrying it in the store.</li>
      <li>Simple, clean, gentle and gets the job done!  </li>
      <li>Really wanted to like this</li>
      <li>Works very well and leaves no residue.  </li>
      <li>Trick is to dampen a cotton pad with the product, then hold it to your eye for 20-30 seconds before wiping gently...</li>
      <li>It does not remove your eye makeup gently.</li>
      <li>Follow with simple rich moisturiser and eye cream every night and my skin&#x27;s hydrated but can still breathe and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>Does waterproof too, but takes a little more effort.  </li>
      <li>This did a good job of removing my hard to remove mascara and eyeliner but my eyelids got very irritated and my eyes are burning as though I had actual soap in them.</li>
      <li>I tried many make up removers before ( cheap and more expensive ones)  and its hard to find one that really works.</li>
      <li>Note that I have very sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>That was always the biggest thing about any other thing I used to clean off my eye make-up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my sister is using it secretly because it&#x27;s almost gone.</li>
      <li>My favorite remover and its hard to find in the stores.</li>
      <li>so sensitive you use nothing but baby wash</li>
      <li>i went over my eye makeup (which is not heavy)</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin so finding a makeup remover that does not irritate my skin but does take off the makeup is a daunting task.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend to those with sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my skin raw like other eye makeup removers - super quick removal with a cotton ball!</li>
      <li>It works easily without tugging or damaging the delicate eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

<li> This one is so clean feeling and leaves nothing like that behind!</li>
<li> (I know I can&#x27;t be the only one who does this), so you think, why not and who cares if it&#x27;s a little pricey?</li>

<li> I use nothing but mineral makeup (so not even heavy duty waterproof stuff or anything)</li>
<li> I felt like I had to rub too hard to get the makeup off.</li>
<li> This product was such a disappointment.</li>
<li> My skin is raw and my eyes are irritated by the time I&#x27;m done and it still leaves some behind.</li>
<li> usually go for the oily eye-make-up remover (actually I often use coconut oil or Lacome&#x27;s product) because it does not irritate my eyes and even then some will still irritate my eyes badly.</li>
<li> if I use this product, and it still leaves makeup behind.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but this burns my eyes really badly, plus does a terrible job of removing (non waterproof) makeup.</li>
<li> I have tried several makeup removers over the years and would get so frustrated because it seemed impossible to find one that didn&#x27;t leave behind a nasty, oily feeling on my skin.</li>

    <li> Simple, clean, gentle and gets the job done!  Does waterproof too, but takes a little more effort.  Trick is to dampen a cotton pad with the product, then hold it to your eye for 20-30 seconds before wiping gently...this gets the eye makeup off much more effectively - and easier on the eyelashes and skin around your eyes.</li>
    <li> Note that I have very sensitive eyes and this may not apply to everyone:&lt;br /&gt;I usually go for the oily eye-make-up remover (actually I often use coconut oil or Lacome&#x27;s product) because it does not irritate my eyes and even then some will still irritate my eyes badly. This did a good job of removing my hard to remove mascara and eyeliner but my eyelids got very irritated and my eyes are burning as though I had actual soap in them. I had to thoroughly rinse my eyes. I don&#x27;t recommend to those with sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product at all. It does not remove your eye makeup gently. My skin is raw and my eyes are irritated by the time I&#x27;m done and it still leaves some behind. I would not recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works easily without tugging or damaging the delicate eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Also, its oil free!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff -- Have issues with dermatitis on my eyelids, and this never irritates or bothers it.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with this, all natural, gentle make-up remover.  I will be ordering again, a great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but this burns my eyes really badly, plus does a terrible job of removing (non waterproof) makeup. Just skip this one.</li>
    <li> This product was such a disappointment. It was like using water. i went over my eye makeup (which is not heavy) several times with this and then just gave up and used something else.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work that well.  I have to use soap and water afterwards to remove the rest of the eye makeup that this wouldn&#x27;t take off.</li>
    <li> Oh those commercials with the beautiful white roses, and the dyes and perfumes they throw on them, so convincing! And you have skin so sensitive you use nothing but baby wash (I know I can&#x27;t be the only one who does this), so you think, why not and who cares if it&#x27;s a little pricey? But then you buy the product and it doesn&#x27;t work! I use nothing but mineral makeup (so not even heavy duty waterproof stuff or anything) yet I have to SCRUB to get my eyes clean if I use this product, and it still leaves makeup behind. I feel like I would be better off just using water.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to like this but it doesn&#x27;t remove waterproof make up or eye liner and burned my eyes.</li>
    <li> My favorite remover and its hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> Works very well and leaves no residue.  One of the best ones I have ever found.  The price on Amazon is also the best I could find.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this eye makeup remover. I was looking for a more natural product, but this just didn&#x27;t do a good job of taking off mascara (regular, not even waterproof mascara!) I felt like I had to rub too hard to get the makeup off. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>

    <li> Takes off even waterproof make up in one wipe, without stinging my eyes or leaving any residue. Follow with simple rich moisturiser and eye cream every night and my skin&#x27;s hydrated but can still breathe and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
    <li> Its a good product. I tried many make up removers before ( cheap and more expensive ones)  and its hard to find one that really works. I liked this one thats qhy is my second time buying it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes AT ALL!!! That was always the biggest thing about any other thing I used to clean off my eye make-up. Also it does a CLEAN job of cleaning my make-up off. It doesn&#x27;t smear all over my face before I just scrape it off with a rough wash rag. love it. I&#x27;m pretty sure my sister is using it secretly because it&#x27;s almost gone. I&#x27;m just gonna order another bottle when it is. Then keep it somewhere safe.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Doesn&#x27;t make my skin raw like other eye makeup removers - super quick removal with a cotton ball!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so finding a makeup remover that does not irritate my skin but does take off the makeup is a daunting task. Thankfully this does both! Very satisfied with this product and intend to buy it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I can&#x27;t use many eye makeup removers because they irritate my eyes.  The Simple product causes no irritation, is effective and inexpensive.  Highly recommended.  I only wish more retailers carried it.</li>
