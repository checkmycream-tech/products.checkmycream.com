<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to buy it - but that&#x27;s on my for buying a razor that uses the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the subscribe and save feature - before this, I always had to make a trip to Wal-mart to get more solution, and then often found it was out of stock, or it was not a convenient time to go to the store. No longer. I now get a refill before I run out.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find this product in stores, and it&#x27;s always out of stock online everywhere else.  Added it to my order and got free shipping--can&#x27;t beat that.  My husband likes his shaver, and the jet clean solution helps maintain it--win-win.</li>
    <li> Cannot buy this one in the stores anymore.I travel a lot and have looked for this in other states and it seems they don&#x27;t have this in the stores anymore.I still have the razor to be clean.I was really happy to see I could buy this from you.I do shop on this site only and can find everything I always needed.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You&lt;br /&gt;  Loret</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found any alternatives to this product, but it works really well at cleaning my shaver.  Subscribe and save makes it a better deal.</li>
    <li> This is really a nice shaver that this cleaner is used on!</li>
    <li> Even though the &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; cleaning of the Norelco is easy, it is very comfortable just to leaving cleaning for itself in the JetClean System with the Clean Solution</li>
    <li> It works well with the system, wish there was a cheaper alternative that lasts longer than noted here.  I also wish they had an unscented version.</li>
    <li> it works for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;on my old razor i used the aerosal spray oil cleaner but now with the Philips Norelco 1250X/47 i use this.&lt;br /&gt;i rinse the razor first with water then if i can let it dry then run the cleaner/charger every few days.</li>
    <li> The solution keeps my razor running smoothly and clean</li>
    <li> It works great and seems to even sharpen my razor. It cleans my razor very well.I think it is expensive.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Does what have to do.</li>
    <li> Cleans shaver pretty well. Only issue is that it evaporates after a couple of cycles.</li>
    <li> works ok.  wish they sold bigger bottles, and was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like having a fresh, clean razor ready to use each day. This item lets me have just that, without doing it myself. I have a monthly subscription for this product, and it arrives like clockwork.</li>
    <li> Product helps as I have a self cleaning razor and every store around me stopped carrying the solution.  I bought like 5 of them</li>
    <li> It is too bad that the Philips razor needs a cleaning solution but this product works okay.  I still have to rinse out my shaver with water after I do the intensive cleaning. Pretty pricey but I suppose it also kills germs and lubricates the razor heads so this is required.</li>
    <li> This item is 2x as much in the store. Comes on a regular basis without hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Always packed well and on time.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> As usual, the service was terrific. Moreover, this stuff works. My shaves had become marginal. So, I decided to give the lubricating cleaner a try. Even though I first rinsed the shaving head with water, when soaked overnight in this fluid, much more cutting precipitated and the razor appeared to afford the close shave I had purchased it to provide. I&#x27;m now cleaning with it once a month.</li>
    <li> Terrible used once and threw out</li>
    <li> This cleaning solution smells really good and does an excellent job cleaning my shaver. I wish they would make larger bottles so I wouldn&#x27;t have to purchase these so often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Jet Clean on my Norelcos for years, and this is a good product. I&#x27;ve used it with the automatic Norelco cleaners and just soaking the heads in it. Judging from the tiny hairs and gunk that is at the bottom of the catch basins, the Solution is doing a good job...also the blade seem to stay sharp longer. Aloha, Rudy</li>
    <li> Your service has improved over the last decade.  I can depend on Amazon to treat me right.  Thankful for this occasion to keep in touch. TA</li>
    <li> Overpriced and does not seem to do more than water. I cleaned my shaver with water out of the faucet and through their cleaning station with this solution in it and I could not see or feel any difference. To me, this solution is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in the store where I had purchased it before. It is recommended by Phillips Norelco to clean my razor and does a good job. The online prince could be better.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, smells nice and clean and does the trick!  In fact I just recently ordered a six pack of this product and I have been very happy with the results.  I always take very good care of my Senso Touch 3D Shaver cleaning the 3 heads thoroughly with hot water after each shave.  Despite my thorough hot water cleaning and after replacing the solution for the first time, I was surprised at the amount of fine debris sitting on the bottom of the cleaning unit canister.  This size 10oz. bottle should adequately fill your Senso Touch 3D cleaner twice.  One last note:  It could be mostly my imagination... but it seems and feels like the shaving heads are a bit sharper after cleaning as opposed to just rinsing thoroughly with hot water.  I do change out the solution every 3 - 4 wks; that time frame is a personal preference thing that I find is fine for me.  I also believe it&#x27;s not necessary to use the cleaning unit/solution after every shave unless you prefer to do so.  This product works very well and I like the clean smell before shaving.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Works quite well on my electric razor, I was quite surprised that it cleaned so well.</li>
    <li> I use it to clean my razor when I charge it. It does keep the blades sharp. I don&#x27;t clean it every shave only when it needs charging, which seems to be okay and it makes the solution last longer.</li>
    <li> I bought the Philips shaver locally and it came with the charger/cleaner base unit. After I ran out of cleaner, I&#x27;m unable to find it in the usual &#x27;big box&#x27; stores, grocery stores or drugstores in my area. Glad that it&#x27;s available here at a good price.</li>
    <li> I use the Jet Clean system as it came as part of the package. It is possible to clean razor without this system but is more trouble. The jet clean system makes it quite easy.</li>
    <li> Not a bad price and arrived on time. Will buy again as needed. Does have a expire date on the bottle, I have plenty of time with the amount that I bought.</li>
    <li> Made my Norelco Shaver seem like brand new</li>
    <li> I know some people say that you don’t need to clean your razor with this stuff, but I think you do. I run my razor under hot water and fully rinse it after every use. When it is time to charge the razor i charge it in the cleaning base and normally run it though twice. For anyone who says this doesn’t do anything more than hot water, I beg you to look in the bottom of the cleaner. There is a good amount of hair and skin cells in the bottom after one cleaning. So it definitely does something. It also lubricates the blades. I notice after cleaning that it glides on my skin easier as well as runs a little more quietly. Overall if you have the cleaning base for your razor, why not use it. this stuff isn’t very expensive and it seems to be worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband is legally blind and he can use this product without assistance.  It does a good job of cleaning his razor.  Was having problems finding this product locally-always out.  Thank you for your prompt service.</li>
    <li> there was not enough description of the product before purchase, I did not know a solution holder was required. probably will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Solution smells pleasant and works well with the Philips Norelco Shaver 6600. Blades come out clean.</li>
    <li> Great price. Oem solution not an imitation. No problems using it. Will order again as this was my second order.</li>
    <li> This item was bought for my father who uses it with his Norelco shaver.  He insists on only this product to clean his shaver, he has used other brands and he feels this one cleans and lubricates the best.</li>
    <li> The Philips cleaning solution is a must have thing for my razor. It&#x27;s got a great smell, but most importantly makes my razor sanitary and much much more efficient. If my Norelco 3D hasn&#x27;t been cleaned in a few days, it starts slowing down and taking forever to shave my face. It takes me 3-4 passes over the same area to get all the hair cut and I&#x27;ll start to get ingrown hairs,  but after a quick clean in the auto cleaner with this solution, the razor feels and cuts like it was brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a Philips Norelco razor that uses this stuff... BUY IT!  Water does not do the job in keeping the razor sanitary and at it&#x27;s prime like this solution (trust me I&#x27;ve tried cheapening out by doing that).</li>
    <li> Amazing how it cleaned!</li>
    <li> A long time fan of Braun razors, I&#x27;ve been using them for 35 years. When Braun introduced the first automatic cleaning system I grabbed one right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any doubts I had about their \\&quot;Clean and Renew\\&quot; system were soon put to rest and the cost of the cleaning cartridges soon became insignificant in comparison to how well my blades and razor head were kept sharp, perfectly clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having switched to the Norelco Sensotouch 3D - I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Norelco Clean an Charge station. It&#x27;s a sensational piece of ingenuity and the kid in me never tires of watching it raise, lowed and tilt the razor into the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after most every shave and it&#x27;s like waking up to a new razor every day. It&#x27;s a bit soapy compared to the Braun which is alcohol based and strips the blades of any residue while lubricating them at the same time. If a soapy residue does build up, especially with constant use a quick swish under hot water should remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does a good a job and compared to the cost of the Braun cartridges it&#x27;s a bargain. I&#x27;ve used up the bottle that came with the razor and ordered a couple of refills of the same solution and one of the \\&quot;Cool Breeze\\&quot; They both work equally well but to my nose there&#x27;s absolutely no difference in scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that this matters, it&#x27;s not cologne but why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Cool Breeze\\&quot; is beyond me. As for results, the solution is very effective the blades and foil come out gleaming and exceptionally clean - which means longer blade life and having to replace the head less frequently - or so I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning solution is hard to find in stores - even those that carry my razor don&#x27;t stock it. It&#x27;s a huge Plus that Amazon has carries this cleaning solution and at a discounted price to boot. Plus, with a Prime membership you get free two day shipping, making it even more affordable to stock up.</li>
    <li> This work greats with my husband&#x27;s razor.  The solution helped keep the razor very clean. Price was reasonable for this item.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use my razor without</li>
    <li> The Jet Clean Solution is a must if you purchase the high end Norelco razor.  Using the solution ensures the razor heads are cleaned and lubricated.  Sometimes it is difficult to find in the stores &#x3D;&#x3D; even the stores that sell the Norelco razor that uses the solution, so I was delighted to be able to purchase this online.  Packaging was perfect and delivery quicker than expected!</li>
    <li> This product is the only thing that works in his shaver cleaning unit.  It can be hard to find sometimes.</li>
    <li> I have used it now for one year and it still gives me a close shave.  I use it every day with gel shaving cream.  At 78 I have uses many kinds of razors and this one is the BEST.</li>
    <li> I have had my Norelco shaver for several years now and it still works like new, thanks to the Jet Clean solution system!</li>
    <li> Great product - new design bottle - new fragrance - same excellent cleaning properties.  For some reason, I cannot find this solution in any of the big box stores in my area so I had to order it online - the downside is Amazon wanted a minimum quantity or for me to sign up for a subscription service so I just bought 6 bottles - enough to last me at least 6 months.</li>
    <li> He loves the shaver, so he has to love this solution...cause this is the only product working with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Good price. Easy transaction.</li>
    <li> Authentic jet clean solution. Bout all one can ask for.</li>
    <li> Product works very good in the Norelco cleaner and is a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I ordered my new [[ASIN:B006W2SYGM Philips Norelco 1280X/47 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor  with Jet Clean System]]. I&#x27;m not impressed with the cleaning ability of the of the Jet Clean System. I know that the problem might not be with the cleaning solution, so I&#x27;m giving it three stars just to be kind. I don&#x27;t know why Norelco felt obliged to create this stuff with such a strong scent, but I think it was not a smart decision. Quite frankly, I think I get cleaner results (and certainly quicker) by just opening up the heads and running them under hot water for a few seconds. I&#x27;ll probably use the cleaning solution until it runs out and then only use the cleaning tray as a charger for my razor.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I never realized how much was left in the head after I rinsed it. It really cleaned the head and lubricated it. I&#x27;m sure it will make the blades last longer.</li>
    <li> What can I say- it keeps the razor clean, which helps reduce my razor burn and breakouts after shaving. It also seems to help extend the life of the razor heads. Shiny.</li>
    <li> Works as advertized. No complaints from me. Love not having to also lubricate my razor after rinsing because I love to wet shave with cream. Just press my auto clean station and leave for work. Win!</li>
    <li> The razor indicates when cleaning is needed and this works great with the cleaning system that came with the Norelco razor. Same solution that comes with razor.</li>
    <li> This stuff cleans my razor head very well,  it&#x27;s like shaving with new blades every time. So I am happy!</li>
    <li> Due to a problem with the shipping address ( which was my error ), I did have some confusion created in trying to rectify the situation, mainly due to my inexperience with the computer. I finally did receive the product and am very satisfied with how the problem was handled at your end. I will definitely use your services in the future.</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend</li>
    <li> This is not a good deal on amazon.  I would recommend buying it directly from the manufacturer website $5 dollars with free shipping.  At least for where I live.  It definitely makes the shave smoother and less razor burn when using this on my shaver. I can notice a big difference when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my razor clean! I wish they bottles were larger and the solution cheaper though.</li>
    <li> This solution is the original jet clean solution and works very well with the Philips jet cleaner. I love it and recommend it to the other customers.</li>
    <li> What more can I say....  It cleans the shaver great and will extend the life if your blades....  I&#x27;d suggest subscribe and save on this product since it&#x27;s almost impossible to find in local walmart or targets and the price on Amazon is much better.</li>
    <li> My father electric razor uses this cleaning solution.  We could not find it in our area.  I order more than one, so we would not have to look for it again in the near future.</li>
    <li> If you have one of the pedestals that does cleaning/charging, this is a necessary component. Evaporates very slowly due to the integral cover. Reduces your facial trimmings to a sludge at the bottom of the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (even amended water) will be insufficient as a solution. Also, water has a higher surface tension and won&#x27;t dry as well off of the heads.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find in your average retail store.  If you do find it, it&#x27;s 2x the price.  You have to change the fluid every two weeks.  This size bottle last for about 4 changes.  You also can set up recurring orders.</li>
    <li> Nice to find this cleaner again. Used to be able to purchase easily at Target, WalMart and BBB but no longer. Very useful in maintaining lubrication and easy to use cleaning station for your Norelco razor. Amazon is great to find those hard to purchase items.</li>
    <li> The clean just solutions works well.</li>
    <li> Works great for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco products since I started shaving. This cleaner lives up to the Norelco name. Blades last longer, stay sharper wjhen they are clean.</li>
    <li> For some reason the cleaning solution is becoming hard to find in department stores, so buying it on Amazon is the best alternative.  This solution helps keep your electric shaver blades in peak condition.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t use it yet, So I do not have a qualified review.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry about that.  After I use it Maybe</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and has a good smell while doing it.  It&#x27;s not very expensive, and can be setup for subscribe &amp; save.  Set it and forget.</li>
    <li> nothing to say about this product other than it is fulfilled by Amazon and they deliver fast and flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I ordered four of these about 3 months ago. I kept waiting to get them and then finally filed a failure to deliver notice to AMZN. I have heard nothing from either the vendor or AMZN. Look, in my mind - if you don&#x27;t have the inventory, at least tell me so I can order it somewhere else. That does not seem to be the vendor&#x27;s or AMZN&#x27;s belief. Very disappointing from the AMZN point of view. They have dropped at least a point in my rating of customer satisfaction. It&#x27;s made me look at lot more often at other places to shop on the net. But AMZN really doesn&#x27;t care. They are volume first and then customer satisfaction is way down at the bottom. But they often end up having the lowest prices on the net. One problem with AMZN purchases is that unlike COSTCO that vets their products so you are sure of buying quality, AMZN carries a lot of junk. Never buy a product from AMZN without first reading all the 1 star comments. You frequently find very similar complaints which usually means that AMZN is selling inferior products even tough they pop up in the top three listings.</li>
    <li> The solution really works well and does a great job of freshening the blades. I will certainly be coming back to Amazon the next time around. See you in 6 months.</li>
    <li> I only purchased this because it was listed as something also purchased with the RQ12 Replacement Head, which my Norelco uses.  After it arrived the Norelco directions for use were very poor so I went to the Norelco web-page only to learn it wasn&#x27;t meant for use with the RQ12 Replacement Head.</li>
    <li> Keeps my razor clean for smooth shaves.  Good stuff.  Good price for an item that I can never find in town at any store.</li>
    <li> Works in the Norelco Jet Clean System and does an excellent job cleaning and lubricating the shaver head.  Works much better than water and should work on most Norelco Heads in a separate container.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS AN ACCESSORY FOR MY CHRISTMAS GIFT...LOVE MY CHRISTMAS GIFT...RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!! NEVER HAD A CLOSER SHAVE...</li>
    <li> I love the Jet Clean Solution as it keep my shaving blades clean. I would recommend this to anyone with a Norelco Shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent to clean my shaving machine after used it many times. When I clean the machine it looks like new.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and cleans the shaver better than I could. Definitely plan on buying this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> I would suggest this if you planned to use an electric razor, it&#x27;s really hard to clean it without it.</li>
    <li> I LIKE having a stockpile of solution. Seems to be working fine so far, no problems or odd smells. Foo.</li>
    <li> i guess this product is good but really cant tell the diff from when i rinsed my shaver with hot water and this solution....but im doing as the instructions tell me to do</li>
    <li> Pleased with the performance of this product-but more pleased I could find it as stores are trending to not carrying it.</li>
    <li> Best price I have ever found, bveen using this solution for many years, will definitely be back! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad, he said it was exactly what he was looking for.</li>
    <li> It works but it should have an option to come up to every 6 months as I do not shave that much so most of it goes to waste or evaporates.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. TRIMMERS ARE OUTSTANDING. FOIL HEADS NOT QUITE CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME BUT NOT BAD. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> got this for my AA battery Philips that has not been washed with any solvent other than water because it doesn&#x27;t has a washing dock. This has washed off many debris and lubricant too.</li>
    <li> I used the Jet Clean Solution with my Philips Norelco 1280X rotary shaver automatic jet cleaning system.  Has a pleasant citrus-y smell and cleans effectively, leaving the shaving heads clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a must to have a clean razor head and this solution solves that problem. The razor head is a breeding ground for bacteria so why not clean than right to avoid any possibility of infection.</li>
    <li> it helps keep my razor clean when i get done shaving i just put my shaver on it cleaning base and push the button and it cleans the blades</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as promised. Has a wonderful clean smell and a very efficient new rectangular shaped bottle that is much easier to store. This product is extremely difficult to find in any store and I&#x27;ve seen it priced from 4.28 to 19.99 on various websites for the  exact same product. The individual unit price was less expensive than buying in bulk.</li>
    <li> works well , cleans ny shaver</li>
    <li> good Jet clean solution. The reason for the 3 stars are the price, you can find cheaper product on amazon or online for a cleaner solution that will do exactly the same thing. and plus it will be natural compare to the Philips solution.</li>
    <li> Cleans well but I can&#x27;t use it because it is scented and it bothers my sinus allergies. I would buy again if they made an unscented version.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner but it&#x27;s on the Norelco Website at $4.99, Not $10.</li>
    <li> REGULAR cleaning leads to a better shave and the self cleaning fluid does a great job for the Norelco shaving system</li>
    <li> Cleans the shaving head great!</li>
    <li> Smooth shave and easy to handle. I like very much the jet cleaning system. Light weight makes it easy to move around.</li>
    <li> My shaver did not come with a cleaning system so I wasted my money and it is not worth returning</li>
    <li> I gave a Philips Norelco to my boyfriend and this solution.  He loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this razor and solution.</li>
    <li> I use it with my razor to clean it as required.  I can&#x27;t get out and shop easily so it was nice to be able to order it.</li>
    <li> It really makes a difference in a short amount of time , the blades are clean and cut smooth like brand new ! and it does that every time i wash it.</li>
    <li> this really is a must, altough i strain mine every couple of weeks with a coffee filter, and fill the try up with a little bit of fresh cleaner solution.</li>
    <li> If anyone has a Norelco rechargeable razor, this is the best cleaning solutions you can buy. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Use this with the razor my wife bought me for my birthday. It works like it should, hey, it&#x27;s cleaning solution, how should it work?</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. good quality no problems.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome</li>
    <li> Delivered as expected. Great product</li>
    <li> cleans but need to use a container that can be messy at times</li>
    <li> You should just buy this solution if you need it.  I use it for cleaning my norelco shaver and it has worked well.</li>
    <li> I bought my husband the Philips Norelco RQ11 SensoTouch Razor for Christmas last year, but I could not find this cleaner anywhere! Thank you for having this item available. It arrived before the estimated date and time and it&#x27;s the actual Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution. I am so glad I finally found it after searching everywhere!</li>
    <li> Works well, keeps razor clean and lubricated, but the bottle only contains enough fluid for a few changeouts. This means it&#x27;s a little more than I would like to spend, but I figure it&#x27;s worth it to maintain my razor. Rinsing with water only wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my old razor clean and it wore out way too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave every day, and alternate between a water rinse and jet clean every other day to prolong the life of the jet clean solution. I also rinse the hairs out before using jet clean, since this seems to also help the solution last longer. This way, one bottle lasts 3-4 months (I think that&#x27;s a change out about every month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Keeps razor clean and smelling fresh&lt;br /&gt; - Keeps razor running smoothly&lt;br /&gt; - Prolongs life of razor&lt;br /&gt; - Prevents gunk from accumulating in the razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Small bottle size/price</li>
    <li> Excellent! as advertised..</li>
    <li> Works well for me.  Hard to find in stores, but I&#x27;ve been buying on-line.</li>
    <li> My husband loved it!  It&#x27;s much more sanitary than any razor I&#x27;ve seen.  Even his skin looks better and cleaner.</li>
    <li> Man was I plesently surprized with this charger. It charges my I Phone 5 in half the time of my wall charger. This is a great little item that was better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, good price.</li>
    <li> Cleans shaver effortlessly and completely. All pros and no cons!! Try it and you will agree. I really can not say anything more.</li>
    <li> When the cleaning solution I had been buying suddenly was unavailable when I needed more, I thought the company may have discontinued it. Indeed, I couldn&#x27;t even find it to buy in their corporate store website. Thanks to a support chat, I was pointed to Amazon as a source for this repackaged version. The bottle is now slimmer and taller (it takes up less shelf space, which I like), but it has a different scent to it. And, the first few weeks of cleaning my razor with this really had a rather nasty smell to it I did not like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that after a month or two, that smell is gone (or I just am not noticing it?). I have read you can also use vinegar for cleaning razors, but I don&#x27;t even want to think what that would smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss the old stuff.</li>
    <li> I have a self cleaning shaver and couldn&#x27;t find this solution anywhere. Packaging was different than the bottle shown, but it was the same product.</li>
    <li> http://www.philips-store.com/store/catalog/shaving-accessories/shaving-cleaners/norelco-jet-clean-solution/productdetail/HQ200_52_US_SHOPPUB/US/en&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just go to philips to buy,and only $5 with FS</li>
    <li> Top-notch shaver. Glad I bought it over cheaper models.</li>
    <li> New bottle, same product - I think it&#x27;s overpriced but what are you going to do? Note that buying the multi-pack is actually quite a bit more expensive than buying the same number individually (or at least this was the case when I ordered).</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like it it is not what i wanted will never buy this product again,i would not recommend this item</li>
    <li> this solution is a great way to clean razor heads. i simply put the blades in some solution and let it sit until completely clean.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well in the razor cleaner. I decided to get it regularly on the subscribe and save</li>
    <li> If you are looking to keep ur blades clean and sharp, then look no further. THIS REALLY WORKS AND WORKS AS STATED.</li>
    <li> Works the same as the more expensive bottle. Very happy this this purchase.</li>
    <li> Saver seems to work more smoothly when I use the solution and cleaning system daily.  Washing the shaver and air drying while traveling is less effective.</li>
    <li> Need this for weeks to clean shaver Without it is not the same have auto one. Only this will work</li>
    <li> Cleans as expected. Always has. Easy to use. I like the new design of bottle too. Will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto y de altísima calidad preserva mucho las hojillas de mi maquina de  afeitar y es duradero seguiré comprando mas a futuro</li>
    <li> my dad had an old shaver and this part broke sure didnt think we could find this part and here it was and a terrific&lt;br /&gt;price and came so quickly</li>
    <li> My husband uses this in his self-cleaning razor. It works great - cleans and lubricates his heads.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> Does the job feels fresh. Arrives fast. I recommend subscribe and save this way you can save on products you need.</li>
    <li> Good cleaning solution.  Razor always feels fresh and clean after using.  However I feel it&#x27;s overpriced for what it is.  I haven&#x27;t been gutsy enough to try a homemade concoction yet.</li>
    <li> Good Head cleaning fluid</li>
    <li> works as advertised, nice scent. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . !</li>
    <li> I anticipate the solution to be as useful as the same that came with the razor when I bough it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, price and response time.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Item was as described</li>
    <li> Great but i like the old scent better.</li>
    <li> Phillips Norelco Jet Clean Solution does what it is suppose to do.  It appears to clean effectively.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Nice scent. Razor always seems to operate better (quiet) after cleaning in solution. As with most razor &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; product is priced on high side.</li>
    <li> Worked very good the few times I used it, grew a beard and no longer need the six bottles I bought.</li>
    <li> Cleans razor well. Has refreshing smell also. My fianc&amp;eacute; loves the smell of this solution. Good product for the money.</li>
    <li> Does what is is supposed to.  Always good to have extra available for my husband to clean his razor when needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this to push my order up to get free shipping on the new razor heads and have used it once.  I would not buy this on its own.  Doesnit help that much.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that I needed this for my shaver but the shaver came with a bottle already.  It will be nice to have but I wouldnt have purchased this as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; if I knew that already.</li>
    <li> Only used once but seems to clean well enough.</li>
    <li> Excellent price vs. local sources and easily avialable rather than looking all over two counties here for something noone carries</li>
    <li> I always get a couple of bottles of this cleaning solution when I travel to the States from Canada&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about half the price</li>
    <li> easiest way to keep my razor clean.</li>
    <li> This product is an update to the original (unscented) version of the cleaning solution. Works great in the clean jet system. Scent isn&#x27;t overpowering or irritating to sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> solution works very well on cleaning my norelco razor. It is easy to use and highly reccommended to keep razor running well for long periods of time. Is inexpensive and a must in my book.</li>
    <li> Good for my Philips razor as it cleans, lubricates and charges the razor as well.  The bottle lasts a good 3 months</li>
    <li> I have owned the Norelco arctec shaver for several years with good service and the Jet Clean solution really seems to help clean and lubricate the heads, and this product refill seems to be like the original solutions I have used before</li>
    <li> This solution works perfectly with my Norelco Jet Clean system and keeps the shaver sparkling clean. It&#x27;s important to note that the sensor contacts in the Jet Clean unit need to be kept clean or else they will develop a coating which will make the unit think that there is not enough solution in the reservoir and will cause the unit to &amp;#34;reject&amp;#34; the cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> I get this, cause i want to clean my razor, and i don&#x27;t know of any alternatives....it is cheap - and when i clean the razor, i see lots of hair crap in the bottom..so i think it works...:-)_</li>
    <li> I have been putting off buying this bit my shaver is much better after a good cleaning which I cannot do with a brush.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, great buy, best price around! Jet clean solution does a wonderful job! Very pleased! Will order this again when needed!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the only fluid to use in your automatic Norelco cleaning device.</li>
    <li> The price is very honest.  This solution cleans the shaver and lubricate it in the same time. Really worth it.</li>
    <li> Very good value and a useful product.Very good value and a useful product.Very good value and a useful product.Very good value and a useful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product ever since I purchased my razor and have found that it keeps it clean and lubricated.  If asked I would reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> As advertised and just what I was looking for. Easy to use and does a good job. Purchase with confidence.</li>
    <li> The cleaning solution keeps my Norelco razor feeling like new.  I still have not needed to buy another bottle with almost daily cleaning unless I forget to hit the button.</li>
    <li> i have to replace the Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution inside of my razors reservoir every month.  this stuff seems to keep it fresh and blades sharp.</li>
    <li> I use this solution because it is supposed to clean and lubricate the head, hopefully giving me increased head life and sharper blades. The Jet Clean cleaning station came with the shaver, and it also charges the unit. The only reason I gave it three stars is after I&#x27;ve run the cleaning cycle, the shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to glide well over my face, almost like it has a tacky feel to it. I only use the Jet Clean cycle about every third shave, otherwise just rinsing the razor head under hot water. I don&#x27;t have the tacky sensation when only using the water rinse. Norelco should evaluate this.</li>
    <li> The whole bottle of solution is able to fill up the jet clean system about 2 to 3 times. If the solution is changed every 15 days, a bottle would last about 1 month, which is reasonable.</li>
    <li> A very good product and so cheaper. Full suggested and recommended for the purpose you need: cleaning the RAZOR in a proper manner.</li>
    <li> After years of blade shaving, we recently went back to an electric razor in our house.  The one chore I hated with an electric razor was the cleanup.  We purchased the Norelco 3D 1280X With JetClean unit and it solved the problem.  This solution works great in the unit and does exactly what it says.  It keeps the razor clean and smelling fresh and is super easy to dump out and replace.  There is no overwhelming alcohol or chemical smell and it does indeed last the full 2 weeks if you clean dailly.  If you have a JetClean razor unit, this is the stuff.</li>
    <li> Who knew that if you used this product, you will not have to keep buying replacement heads as they will last longer by just cleaning them properly.</li>
    <li> Cleaning solution makes cleaning shaver so easy. Once every two weeks replace solution in cleaning tub and your work is done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for my Norelco 1280X since I purchased the razor.  I&#x27;ve also enjoyed Amazons subscription service for this product, finding that 2 bottles every 3 months is about the right amount for me (I replace the fluid monthly, not every 2 weeks).  This paired with the JetClean system does seem to keep my razor fairly clean.  I never notice a buildup of hair inside, and never have to open the head to clean it out.  That being said, my razor heads always seem to have a thin white film on them from the various shaving products I&#x27;ve tried over the years while using this razor.  Shaving cream residue stays on the head for instance (shaving gel is worse) despite shaving for 3 minutes then putting it through the JetClean daily.  This appears to be a minor aesthetic annoyance only, but it would be nice if it dissolved and removed those products from the head a little better.</li>
    <li> You cant beat the 4 pack price on this solution for your Norelco shaver.  Even the &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; stores!  This is a bargain!</li>
    <li> &#x27;Cool Breeze&#x27; it ain&#x27;t.  Think: cheapest Bowery Bum after shave - like Aqua Velva, only worse and more persistent.  Took a half hour and liberal use of 90% isopropyl alcohol to clean the smell from the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also didn&#x27;t remove the musty/moldy smell from the razor itself (separate from the head, which an overnight soak did clean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tossed the remainder in the trash.  Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever thought a cleaning solution needed to be a cologne should be shot in the parking lot as an example.</li>
    <li> This works perfect for cleaning my razor and keeps things humming smoothly. It cuts oils from your skin ang keeps things sparkling.</li>
    <li> This is great for cleaning an electric razor and I would recommend using it regularly to keep it clean and ready to use.</li>
    <li> great product, very satisfied</li>
    <li> Keeps my razor smelling fresh, I really miss my cleaning system when I travel extended periods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can subscribe and get it even cheaper and without the forgetting to get a new one (always happened to me).</li>
    <li> No negatives on this one. The product does what it says and what it is intended for. My husband has a new shaver and loves this product and refuses to use anything else.</li>
    <li> Works well,  but is very expensive.  I&#x27;ve been having a tough time finding this in stores,  so I&#x27;ve switched to a combination of water and Dial liquid soap.  Seems to work just as well.  I just rinse my razor off with tap water after the cleaning cycle.  I won&#x27;t order this product again.</li>
    <li> Razor is much cleaner with cleaning solution than with brush alone.</li>
    <li> My husband has had his electric razor for a couple of years now and it use to be easy to find the cleaning solution at the store. Now you can&#x27;t find it anywhere. So just out of curiosity we looked for it on here. Not only did we find it we found it for an amazing price!!! This was exactly what we needed so that he can continue using his razor.</li>
    <li> Works well, but alcohol may be just as effective. I use it since it is rcecommened by the manufacturer and their razors work well for me.</li>
    <li> Cleans my razor very well.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I expected it to be.  The great deal has allowed me to take better care of my shaver.</li>
    <li> The Norelco electric razor works even better when it is kept very clean. The Jet Clean Solution is especially good if the razor is used daily.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this product. It does exactly what is needed to keep his razor working properly.&lt;br /&gt;He definitely plans to buy this again.</li>
    <li> i dont have words for this product because it does not need more words the product is good , fine.</li>
    <li> Does a good job cleansing and conditioning my blades. I prefer to wet shave with shave cream. I really keeps the blades in good state. Always get a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I thought about not getting this, but figured I would try it on a whim. Upon the first use, I was absolutely delighted at how well it cleaned my electric shaver and how good it made my shaver smell. It&#x27;s a very masculine smell. I love it. I wish they had a cologne for it. Highly recommended if you have an electric shaver with an attached cleaner.</li>
    <li> I do not have the snazzy Jet Clean auto cleaner system but simply pouring a bit into a small dish and spending a few minutes, dipping it in, running it, taking it out, etc really cleaned up my razor and I have to believe it will stay sharper and run better as a result.&lt;br /&gt;I looked for some sort of cleaning solution locally for a while but none of the CVS type stores even knew what I was talking about so I&#x27;m glad this is obtainable for a few dollars.</li>
    <li> I clean my razor with it. I use it every week and the store I go to quit caring it. I have used this product for ten years, can&#x27;t clean without it tried other brands just unable to compare to this product.</li>
    <li> I have never used this solution before I now find that makes my razor run nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find it locally anymore. Like the smell and having my razor clean. older model, will keep buying until it dies.</li>
    <li> Amazon has this product listed several ways and it was a little confusing if they were the same 10oz size I&#x27;m used to buying. Had to view the photo on zoom and keep fingers crossed this was the orrery size and not the other more expensive version also sold by amazon (and other sellers) with the correct specs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the standard 10oz size I was hoping to receive</li>
    <li> Sin mucho a que hacer referencia es lo que ven en la publicacion, hace lo que tiene que hacer. Y necesaria para mantener limpia tu afeiotadora</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this solution is half the price of what I used to buy. It seems to be the same solution if not better. I might sign up for the regular shipment of it just for upkeep of my razor and the autocleaner.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a friend who has mentioned that it works very well.</li>
    <li> I use this on my electric razor and it cleans nicely with out any strong odors.</li>
    <li> This is the only solution I have sued to clean my 12 year old cordless Norelco.  Rasor come out slick as a whistle every time.</li>
    <li> Great to clean your shaving heads on your Norelco shavers&lt;br /&gt;Discontinued under Subscribe&amp; Save today!&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find it under retail!</li>
    <li> it is the original cleansing fluid. very good to maintain your razors and also for keeping them free of bacteria.</li>
    <li> This provides a hands-off way to clean and recharge your Norelco Philips 3D Razor.  Easy and unattended!&lt;br /&gt;Solution lasts much longer if I rinse the heads under the faucet to clear whisker stubs BEFORE placing razor into Cleaning System; otherwise cleaning solution soon contains much beard stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Razor smells good, too!</li>
    <li> Works well to keep my Norelco self-cleaning electric razor&#x27;s heads clean. Next time I am going to buy a larger size.</li>
    <li> Compared to the little short round bottles it&#x27;s the same stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t figure out why it&#x27;s 1/2 the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Same amount of cleaning solution.  Why so different is a great question to ask of the people that make it.</li>
    <li> This product is used in the cleaner/charger which comes with certain models of Norelco electric razors.  It works great!  The razor head is sparkling clean and the razor battery is fully charged.  The HQ200 Jet Clean Solution is part of the process and the desired result of a clean razor ready for the next use is achieved.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about it. It does the job. I do not have anything to compare it to. I do like the Norelco clean/charger!</li>
    <li> The solution has a pleasant scent and feels good when using razor after cleaned.  I will buy more when I need to.</li>
    <li> For a few months this stuff was impossible to find.  I use to have it on autoship from amazon and it was $5-6 and prime shipping.  Then they cancelled and it disappeared from everywhere (except for hoarders selling it for $25/bottle).  When I found it for $12 on prime shipping again I jumped on it.  I had tried making my own solution with different combinations, but nothing measured up to this and the cleaner would reject my homemade stuff.  Now I am back to using this everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on amazon does seem to be a bit high now that this stuff seems to be back in production by Phillips.  On their own site they sell it for $5 and free shipping.  Seriously amazon?  2.5 bottles for the price of your one?</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to use the razor, you may as well use the recommended cleaner.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I used this product with my Norelco Jet Cleaner; it works well, keeps the razor clean and the seller delivered the product very quickly.  Very good price, too.</li>
    <li> The smell from the solution gives off that really clean sterile smell like the smell as a comb is pulled from the blue sterile liquid at the barbershop</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this solution to clean my razor for over 5 yr. It cleans it quickly &amp; completely without taking the head apart.</li>
    <li> What can I say about this clean Solution, well yeah, it cleans but then again what else is it supposed to do!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. What else can I say? Reasonable price? Yes. Store-able? Yes. Lasts me way longer than the instructions say it should because I only use it when I recharge.</li>
    <li> bought this solution with my norelco 2d shaver. not much to really say good cleaning everytime no residue. does need changing every 1-2 weeks depending on usage</li>
    <li> Good price cleans well</li>
    <li> Wish the price was lower because it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This works well for those who bought the Norelco razor that comes with a cleaning machine.  After a few hours on the machine, your electric shaver is recharged and has clean heads.</li>
    <li> What can I say, this is the cleaner that is recommended for my husbands electric shaver, so it works just fine.</li>
    <li> We did not even know this product was available until we saw it on Amazon when we were ordering a new head for my husband&#x27;s razor.  He is really pleased with the way this cleans his shaver.</li>
    <li> great price on this product .This is exactly what I needed and matches the product that came with the shaver</li>
    <li> Just use water instead. Works just as fine, if you want to be more hygienic, put a small amount of anti-septic liquid to sanitize the blades. I didn&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;lubrication\\&quot; when I used this solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t bad or misleading but you can DIY a cheaper option.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what I wanted and needed it to do for my Norelco. Which is the greatest contraption invented since sliced bread! I would recommend this product to everyone with the clean machine that utilizes the solution.</li>
    <li> Not like there are many other options, but it works well and the bottle is a good size that fits in my drawer.</li>
    <li> great,, another hard to find item</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T GET IT ANYMORE</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great buy for the money, looked all over and could not find it for a better price. Would recommend this item to family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> Does help your blades feel sharper and really helps clean the hair shavings with your cleaning machine. Plus can use multiple cleanings.</li>
    <li> well, it seems to do the job, i clean my razor once every two weeks and I haven&#x27;t come out in a rash, boils nor contracted any diseases (skin diseases) - I did contract another disease but that was nothing to do with this product but due to a rather unfortunate in Thailand involving a so called \\&quot;girl\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Went a week or two without this cleaning solution for my razor and i had to order it to get my razor to have that fresh smell, love it.</li>
    <li> I like using this solution to keep my Panasonic shaver clean and smelling fresh.  Because of the cost of this solution, I use it about once a month.  I soak the head in the solution for about 5 minutes and run the cleaning cycle.  After cleaning, I can see stubble on the bottom of the solution and the safer smells good.</li>
    <li> Shine bright like a diamond!</li>
    <li> It is just like the solution provided with my new shaver.  The price is very affordable and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Jet solution for my husbands shaver.  We normally get it at our local store but they were out of it.  I&#x27;m a having a harder time finding it.  So we decided let&#x27;s just check with Amazon and put it on auto shipment just like another product I have on auto shipment.  They had it in a square container and by putting it under auto shipment the price was even better. We recieved it and the next day my hubby said honey please don&#x27;t order that Jet solution again.  I ask why and he said it has a SCENT to it.  NO NOT A SCENT.  We can&#x27;t have that.  My hubby is allergic to anything perfumery.  Could you please list every detail about the product.  Some of us need to know these things.  Details, Details, Details about your products.  The more words the better.  In the meantime I will send this back and hope that another order that I placed also through Amazon don&#x27;t come .  I sent them an email and ask if it consist of the scent  &amp;#34;Cool Breeze&amp;#34; and they said that is all they sell.  What happened to just plain and no scent.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do; clean and lubricate my electric razor.  I don&#x27;t know how long the solution can really last before the need to change it out, but for now I just stick to the directions and change it out every two weeks like it suggests.  It is exactly enough solution to fill up twice.  No wasted solution.  I like that.  I&#x27;m kind of OCD about having a tiny amount of solution left in a container.</li>
    <li> The product works ok with me on my razor  works great with hot water by letting the razor head soak in the sink</li>
    <li> Easy to keep shaver clean and blades sharp. Works great with the SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor. I highly recommentd this stuff.</li>
    <li> works fine with the razor which is 3D senso touch, im sure it keeps the machine&#x27;s life longer to use :)</li>
    <li> came as package deal.  He loves the razor.  It shaves his head too perfectly.&lt;br /&gt; don&#x27;t know why it says  six more words are required so here they are</li>
    <li> This is excellent product just as advertised.  It was sold for a great price and delivered ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my new Norelco shaver, and it does a good job of cleaning the razor head and leaving it fresh for the next use.</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed for my new razor. It is used to clean the electric razor in the cleaning device.</li>
    <li> This product has a very strong scent which not only lingers on the razor but also lingers on your face.  I found the scent very unpleasant - smelled like cheap cologne.  I quit using it but have not found a good substitute.  It may be time for a different brand of shaver.  Too bad.  I&#x27;ve been a Norelco customer for years.</li>
    <li> Works great and helps keep my trimmer in working order. i have been using this since i got my trimmer and have had no issue with it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Exactly what I wanted. Original factory replacement cleaning solution that was in the box when I bought my Phillips Norelco shaver.</li>
