<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> satisfecho con el producto, muchas gracias.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Does a good job on the beard and moustache that my boyfriend has.</li>
    <li> The comb broke, battery life is low &amp; it pulled. Crap</li>
    <li> It is an excellent Thanks</li>
    <li> Quite silent compared to others I used in the past. Surely meet the expectations.</li>
    <li> Out of every hair trimmer I have bought to use on my husbands hair this one by far is the worst. It doesn&#x27;t stay charged long, it takes me SO much longer to cut his hair, and most of the guard pieces have broken off. I absolutely do not like this product at all. Not worth the money I paid!</li>
    <li> This trimmer does the job for facial hair - but struggles a bit with the hair on my head.  Overall, easy to use, does the job and is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I have used 2 other trimmers over the past 20 years.  This has been the best trimmer I have owned.  It cuts my beard and mustache better than the 2 other trimmers ever did.  It doesn&#x27;t clog as bad as the others.  The precise trimmer is great for getting my mustache even.  I tried the hair guard the other day and it worked perfectly.  I usually cut my hair short for the summer and it did a great job giving me an all over even cut.  That is the great feature with this trimmer, it is really good at cutting all of the hairs whether it is your facial hair or top of the head.  My other trimmers would often not cut some hairs given the way my beard grows at an angle in one portion and I would often have to get a scissors to get those few hairs but this trimmer gets those also.  I would have to give credit to the guard.  Its ability to adjust to various heights and stay there is excellent.  It holds a charge better than my previous rechargeable. The 2 guards are nice to haves, if you are using it for more than just your facial hair.  Overall a great trimmer and a good companion with my electric razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after he decided to grow a beard. We have owned it for about 4 years now and have only replaced one of the guides because a tooth broke. I even use it to cut my son&#x27;s hair and to trim my husbands neck between hair cuts. Great product and do not regret buying.</li>
    <li> This product is OK.  The trimmer feels underpowered.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot really use it as a corded trimmer because the cord will not stay connected to the device, the smallest pull will disconnect it.&lt;br /&gt;The accessory bag needs to be a little larger for everything to fit comfortably inside.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer does feel good in the hand and is designed well aside from the power issue.</li>
    <li> Good item&lt;br /&gt;But I expect better .. I was expecting that removes hair better&lt;br /&gt;But in general are good and the industry was not bad</li>
    <li> Well, I wanted to like this, but it would not even cut through my beard very well and that is what I bought it for.  Returned it and bought full size clippers that have some power.</li>
    <li> Truth be told, I bought this product to replace my dying trimmer because it was on sale, and I expected quality from Braun. This was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, if you want to use this to maintain a short beard, good luck. The guides are useless. Instead of combing the hair up to the cutting blades, they are are rounded and perpendicular to the blade. Where as most products I&#x27;ve seen have combs/guides that stick out in front of the blades and come to an angle to lift hair, these guides just run the hair over; not very effective. The guides also flimsy, and attempting to use the 1MM option leaves your face looking patchy. First time I used it I started from the higher lengths and worked my way down. 3MM was too long, and 1MM resulted in a mess that caused me to shave it all off and try again later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, I wasn&#x27;t too pleased that the battery takes 8 hours for a full charge, and lasts such an embarrassingly short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I use this trimmer for now is cleaning up my neck line. If I hadn&#x27;t of lost my receipt, I would have returned it. This trimmer wasn&#x27;t even worth it on sale.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is pretty good.  It has a wide array of lengths to choose from and seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Braun Cruzer 6 for about 5 months now, and I have to say that I&#x27;m happy with this beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I choose this over other brands. but not happy after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price. difficult to use and handle. trims good.</li>
    <li> My old beard trimmer attachments started to fall apart. I wanted to find a replacement which would be more robust. The Braun Cruzer 6 really meets my expections and my needs. The razor is very powerful and easy to handle and to use. The attachments are well made and easy to install when they are required. I am now able to trim my beard and moustache exactly the way I want. I have even used the Cruzer to cut my hair.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say about this product. I could use it to cut my hair if I wanted to. I like the mustache trimmer slide out arm.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cruzer beard and head trimmer is a great trimmer to have for that man who is on the go and wants to keep looking neat. The Cruzer is easy to use and trims in a few minutes. Braun has developed an easy to use and affordable beard and head trimmer.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 beard &amp; head cordless electric razor is a cool shaver that really comes in handy.  I&#x27;m a gentleman who wears his hair very short and shaved close to the skin so I can&#x27;t comment too fully on its ability to properly cut a full head of hair but as far as convenience it is very nice.  In the past I have used a large barber style clipper which, while powerful, had the down sides of being heavy and having a thick power cord that got in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is rechargeable and includes a cord that is detachable.  It is light and portable, even coming with a nice carrying case.  It also includes two adjustable attachments to allow for varying lengths.  There is also a small portion that slides out and is a smaller clipper for areas that need more precision.  On the cosmetic side of things it is a slick looking cool blue and grey color scheme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down sides I can think of are that it does not seem to have the raw power of a corded clipper and this sometimes makes me feel it is not clipping as efficiently, the head is a touch smaller than a barber style clipper and the battery is really only good for one maybe two full uses (but keep in mind I&#x27;m clipping my whole head and take a while so it may well be remarkable battery life for what it is doing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I feel the positives outweigh the negatives and I like this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product thus far.  Do not feel it is very good for hair cutting, as opposed to beard trimming.  Needed a trimmer that was dual voltage for use in Europe and this fits the bill.  Wide variety of lengths to choose from.  Very quick standard shipping from Amazon - as usual.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional men&#x27;s groomer for over 20 years and have owned at least 40 clippers of all varieties. None have been as good as this Braun Trimmer for consistent results when trimming the beard. It&#x27;s extremely variable in it&#x27;s setting for length and can be used for body grooming as well. Holds a good charge, and isn&#x27;t too heavy like many professional clippers. Definitely one of my favorite &#x27;go to&#x27; clippers.</li>
    <li> I always had faith in the Braun name until this product was purchased.  Looked cheap coming out of the box.  Features worked OK but after one month the battery will not hold a charge.  Amazon has 30 day return window so now I must deal with Braun.  They want original box, but who keeps those things?  I&#x27;ll return it anyway and see what happens.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very easy to use, many different settings and accurate. Great cutting quality on the face and works great with a thick head of hair.clean up is very easy and so is maintainance. Fantastic product. Don&#x27;t know about the long term use though. To new. That&#x27;s why it only has 4 stars</li>
    <li> I love every thing about the beard trimmer I does the job it was made for with little effort.  Trims and shapes my moustaache and goatee with very little effort.</li>
    <li> Like the way it adjusts. Does great job trimming beard.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I had hoped, I have owned other Braun grooming items in the past that were phenomenal.  This one doesn&#x27;t quite hit that mark</li>
    <li> I actually threw out two new shavers after I bought this one. Every feature you could dream of. Very easy to use and extremely acurate trimmer.</li>
    <li> What is this - 1990?  This beard trimmer loses its vivacity after just a few minutes of use.  That&#x27;s how it was new, and how it is more than a year later.  Really - after charging it for 24 hours or more, I can hear its battery drain down from full to marginal performance level by the time I finish trimming a modest millimeter or two off my very modest, close cropped beard.  Its battery(ies) are totally unsuitable for the usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dismal battery performance is embarrassing.  Might have been OK twenty years ago, but it&#x27;s unacceptable today.  I can take my cordless toothbrush on the road for a week, using it twice daily, and it&#x27;s still got battery to spare.  Sure, a cordless beard trimmer is a convenience at home - after all, no one wants to be tethered to a wall outlet.  But come on, the cordless toothbrush has defined modern grooming standards.  Why do I have to pack the plug-in cord for my trimmer just to travel for a week of business?  I don&#x27;t want a power cord cluttering up my dopp kit.  And I don&#x27;t want that power cord laying on a wet countertop at the hotel.  Sheesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I don&#x27;t have much to say.  I only use the Braun to keep my beard trimmed from quite close to very close, and its trimmer head is adequate for that task.  The plastic comb hasn&#x27;t broken in the first year of use, which is a pleasant surprise.  The extendable tiny trimmer is a nice touch.  But really, I&#x27;d prefer to pay more for a cordless trimmer that is powered with *zest* for at least two or three grooming sessions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other trimmers before where the blade actually pops outwards on a hinge so you can rinse it off.  With that kind of design, hair tends to get inside the trimmer.  The Braun Cruzer 6 doesn&#x27;t have that feature, and instead is just one solid piece, with the precision trimmer being the only piece that slides out.  When I tried rinsing the main buzzer, I ended up getting water underneath the precision, trimmer sliding mechanism.  It took a while to dry, but it didn&#x27;t affect the performance.  It comes with a small brush for cleaning too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are easy to snap on and off and seem to offer enough adjustment for anybody&#x27;s needs.  Overall, it&#x27;s a solid trimmer with a nice zippered case that carries the brush, trimmer, and power cord.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I initially got it even though I have the face cruzer 6 as it seemed like a more powerful and sharper trimmer. Which it is. For a guy that uses it regularly and needs a good even trim, it does the job. Only down side is, hair gets stuck in the trimmer after about 10 minutes of trimming and needs to be emptied, not a big deal though.</li>
    <li> I try out a lot of products that deal with facial hair.  I have coarse/ thick hair that is hard to shave and leaves irritation and sometimes bumps that appear several days after shaving.  I gave this product a try and although I am sure it will work for the majority of the users out there, it just didn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut it\\&quot; for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically trim my goatee with a standard Wahl clipper and do the outline with an Andis T-outliner, which is what I also used for cleaning up my face.  It does give me a pretty close cut, almost like it looks the day after I shave with a razor.  So, I thought this might fit the bill for something lighter that I could use when traveling.  Well, not really.  I found it to be a little on the noisy side, and not heavy duty or strong enough to power through the goatee trimming.  Although it will work, I had to make multiple passes over the same areas to get it to work and if I went to fast it would bind up a little bit.  Now, keep in mind that most buyers don&#x27;t need to use anything with that much power as it does add weight to the machines and isn&#x27;t required most of the time.  In my case though, I might as well start using animal sheers :) Just kidding folks.  I have been happy with my T-outliner and since the blades gave out and I tried another aftermarket set that I didn&#x27;t like.  I went ahead and ordered Andis 08770 Andis Experience Gtx trimmers and will review them after I have used them for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These did end up going back.  Maybe it was just the battery that didn&#x27;t hold a charge well enough or maybe the motor.  But for the amount of noise it made relative to the power it had. It just wasn&#x27;t enough to justify keeping it.  Good luck out there with your decisions, I hope this review was helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 2 of these over the last two years. While I love this razor when it is new, I won&#x27;t be purchasing a 3rd. The battery doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 minutes after a full charge cycle even though I only charge it when it&#x27;s almost dead. This happened to both of mine after about 10 month&#x27;s of ownership despite being lightly used. None of the parts on Braun clippers of this type are replaceable which is a waste. The battery and blades should be readily available and easy to replace. I&#x27;ve used nothing but Braun shaving products for 15 year&#x27;s and thier personal trimmers have been a disappointment in the end. I bought a Wahl peanut clipper like beauticians and barbers use. It&#x27;s not cordless but very durable, serviceable, part&#x27;s are affordable and readily available. The blade width on the peanut is small like the Braun which is a must for tight places.</li>
    <li> sometimes it get stuck&lt;br /&gt;but over all its a good product&lt;br /&gt;specially for the price</li>
    <li> Really good razor.&lt;br /&gt;Works very smooth.</li>
    <li> The razor makes it easy to to trim your beard or cut hair. If your hair is thick it might&lt;br /&gt;be underpowered and need to be  cleaned often,  even that is simple.  This is not the&lt;br /&gt;case for my use and works perfectly. Changing the attachment is a snap and the length&lt;br /&gt;adjustment well designed.  The travel case  seems a little small and everything fits in it a bit&lt;br /&gt;awkward, this is not really a big deal. I do not think it is my imagination but it does not seem&lt;br /&gt;as loud compared to others that I have had.  The pop up trimmer was a bit hard for me to&lt;br /&gt;use, it would of been easy to give it 5 stars but this should not be given out casually.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I use this to trim a recently grown beard and it works flawlessly. The trim guard makes it easy to dial in how long you want your beard. Have not tried the hair cutting ability, but would expect it to work fine. I like the fact that it&#x27;s battery powered and don&#x27;t have to contend with a wire.  Solid build quality, is light but significant in your hands.</li>
    <li> The title pretty much says it all.  Does what it says in the description and is reliable.  Dont go to wal-mart and buy one of these cause for the same price you can buy this one and it will work way better than any shaver youd buy at wal-mart or target.</li>
    <li> This is well-designed and innovative. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t need multiple guide tools, because the included combs adjust by sliding along the machine. It also has a separate extending micro trimmer. The dual power system is impressive. And it&#x27;s water-submergeable. However, this is an expensive machine. I find inexpensive trimmers to be perfectly adequate for my hair. The question is: Do you want to spend a lot on a high-tech model like this, or save money by buying an inexpensive trimming set? If money is no object, then by all means, this is fabulous and go for it.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product and am overall very pleased. I use it to cut my hair my hair. However, today I used it to cut my son&#x27;s hair. All was going along well and I was thinking how nice and quiet this is.  My thoughts then turned to the fact that it has trouble cutting hair unless you are exactly against the grain. This isn&#x27;t a major issue but was a minor annoyance.  I then took off the measuring guard and trimmed his neck and ears. I then put the guard back on to recheck his head, confirmed that it was still on 9mm and ran it through his hair. Much to my chagrin I discovered that the guard can go on too far, not seated correctly, and I cut a major groove through the side of his head!  So my probable 5 star rating dropped to a 3. This might be one of those \\&quot;well it won&#x27;t happen to me\\&quot; stories but it did happen and I wasn&#x27;t too pleased. Fortunately my son is good natured and didn&#x27;t get mad and mom took him to the beautician.  We&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who at first was put off by the fact that it has to be charged 12 hours before use. But once it was charged he put it to the test and is in love with how close of a shave he gets. With a full charge you get a nice clean smooth shave. The regular razor portion doesn&#x27;t have the power of a normal power razor, he wasn&#x27;t too amped up about that. It has a few attachments that are easy to pop on off and off and the GREAT thing is that it comes with a replacement blade (which was awesome because those are expensive!). It also brings three separate attachments which he has yet to use but is thankful for having just in case he comes across a wooly mammoth he needs to shave or something.     The product brings a snazzy travel bag in black with a drawstring and more importantly it brings a sort of shower caddie so you can hang it in the shower, and it&#x27;s even water proof! Cleanup was a no hassle situation they provide a cleaning brush that works great and the overall cleaning experience is so much easier than most other power razors. It also brings this nifty magnetic base to charge with which makes it easy for travel and storage. The man in your life will fall in love with this little gadget!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well for me. I was replacing an old Phillips Norelco that died after many years. I remove the head of the razor to buzz my head weekly and use the adjustable head to trim my beard. It has less power than the Phillips did but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It plug up with hair and it must be cleared to offen</li>
    <li> Works a lot better than most trimmers.</li>
    <li> It does a poor job cutting facial hair.  I have to make dozens of passes over the same area to cut all of the hair.  I&#x27;ve never had to do this with other beard trimmers before.  The device seems reasonably well constructed (about as good as can be expected these days), but it performs poorly at it&#x27;s primary task which is very disappointing.  It&#x27;s a shame because certain aspects look like a fair amount of care went into the design, but then you go to use it and it is such a chore to get it to actually evenly trim up your beard.  I&#x27;m not sure if the motor is just weak, the blades are too short or dull. or there is some other flaw here, but someone at Braun made some very bad decisions.</li>
    <li> After having used the Panasonic ER224S head/face trimmer for about a year and a half, I had to invest some more cash and buy this one since the other broke. I had been quite satisfied with the panasonic but must say the Cruzer 6 is much better. It is more solid, has a more ergonomic design and the detachable clip comes off and on far more easily than the one on the Panasonic ER224S.  I&#x27;ve only used this trimmer 3 times so far but I&#x27;m already noticing the difference in quality and results. It is also washable like the Panasonic ER224S, but comes with a charging cord so that you can use it of the wall socket if the battery happens to die on you (which shouldn&#x27;t happen if you&#x27;re careful as there is a battery life indicator displayed on the handle).  In summary, if you&#x27;re going to invest in a beard/head trimmer (which will save you loads over the years), don&#x27;t be cheap and settle for a lower quality product that will either break or lose its punch after a few uses. Get a quality product like the Braun Cruzer 6.</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun Cruzer 6 for three months now and having reliably tested it over this period, I would not recommend the trimmer to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I have a 10mm beard and the trimmer struggles awfully to cut the beard at a uniform length. Mostly, it just pushes the hair around leaving a patchy look with single, straggly hairs sticking out and needing scissors to cut them. Not a good look. It seems that there just isn&#x27;t the power to trim a proper beard; whilst both of the comb sets seem designed poorly, not allowing all hairs to get a uniform cut. That said, for my beard, the hair comb set does a better job than the beard comb.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is the battery. It simply will not run for 40 minutes with a one hour charge. It audibly drops power after ten minutes of use. Which is bad when it takes so long to get a proper trim as the trimmers aren&#x27;t up to the job.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a frustrating experience and waste of money. I&#x27;ll be buying a plug in hair clipper set to do the job better.</li>
    <li> Plastic is not so firm when you press against your face. There is some flex to it, so if you want an even cut make sure you or the person who is doing it has the same amount of pressure in each pass</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by this product.  I typically shave every day for the work week, and then take a break on the weekends.  Every once in a while, I would leave the goatee, but by Wednesday or Thursday, it was looking too scraggly to be respectable.    This beard trimmer really fit the bill.  I spend less time shaving, keep the goatee for a few weeks now, and use the number 3 setting every 2-3 days to maintain the look.  The battery has yet to run out, and the fit/finish of the device is great.  It feels and performs like a well-engineered product.    The only disappointing element is that it has settings for 1,3,5,7...  I would love a setting for 2, but end up settling for 3 instead.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer.  I use it to trim my goat-tee.  Works great.  Charge lasts a long time.  My only complaint is the side buttons to detach the attachments aren&#x27;t as easy to use.    But otherwise, a great timmer.  Gets the job done easily.</li>
    <li> The first use was good, but it quickly took a turn down hill, it takes more time than should ever be needed to trim hair, it doesn&#x27;t get close enough for a 5&#x27;o&#x27;clock shadow look, and misses a lot of hair. I&#x27;d say skip it and go for something higher end because it&#x27;s much more worth it. I won&#x27;t be using Braun again after this poor product.</li>
    <li> I have used the Norelco T980 (IIRC) for close to 5 years. the batteries and unit finally just were wearing out.  When trying to get a new one the Norelco 4070 with the extra powerful vacuum does NOT have a contour head for true beards, it is for stubble cuts only.  You have to search out a QT4090 that is available at select stores only.  While talking with Norelco I let their customer service know we did not have those stores in our rural area and I would buy another brand from Amazon - Norelco CS did not care if I bought one of their units or not.  I looked through Amazon&#x27;s listings thoroughly and decided on this Bruan Cruzer 6.  One thing that really convinced me was the 2 batteries that kick in extra power when it hits coarse or heavy beard areas - and this WORKS!!!  No it does not have the vacuum but even the old Norelco caught probably  only a third of the hair so after charging the unit up overnight I trimmed my beard to take the wife out to dinner last night.  Covered the sink and counter with a bath towel as I did with the Norelco with vacuum and just let it catch the hair - this gave me the best trim I have had outside a barber shop and it may have even been better then those!  It followed the contour of my face better then any other unit I have owned and the extra power kick in unit really works.  I have some really coarse areas that would strain all other brands - the Braun just kicked it up and kept giving a good cut with no hair pulling or stalling.  The small slide up head allowed me to trim areas like the corners of my mouth and right under the nose in addition to those nose and ear hairs we all have to worry with as age gets us.  Picked the towel up when finished and dumped the hair in the trash can - forget the vacuum units really don&#x27;t catch the hair, just lay out a towel and get this Braun - you will not regret it!  A real added advantage was my wife said it was the best trim on my beard ever and she was thrilled - that really convinced me I bought the right unit!!!</li>
    <li> I have a full beard for 27 years. During that time I&#x27;ve had many beard trimmers, and have always been on the search for a better one.  Though I&#x27;ve only had this one about a month, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had. I settled on a Wahl Peanut for a long time, liking it a great deal, except that it was corded which was cumbersome to use.  Time will tell the battery life of this one, but it&#x27;s clearly powerful enough to do a great job without bogging down or pulling. I use it several times per week and am still using it on it&#x27;s original charge.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver for my head and beard. It does a great job keeping the stubble even. It is really easy to adjust the length. The waterproof nature is great as it cleans up easily and you can use it in the shower. The shaver holds a charge well and the power coward is one of the best made cords I have had.</li>
    <li> Love this item thank you very much!!!</li>
    <li> The higher height settings are useless, one of the fins on the attachment broke easily &amp; more than once I&#x27;ve screwed up a hairdo or beard trim because the attachment moved out of its height setting. However, I like the way it trims without attachments, leaves a nice stubble. I cannot recommend this to any fellow bearded men, I will not buy this product again &amp; will be looking at a different brand, I&#x27;ve had good luck with Wahl, maybe it&#x27;s time for me to switch back.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver/clipper, being in the military and traveling overseas it&#x27;s a pain when equip is not dual voltage. these have a travel type charger and can be used anywhere with the proper plug adapter. These cut well so far, only used them a few times but I like them.</li>
    <li> Have had this for about 3 weeks, and have nothing but nice things to say about it. It seems well built and runs quiet. So far, the battery appears to be solid, and lasts a long time. Let&#x27;s see how this unit stands up to the test of time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally review many things, but I have owned the braun cruzer 5 beard and head trimmer and just recently bought the braun cruzer 6 beard and head trimmer.  They are both identical, but it appears that the cruzer 6 has a more powerful motor.  They both are equally as great, but the cruzer 6 has an extra unique trimmer to trim without having to remove the guides.  Now I want to let you all know that I do not use this trimmer for a close shave...I have about a 1/8\\&quot; beard so the 3MM works perfect.  It trims pretty even for the most part, and I have also found that there is not a way you can \\&quot;coon\\&quot; yourself because the beard comb has teeth that go on top of it so that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t accidently shave off your beard.  Overall this is the best beard trimmer I have used (previously I&#x27;ve owned a wahl peanut which is really good too, a norelco qt4070 which sucked so bad I exchanged it), and really if you have the extra money I recommend the cruzer 6 over the 5, plus the cruzer 6 has a sweet carrying case and it charges in one hour, versus the cruzer 5 takes 8 hours to charge and it seems as though the cruzer 5 motor isn&#x27;t as strong.  It even sounds weaker too when using them.  I highly recommend this to anyone keeping that short beard about a week&#x27;s length or so if you are pretty gnarly like myself.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money spent for this great trimmer. Ihave had the much cheaper trimmers in the past and they become dull with get use.</li>
    <li> Just a horrible unit, that replaced my remington. You need to leave it plugged in, otherwise you barely have enough power to finish. If you use the slider trimmer, power gets cut in half. Wish I could return it, what a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I rated it low due to power, I couldn&#x27;t return it and use it.  Yes it still lacks in power.  Yes it barely holds a good charge, so I use it 90% of the time plugged in.  I just have a hard time recommending it, when it doesn&#x27;t cut great, I&#x27;m just stuck with it, until I get a new one.  Shame, I wanted to love it, but just can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I did not return it and was too cheap to get another, I use it with its cord.  When it&#x27;s plugged in, it does a fairly decent job and the levels are fine.  There are better ones out there, even still.</li>
    <li> Battery life is the only problem with this product.  Good for about 1 year, then won&#x27;t hold a charge.  I would buy another if it had Lithium Ion battery, the Cruzer 6 does not.  And it will not shave from wall power.</li>
    <li> Works great! Great for Father&#x27;s Day</li>
    <li> The Cruzer 6 is a lightweight trimmer with an easy to adjust guard. Unfortunately, lightweight translates, for me, into low quality. It has the look and feel of a disposable product meant to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is not very strong and the guard is on the flimsy side, meaning you are not going to get a very precise cut.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to trim up your beard then this is for you. Easiest thing to use and to adjust when you need to. It runs very quiet too. Can&#x27;t even really hear it.</li>
    <li> One star is generous. I suspect that the one I got was returned or broken. It only works at the level 1 which is just about like using a straight edge. Plus it&#x27;s not easy to clean. I really hate it and probably won&#x27;t use it again. I wish I could return it but that&#x27;s the problem with buying on line, it&#x27;s a pain in the butt.</li>
    <li> Prior to using the Braun cruZer6, I had been using the Philips Norelco T980, which is a superb trimmer. As such, my review may be somewhat biased, having previously enjoyed the Norelco. That notwithstanding, the Braun cruZer6 is a great trimmer in its own right, so let me point out some of the pros and cons:    PROS:  * Ease of use to change through six different blade lengths, and the extra attachment for the head is easy to snap in place  * Sideburn accessory is very handy for keeping the &#x27;burns neatly trimmed  * Comfortable ergonomic design feels great in the hands  * Cleaning is easy, as this unit can be rinsed under water. Blade oil is included, for just such a purpose  * The internal rechargeable batteries hold a charge for a decent amount of time (just under an hour, so more than a week of normal use)  * Can be used with or without the cord  * Blades are fairly sharp and do not pull hairs  * Quick 60-minute recharge time is very convenient  * Operation is fairly quiet  * Travel pouch and charger make for an easy-to-travel-with item  * Two year warranty    CONS:  * No hair collector component, which would have been great for keeping the bathroom sink clean  * As many have already declared, the rechargeable batteries are not replaceable, which is a definite strike against  * Could benefit from a slightly more powerful motor, as some hairs can be a little too thick and stubborn for the Braun on the first few passes  * Price point may be a little bit high for this product, especially considering there is no Lifetime Warranty    Keep in mind that if your intended use is for a body hair trimmer, the Braun Cruzer does not shave the skin completely smooth -- as that is not in its intended design. But if you are seeking a trimmer to crop and maintain facial, head or body hair, this is a great tool to have -- and a great gift idea!</li>
    <li> The trimmer is ok. If purchased at other stores cost a lot more than amazon. I would have been disappointed if I paid $60 like other sites wanted. It trims the beard great. For cutting hair , it clogs itself  very quickly and you have to remove guide alot to clear out hair. It is good to keep hair shaped up once you have it cut at the length you want. It charges quickly.</li>
    <li> Like others, I concur that the batter life on this is awful. In under 2 years it barely holds a charge for 2 minutes and even that isn&#x27;t full power. If it worked plugged in I would at least get some use out of it, but as it is it&#x27;s going in the trash and I&#x27;m back to Norelco, last Braun product I&#x27;ll buy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this trimmer. It was a big disappointment, especially since it is one of the most expensive out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) If you want a trimmer to keep the \\&quot;stubble look\\&quot; (beard 1-1.5 mm), this won&#x27;t do it for you, just that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It is a cordless trimmer, which is nice. However, the charge base is very light and looks flimsy, which makes it hard to keep it sitting in the same place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It is washable; that is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I placed it on the charge base, and went to use it 2 days later, but it wouldn&#x27;t work! I realized the indicator light on the charge base would turn green when I placed the trimmer on it, but it would turn off right away. I suspect the battery was not getting charged. Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this item. Bad experience with it. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Cruzer 6 to keep my facial hair trimmed down to save time and money on not shaving. I previously used a hair clippers, like those in a barber shop, to keep my facial hair trimmed down. But I recently moved to a country with different electricity voltage and my clippers no longer worked. I bought the Cruzer because it would charge on the new electricity standards, operate on a battery and got decent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several times using the Cruzer 6, I learned that this is for trimming a BEARD and not getting facial hair really short. I was going for a \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; look which I now know is that my facial hair is less than one mm in length. One mm is the shortest length that the Cruzer 6 can trim whereas my previous hair clippers could go anywhere from .3 mm to 1 mm. However, even at one mm the Cruzer 6 had trouble keeping up with my thick facial hair requiring several passes and slow movements to get even just a mediocre trim. Even when I trimmed at the next longest length of 3 mm, the Cruzer 6 didn&#x27;t even feel like it was making a dent. The Cruzer 6 was also particularly bad at getting neck areas trimmed down. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I think it had to do with the difficulty of getting the Cruzer 6 in to trim at a good angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibly the only saving grace of the Cruzer 6 is the small little trimmer attached to the larger trimmer. That was good for bringing in the beard line on my neck, putting a line in the facial hair line at my cheeks and trimming around my \\&quot;soul patch\\&quot; (the area of hair directly below the lower lip). But even then the small trimmer maybe did a four star job and, in and of itself, is not a reason to buy this product. Since the Cruzer 6 did such a bad job on my beard, I would not even begin to think of using it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how long you want to keep your facial hair, I&#x27;d recommend a different beard trimmer (i.e. facial hair longer than 1 mm), but I don&#x27;t have a specific one to recommend, or a hair clipper like the [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]] for keeping your hair less than 1 mm in length for that \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; look.</li>
    <li> This shaver is very ergonomically comfortable, with smooth curves and a comfortable touch against the skin. I have had other beard trimmers with those single length plastic comb attachments you have to switch for different lengths to control shortness of cut, but results from using them are somewhat imprecise because of the dependence upon the angle at which you hold the cutting head to your face. What I like about this one is that you set the depth of the cut and then whack away without any worry of cutting too short, going back and forth, up and down, moving the head in all different directions and angles to the face. And for those who like that \\&quot;slightly more than 5:00 shadow\\&quot; kind of cut that is so stylish today, you can achieve that consistently without any concern about how you hold the angle of the cutting blade because of the consistent depth of the cutting head, no matter which direction or angle it is working, because the cutting guard completely surrounds the blade to insure it stays exactly the same distance from the skin at every angle, whether upside down, or backwards in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are six different depth settings for the beard trimmer (without having to change any cutting heads to select the depth you want) and a separate similar attachment with six deeper settings for longer cuts involving your hair. The cutting guards are easily removed, with the depression of two buttons on the side, allowing it to slide off, for \\&quot;bare cutting\\&quot; blade exposure, in case you want to use it like the barber does, against a regular comb or to easily remove \\&quot;fly away\\&quot; hair strands that are sticking up and out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is easy since you simply run the head under running water, without any danger of damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this trimmer and have since retired my other brand which worked well but not as forgiving and brain dead simple as this one for consistent cutting and flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is no surprise to me to see that Braun carefully designed this for function and efficiency, since I have had the same Braun Shaver for over 15 years which has never malfunctioned and with my stiff facial hair, I had never previously experienced cuts as close when using those rotary triple head shavers. When I discovered the Braun shaver with the horizontal cutting action and micro screen guard which amazingly captures every hair in its path, I started getting the kind of results that I had longed for with the rotary shavers. Seemed like I always had to finish the rotary off with a swipe or two of a safety razor in one direction or another to get down to smooth, stuble free skin. Sorry for the digression. Just thought it would be nice for some of you out there to consider the Braun line of shavers for \\&quot;tough stuble\\&quot; results.designed this for function and efficiency, since I have had the same Braun Shaver for over 15 years which has never malfunctioned and with my stiff facial hair, I had never previously experienced cuts as close when using those rotary triple head shavers.

    <li> I actually ordered this razor to use on my poodle between trips to the groomer, but my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend saw it when it arrived, and wanted to use it first.  So this is a nineteen-year old young man&#x27;s opinion of this razor (He has been wearing a trimmed full beard for three years):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  He liked that the razor comes with two heads:  One to trim facial hair and one for hair cutting.  He liked that the razor came with several different sizes of guards so that the probability is high that whatever length you like your beard/hair to be, this razor will have come with the guard that you need. (For those who are not regular users of electric shavers,  a \\&quot;guard\\&quot; is a little plastic doo-dad which fits over top of the razor&#x27;s blade so that you cut to your beard/hair to a set length.)  He liked the edger for precision-styling the beard.  He says that the razor did not pull hair, which would certainly be a concern for me if I was using it on my poodle.  He liked that the razor was sharp and precise so that he did not have to go over the same place several times.  The razor come with a little cleaning kit.  He liked that it was easy to clean the razor, and easy to get hair out of the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  He did not like that when he plugged in and started using the razor, it got hot after about five minutes.  He said that it did get uncomfortably hot a few times, but he is not sure if it would have done that if he had not been charging while shaving (I think he means that he kept it plugged into the wall while using it).  I have not used this razor on my dog, yet.  But this overheating problem would definitely be a concern for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this young man preferred this razor over his previous trimmer.  He said it was sharper and more precise.  With the previous trimmer, he said he had to go over the area to be shaved several times, and many times his old razor would miss hairs, thus giving him a less-than-clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I got the razor back from my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend, and have used it twice on my poodle.  It does a very good job on his silky, curly hair.  It&#x27;s nice that I can use it cordless.  It&#x27;s not as powerful as the plug-in horse clippers I have, but it is fine for facial clean-ups and going quickly over his body.  It&#x27;s not strong enough, nor does it hold a charge long enough to give a full poodle clip on a Standard Poodle, but that is surely off-warranty usage anyway.  Just thought you might like to know.  I didn&#x27;t have an issue with the razor overheating.r&#x27;s boyfriend, and have used it twice on my poodle.

    <li> Very nice for scraggly beard growth into a thin beard</li>
    <li> this is the best trimmer in my life, you can shave your beard like professional barber. plus. this devise has nice design</li>
    <li> great fro shapeing the beard.</li>
    <li> Great item as per my son who requested the Braun Cruzer 6 for his birthday gift.  My wife and I ordered it and my son has had it now for several moths and he said he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :-)</li>
    <li> My husband loves this! The best part is that you can use it while it is charging! Must buy for any guy out there</li>
    <li> Face it--heading out to get a haircut can be a bit of a hassle--and ends up costing more money than the sticker price. As a result, I always seem to let my hair grow too long and look a bit shabby. For a while now, I&#x27;ve been thinking about getting something to let me handle the job myself, so I can keep my hair trim. I wanted something that would let me work quickly and didn&#x27;t want anything like the huge machines I remember from my childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the Cruzer seemed like a great match--sure it&#x27;s advertised mostly for beards, but it does mention head-hair and that&#x27;s my application. It&#x27;s light-weight, and the guides let you set a length that keeps you from accidentally shaving patches in your head, which was a key fear of mine (see discussion of old-time monster machines above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ran this, it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t really taking a charge, but perhaps I simply didn&#x27;t charge it long enough. At any rate, the second time, it held plenty of juice to finish the job. Also the first time, I wet my hair before using it. The Cruzer did cut the wet hair, but it seemed to work a bit harder than when I simply left it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I&#x27;m not talking high style here--my goal is a consistent (short) look on the sides and back, and shorter on top. The Cruzer can deliver this (or could deliver longer cuts--hence the guides). I can do it myself, without using a mirror, simply finger-feeling for spots I&#x27;ve missed. I do draft my wife into trimming the neck-line--again using the Cruzer but this time without the guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I like it, I&#x27;m using it to cut my hair. I&#x27;m saving a few bucks every time I run it. And I&#x27;ve got my hair more the way I like it a higher percentage of the time. Sounds like a win-win. No major problems at all. Minor quibbles--sometimes it seems to leave patches of longer hair... this may be because I don&#x27;t move my arm straight so it&#x27;s hard to blame the machine, it really didn&#x27;t work as well as I would have liked when my hair was wet, and the guides are just a little (not a lot but some) tricky to remove when it comes time to trim the neckline. That was enough to drop it from the hard-to-achieve 5 star rating, but all of these are minor and I&#x27;m happy to recommend this little machine.little (not a lot but some) tricky to remove when it comes time to trim the neckline.

    <li> good razor for trimming your beard, or anyother hair. dosent cut very close without the gaurd so manscaping isnt quite as good as other razors iv had. if your short on dough this lil guy will get you buy for a while though.</li>
    <li> Smooth, painless experience.  Other clippers have caught and tugged...Ouch!  Not this one.</li>
    <li> Bought the Braun cruZer 6 because I have had a Braun electric razor for over 10 years and love it.  My old Braun razor has lots of power and provides me with a quick and close shave every morning.  I take it with me everywhere I go.  Has lasted and not degraded over time. I do buy new cutter and foil once in a while to keep things shaving well. The Braun cruZer 6 is not even in the same ball park.  I guess I should have guessed that by the price.  The cruZer 6 is small and light and easy to use.  However, it has no power at all.  The first time I turned it on after giving it an overnight charge it sounded like it was barely able to power itself up.  It sounded like it was fighting just to keep itself running.  Now imagine trying to run the struggling trimmer through any type of hair. Now it really bogs down.  I would buy this razor if you are looking to trim a little here or there. Basically a touch up or two.  To buy this razor to do any true trimming is a mistake.  I&#x27;ll be going back to using my big old \\&quot;cord only\\&quot; trimmer for the real work.</li>
    <li> The blades were never sharp and, in fact were duller brand new than blades on products used for years; so it&#x27;s only good for trimming, not shaves of any type.  The device does work well in water and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Works very well, thank you Braun</li>
    <li> The Braun beard and hair trimmer is one of the few that I&#x27;ve used the fit all my needs in a compact travel-ready kit. I love the adjustable length and the attached trimmer.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m not a guy so I handed this item over to one of my guy friends to try out and give me his honest opinion. He used it first to cut the hair on his head as he likes to keep a short cut. He put one of the guides on so that it wouldn&#x27;t cut it too short and got to work. It appeared to work good and not miss too much as he went along. I tried it out on his head and it was comfortable to hold and worked easily. It did clog up every now and again, but I believe any trimmer would do this. He then tried it to trim his mustache and liked the results with that. He said this isn&#x27;t a trimmer he would reach for on a daily basis, but one that he would use a few times a month if he had it.</li>
    <li> Got it for my Hubby, he&#x27;s still getting use to it but likes it so far.&lt;br /&gt;delivery was quick, happy ending..</li>
    <li> I was interested in the Cruzer 6 trimmer primarily for hair, not beard trimming. I keep my hair very short, and I like it neat, and this generally either means frequent haircuts (with their incremental costs), or finding a good and convenient set of clippers. I have used (rather, have had used on me) an Oster clipper that is very good, but it is corded, loud, gets pretty hot in use, and is kind of heavy. It can also chew up your skin when you try to set contours. There are accessory combs for it, but the whole prospect of cutting my own hair with them is a bit daunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does the Cruzer 6 compare? Not daunting at all. I read the brief instructions, checked out the 2 included combs, and got to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cordless operation. The rechargeable NiMH battery lasts a nice long 40 minutes or so, with an hour or so to charge it up. I couldn&#x27;t see any way to access the battery compartment, but with NiMHs, you should get hundreds upon hundreds of charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to adjust. One comb covers 1-10mm, the other 11-20mm. Click stops are at every 2mm. There is also a contour (\\&quot;sideburn\\&quot;) trimmer that pops up. Nifty design and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet during operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly powerful. My hair is average fineness, but pretty thick. The Cruzer 6 handled it well, only bogging down once when I moved into thick territory a little too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice kit, consisting of a compact zippered case, the trimmer, 2 combs, charger cord, cleaning brush, instructions, and some lubricating oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable cost. Hey, the Oster is over a hundred, and that&#x27;s without any accessories. For what you get with the Cruzer 6, including Braun quality, this is a very fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like a user-replaceable battery, but this is a minor quibble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of reviewers here can tell you of the quality as a beard trimmer. I used it to give myself a haircut ... and I&#x27;m pretty picky about my hair. It looks good, and the Cruzer 6 is the reason. With good cheap haircuts at the barber running $15-20 depending on your tipping generosity ... well, you do the math. This unit is a deal.arber running $15-20 depending on your tipping generosity ... well, you do the math. This unit is a deal.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift to my son.  He thinks it&#x27;s the best beard trimmer he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> 1 hour charge is great.  I actually didn&#x27;t know it had that feature when I purchased it.  The motor is super quiet. I can barely hear it over the sound of the exhaust in the restroom.  Cuts hair like butter.  The only complaint that I have is that the slide out trimmer doesn&#x27;t stick out far enough for my taste.  I&#x27;ll eventually get used to it i hope.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> Lasted about a year and a half.  Would not work unplugged for the last 6 months.  Now, it won&#x27;t turn on at all.  Primarily used for facial hair trimming.  It was ok for that, but the longer and/or thinner the hair is, the less effective it becomes.</li>
    <li> Poor quality product. The slider that adjusts the length of the cut broke after about 5 uses for no reason. Motor not very powerful--slow clipping speed means that it doesn&#x27;t cut very effectively.</li>
    <li> Braun.  A solid name for years in the industry.  That was until recently when I lost all respect for them and P&amp;G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for personal use and it said it was new.  The cost I thought was a little high but I thought to myself &amp;#34;you are getting a Braun so you are getting quality.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the item came two days later, I opened the box and to my horror, there were facial and pubic hair on the product!  IT WAS USED AND PACKAGED AS NEW!  I called Amazon at once and they immediately made sure I got my money back and they apologized profusely about the problem.  They explained to me that the products come from Braun to be fulfilled by Amazon and that if the outside of the box looks new, they don&#x27;t worry about doing extra controls on it.  Furthermore, why would they have to worry about Braun sending them a used product right?  I called Braun to tell them and all they wanted me to do is to be hush about the issue and they told me they would replace the product.  I told them I had sent it back to Amazon already and gotten my money back but I was going to present a complaint about it to health authorities since they clearly didn&#x27;t care about sending me a used product with evidence on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that I lost all faith in Braun and P&amp;G in general.  If something this blatant is not observed, then what else are we buying from them that is used and not sanitized?  To be honest, the hair was not the thing that bothered me the most.  What if the person who used it had cut themselves with it and they had a transmittable illness?  The hair was gross yes but I could have fixed that easy with an air can.  The health matter and the fact that they falsely advertised the product made me to never want to do business again with any Procter &amp; Gamble  product.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun timmer mostly to trim my goatee. It works very well, and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;- Cut nicely.&lt;br /&gt;- Charges quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Hold charge for a long time. Can be used while charging. I had an older remington trimmer which was really annoying because it would constantly loose its charge, and you couldn&#x27;t plug it in and use it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Feels sold and has attachment to trim head if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;- Just a minor gripe. The beard settings for the trimmer attachment go from 1, 3,5 ,7, 9, and 11 mm. There is no no way to set it in between so for instance if I wanted my beard at 2 mm I can&#x27;t do it. Not sure why they did this as otherwise I have no complaints with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Really good product and I would tell other to buy it.  It didn&#x27;t get 5 stars because the small trimmer on the top get REALLY hot if you use it for 1 minute.  Actually burned my face.  LOL</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok. i bought it to replace an old remington battery operated trimmer, it seems to get the job done - time will tell</li>
    <li> Brought this item after reading the great reviews on Amazon and got a great deal + free/fast shipping on Amazon. Been using the cruzer 6 head &amp; beard for a few months now and its OK. It does everything as advertised and the build quality and color scheme is pretty decent, but it&#x27;s definitely not worth the mid $40&#x27;s price tag. The battery life sucks and the \\&quot;precision\\&quot; trimmer is so so. Had i not thrown the original package out by mistake, i would have definitely returned this item. Ended up buying an Andis T Outliner for \\&quot;precision\\&quot; trimming and use the cruzer for trimming (something a cheap trimmer from walmart or kmart can do).

    <li> Over the years, I must have purchased about 10 beard/mustache trimmers. None were perfect, and all were overpriced. Either the rechargeable batteries died after a year or two, the blades didn&#x27;t cut well, the attachments were poorly designed, or they were cheaply made overall. Given the fact that there are so few of these units on the market, one has no choice but to conclude that most men either do not have facial hair, or don&#x27;t demand higher-quality trimmers -- if they did, the companies that make them would need to produce better units. Well, I finally found one that I like -- this Braun has the qualities that I was looking for in a single package. The unit is well-made and well-designed, the motor is strong, the blades are high-quality, the comb attachments are well-designed and easy to remove, the attachment length adjustment setting locks into place and won&#x27;t accidentally move, the battery holds a decent charge, and it isn&#x27;t overpriced. This unit comes with 2 comb attachments, each for a different range of lengths. The markings aren&#x27;t some arbitrary scale, but in mm of hair length. The blades are sharp and high-quality, and can be immersed in water for cleaning. The unit comes with oil to keep the blades lubricated. The locking mechanism for the attachments cannot accidentally move while in use, which is a problem with a lot of other trimmers. The detail trimmer works really well, and allows you to see what you are doing while using it. The unit comes with a decent travel pouch, and the charger is a cable that plugs into the unit, which I like better than being a transformer that it sits in while plugged into the wall -- requiring outlet space which you may not have. It doesn&#x27;t have a vacuum for the hair clippings, and the main blade cannot be easily removed for cleaning, as it pivots on a hinge, but these are minor criticisms given its ease of use and build quality. I used this for the first time yesterday, and am pleased with the job it did as well as the trimmer itself. Recommended.</li>
    <li> The thing always had a weak motor which meant going over the same spot a ton of times... Had it for a little over a year and now the piece which adjust the height of the trimmer has, one-by-one, been breaking and leaving me with big gaps in the amount it touches my face.. I was able to work with missing 1 or 2, but not 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really loose with my money, and even I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Being loose with my money, I won&#x27;t seek out a replacement part. I&#x27;m looking for a new beard/mustache trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to keep my facial hair at the \\&quot;3-day shadow\\&quot; length. Unfortunately, the first setting seems to cut too short, and the second setting seems to cut too long. I&#x27;d like to see a middle length, but I understand Braun&#x27;s intentions of keeping this trimmer as universal as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life is great!&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- Easily adjustable lengths with two different clips&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean and maintain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not an all-metal, super-solid feel&lt;br /&gt;- The fine trimmer on back sometimes caught facial hair while trimming with the main blades... kind of painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. While I just keep my facial hair at the longer length of the second setting, the price and ease of using this trimmer makes it a product worth keeping.</li>
    <li> The name says it all !!! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a new world. Now I alternate between my Schick razor and my new machines. But I may not have to go to the barber any more.</li>
    <li> poor plastic comb .. broken in less than 2 months !!!! Weird&lt;br /&gt;my older Philips trimmer lasts for more than 5 years&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy Philips next time</li>
    <li> It looks as nice as it works.It feels great in your hand doing an awesome job ,just like the braun shaverI have.</li>
    <li> Braun makes top flight personal care products and this one is no different, you can tell the moment you pick it up that it is a cut above the rest.  I used to do a lot of comparison shopping with products of this type, but Braun has gotten so good that I simply do a price check or might briefly look at the competition, then I buy the top of the line Braun product every time.... this, the 790 shaver, they all are actually worth the extra money, which is something you can&#x27;t often say about electrics purchases.  The Cruzer 6 Trimmer is the top of the line trimmer product above the Cruzer 5 and has a bit better construction and comb accessories than the 5.  It also has some kind of &#x27;dual battery&#x27; construction which I don&#x27;t know a lot about.  Points of interest  - Battery lasts a very long time and shines above other trimmers of this type by a mile.. there are complaints on line about it not being replaceable, but my experience is that sealed unit batteries perform so much better than replaceable that I much prefer sealed unit.  - the battery and cutting performance is so good that it&#x27;s actually feasible to replace a 120v hair cutter like a Wahl full size with this.... I was very surprised by this, but it&#x27;s true.  - it&#x27;s very quiet for this type of trimmer and has a very low buzz  - when using the bare blade without the comb, the tip has been finished so that it won&#x27;t scratch / scrape your skin, it&#x27;s very comfortable to cut in hairline on the back of neck etc. and feels smooth when used this way, much better than the rest.  - it is a little smaller and lighter than I expected from the picture, which is good as it&#x27;s very maneuverable etc. but it is still big enough to do large areas quickly.  - there are two comb accessories, a long and a short each adjustable to 6 increments measured in mm.  The short is the most useful and adjusts to 1,3,5,7,9, and 11mm length.  There are release buttons on both sides to completely remove the comb to use as a straight trimmer or put theother comb on for different lengths.  - the trimmer is very effective and cuts through thick hair very easily... so much so that (while I didn&#x27;t try to do so) I could imagine giving and actual all over haircut with it.  There&#x27;s definitely enough battery endurance to do that, it cuts like a champ, and the long comb goes to lengths for tight military haircuts and even a little longer.  - a very minor gripe is that the depth adjustment button can be accidentally pressed during use if you hold it in an unusual way, so there is a slight possibility of shearing off an eyebrow if you are a freak about the way you hold it ;)  - one hint: the curvature of the tip casts a little doubt as to what side of it you put towards the skin, you should look inside the comb to verify which way to hold it until you get used to using it  I mistakenly dropped it about 5 feet onto ceramic tile about an hour after I opened it (of course) and it came through like a champ....  so I genuinely have nothing negative to say about it  enjoy.</li>
    <li> Unhappy after Rowenta trimmer. Too weak, too light and cheep feel. On/Off button is located on the wrong side. Needs removing the comb and cleaning all the time when using it with comb, otherwise doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a head shaver, and it works great to keep just the stubble. Not as wide as I&#x27;d like but it does fine. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great bears trimmer. There are a variety of applications. It&#x27;s simple to use, travels well, and chargers in a snap. I was looking at several products; I&#x27;m happy I spent more $ on the Braun.</li>
    <li> If you want a trimmer that actually clips your hair and doesn&#x27;t just pull it out, I would look at other trimmers. Not what I was expecting from a Braun trimmer.</li>
    <li> well built, quiet operation, trims well. Nicer than previous beard trimmers I owned. Even better if the battery was lithium based, but the current one works well so far.</li>
    <li> i like this trimmer but still its missing something. batteries are very bad... hate to charge it all the time. not satisfied completely</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer!  I cut my husbands hair and this trimmer easily shaved 15 minutes off the process.  Since I don&#x27;t have to stop to dig through our guides looking for a 2 or 4 or whatever, I simply start with the short guide and click it longer as I move up his head and then snap on the longer guide and click that up as I need to do the top.  Done!  It has a great close trimmer for around the ears and side burns, he has facial hair too and it worked great for grooming his short beard and stach combo.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t have a cord when you are shaving, only to recharge.  It is so nice to have more freedom of movement to get the angles right without worry of slapping him in the face with the cord.  When done he wipes it down and puts it back in the carry bag with the other guide and cord.  Neat as a pin in the cupbord too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a number of electric razors over the last few years, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve actually liked. I never wanted a &#x27;fuzz&#x27; trimmer. I&#x27;ve no interest in having a five o&#x27;clock shadow. But this one goes down to the nub, and smoothly. My skin won&#x27;t let me use an electric, or even a slightly dull regular razor. It gets very irritated. But this one doesn&#x27;t produce that.&lt;br /&gt;Like most other &#x27;beard&#x27; trimmers, it really doesn&#x27;t work well on longer hairs. That said, it&#x27;s worth it. VERY well made. Very long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This trimmer fits nicely in the hand. It&#x27;s lightweight, but still feel solid enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried trimming my beard on several length settings, and it did the job smoothly and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two length attachments. One attachment can be adjusted to trim a beard or hair at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 11 mm.  The other can trim at 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is rechargeable, and comes with a removable electrical cord.  It can run either with the cord plugged in, or charged and without the plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this trimmer comes with a compact travel case, into which you can fit the trimmer, cord, and length attachments.</li>
    <li> This is not an electric razor. Don&#x27;t expect it to completely remove a beard or other hair. You can get pretty close, though.     I&#x27;ve used this for a while now, and I can give a more informed opinion. The two sets of trimming blades really only vary by width, so if you are careful, or patient, one becomes relatively superfluous. That said, the tool is useful and can actually be used to cut a person&#x27;s hair, which is not something that I might say about other, similar trimmers.     The battery life is pretty good, and the charging time is reasonably quick.     All told, I consider this a pretty useful trimmer, but more appropriate for cutting the length of hair, rather than removing it entirely. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will allow you to shave, this is not what you&#x27;re looking for.    Harkius</li>
    <li> nice.. not that great for shaping the beard though..... liked  the battery life. would recommend it to my frnds .</li>
    <li> Ir is a really good product, easy to use. This machine is the best for people who spend a lot of time traveling or out of home</li>
    <li> This is a great beard trimmer. Very silent, doesn&#x27;t require too many passes to achieve the desired length and is also very light. The trimmer has sizes 1,3,5,7,9,11 for the beard and 2,4,6,8,10,12 for &#x27;hair&#x27;. The only two cons about this product are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life only last about 2 hours. More than enough for a shave, but you constantly have to recharge it. It takes me about 30 minutes as a bare minimum to shave, usually up to an hour. Reason being is this thing is so silent that power suffers a bit from it. You have to go over the same area at least 3 times before it achieves the desired length. Minor annoyance, but still worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Head trimmer version is just useless. I tried to trim my hair with it but it was taking so long I just decided to use another trimmer. The clip on for the hair trimmer should really be looked at as a clip on for a beard trimmer for men that have much longer beards. Maybe if you just want to do a full shave you could call this a head trimmer, not if you&#x27;d want your hair to be a 4. As a beard trimmer this product is great, for the false advertisement(pretentious advertisement maybe?)I took of one star.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use.  Be careful with the small micro trimmer.  It has grabbed hairs before.  The main trimmer and guards work well.</li>
    <li> This shaver has been now used for 2 months, it is a definite improvement on some of the cheaper shavers out there with its simple attachments and ease of use. However for a very precise cut especially on coarse hair and around corners you may still need something more than the little sliding trimmer. It is useful though for shaping. The guard attachment helped keep the length even but there were a few stray hair that had to be done again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it performs better than some of the cheaper trimmers and has a powerful and quiet motor and the heads are easy to snap on and off, making it easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Works great, does what it was intended for. Had Philips Norelco BG2030 previously and it was much better than that one for grooming and no need to replace the heads if only using it for face.    FYI: this is a groomer not a shaver.</li>
    <li> This beard and head trimmer benefits from easy cleaning (the height adjustor is easily removable, allowing for quick cleaning of the unit) and some outstanding extra features: (1) the precision trimmer allows for quick trims and deft handling of tight spots; (2) the built-in trim height adjustor has multiple settings to allow easy customization and quick changes for areas with different needs (beard, hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It *is* a bit larger than my husband&#x27;s last unit, which makes traveling with it a bit more challenging, but the advantage of having so many features built in (instead of \\&quot;add on\\&quot;) counters that. It&#x27;s easy to keep it together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, the packaging is pretty fun and funky--adds to the overall style of the piece. This unit is primarily in use by my husband, who has midlength straight hair and a goatee, but the packaging caught the eye of my 14-year-old son, too. Savvy marketing for an \\&quot;edgy\\&quot; audience. :)</li>
    <li> What can I say this item never worked it arrived D.O.A. I bought this solely on the several reviews of ladies who said their husbands shaved their heads like I do and they loved it. Customer service at Braun is the worst ever, very rude and not helpful at all. 1st rep say just a minute sir I will put you on hold, 10 minutes later gave up. 2nd rep I explained what happenned with the 1st rep, I apologize for the bad experience, let me try and help you put me on hold 12 minutes later still hadn&#x27;t returned. 3rd attempt asked to speak to a supervisor 8 mintues later a person saying they were a \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; apologized and said how can I help, explained the problem for the 3rd time and was promptly put on hold after 2 minutes came back saying she was still researching 5  mintues after that came back with the brilliant answer will Sir just follow the instructions. Total waste of time. BTW the supervisors english was the worst of all 3 people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.G.</li>
    <li> I love Braun products in general. This was a disappointment. I have dark think beard hair. The trimmer would miss hairs, and I had to go over the same place to many times my skin would become irritated. Not good if you have a thick beard.</li>
    <li> Blades are sharp, product is very light and practical. A useful addition would be what Norelco has, which is a small container to hold the cut hair. Using this, the hair is all over my counter and sink. Besides this, product cuts very well and is washable.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have a good experience with trimmers, for couple of reasons; (1) cordless ones were a nightmare as the batteries lose capacity after a few months of use and trimmer becomes useless and inefficient even with charger plugged in to power, (2) corded ones were heavy and unsuitable for face skin, (3) not too common one - I was looking for a trimmer that can take 110VAC as well as 220VAC as I was traveling overseas once in a while; when I came to know about this one (Braun), I didn&#x27;t expect much of a difference, usually manufacturers would advertise their products as the ultimate solution to all efficiency and versatility shortcomings. Verdict - this product scores fairly well compared to other brands. I cannot judge the batteries yet as I&#x27;ve been using it for a month only, however, the fact that it can work either on batteries or plugged makes it a viable product in addition to being compact as power cord is directly hooked-up in the trimmer, so no charger hassle and less components to deal with. Its good grip surface finish makes it very ergonomic. Being compact and offering slide-in out precision trimmer is also well suited for face trimming. Other cool features I like is the on-off push button and the water washable. Last is price that is very reasonable compared to overall product design and features.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent trimmer at a great price. I used to have to go over my beard again and again to trim but now I am trimmed in one pass.  Time saver &#x3D; Money saver.</li>
    <li> Good luck finding this in any store (talking about buying a 6). Looked all over. 6 is soooo much better. Why you ask, well because the battery charge time is 1 hour not 8 as compared to the 5. I&#x27;m not kidding, it takes 8 hours to charge the 5. So just buy the 6 but you will only find it online. This is a great trimmer for all body parts not just the head. I used it all over even down there. Not good for clean shaving and you will not find one that is so just use a razor if you want something clean saved. Who saves their body anymore? Year 2000. Just keep everything trimmed is the way to go.</li>
    <li> These are my husbands comments, obviously!  it&#x27;s one of the best you can buy!!  It never fails, it stays sharp, the charge lasts a long time, easy to clean</li>
    <li> I got this Braun Cruzer for my husband birthday and after reading all reviews i decided for this one, and my hubby loves it he just need it for trimmer and the he shaves with a regular razor,so far so good: )</li>
    <li> For me it&#x27;s just ok.  I use it for beard trimming and it&#x27;s not smooth when it goes across my face.  Sometimes it feels like it&#x27;s bouncing and I move it slow and deliberately.  I&#x27;m not real fond of the design.  It&#x27;s a bit bulky compared to the one I replaced.</li>
    <li> It charges quickly, performs for a loooong time on one charge, and cuts cleanly without pulling.  I say that as someone with a very dense and coarse heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to free-hand the area under the nose, the guard head is just way too thick to get in there.  Other than that, it&#x27;s all no-muss no-fuss trimming that takes about two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very, very easy to clean. It can be wet cleaned, but I haven&#x27;t found that necessary.  I just brush it out after each use and I&#x27;ve hit it with canned air a time or two to get stubborn hairs stuck in the internal spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only one complaint - I wish the small trimmer attachment didn&#x27;t run when retracted.  I&#x27;ve tagged myself with it a couple times while using aggressive angles.  Yes, I&#x27;ve learned to avoid doing that, but there&#x27;s no reason it couldn&#x27;t either have its own guard or run only when extended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to speak to durability, but it certainly seems rugged and well constructed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Braun Cruzer three times so far to trim my hair short (1/8 inch or so). I had been paying a barber $8 every two weeks to do the same, so I&#x27;m saving $16 per month. It takes me about 10 minutes. I like that the cord comes off for trimming. I charge it between each trim so I don&#x27;t know how long it holds a charge. I don&#x27;t need to clean it; I just blow the hair out. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I just got mine and am so excited. Since it is new, nothing has gone wrong that I need to complain. It is my first time getting a trimmer of any sort and in my opinion, the Cruzer is more than up to the task. Cuts my hair well and I am able to define my beard well. Highly recommended. It is a high quality buy. The color looks fancy too. Definitely very sleek and suitable for travel as well.</li>
    <li> Works great for a beard trimmer.  The only con is that the increments skip 4 and 6 mm, so I make do with 5 and 7mm.</li>
    <li> I chose this trimmer because out of all the trimmers out there, this one seemed to have more consistently higher reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the negative reviews for this trimmer are correct:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  The trimmer is not powerful enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned that, from day one, was unable to cut my beard. It&#x27;s not even that my beard is really thick and hard to trim. No other trimmer has ever had a problem, even the cheap $20 trimmers. I literally have to make 10-20 passes over the same area to get all the hair trimmed. It&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  The plastic guard is way too flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer gives you a very uneven trim. Even if you try to go easy on the trimmer and not press it against your face very hard, it still comes out uneven since it&#x27;s impossible to apply the exact same pressure at the exact same angle the entire time. You&#x27;re going to end up with some shallow areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that you do not purchase this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says, I use it to trim my bear and I also use it to shorten the length of my hair. Even my dad is using it now, so it is worth the money and definitely a great product.</li>
    <li> This gives my husband the perfect length on his beard. Keeps him from looking like a shaggy Civil War soldier, but also doesn&#x27;t trim him so short that his beard is patchy. Compact, lightweight, and functions perfectly so far (weekly trims for a few months).</li>
    <li> I received the product I ordered but original box is ripped and dusty.  I think this item was previously used or it is refurbished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this seller to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Braun Cruzer 6 for about 1 week now, and I have to say that I&#x27;m about as happy as a person can get with a beard trimmer. I have a beard that grows very fast, thick and easily can get out of order and painful/itchy within 2 or 3 days. I prefer to have a 5 O&#x27;Clock Shadow style for my beard and had trouble attaining that look with other beard trimmers. But not with the Braun Cruzer 6! Not only is it effortless to achieve my specified look, I can mow through much faster with this than any other beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, with NO PAIN or pulled hairs. It&#x27;s extremely easy to clean and maintain as well.  The mechanical operation of the razors seems pretty solid too. The trimmer is decently quite and when turning it on, it doesn&#x27;t instantly \\&quot;jerk\\&quot; into operation with a clunky sound like other trimmers I&#x27;ve used. Also, the trimmer has a nice feel in my hand and I notice myself using/holding it like a pen. Its very light, but not in a cheap way.   I highly recommend this for any man that has a fast, thick growing beard with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The problem with this trimmer is it LOOKS like it should be awesome.  The fit is right in your hand and the features seem to be what you need.  My last trimmer could not be washed, so quick rinse was out of the question.  My major issue with this trimmer is it cuts hair unevenly.  Assuming your beard hair is not all facing once direction, you will have a hard time getting the clipper to cut to the length you want to, even when the hair is obviously sticking up.  The other issue is the battery affects the clippers performance if (I&#x27;m estimating since there is no battery display) once it drops below 80%.  Plugging it in while you shave will not solve the problem.  I&#x27;m not sure what the real issue is mechanically, but it&#x27;s as if the motor starts to tire after leaving it on for 5 minutes or so.  The effect is pretty drastic and leaves uneven patches in my beard.  Seeing the effects on my beard, I wouldn&#x27;t dare use it on my head.  With very close cuts, cutting evenly matters.  The precision editor is not very effective for precise cuts because the head sticks just past the larger cutting head. If you&#x27;re trying to work precisely, you&#x27;re always trying to manage the larger head either visually (it&#x27;s in the way) or attempting to not cut with the wrong head (it still runs but at a lower buzz, but hair can get caught/stuck and pull which is annoying to deal with.)  This clipper was a step up from the off-the-shelf discount brand I bought years ago, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver what it promises.  For the price, you&#x27;re not going to kick yourself.  But if you need effective beard management, this is not the tool for you.</li>
    <li> Bought it as gift and asked my husband for a review. He said, \\&quot;I like it so far, so give it a 5.\\&quot; For me it is compact takes up less space than the old one and it is attractive. I noticed his beard looked great too!</li>
    <li> Does all that I expected.  Good for trimming mustaches, beards and body hair.  Have not tried it for haircuts yet.</li>
    <li> Worst trimmer ever. Waste of money. Doesnt cut hair and gets clogged. Terrible product, I highly recommend wahl. Used this once and through it away.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is the best I have ever used.  The battery lasts for several beard trims, and the unit is extremely solid-feeling.  The guide is designed so that it won&#x27;t pop down to a lower level while you&#x27;re pressing on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like much about this trimmer is that there are not many shorter settings.  I try to go for the rough/unshaven look, and I would have liked about 4 settings in the span between flush and level 2.  Still, the pros far outweigh this single con.  Buy this trimmer, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for a Norelco Maverick, which after many years (and one battery replacement), died. The Braun was one of the more expensive alternatives but I am very happy with it because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It uses NiMH (nickel metal hydride) batteries. Hard to determine this -- surprisingly, the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t say on the website or the Amazon listing. But now that I have the device, the recycling label confirms it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a big factor, as NiMH batteries should last a lot longer than the more commonly used (and much cheaper) NiCd. (Batteries on all these shavers are not replaceable but if you&#x27;re handy and can solder, you can open it up and replace them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Instead of multiple heads and parts, it uses adjustable heads to change depth (one head for close, one for longer trimming). Easy and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Great build quality -- solid, feels very durable, all working parts move easily and solidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Great features. Certainly does everything I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Two year satisfaction guarantee removes risk in ordering this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dropped rating a star because one minor negative became more negative. A plastic prong broke off the head. Still usable with care, and no worries, it has a two year guarantee. But good luck getting customer service. The Braun website is a mess. Found the e-mail us link (not easy-- they try to send me to an appliance repair place in San Francisco, 45 miles away). The e-mail form wanted birthdate. Wha? I entered something goofy and found it won&#x27;t let you e-mail them if they think you&#x27;re under a certain age. And it flushes the form so you have to start over. &amp;#$%@!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally succeeded in sending an e-mail to Customer Service -- we will see if they handle the issue.</li>
    <li> I have had this saver for about 3 months now.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon wont replace it after 30 days and braun will not assist in replacing the shaver head as the small shaver head plastic clip snapped apart and not from hard use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would think that you are buying from a manjor razor company and amazon the would have a better ploicy on breakage.&lt;br /&gt;All I wanted was a replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;Braun has lost me as a customer due to the lack of customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the break the shaver work OK but I would not asy anthing more than just ok.&lt;br /&gt;Dont think that just cuz it has the name Braun on it that it is a superior razor.</li>
    <li> 12/02/13: 5 Star rating is based on item received as described but since it is a gift for Christmas, product review/performance has not yet been determined.</li>
    <li> Lousy.  From the first charge it sounds like it is about to die.  Clippers move so slowly that you have to trim your beard in super slo-mo and keep hitting same area in order to trim.  Oiling the clippers didn&#x27;t provide any improvement.  I had the braun cruzer 6 face shaver previously and liked it very much until the guard broke off.  Because they didn&#x27;t offer a replacement part it became useless.  I got the beard and head trimmer because i didn&#x27;t use the electric shaver function of the other model.  But the trimmer on the new model isn&#x27;t nearly as good.  It was a total waste.</li>
    <li> Use it for beard/mustach trimming.  Works fine...</li>
    <li> Better tool than my past two.  Something about the angles trims my stache better.</li>
    <li> Good basic beard, head trimmer.  Unusually slow though.  I&#x27;ve not bought one of these before, so all beard &amp; head trimmers may be slow, but it just seems like you have to go back and forth a lot, no matter which setting you&#x27;re on.  Solid unit though and you can take in the shower with you.  Maybe loses it&#x27;s charge a little quick though, too.</li>
    <li> This thing was great at first but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Overall construction is cheap. Comb broke right away.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended for trimming, specially if you like the look of short carefully trimmed hair in your face ;) The trimmer has good blades and a soft rubber finish on the edge that provides a smooth feeling when trimming -- I upgraded to this from a pretty cheap-feeling Phillips trimmer and the difference is huge. I don&#x27;t get that big dry skin sensation afterwards anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a little less noisy than other trimmers I&#x27;ve had (or heard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts for about three full face trims for me (I don&#x27;t have too much facial hair anyway), but charging takes just one hour, so I think it&#x27;s also convenient for traveling (just took it to a trip to Europe).</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor after reading way too many reviews.  (So, I thought I would write one.)  I replaced my Wahl beard trimmer with the Braun.  Overall, I liked my Wahl better; however, this is not a bad choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: This razor includes a locking, multi-level trim guard.  This is far superior to my other trimmers who had up to 10 individual guards of which I had to keep track.  The guard stays in place nicely and does a good job of keeping an even cut.  The razor charges nicely and works well on the cord or off of it.  (Note to new users: You have to keep pushing the cord in until you feel the \\&quot;click\\&quot;.  It took me way too long to figure this out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: Occasionally the blades feel more like they are pulling a few hairs not cutting them.  Unsheathed, the razor does not provide a super close cut.  Other electric razors do a much better job of cutting through a beard to prep for a shave.  Event with a 3-4 day beard I had difficulty cutting down to an acceptable length to use a straight razor.  I use a Wahl head trimmer to \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; my head.  I have not had enough faith in the product to try it on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short: This is a great trimmer.  It does better than any other I&#x27;ve tried at doing everything.  Other trimmers do a better job at cutting close, but this one does quite well at trimming a beard.</li>
    <li> Product came very quickly. I opened the package I tested the device and discovered that is inside another person&#x27;s hair! I immediately contacted customer service and they returned the money I paid.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. Holds a charge for a very long time also. I would recommend this product to anyone as I feel its worth the price for what it does.</li>
    <li> Pros: Everything since competitors do NOT have anything similar to this since my 10+ year old Norelco 8800 died&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Power is a bit lacking&lt;br /&gt;2. As others have mentioned, it would be nice to have more setting options that retain its accuracy&lt;br /&gt;3. As others have mentioned, the edges of the clips can be sharp</li>
    <li> Used it to trim my beard and had no problems with it. Packaging was great however could have been sharper and utilize more combs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer after being swayed by other reviews. I am sure, that, like many of you, you have tried many other trimmers. I am guilty of this too! I was tired of changing AA batteries two to three times a month. I decided to give The Braun Cruzer 6 a try. I must admit, it wasn&#x27;t the lowest priced trimmer, but, you definitely get what you pay for. This trimmer has more than exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my key observations;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No more battery changes (very convenient, rechargeable battery, charger included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Powerful motor (much more power, than, a single AA powered unit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Adjustable trimmer guides (two guides are supplied, one for \\&quot;close\\&quot; trimming and the other one handles the higher settings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Ergonomically designed (feels very comfortable while using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. \\&quot;Rubberized\\&quot; body sides (good control, doesn&#x27;t slip while using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Comes with a zippered pouch, that, holds everything! (trimmer, both guides, charger and supplied maintenance items {lubricating oil and a cleaning brush})&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I can only say, that, this is the BEST trimmer, that, I have ever purchased, it is powerful and I get over 2 weeks of battery life, no beard, just mustache and side-burn trimming!</li>
    <li> The product is really good and I really liked it. This has many settings which I was expecting and can make many styles with the Braun trimmer.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t do this, but this shaver has been so crappy, i felt I had to tell the people of Amazon about this. This really is just a stubble shaver if you&#x27;re looking for that...I&#x27;ve had trimmers that have gotten closer than this(Andis trimmers)...For the money it&#x27;s not worth it, With the precision shaver, that&#x27;s the only good thing about it. If it didn&#x27;t have a precision trimmer, i would of sent it back a long time ago. Either way, I don&#x27;t know how long people like to shave, but i&#x27;d rather it not take me 45 to an hour. I don&#x27;t know if mine is defected, but at this point if won&#x27;t even hold a charge! Everytime I use it unplugged, it starts flashing red. Even when i have it plugged in, it&#x27;s always flashing green so I would assume it&#x27;s charging...NO it&#x27;s not charging...As soon as I get paid, i&#x27;m gonna go to a Family Dollar and buy a Gillette Trimmer for 18 Bucks...Then after that, i&#x27;m gonna make a video of me sledge-hammering this thing to death...I HATE IT...i&#x27;ve had it for almost a year, so this is a real review...I had my thoughts when I first started using it and thought it would pan out...But i was wrong and i will probably never buy another Braun product as long i&#x27;m on this Earth.</li>
    <li> Braun Cruzer 6 beard and head trimmer:-&lt;br /&gt;Why Braun ever stopped producing a trimmer like this for sale in the UK I don&#x27;t know.It is brilliant! An update of their first venture into beard trimmers during the 1970&#x27;s. Works a treat. Shame I had to purchase from USA and not UK. Braun needs to have a serious re-think!! The unit is \\&quot;Just what the doctor ordered\\&quot;!!</li>
    <li> Upadate 12/13/2012:&lt;br /&gt;The battery life has now degraded to the point wher I can get 1 (one) 3-4 minute trim of my goatee.  When I turn the trimmer off, the indicator light indicates (flashing red LED/light) that a recharge is necesary.  Essenially, I am forced to keep this item plugged in constantly.  My old Wahl trimmer that this Braun replaced holds a charge longer!&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I like the trimmer with the exception of the battery life. I can get 2-3 trims (maybe 5 minutes each) of my goatee, and then it needs recharging. No where near what they advertise in the product literature.</li>
    <li> My favorite old beard trimmer finally died and I chose this one as a replacement. Very happy with this one. The plastic trimmer guard had several depth adjustments and the push-up trimmer is very handy for small areas. The plastic guard is removeable. It&#x27;s a bit fiddly to put it back on, but once on it stays on and the depth adjustment stays the same. One of the happiest features is the coiled cord and small power supply built into the plug. MUCH better than some big ol&#x27; power supply brick that is unsightly. There&#x27;s plenty of power in this unit -- never felt like it was struggling to do it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> It was for my grandson and he said it is fabulous.</li>
    <li> Great looking package, made of solid plastics and the metals look quality and built to last. It does a great job cutting through my near yeti fur beard and never hesitates. Comes with a great selection of edges for different lengths. built-in mini trimmer is a novelty, although it could be handy for trimming mustache edges it&#x27;s a feature I doubt I&#x27;ll use, and that&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s enough of a quality item for me to not care about that. Battery charging is good, only time will tell how it stands up. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It works very well for my beard. Highly recommended for beard trimming. I would buy any Braun products. They all are well designed to my experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many beard trimmers over the years, but I have to stay this was the worst, by a long shot. It doesn&#x27;t hold its charge even close to as long as it&#x27;s supposed to, it gets clogged way too easily, and finally wore down after only a little over a year. Horrible product, especially considering its price. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very poor battery performance. Needs to be charged after every use (slows down by the second use). The detail trimmer does not come out to a length that is convenient to use. Other than that, it cuts hair adequately and travels well enough (besides needing to charge so often). The only really positive thing I can say about it is that it is a good looking shaver, this is not very important for a shaver...</li>
    <li> The pro&#x27;s of this product include being lightweight, which makes its easy and less tiresome to use and also that it is cord free.  No more extension cord getting wrapped, hooked, or tangled with other products on the counter.  In comparison to other trimmers, this product is very safe.  It truly seems impossible to cut yourself and that is even without making use of the blade guard.  It is able to cut very precise lines and the trimmer height adjustment makes it simple to perform taper and fading of short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con&#x27;s of this product include that the motor is underpowered.  The device requires frequent cleaning.  Hair gets caught in cutting blades and during a single haircut (military-style) short hair the blade had to be cleaned approx. 6 times.  This caused a lot of stopping and starting to provide cleaning maintenance during cut/trimming.  It was also more difficult to trim hair around ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all:  This is a more ideal product for beard trimming rather than cutting short head hair.  If this is the purchasers main purpose, it is an excellent product.  If you&#x27;re hoping to have a more universal tool that can perform both tasks (beard and head), this might not be the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This particular trimmer was used to cut very short (military-style) head hair of normal thickness.</li>
    <li> The unit feels comfortable to hold - neither too big nor too small. It also exudes elegant quality, with a nice finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to go wrong with this unit - the hair comb fits into place easily, and the adjustment of length is simplicity itself. All in all, a really intuitive and functional device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just a tad bit delicate when it comes to trimming - possibly because of its dual role as a beard trimmer - which made it take a lot longer than usual to get my hair trimmed. Impressively, it had enough charge for a head trimming session, right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is really easy because it is completely waterproof. The only challenge is the tiny bottle of oil that you have to squirt into all the right places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Trimming!</li>
    <li> Much like you are doing right now, I poured over hundreds of reviews on numerous trimmers before I settled on one.  I chose the Braun 6 Head and Beard trimmer and am very satisfied with my choice.  Short review:  Lightweight, Low vibrations, Low noise, cuts very well, short charge time, attached retractable small/narrow trimmer, can trim while plugged in, and covers a wide hair length range.  The price is very good compared to how nice and versatile this trimmer is. Originally I was looking for a more affordable item, but the reviews urged me to spend a little more.  Very thick, longer hair will clog up the trimmer quickly, so removing the comb and dumping the hair is required. It&#x27;s a minor inconvenience at best. Definate recommend.  Long review:  When I read reviews, I read the bad ones first.  Most of them said the same thing and they were far outweighed by the positive reviews.  I trim/shave most of the regions on my body, and I will cover each area at a time.  First, the trimmers are very lightweight which is nice when trimming your head with lifted arms for an extended periods of time.  Compared to most other trimmers (especially plug in versions) the vibration and noise are nominal.  The body is plastic and half of it is rubberized for improved grip.  The trimmer fits well in your hand and is laid out very well.  Unlike the Braun 5, the Braun 6 has a shorter charge time once you perform the initial charge.  The indicator light does a great job of letting you know the state of your charge as well, both charging and discharging.  My body hair ranges from very coarse and wirey, to very thin and light.  I did not have one single hair pull/snag.  The hardest part of using the trimmer is figuring out what length setting to use!  The trim length guide is clearly marked and will not jump out of the setting.  There are two detachable combs. One gives you lengths from 1 to 10 millimeters, and the other gives you from 10 to 20 millimeters.  Not using a comb at all will give you a very close to the skin trim.  The Braun 6 also has a retractable, narrow-head secondary trimmer.  This smaller trimmer is great for reaching small and narrow areas, such as under the nose and around the top of the ears, among others.  The comb prongs, although they are plastic, are pretty stiff and keep skin out, and hair cuts level with very little comb bending or deflection.  As with most plastic appliances, you should take care to not be rough with the trimmer, the combs particularly.  A reasonable level of care will yield many years of use out of this trimmer.  I dropped mine from a four foot shelf after its first use, and it still works just fine (whew!).  The trimmer comes with a small travel case and the charger has a curled cord so it doesnt tangle up if you are trimming while plugged in.  I tested using the trimmer while plugged in with a very low battery. It ran at full strength, which is a very nice feature instead of having to wait for the charge.  Charge time for the Braun 6 is 1 hour.  My sessions are between 30-40 minutes and it was still running strong at the end.  Goatee:  My facial hair is very thick, coarse, and wire-like!  The Braun 6 cut it all quickly with ease. My facial hair curls a little and some of those can be tricky to get all one length, so I recommend using a fine tooth comb to get the hair as straight as possible for an even cut.    Head hair:  My hair up top is very thick and straight.  I wear a military &#x27;high and tight&#x27; hair style. The trimmer cuts very quickly and efficiently.  It took only a couple passes to get everything even and at the proper length.  The only fault I found is that thick hair will clog up the area between the blades and the comb.  I did need to stop every several passes to remove the comb and dump the hair clump. It only did this on the longer hair on top of my head, not the sides or elsewhere on my body.  The advantage is that I could dump the hair clumps where I wanted instead of it going everywhere, like with regular clippers.  Chest hair:  My chest hair is fairly wirey.  Once again, no issues with cutting here.  Pubic region:  Let&#x27;s face it, tons of people trim that area and will do so with these clippers.  Pubic hair is normally fairly coarse and curly,as is mine.  Even on extremely soft and delicate skin, there were no dreaded hair snags.  Also, the comb prongs do a very good job of preventing skin from making contact with the cutting blades. Of course you should always trim with caution down there to prevent unwanted contact, especially on skin that folds easily. The small size of the trimmer makes reaching certain areas very easy and less awkward.  I know that when I get home from overseas, my wife will steal this trimmer and use it for her trimming!  Underarms:  My underarm hair is very light and thin.  This was the only area that I had some difficulty getting an even cut.  Due to the hair being so light, it didn&#x27;t want to be guided into the comb prongs and into the blades.  If you have hair like this over larger areas, you may need to make many passes to get a good, even cut.  As you can tell, I am pleased with my purchase.  The only unknown now is long-term life span.  If I can get 2 years out of this trimmer, I will feel as if I got my money&#x27;s worth.  I have no reason to believe the trimmer won&#x27;t go well beyond that time frame.</li>
    <li> I have had this electric razor or \\&quot;Trimmer\\&quot; for several months now.  I have given two haircuts every two weeks and occassional trims without a hitch.  The guides stay on, the blades and motor are quiet and clean easily. I have zero complaints and would recommend whole-heartedly if you are a do-it-yourselfer!! Just remember... for it to last, you have to clean and oil the blades each time!!    All the best,    Jay</li>
    <li> Been using it for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s working wonderfully - trimming the beard at whatever length the season demands. The attachments seemed a bit delicate (plastic) but having treated it gently - including a good bit of suitcase travel - in reality it has held up flawlessly without any problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recharge function is quick and complete. I can get about 3 weeks out of a charge, using it 1-2x weekly. Ergnomically it&#x27;s really well designed, easy to manipulate and operate. Comes in a nice case that is perfect for travel. And it opens up to be brushed out/cleaned quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I lost this one I&#x27;d get another - in fact - maybe I should by a spare before they discontinue this model!</li>
    <li> it is rather small for trimming your hair (the head) and doesnt seem very sharp and is probably under-powered. i will give it a few more charges and see if that improves its performance.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean, but doesn&#x27;t cut well around chin contours and need too many passes to do a great job.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome trimmer.  I use it for trimming my beard once a week.  Once a month I use it to trim other areas.  Works great.  Battery lasts a long time and charges fairly quickly (about 2 hrs).  Now my son wants one too ...</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after thorough research and deliberations over all the options at my disposal, and I thought I had narrowed it down to the one best fit for what I was looking for. I shave with my Merkur safety razor so I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything to provide a really close shave, as I handle that the old-fashioned way, which despite all these 8-blade razors or &amp;#34;Pulsonic&amp;#34; electric razor technologies, is still the best and most efficient way. I purchased the Braun Cruzer 6 because I wanted the best possible product to maintain and shape the &amp;#34;chin strap&amp;#34; type of beard that I had going. A sharp and clean shave along the jawline, as well as keeping it trimmed to a respectable length was all I needed. Hindsight is 20/20, so if you&#x27;re looking for anything that fits the description of what I was looking for, take heed to this review and don&#x27;t make the same mistake that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it seemed that the product was sufficient, although I immediately noticed that it wasn&#x27;t providing the precise trimming that I was looking for. I figured the little extension precision trimmer would meet my needs in the detailing department, but it did not. In fact, it would&#x27;ve been less painful dry-shaving against the grain with a straight-edge razor. It did well when I placed the attachment on and I will give it credit for the number of length adjustments it had. I clicked it on the setting that was right for me and it provided the well-trimmed finish that I wanted. I understand that it was marketed as a beard and head trimmer first and foremost, but the description made it sound as though it was the best of both worlds. Unfortunately, this razor isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; of anything. In fact, that word doesn&#x27;t even exist in the world that the Cruzer 6 exists in. I&#x27;ve been rather civil up to this point, but now I&#x27;m going to reveal the way this excuse for a razor has made me feel inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to make this easy for you. The world is full of many extremely diverse and unique people whose needs and preferences vary greatly. So I&#x27;m going to list the potential reasons that one would want to purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a Braun Cruzer 6 Beard &amp; Head Trimmer if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You absolutely love charging electric razors. If nothing excites you more than constantly having to plug your charger into the&lt;br /&gt;  wall, this is the one for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You enjoy the feeling of small metal serrations tugging at your hair when you try shaping your beard and ripping it off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You want an electric razor that contains a precision-trimming extension whose sole purpose in life is to painfully rip hair from your&lt;br /&gt;  face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You want a razor that loses it&#x27;s ability to trim hair within a year of owning it. Even if you apply lubricating oil, the Cruzer 6 won&#x27;t let&lt;br /&gt;  you down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review may seem nothing more than a biased submission from a disgruntled owner, but I have learned all of these facts the hard way. I maintained my Cruzer 6 perfectly and it still looks the way it did when I first removed it from the box (Oh the expectations that were so soon to be dissolving in failure). The precision extension never really did much since day 1. But after maybe a year of owning it, it has been rendered useless to me. I&#x27;ve tried using different angles, flipping sides...it doesn&#x27;t matter. No matter how you apply it to the hair you wish to trim, it grips it and rips it. From reading the product description, I thought for sure the battery life was going to be a great quality. Not so much. Nay, not at all. It can be left on the charger until it reaches full capacity, chances are, within the next two times (if not the very next time) you go to use it, you&#x27;ll be greeted by a nice little flashing red light. If you don&#x27;t plug your razor back into the wall immediately after you&#x27;re done using it and leave it to charge, you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This concludes my review of the Braun Cruzer 6. I&#x27;m not a newbie to shaving who doesn&#x27;t know how to maintain a razor. I was in the Marine Corps for over 4 years where I shaved every day of my life. I&#x27;ve tried the expensive electric razors like the &amp;#34;Pulsonic&amp;#34; that supposedly provides a skin-close shave, I&#x27;ve used disposable razors, safety razors, straight-edged razors, water-less shaving gel, expensive shaving creams...So this wasn&#x27;t my first rodeo. I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews on anything I buy, but when something makes me unusually upset and disappointed in, I create a review to (1) seek justice against the product that betrayed me, and (2) make it public so others will hopefully not purchase it and learn the hard way like myself. However, if this razor does sound like the one for you, then have at it. Because I assure you, everything I&#x27;ve listed here WILL happen. And if that&#x27;s the case, I have a Braun Cruzer 6 in great shape for sale.</li>
    <li> I waited until I had used the Braun Cruzer 6 for an extended period of time before submitting a review - especially given the concerns of other reviewers on the longevity of any rechargeable battery shaver/trimmer.  You really cannot tell for a while how long those internal rechargeable batteries will provide a reasonably good charge.  Also, although not beastly in size, this is a pretty good size machine that is easily as big as most cordless shavers.  I have been using the Braun Cruzer 6 for about five months now, and the rechargeable battery in this device is the best I have ever had a comparable device.  So enough about the battery life, how good is it?  Although this is not a high-priced device, I have generally gone with less expensive beard trimmers.  I have a full beard, but do not otherwise use the Braun Cruzer 6 for hair trimming/cutting.  I would think that those seeking a military or brush cut hair trimmer would want a wider head on the device - that would make it less maneuverable, effective and desirable as beard trimmer, in my opinion.  For my purposes, the trimmer head is about perfect.  It is wider than the beard trimmers I previously used, but not so big as to complicate the maneuvering required for trimming beards and mustaches.  It has a good ergonomic feel, although if you&#x27;ve used different devices it may take a little time to get acclimated to the positions of the power and hair comb length settings.  After a week or so, you should be comfortable with the layout.  The performance is very precise and very consistent - as one would expect from a Braun product. It is simple to use effectively.  The unique design places the hair length settings on the removable comb itself, not the body of the trimmer.  This greatly reduces problems with inadvertently changing that setting when the comb is removed to do edging around the beard and mustache.  Since there are two hair comb attachments provided, people who frequently use two settings can even set oneon each.  Although absolutely unimportant to me, I will concede that the attachments look sort of cool the way they appear to float over the cutter head. The \\&quot;sliding precision trimmer,\\&quot; aside from reminding me of the small head shooting out from the beast in Alien, didn&#x27;t do much for me.  I use the main cutter head when I need that sort of detail.  I won&#x27;t ding them for this, since I note other users have had success with it, and we all have different conditions to deal with.   Overall, this product does everything I want very well, specific to the task of beards and mustaches.  I will leave it to others to determine how it stacks up against other products intended to handle everything else.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas present for my fiancee. He sports the stubble beard look and has been using a POS little one for about 5 years. I got him this because he shaves his head regularly and I absolutely detest those plug in ones with 20 attachments. This is a perfect all in one shaver for a guy who shaves his head and has a stubble beard. It feels great in your hand, very lightweight but durable, and works very well. It did pull his hair when he was shaving the thicker part, but he has very course, thick hair. It looked great when it was done.  All in all, it is the perfect all in one tool for manscaping. You won&#x27;t regret getting it.</li>
    <li> I dont get the clean shave, The blade get heat up very quick. I want to buy something which give me better shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of electric shavers -- beard and otherwise -- many more expensive than this one. It, however, does a better job than any of others. Because of its size and number of features, it&#x27;s good for traveling. Perfect, it&#x27;s not, but it is good.</li>
    <li> Beard and Head Trimmer was exactly what I was looking for.  Does a great job on a thick and full beard.</li>
    <li> ++ trimmers work well, battery seems fresh, one hour charge time, compact size&lt;br /&gt;-- $$$ too much, charging cord connection could be improved&lt;br /&gt;comments added 3/10/14......worked great but did not pass drop test.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for another brand of trimmer that died. Braun makes top of the line products and this is no exception. This is a good trimmer, it is comfortable to hold, feels well made and charges very quickly. It comes with two separate comb attachments that have multiple length settings and are easy to change. It works great on my beard and body hair but I have tried it on my head yet. The trimmer cuts the hair length evenly, giving you a clean cut look, like it was done by a professional. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I love this little shaver.  Has lots of different depth settings so you can trim to different lengths.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and works great in the shower.  The only downside is that mine died after just 18 months.  BUT - I like how it shaves so much I bought another - this time with the Squaretrade 3 year warranty.  If it were more durable, it&#x27;d be a 5 star rating for sure.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming my beard, also really good at precision edging</li>
    <li> Really nice actually, the bear comb works good it does not change while you are using it. Haven&#x27;t used the hair combo yet, I&#x27;m a little bit scare about cutting my hair myself.&lt;br /&gt;The precision trimer ir really good, it helps to give shape to the bear and clear the edges. If you use the normal trimer with no comb it does not cut really short, you really need the precision one to have a nice look, that&#x27;s the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like that much.&lt;br /&gt;It is not heavy so it is easy to use it and it feels good when you are holding it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for trimming the groin area and works good as well, but don&#x27;t recommend it for the most sensitive areas (balls).&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a case with some oil and a small brush too keep it clean. Nice for traveling or even storage it at home.</li>
    <li> Great product from Braun as usual, works as expected, though I will be very careful ditaching the blade as the latch section look a little flimsy, can be used anywher in the world by just putting in a plug adapter, the charger remains the same...great</li>
    <li> really good trimmer..&lt;br /&gt;It does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would have preferred for the side trimmer to be completely detachable as it sometimes irritates,&lt;br /&gt;but overall nice shave.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my brother for Christmas. After some mishaps trying to figure out which number razor worked best, he loves it!</li>
    <li> Great, but the guard slips at times…be careful.</li>
    <li> Basically failed after a month of use. I have to have it plugged in while trimming. Not the most accurate as the high end foil trimmers. Then again you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Limited settings: 1mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, etc.  (Some trimmers go: 1mm, 1.5mm, 2mm, 2.5mm, etc.)  There&#x27;s a big difference between 1mm and 3mm.  Also, depending on how you grab the trimmer, it&#x27;s possible to accidentally change the setting mid-swipe. Hello, bald spot. Have owned two of these -- neither has lasted more than a year.  Same thing broke both times: the plastic teeth on the blue cutting head.  Can&#x27;t be cheaply replaced.  Am now buying another brand.</li>
    <li> The best!&lt;br /&gt;Super smooth and effective</li>
    <li> Worthless. Braun should refund all purchases!!! Better won&#x27;t last longer than 2min after a month. Attachments broke in first month also. Small trimmer scratches so much it hurts to use! Stay away.</li>
    <li> The beard trimmer works great, the unit looks and feels nice as well, and the battery life and charging times are as advertised.  Unfortunately I purchased the unit because it had the built in precision trimmer... this is where I dock the star and a half. The pop out trimmer is very difficult to use because it does not pop out far enough from the main body and it can be tough to see exactly what you&#x27;re doing, especially when you&#x27;re trying to create straight, well defined lines.  Also - it just doesn&#x27;t cut very well... not enough power is transferred to it when you turn it on, and it ends up pulling on my facial hair quite often.  My wife even tried to use it to trim my neck line after I shaved my head (used my whal for the actual shave) and noticed that it just plain sucks as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Braun - if you&#x27;re going to include the trimmer, you might as well make it functional.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get how people can vote this less than 4 stars. I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 months now, probably twice a month, and this is just perfect. The cruzer let&#x27;s you shave every single hair anywhere on your body and it only takes a single charge (which takes about an hour to fully charge) to do it all. It&#x27;s waterproof, so easy cleaning. Lightweight, small. What else do you want more?</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Cut hair and beard reasonably well at first.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasted the whole cut at first.&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable cutting lengths with only 2 combs&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Works in any country so is good for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Each month the battery lost more of its reserve, despite following the manufacturer&#x27;s advice of running down completely each use, which for me was about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;After a few months the battery died, making the device useless.&lt;br /&gt;The cord does not stay plugged in, making it almost impossible to use without the battery.&lt;br /&gt;Even holding the cord in place, the shaver still dies after a moment because the battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;The teeth in the comb break fairly easily - the plastic is fairly flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Not very powerful - can pull hair rather than cut because it&#x27;s not powerful enough, so needs care to use.&lt;br /&gt;Noisy compared to others I&#x27;ve tried, though not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a beard and head shaver/clipper, so like many others read the reviews and ordered this Braun from Amazon. At it&#x27;s price I expected better performance than cheap clippers, so was disappointed to find the above faults which rendered it impractical, and finally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it&#x27;s not worth the money, as cheap clippers would probably have done just as well for a lot less money. I&#x27;ve since ordered an Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper from Amazon, which only works up to 120 volt, so is not good for travel as it has no battery. Although I&#x27;ve only used it once, this clipper performs faster, more quietly, and seems much more durable than the Braun Cruzer 6. I&#x27;ll probably write a review of it when I&#x27;ve had it some time, but for now, everything about it speaks of a durable product that will last for decades, even if the US-made technology is outdated compared to what&#x27;s available in the UK, Europe, Japan, etc, e.g. the Panasonic beard trimmer I bought in 1998, lasted until I dropped and broke it last year - 15 years of faultless performance, shaving head and beard. The battery worked well, there was 110-240 volt charging capability, and a solid plug connection that allowed battery bypass if needed. I may go back to Panasonic for a travel clipper.</li>
    <li> This is the most flexible and convenient electric shaver I have owned so far.  It is compact, easy to maneuver and does not require changing anything to get the right adjustment. It is perfect for traveling and home use. This item really delivers.</li>
    <li> I use mine primarily for facial hair - and for that purpose, it&#x27;s extremely good. Sturdy, powerful, and provided a very even result, at all lengths i&#x27;ve tried (1, up to about 7mm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it a go for head hair as well, and as other users have reported - it does load up pretty quickly.. With that said however - i didn&#x27;t have to stop or otherwise interrupt the flow of my hair-cutting - a simple flick of the wrist while it was running would clear it, and i was able to continue cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provided good results on my head, but the cut path is a bit small for overall head use... (and any larger cut path would make it unusable for beards) -  a dedicated hair buzzer is more ideal, with this razor being used for travel or in-between buzzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still - 4 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I owned some cheaper of trimmer previously, and was frustrated with its so so performance, so i figured to spend more on this one.  Unfortunately the design is terrible, and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge very well.  I would avoid this trimmer, and probably this brand as well.  Way overpriced for what you get.</li>
    <li> This is the first self-care product I ever purchased in my life, and through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Product had arrived in a timely manner, and the box was sound and secured.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, still use today, and its water proof !! amazing !!!</li>
    <li> Worked well when it worked.  At first this was excellent - did a good job trimming my beard and mustache.  Now, 2 years later, the charge doesn&#x27;t make it through a complete beard trim, and even when I plug it in to the outlet it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few seconds and tears at my beard.  The mustache trimmer is now useless - it&#x27;s been that way for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would think at $43 this would have been a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, works like a charm, very powerful and great battery life.  Does well with very longer beard and very close shaves.  Great for detail work.</li>
    <li> I ordered this along with the Wahl 9906-717 thinking I might need both to meet all my trimming needs. I was right and wrong.  This item does a great job trimming, but for cutting lines this doesn&#x27;t do the best!  The Wahl does however!  All in all, I would buy this again if and when I needed one.</li>
    <li> I love Braun products, they work well, last and are built to a very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off because when shaving your head (which is what I use it for) you have to make a few passes and it can take a while. However, it does a perfect job and is a joy to use. I really recommend getting this.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Well design product. My kids &amp; I kept experiments on our hair and the result were satisfy. Good product &amp; value for money.</li>
    <li> Maneuvers well and holds a charge for a long time The trimmer adjuster is not the best But is adequate</li>
    <li> Summary:  Good for grooming stubble, not as good for full beards.  Low tech when compared to similarly priced trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;If it was $10 cheaper, I&#x27;d have less to say, but for $40 keep reading for the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made more for men with stubble than those with actual beards, I&#x27;m not sure how they can call this a beard trimmer.  The packaging is embarrassing, with the normally classy Braun choosing to try and market this trimmer to what I can only imagine they call the \\&quot;urban youth\\&quot; market.  Fonts are in a fake graffiti style, and cartoon faces depict the types of grooming you can do with it (\\&quot;You can make yourself look like a pirate!!\\&quot;).  Doesn&#x27;t really seem geared toward adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $40 I&#x27;d expect a Li-Ion battery, and maybe even self-sharpening (or at least maintenance free) blades.  Instead you&#x27;ve got NiMH cells, and in the travel case included for the trimmer (a nice touch... the case is actually pretty solid) is a small bottle of mineral oil to keep the blades oiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being waterproof is cool, but I don&#x27;t have a mirror in my shower and I&#x27;m never going to shave in there, so I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s really worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;precision trimmer\\&quot; seems all but worthless.  To start with, it&#x27;s designed confusingly with the button to extend it looking like it&#x27;s where the power button should be (got me the first few times I used this Braun).  If you have the long hair trimmer on the shaver it doesn&#x27;t even extend out beyond it, making it unusable.  If you have the normal (1-10mm) attachment on it just barely sticks out, and you can&#x27;t really see it so I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;re supposed to trim with any real precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this trimmer it took me many passes to trim down my beard.  The guides seemed too rigid, and with large spaces between the teeth that made me nervous about getting an even shave around the contours of my face (actually, the spacing on the blades themselves seem pretty far apart aswell).  The longest 10mm setting of the beard attachment seems just slightly above stubble length to me, and is definitely not meant for those of us who want to maintain a full beard.  Somewhat related, the \\&quot;hair\\&quot; attachment which allows for longer length trimming isn&#x27;t well suited for use on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrap up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this is fine for many (read: those who just want to keep well groomed stubble), but I&#x27;ve come to expect more of Braun and was let down by this product with the price point it is sold at ($40.19 as of March, 2014).  I think I would have been happier spending ten dollars more to get something like the [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Trimmer]] (which can go up to 18mm, has li-ion battery AND a vacuum!), or spend $10 less to get something like the [[ASIN:B005PUZZR8 Remington MB4040 Li-Ion Trimmer]].  It&#x27;s worth noting that both of these options have blades that don&#x27;t require oiling like the Braun.</li>
    <li> I love the design and color-theme they used.  But, the battery acts funky.  After you turn it on, it starts slowly, and speeds up over time - and before you know it it&#x27;s dying, even if it&#x27;s fully charged.  Also, the buttons that you must press in to slide a moving part, don&#x27;t work very well at all and you pretty much have to use 2 hands.</li>
    <li> does not produce a clean shave.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works great, i cut my hair and beard and they look great and its really easy.  the head trimmer guard broke after like a week of having it I contacted customer support and they dispatched a replacement right away and haven&#x27;t had a problem since.</li>
    <li> I bought this to my boyfriend and it was a great success!&lt;br /&gt;Product is as good as described, according to him.&lt;br /&gt;It has been two years and the product continues to work perfectly and still looks new.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace old Norelco that broke, I was a little concerned at first the motor seemed a little slow but seems to work just fine. Battery seem to last for about four trims before needing charged.</li>
    <li> Love the build quality. Love the way it feels in the hand. One of the best trimmers in the market according to me.</li>
    <li> This is a piece or junk. Blades pull and pinch facial hair. Comb guards are flimsy and will break. Braun customer service is great, most Braun products are good, not this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a little over a year, and had no complaints at all.  Until the battery started wearing out.  Now, it barely runs, even with the cord continuously plugged in.  So consider this a disposable device...once the battery wears out, it becomes useless.  I am buying a new one today, and will be sure that whatever I purchase has a lithium battery this time.</li>
    <li> This trimmer runs on battery, so  it can be used everywhere. It is surprisingly quiet. The in-case small trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;We are very pleased. The head trimmer is for longer hair. If you won&#x27;t a buzz, it is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans easily and is comfortable to us.</li>
    <li> Bought for my boyfriend. He says it works great. He only uses it for a beard trimmer and the back of his neck though. No full head shaving or lot of shaving at all.</li>
    <li> does the job pretty decent but wish it had a 2mm setting ... just goes from 1 to 3mm.  performs well. reliable.</li>
    <li> I bought this 2 years ago for my hubby. It is still running great and is a great quality of product for the price point. Extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer only to trim down my beard and that&#x27;s what it does. Don&#x27;t expect a real close shave by any means but the battery life is good, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for travel. Good product.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. It&#x27;s simple to set and use, and I don&#x27;t see any problems. Cleaning is easy.</li>
    <li> I use this on my bear only and it&#x27;s great. High quality product for great value. Trims evenly and the detailer is effective. I even use it without a guard (to shave my neck) and haven&#x27;t been cut by it once. I&#x27;ll be a Braun man for life.</li>
    <li> product is great and accessories are quality. do not get this if you want to go pretty close though. i like the boston scruff look and it is a little longer than i like.. almost have to use it every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with Braun products.  The Braun shaver I have has served me well, does its job and feels solidly made.  As did the one before it.  I purchased the Cruzer 6 specifically for trimming my beard.  It replaced a well used Wahl trimmer that finally died.  This Braun tries to do too much and fails.  I quickly learned it is not very good at trimming beards.  Its not as precise as a dedicated beard trimmer.  The depth guide slides too easily to the lowest setting when you aren&#x27;t expecting it, taking a chunk of your beard or side burns with it.  But my biggest peeve is a small retractable trimmer that catches on your beard hair if you don&#x27;t hold the thing at just the right angle.  And when it catches, it pulls out the hair.  Now if you are into that sort of thing, then this device might be right up your alley.  Otherwise steer clear and buy a dedicated beard trimmer like the Wahl.  To top it off this Cruzer 6 feels very cheaply made, unlike other Brauns I have bought.  It might cut hair well, but its a childs toy for beards.</li>
    <li> A good product that does what it says it will and also charges at 240 volts when outside the US. Recommended.  Update: After about 1 year there were problems with recharging the battery. There was less and less time available for use after recharging.  In less than two years it no longer holds a charge at all and the pop up trimmer never works.  I am replacing it with a different brand.  It was great when new but has a very limited product life.  I was an occasional user so this was not due to excessive use - it had a very poor product life cycle. Overall a disappointing purchase.</li>
    <li> What an utter piece of tripe this thing is. Beard trimmer? More like beard puller. While the idea of having a micro-adjustable length guide was appealing, I see now that it&#x27;s the very thing that ruins this trimmer. A guide is suppose to lift up the hairs and make it easy for the trimmer blades to cut. This adjustable guide pushes the hairs down as much as it tries to lift them, and the result is an uneven and difficult trim with LOTS of hair pulling and struggle. I&#x27;m convinced that anything Braun makes is garbage unless you get one of their flagship, higher end shavers. I&#x27;d stay away from this if you are serious about your beard maintenance. Maybe it&#x27;s alright if you want to use it without the trim guard and give yourself a closer trim. Otherwise, move on and get a Wahl Peanut or one of their good Li-On models, which is what I&#x27;ll be looking into as soon as I&#x27;m done writing this review.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Cause it&#x27;s losing teeth. Snap.&lt;br /&gt;Two of the teeth on the larger, hair-trimming comb snapped right off. Getting through to any sort of costumer service representative to have a replacement sent has been unsuccessful.</li>
    <li> I am a Braun fanboy but not for this product. Does not trim crisply or evenly. Lowest setting of 1mm has little effect on hair of 2-3mm so does not yield 1mm beard/stubble as reasonably expected. Underpowered and requires too frequent recharging.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this unit. Had an older model for a different manufacturer and it was time for an upgrade/update.</li>
    <li> Great shave, holds a charge long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person that has a love hate relationship with electronics. I don&#x27;t like the idea of being wasteful, so when I buy something like this I look for a reliable multi-function tool that will last for a long time and serve the most purposes ideally. This trimmer does that is good for all body parts and is braun a brand that has always lasted for years in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: All stands but the battery turned out to be crap, nothing like other braun shavers I own.</li>
    <li> Design of the trimmer is great but the sever lack of power makes it almost unusable. I would not at all recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend a year and a half ago, and he still uses it and loves the fact that he doesn&#x27;t have to change out the guards.  His beard is nice and evenly trimmed, and it still holds an amazing charge!</li>
    <li> I have been using these every 3 days on my own head since I bought them in 2011 and they still work great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good and works really cool. I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend.Unlike other shavers this has a razor type mechanism which eases the process.</li>
    <li> Shaving: worked fine while it lasted. It does a decent job of trimming but I did find that for my type of hair (I&#x27;m South Asian and have thick black beard hair) and the way it grows, I needed to move the beard in the opposite direction to trim my chin area. Over time I got used to this, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m very happy about having to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery: holds a good charge and lasts pretty long, and I can charge while using it if it dies on me. This was useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer: the small retractable trimmer head on the back is fairly useless, as for the last year or so it has hardly been able to cut through my not-exactly-bushy sideburns. FAIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combs: And now to the part that brought me down from 3 to 2 stars -- a tooth from the main trimmer comb broke off (right in the middle) from regular use. No drops, nothing, just regular use. At this point the comb and hence the shaver is unusable for me. It is still under the 2 year warranty so I called Braun but the support agent curtly told me that combs are not covered by the warranty. Thanks a lot. Now I&#x27;m expected to drop $25 to get a replacement comb, which is more than half the price of the shaver itself, and LESS than the price of the QT4000 from Philips which is 4+ stars. This is my first and last Braun.</li>
    <li> ...and I&#x27;ve owned nearly every model of trimmer!  A year has passed and this thing is still going.  Shaves beards PROPERLY and QUICKLY.....I look d*** good every day :)  If you need a trimmer that actually &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;....this is it.  Get it.....you&#x27;ll be back to thank me.   Just bought another one as a backup. 2/16</li>
    <li> The product keeps a charge for weeks; recharges quickly; very adjustable; well-made; and durable.  Works well for a one inch beard.</li>
    <li> such a big mile when he opened this present and it was shipped super fast.one of the few things he actually wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had another Braun trimmer for years (it finally died). This one works just as well if not better. I really like the slide-able trimmer as it makes it really easy for me to trim my moustache. Overall, I can&#x27;t complain about this product. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll last several years</li>
    <li> I bought one and loved it until a &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; on the guide broke. All I do is trim my beard which isn&#x27;t big (9mm).  I called customer service and I will say they ended up sending me a whole replacement unit (trimmer guide and charger... not just the guide) but only because they had no single replacement guides available. They weren&#x27;t even sure when they were getting more. I have always assumed this is because other customers had similar issues.  Well a few months later the NEW guide broke in the same way but the two central teeth broke this time. Just bent in like teeth on a cheap plastic picnic fork.  2nd failure of the same part in 2 months. Pat on the back for whoever they have as their engineers over there.  It&#x27;s a shame too because the trimmer itself worked quite well and I was otherwise very happy. I would never recommend this product to anyone due to the above repeated issues.</li>
    <li> This razor works great for facial hair. My husband and I tried to use it for his head as it says it can go both ways with the different attachments. It&#x27;s definitely too short for his jorm haircut but works fine besides that.</li>
    <li> Great design, obviously, very ergonomic, sharp blades. Haven&#x27;t had any battery problems, and the construction of the shaver and combs seem very sturdy, not fragile at all. Possible cons: I intended to use it to trim my goatee and I think the comb and blade are a bit too big, specially when trimming around the moustache area. If you have a smaller face (and a smaller moustache), it may be a little complicated to get it perfect. Another problem is that the comb heights are only odd numbers (1-3-5-7-9...mm), and, at least in my case, the perfect height would actually be closer to a two... tough luck, I guess....&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product, overall, and yes, you can use it for beard design, it&#x27;s just not a product specifically built for that. If you want an all-around beard-head-body trimmer, this is will do it&#x27;s job and is definetely worth it, but I&#x27;m still buying a shaver/trimmer on my next purchase...</li>
    <li> If only this trimmer had more power, a longer battery life and indestructible trimmer guards this would be my trimmer for life..... I&#x27;ve owned a Cruzer 6 for almost 3 years now. Gone through about 4 replacement guards..... It really does get the job done, but at a ridiculous trade off. Now I have three of the damn things because Braun keeps sending me a new trimmer when the head keeps breaking! FML</li>
    <li> This was a very good purchase. I have already used the razor and it did a great job. Thanks for your help.</li>
    <li> If you are trying to find a device that can help you keep the scruffy, 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look this is probably the best device for you. After reading many reviews both on amazon and on beard websites I went with this trimmer. It comes with two trimming heads that can be fine tuned to your liking. The shortest setting really cuts your facial hair down to about ~1 days length. While I like my scruff a little fuller when it comes to shaving I am lazy so I generally use the shortest setting every two or three days. Comes with travel pouch which is nice as its a slim device which wouldn&#x27;t be a burden to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint: Sometimes I have to press hard into my face and/or go over my face a few times before it evenly cuts down my facial hair.  Best overlooked detail: The little small trimmer that extends from the top is great for cleaning up the sideburns, nose hair, long hairs around adams apple, just make sure you have a steady hand.</li>
    <li> Best ball trimmer so far not one nick thank  ozz&amp;#34;y</li>
    <li> Loved ... verry good with multiples adjustments</li>
    <li> Dislike not having a lithium ion battery.  All works as expected.  Design is ergonomic, but difficult to get used to. (I want to hold it backwards)</li>
    <li> I had to purchase a new razor in 2005 and after trying all the major brands, I chose the Braun 8595 which I still use today.  I wanted a specialized trimmer for beard grooming, etc. and once more found the Braun Cruzer 6 product to outperform the other major brands.  This is now my second Braun product and together they take care of all my grooming and trimming needs!  I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a product that is truly superior to the competition, and this usually means I don&#x27;t ever have to purchase a replacement so over time it&#x27;s less expensive to buy one Braun that will last decades as opposed to multiple &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; units that fail after a few years.  Plus, they simply work much better.  I would have given this item the full five stars if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that the height adjustment provides only odd increments (1mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, etc.) and I would have preferred the even increments as well, at least for the first couple of settings (e.g. 1mm, 2mm, 3mm, 4mm, 5mm, 7mm, etc.).  But this is a minor point and I didn&#x27;t hesitate to go with the Braun.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s beard gets long and shaggy and it is expensive to continually go get it trimmed.  This trimmer was so easy, even my husband could use it!  He always looks great and it doesn&#x27;t take much time at all.  The trimmer comes with attachments and is so easy to use.  What a wonderful improvement!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and charge lasts for quite a few trims. Just don&#x27;t  to forget to chek the length setting at each use.</li>
    <li> I use this exclusively for trimming my beard. It&#x27;s got good power and looks well made. I recommend this to anyone wanting to sculpt the beard closer to their face.</li>
    <li> I was initially very excited by this trimmer.  Great sturdy feel, and looked like it was high quality.  However I was quickly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this does not trim anywhere near as close as my old Wahl for those areas you want to keep cleanly shaven.  I know it&#x27;s not a shaver, but I was surprised that it couldn&#x27;t trim stubble as short as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I travel frequently and half of the guides on the comb have broken off in my travel kit.  I dont&#x27; think that I treat this thing that rough, and certainly no rougher than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, the battery life is horrible.  It started out mediocre and rapidly got so bad that it will barely last through a single shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I seriously regret this purchase and am actively looking to replace this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Braun&#x27;s Cruzer kit is well-made, easy to use, rechargeable and reasonably quiet.  My partner uses it to trim his beard/mustache and he loves it.  It&#x27;s great for sideburn trimming, too.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer (of the 5 or 6) I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is the blue plastic teeth of the attachments break off after several months of use.&lt;br /&gt;I get the impression that every trimmer is built with planned obsolescence... what the heck!&lt;br /&gt;Attachment part is hard to find online... $25... guess I&#x27;ll order another razor for $40 and be wasteful.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product.  It consistently \\&quot;chokes\\&quot; on my beard, which causes a very uncomfortable/painful pulling effect.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if I leave it charging all night, this product can not get through a complete beard trim.  I took the time to call Braun Customer Service because I just felt that the motor never really had the juice to get the job done.  Unfortunately, Braun told me it wasn&#x27;t under warranty and offered to repair it at a cost.  I would rather spend money on a new trimmer than put additional money into a product that was never good to begin with.  Who knows, maybe I got a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;...a lot of people give this trimmer good reviews.  I&#x27;d steer you away from this thing.  In truth, this is the first ever product review I have taken the time to write, but I&#x27;m not OK with companies producing poor quality products and getting away with it.  I feel that user reviews are the best way to keep &#x27;em honest.</li>
    <li> I have use Wahl for twenty years and this is the first Braun.  I absolutely love it. Please give it a try</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says and after using it for a while I can say that it is the best I have ever tried and strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smooth quiet trimming. Cuts easily and precisly&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend. 6 more words required to finish</li>
    <li> Good and strong charge.  However, the comb is a bit cumbersome to attach and detach.  Overall, I am satisfied after a few uses.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome Shaver--all over body shaver.  Love it -- Well worth the price--love the sliding guard for cutting to the right length.  Excellent--will buy another if it ever fails.  Hope it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> only issue I had was that it fell on the floor and the comb broke. I tried to find a replacement piece which incidentally would have been a little bit less expensive then buying an entire unit.</li>
    <li> trimmer works fine. battery life seems good. max beard settings could be a bit longer. have not tried hair trimmer attachment. paid for name</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer to replace me old Whal.  The whal is still going strong, but it didn&#x27;t have a comb for adjusting to beard height, while this one does.  The little fine edge trimmer could be bigger/better as it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the old Whal did.  Overall not a bad buy.</li>
    <li> Very good product from the German Corp.</li>
    <li> Nice Trimmer, I love using it!</li>
    <li> The blue plastic tines in the trimmer are brittle and break easily, rendering the trimmer useless for anything but a full, close buzz--and no replacement part is available. Battery life is also an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already replaced this trimmer once (to their credit, Braun sent me a new trimmer for free). But when the same plastic tines broke again after only 8-months of use, I decided to try another brand for my next trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun Cruzer 6 Beard &amp; Head Trimmer because I thought it would give me flexibility with my beard and head hair length.  I don&#x27;t like a full beard nor do I like to be clean shaven so I go somewhere in between.  For my head I am bald and like a little bit of growth on the sides and not clean shaven.  Unfortunately, only the lowest setting of the Braun beard attachment at 1mm works for my purposes.  It gives me a decent beard trim and an okay head trim, but I don&#x27;t have the option to go closer.  Any higher settings do not get close enough and the head attachment is completely useless for a bald guy.  The packaging makes it seem like it&#x27;s for guys who shave their head but it really isn&#x27;t.  The pop up trimmer is too small to use on a big area like the head.  This product is more for guys with a full beard who want to keep it trimmed and guys who want to cut their own full head of hair.  I had a similar product by Remington that worked much better.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good Lithium-ion battery with 110-240v charger and read good reviews about this one. I&#x27;m a fan of Braun. I&#x27;m not a fan of this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power seems to be a problem. It pulses when running on battery. This is a problem as it can weaken at times causing it to pull hair rather than cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, I rather liked the clipper guard and the ability to have several sizes right on the device. I was less impressed with the small cutter. It was hard to deploy and hard to retract. The small clipper also suffered more than the bigger from the pulsing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that the one I have is defective, and I may try to use Braun&#x27;s warranty service to see how things go. If that goes well, I&#x27;ll report back. As things stand today, I can&#x27;t return it to Amazon (missed the return window, as I kept hoping the battery would shape up), and I&#x27;m not happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Ended up buying a cheaper brand at Wal-Mart b/c my son said it doesn&#x27;t do as well on his beard.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 Beard &amp; Head Trimmer broke down after 6 months without any external impact: after only six months two prongs of the hair-comb fell apart. This is not adequate for such a product. I did not drop it, never pushed hard and it was no shipping damage. The prongs simply dropped apart. That&#x27;s what we mostly see from very cheap no name Chines goods, but not what we expect from a main brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from this I was very happy with this product ... but now I can throw it away - after only 6 months ...</li>
    <li> Low power; the small styling portion gets very hot quickly so as to burn the skin; disappointing coming from Braun.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, as long as you have a wall plug you always be on shape, because if the battery is down you can conect it and keep on the shine work. Por even in the shower coz is water proof. The only con is the measures for the beard jump from 1-3-5-7-9-11 so if you want a middle beard you need to wait 1week. Besides that it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
    <li> The Cruzer 6 is just what I needed after trying other methods to avoid shaving with a razor blade. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to&lt;br /&gt;clean. I&#x27;m glad I got it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My current beard/sideburn/etc trimmer is a [[ASIN:B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer]] and the last two trimmers I have owned have also been Remington&#x27;s (purchase price for all have been app. $25/each).  I like it because it has several easy to choose cut lengths, it holds a charge for an extremely long time, it isn&#x27;t overly loud, it doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much in my hand, and (the important part) it cuts really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the Braun Cruzer 6 since it seemed to have a better selection of cut lengths, it had a separate sideburn trimmer, and because it is also (theoretically) designed to cut the hair on your head, I assumed that it cut very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box it is very sleek and a little smaller than my Remington - defintely palm-sized and easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a number for the guard setting (1-2-3 etc), the Braun actually has the length in mm&#x27;s that it will leave - a good option if you are going for a specific length rather than guessing.  I found that changing the guard setting was a little more cumbersome as you have to depress buttons on both sides of the guard and move up/down (but since the Remington just has a wheel, seems to me that EVERY other method would be harder, so not really a knock here).&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to hold a charge for a long time and is relatively quiet - maybe quieter than the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knocks:&lt;br /&gt;This thing DOES NOT cut hair as good as the Remington.  After setting both at the same lengths (I measured), I did my typical shaving method on my goatee - i.e. several paces along entire areas, in both directions, etc - as I&#x27;ve been doing for years with my Remingtons.  After finishing, I could just tell by looking that the Braun had not cut all the hair to an even length.  So I then did the same trim with the Remington and hair was flying like my goatee hadn&#x27;t even been touched - and not just short bits, long hairs.  This is a HUGE knock as it basically failed at it&#x27;s primary job - cutting.  Obviously goatee trimming isn&#x27;t comparable to head hair trimming, but in my mind I would think that cutting your hair with a trimmer like this would be HARDER than any other application and if can&#x27;t handle my somewhat thin/short goatee, I&#x27;m not confident that it can handle anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I didn&#x27;t like is it vibrated much more in my hand than the Remington.  Normally I would chalk this up as a more powerful cutting motor, but it sure doesn&#x27;t help it cut.&lt;br /&gt;Also the charging cord has is cumbersome.  Rather than the little transformer being in the unit, ala the Remington, or a small box, ala many small electronics, the Braun has this huge plug that juts out maybe 4 or 5 inches straight out from the outlet.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a hazard or even that you could knock it out of the outlet easier (which you could), but it just looks stupid and good luck trying to plug that thing in an outlet behind a dresser, bed, end table, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upshot:&lt;br /&gt;The areas that the Baruan Cruzer 6 compares favorably to my present Remington MB-200 Titanium are largely cosmetic and pale in comparison in the areas that it fails at.  Take away all the other knocks and you&#x27;d still have the fact that it DOES NOT cut well.  That&#x27;s really the only thing you need to know.sically failed at it&#x27;s primary job - cutting.

    <li> Battery life is very good; cleans very easily and my hair hasn&#x27;t got caught in it even once so far.</li>
    <li> Trims perfect for me. Has lots of settings, holds a charge very well and is very quiet and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I liked it a lot at first , i thought Braun was quality but i guess not. The batteries didn&#x27;t last long , maybe 3 or 4 months max. Now i have a dead shaver. Wont buy Braun again</li>
    <li> Some parts weren&#x27;t durable when traveling but the blades are sharper than many other brands. I loved it until the beard trimmer attachment broke.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Very sharp. Well balanced in the hand. Infinitely adjustable length. Holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, loving it.</li>
    <li> If it arrived a little earlier, I would have felt more satisfied and it was a bit wet when I opened the package. Some moisture I suppose.</li>
    <li> This won&#x27;t work for you if you have a lot and strong facial hair. It just is weak motor. Looks good b no functional value.</li>
    <li> If you want to trim using the setting 1, which is what I&#x27;d thought those seeking to wear a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; would go for, you will end up with numerous gaps. Your face will look like it has been partially eaten by rats, the corners are imperfect and even on straight surfaces (near the ears for example) it leaves gaps. I had to clean shave twice after using it because I looked ridiculous with the final result. There&#x27;s no way around it either...setting 1 leave gaps big and setting three doesn&#x27;t trim at all. Avoid it if you can, unless you are looking for something to shave your head, then that would do the trick.</li>
    <li> Works fine, until the battery dies.  At this point in history how do we not have better rechargeable batteries available??  After a few months the only way I could use it was with it plugged in...and the cord is super short.  It&#x27;s not like I wore it out, I&#x27;m bald and only needed it to trim my beard.  Do better, Braun.</li>
    <li> Beard trimmer is pretty good. Does the job well. My only issue is the detail trimmer that slides up. When trimming my beard normally it seems like the detail trimmer collects quite a bit of hair. It&#x27;s not a big issue just means more clean up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very useful, and does the job it is supposed to. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to get close enough to the face, luckily for me I&#x27;m looking for a rugged shave, I don&#x27;t care to have a fully clean shaven face, but if I were it definitely wouldn&#x27;t suffice, plus the blades get very hot after only a minute of use, so if the blades are directly touching your face, it might cause irritation if not a rash or worse. None of these things are an issue for me because I don&#x27;t look for a clean shave so it&#x27;s up to the buyer.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cut as short as i thought boggs down and pulls</li>
    <li> Reserving my judgement. Used razor twice before battery ran out. Went to charge &amp; found I&#x27; d been supplied with a charger thats not suitable for Australian power supply. Have reported to Amazon so hoping a new charger will turn up soon. Haven&#x27;t been given any delivery info so fingers crossed that something will turn up.</li>
    <li> Bought (and returned) several trimmers because they were awkward to use, inconsistent cutting depth, and worst of all - many of them pull your hair a lot as you try to use them.  Braun works effortlessly and the adjustable beard length guard really works.  It is easy to adjust and keeps my beard neat and trim without major effort.  My wife appreciates my neater look, too! :)&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended in combination with the Cruzer face shaver for great grooming without too much effort and time involved.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice trimmer for the price. There are a few things I would tweak but overall for a newbie, it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> The bad: The beard trimming lengths are only odd numbers. I find lengths of 1mm 2mm 3mm what is really necessary. 3 mm is a little long, 1mm is very short. The cruzer doesn&#x27;t have the middle numbers and it&#x27;s a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it takes many passes before evenly trimmed. It has even cut me at 1mm length.&lt;br /&gt;The good: decently quiet and excellent battery life. Cool design and sturdy feel. Water proof is handy for cleaning and reassures those who trim in the shower</li>
    <li> This product just does the job somewhat expensive compared to its competitors, hopefully i bought it with a discount, disappointed about battery life.</li>
    <li> This has many attachments to make this work for someone with a beard or light stubble. Easy to adjust and not too many removable parts.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer. In the past I have had trouble finding on that trims closely without pulling. The price was right and shipping during Christmas was amazing!</li>
    <li> Must change between almost every use.</li>
    <li> Hoping this one could do the job after my Norelco T765 finally bit the dust.  Boy did this just not do the job.  Had to go over and over areas to get it to get the hairs, but even after almost an hour try to trim my beard, I still have un-cut hairs.  not sure why either, probably the comb design doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs back to the actual clippers.  The mini-shaver thing gets in the way too, when trying to trim with the bigger clippers.  Good things?  Washable?  1-hour charge?  Travel case?  Okay, but it can&#x27;t shave my beard, so out the door with it.</li>
    <li> I was torn between this model and the Cruzer 5, but I&#x27;m glad I went with this one for a little more money, because it charges in 1 hour instead of 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice looking and comes with a travel case too. It really feels well designed and it&#x27;s a huge upgrade over the other trimmers I&#x27;ve had over the years.</li>
    <li> I wanted so badly to like this trimmer, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to maintain a light stubble. At the lowest setting, you&#x27;re looking at more of a light beard than 1-2 day stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I hate giving a Braun product such a low rating, but this product should not advertise itself as a stubble trimmer.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of the brand name. Doesn&#x27;t really trim very well. Leaves beard uneven. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> By far and away the best beard trimmer I have ever owned. Powerfull cut, easy to use and easy to clean. Looks like it would be good to trim hair too but I only use it for my beard.</li>
    <li> Beard maybe. Head, definitely not. We used this to shave my sons head. It took forever. This is not a decent buzzer for buzzing hair to different lengths. The front became clogged right away. It&#x27;s back in the box and going back to the store tomorrow. I had high hoped because this is a Brawn but it still did not work. There is not much else to say. Maybe if you are already bald and just need a touch up but not for hair of some length.</li>
    <li> A good all around shaver</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. Used it the minute it came on my beard and head.  A++ for beard work. B for head trimming. Love that it&#x27;s cordless and love that the guards are adjustable.</li>
    <li> Bought this gift as a Christmas gift. The person who I gave it to said he&#x27;s amazing. Works very well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice trimmer. It is well built and is easy to use.  It is not as powerful as I had hoped it would be so you do have to go over&lt;br /&gt; the area you are trimming multiple times.  However, the area looks well groomed afterwards.</li>
    <li> Should have got one of these sooner. It keeps me looking good. Especially if your trying to grow a beard.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as you see it on the pictures. Very satisfied. I will buy it again. Bottom line, I recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned some great beard and hair trimmers, but out of 5 or 6 this ranks probably at 2.  Unfortunately my Philips Norelco QG3270 Multigroom Proc trimmer fell in the toilet and I had to find a new one.  That one was pretty good and far superior to this, though still far from &#x27;perfect&#x27; (still looking).&lt;br /&gt;In short:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  The unit looks pretty good and I like the push button on/off switch.  Charges up faster than many models.  That&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Simply doesn&#x27;t cut my beard.  15 passes and there&#x27;s still ample long hair!  Power seems insufficient.  Adjustments are in fairly large increments.  It is bulkier than needed.  The guard has some give to it, so length may be uneven depending on the amount of pressure applied.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably return this and go back to a new Philips.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted this for his birthday.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> It is probably a great product for shaving your head with but I wanted it for my face and it didn&#x27;t really deliver. The designer stubble bit is quite small and does not really work well for shaving a face...it&#x27;s definitely more for thick beards and shaving heads.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an upgrade for a cheap $15 trimmer (which works one thousand times better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power output is too low. The blade guard is too thick and pushes hair away from the blades instead of drawing them in for a clean and even cut which is in fact the main purpose of a beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re trimming peach fuzz off of your balls please avoid the headache purchasing this peice if garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After failing to properly trim my beard I decided to use it for my dog and it failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this and if you did be sure to let Braun know that this is a rip off.</li>
    <li> works nice, charge lasts  reasonably long. The only issue I personally have  is that the adjustment for the cut depth is in 2mm increments, 1mm, 3mm, 5mm, etc. &amp;#34;What&#x27;s a millimeter?&amp;#34;you may ask. Well if you are like me and like your beard very short, but not 1mm short and not 3mm long - you know what  that 1 mm is ;)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning could be simpler, the suppled brush doesn&#x27;t work well and the &amp;#34;ruberish&amp;#34; surface, while giving you an excellent grip, also hold on great to the cut beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use this to shave my head as well ( down to 0 and not waiting long in between shaves).</li>
    <li> great product for couple of years heavy use</li>
    <li> I have fairly soft beard hair and the shaver works pretty good for cutting the hair to length. If you flip it over to trim under your chin it pulls the hair instead of cutting it. I got this to replace a Philips trimmer that I had for 8yrs which didn&#x27;t have the hair pulling problem. After 1 year of use I now only use this for mustache trimming, I switched from having a chin strap beard to a full beard so I use a professional hair trimmer on my full beard and Braun Series 7 shaver&#x27;s flip out trimmer for shaping and touch ups.</li>
    <li> It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do very well, the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the trimmer extension is quite hard to extend and contract.</li>
    <li> Great product to trim and manage facial hair.  Has made my beard growing endeavor easy and painless. Maintains charge longer than expcted, very maneuverable, and lightweight.  The add-on items are very functional.</li>
    <li> The design and cordless feature is great. Unfortunately the hair attachment starts at 10 mm, I like to buzz my head very close (so I use the &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; attachment to cut my hair. Also I have very fine hair and find that the clippers clog after each pass on my head. So I have to remove the attachment and clean the blades constantly. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a trimmer before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure I knew what to expect. It is fairly basic but it does a great job. The 2 attachments are more than enough to trim your beard and buzz your head. It has a nice pop up mini trimmer that lets you give your sideburns a nice, fine trim. The quick charge feature is also very nice, who wants to wait 8 hours to charge their shaver. Something that I noticed that hasn&#x27;t been brought to attention, is that the head trimmer doesn&#x27;t use classic numbers like other trimmers. I have heard about people saying they want a \\&quot;2\\&quot; on the sides, this trimmer lacks that scale. Everything is based on a mm (millimeter) scale. It took me a bit of comparing, but I found that a 9 on other trimmers, is a 20 on this. I am completely satisfied with this trimmer and I would recommend buying this if you are in the market for a new trimmer!</li>
    <li> My last trimmer broke. After I used this one, I wished that it had broken earlier! This is smooth, trims neatly and is versatile enough to do detailed work. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> After 3 years of use I have to say I am very disappointed with this Braun product. Since the first day, when trimming my beard with the Cruzer, I had tu use it several times over the same spot in order to have a correct length I wanted. The battery only lasts one session, and the beard trimmer accessory has broken with normal use and I have to repair it (see photo).  I have had other Braun products of higher quality, but this one is a product with nice design but poor quality.</li>
    <li> After using this product for 1 month I decided to write a review. I use it for my beard and head (short cut) and had no problems. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, it does it job. But it is not great I&#x27;ll list the cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-motor is underpowered. So in some areas like the chin area you have to &#x27;work&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;-requires frequent cleaning</li>
    <li> Allows you to trim right up to your nose without shoving the thing in your nostrils to trim my mustache. My previous \\&quot;groom everything in one package\\&quot; trimmer was a problem in this area, so I am very happy to be past that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s nice, good packaging, strong charge, comes with a nice little bag.  The cut itself is much cleaner than on my previous trimmer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably could have gotten the Cruzer5, the pop up trimmer is not as wide as I had hoped.  Sometimes the price on the 5 and 6 are almost identical, if so it&#x27;s a no brainer. As of this review there is a $15 difference which I do not feel is worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Easy to get a even length when trimming the beard.  It&#x27;s great that it can be rinsed after use.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the price! No complaints</li>
    <li> The motor runs very slow on this razor and the unit discharges quicker than I think it should.  My unit might have a bad battery, I should have returned it while I could.</li>
    <li> This is a very high tech device that has a better than average trimmer head and a unique minny trimmer.</li>
    <li> I never tend to clean shave so I use this item every few days and it is better than I could have hoped. It&#x27;s never pulled a hair on my face, the battery life is great, and it gives me a really nice even shave. It cleans easily and comes with a nice little travel case with a brush and some blade oil. The oil isn&#x27;t usually necessary unless you tend to run the trimmer under water though. The guides are great and easy to change lengths depending on if I just want to trim a beard that&#x27;s growing out or shave one off. Also works great to clean up my neckline in between haircuts. Love this item highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The large guards shouldn&#x27;t be placed in the case because the blades of the guard keep breaking off. They are cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve personally ever used... Keeps your beard all one length holds a charge well and its reasonably priced...</li>
    <li> This is great product, I use to trim both head and beard. Charge once and use for many times.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than any other product in the market. I bought an other product with electric control of the brush length and digital display, but it only does beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sudath</li>
    <li> So far so good my first beard to maintain and the product is working as expected.battery life is good.easy to clean</li>
    <li> good product / worth the money/ does a good job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. I was expecting it to have the ability to mark my shave lines, but it lacks the power to do so, it is good for trimming the large area of beard</li>
    <li> The comb attachments have a tendency to break off.  I wrote the manufacturer directly and the they wrote back promising to send me a new one....but they did not.  Do not buy this trimmer.    I am very disappointed in Procter &amp; Gamble.    A big, profitable company like that should do better.</li>
    <li> I love this product for trimming my beard and only recommend it for buzzing your head when you&#x27;re in a bind.  Trimmer is quiet compared to other beard trimmers I have used in the past.  Comes with travel case with two adjustable blade guards (I only use the shortest one).  I buzzed my hair with this trimmer and it did a decent job but I felt that it was underpowered compared to trimmers specifically marketed for this task.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this item again should it fail on me</li>
    <li> Could be doing with a bit more power. It tends to stick when cutting thicker hair. Not the best battery life either. Still a great trimmer though. I use it to keep my hair at about a 1and to trim my beard. Gives a very even cut if you keep it short.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is not too expensive and it has a lot of nice features. It&#x27;s very easy to use and the charge lasts a very long time. The only area that they could improve would be allowing you to select even and odd number settings instead of only odd numbers, but that&#x27;s really minor when talking about such small measurements. I only used this as a beard trimmer, and I have pretty thick stubble. This gave me no issue and no skin irritation. I would definitely suggest this to others.</li>
    <li> It works flawlessly.  Easy to use, easy to clean, long battery charge life.  Great grooming tool.  Allows eay adjustment for different beard areas.</li>
    <li> hard to clean. rubber material is not easy to wipe off.&lt;br /&gt;small trimmer is just a cheap little trimmer and does not meet expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall I wasn&#x27;t happy with the amount I spent.</li>
    <li> Do not recommend this machine for hair at all</li>
    <li> Works great. Had it for a while and would order another one if I needed another.</li>
    <li> The guide on this product is very thin and bendy. As a result it&#x27;s difficult to get an even-length cut on stubble and it takes many repeat trims over the same area to get a consistent trim. Unimpressed.</li>
    <li> Not nearly enough power.  Don&#x27;t waist your time if you are a black man and want to use this to trim/shave face.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is only good for facial hair as it is not strong enough to cut the hair. They should mention that on product details.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few months now and it works great.  Sometimes it sounds like the motor is about to give out but it keeps on trimming.  I have never had a snagged hair.  I have trimmed my head once and use it for my beard on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need a shaver - either electric or traditional -  if you are in a position where you need to be clean shaven for some reason.  This is only a trimmer and not a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to whoever is looking for a good trimmer for the whole body.</li>
    <li> I like it. Handles my goatee just fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect item arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I am the one who helps my husband trim his hair and his old trimmer was not doing the job.....so....I was thrilled to be able to review the Braum Cruzer.&lt;br /&gt;I also had to enlist my hubby to do the trimming of his face hair. For some reason, unknown to me, he didn&#x27;t want me to give it a try in that area. Anyway, I noticed right away that the structuer of the Braun was well made and very easy to hold even in my hand. I could move it around where I had to go as I trimmed.  It was not bulky, as some are. There are several settings on it to help you get just the right trim. It was a snap. I had my husband neat and tidy in a short period of time, and I seemed to have move control than with the old one.  Now it was his turn to trim his face hair.  He pittered arond with the Braun for a while before he gave it a go.  His mustache was perfect, exactly the way he liked it when he was done.  It looked great and he told me it was very easy to use. Since I was right there watching(something he wasn&#x27;t thrilled about) I could tell that it was not a chore like usual but he was actually  enjoying using the Braun. Clean up was easy, even hubby thought so. We used this product several more times and everytime it was great. It seems to be durable and well made, but I guess only time will tell on that. However... what we do know is this:  Good price, does what it says it will and more. I think this is a winner.</li>
    <li> I have lost count at how many variations of trimmers, clippers and shavers I have bought through the years.  It got to the point where I had three units to do different facial trim features.  One for trimming sideburns, one for keeping a scruff, and another for mustache or goatee phases.  Well, this does it all.  Finally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many times when I have had fuller facial hair and only wanted to shape, I would end up shaving the whole thing off due to screwing it up.  The Cruzer however, is quite specific to various lengths and styles.  And unlike my heavy plugged in buzzer, cutting off my ear or chopping my skin, there is no fear of that here.  It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to handle, and a snap to get the right angle.  You can also get it wet, and rinse it off etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most precise trimmer I have used yet.  Not one accident, which gives me confidence to try different lengths and shapes.  The list price is about $10 more than it should be, but with Amazon&#x27;s current discount, and their new coupon feature, it&#x27;s a pretty great deal right now.</li>
    <li> My last beard trimmer was the Norelco G370 all-in-one, which runs significantly cheaper at $15.  I got it as a temporary solution at the time but to my surprise it lasted years until the battery eventually would not hold a charge, so I had to get a new one.  I chose to go with this Braun Cruzer product based on the reviews, perceived build quality, and the most important improvement over my last trimmer: dual power.  The Norelco, while great, had a big flaw in that it was battery operated only, so if you hadn&#x27;t charged it you couldn&#x27;t use it - even if it was plugged in.  Braun&#x27;s product sold me on the fact that it will run with the cord plugged in or via battery.  Unfortunately, the power was also the biggest problem with the device.  No matter if I had it plugged in or not, the power output was the same: low.  The speed of the blade cutting was so slow I would do 20-30 passes over my beard and it would STILL miss hairs.  Gave me a terrible trim, and no amount of charging or plugging in the device to other outlets would increase the power.  Matter of fact, once you turn it on, what little speed the blades have quickly goes away within a minute leaving you with a device that is unusable for its sole purpose: trimming.  That&#x27;s why I have given this product a one.  The engineers failed massively in this department.  Everything else about the product seems great: solid construction, hefty weight, great adjustable trimmer adapters, packaging, secondary trimmer, etc.  I ended up returning this to Amazon because it is a design flaw.  Going to try out the Wahl Groomsman beard trimmer next.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok   i have a braun pulsonic shaver so i wanted this for beard trimming/shaping    it&#x27;s not the greatest for that.   it doesn&#x27;t get the stubble well, and while your shaving the stubble (without any attachments) the detail attachment has the tendency to scratch pull at your neck/face. i wish there was a cap that went on top of it.  the beard adjustments are ok they have 1 3 5 etc. i kinda wish there was a four and a two.   it does a nice job trimming facial hair with the attachments, it effective, fast   battery life is good  bottom line   if you want some thing to trim your beard (not stubble) with a 3 or a 5 great, if you want more options and finer shaving you might want to go else where</li>
    <li> I have purchased Braun products in the past and have been very satisfied.  I did not have the same experience with this product.  It did not cut my hair very evenly and I had to cut my head hair for over 45 minutes to get it even.  I finally cut it very short 1mm to get it presentable, instead of the 5mm that I wanted.</li>
    <li> ITS just under powered if beard hair is long it will pull hair nice that it has a built in detail trimmer but both run at same time if you don&#x27;t hold it right you will trim two things at once, if just maintaining stubble it might be right for you</li>
    <li> This is the very best beard trimmer I have ever used. It has very good battery life. It is a great and affordable product.</li>
    <li> This is my second on after the plastic guards broke on my last one.  This one seems a bit flimsy in terms of the attachment being held on tight enough.  I&#x27;ve had a couple gash accidents.</li>
    <li> Been using this trimmer since Xmas &#x27;11 and have no complaints. Comfortable and easy to use with good battery life. Multiple attachments allow for a lot of different lengths. Trimmer has stayed sharp with very little maintenance and never experience facial hair being pulled rather than cut.&lt;br /&gt;Only concern is that there does seem to be some hairs that get trapped somewhere under the blade even after rinsing although this doesn&#x27;t seem to affect performance.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Well, I finally took the plunge after 30 years, and shaved my head due to feeling anxious, with anxiety of a bald spot on the top of my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the most wonderful Christmas Present ever!  I feel and look much better.. The shaver fits nice in my hand, and with the head shaver on the closest cut, I was able to give myself a precise head trim, with no problems. I also bought a nice 5&#x27;&#x27; hand mirror to inspect my entire head to ensure all the hair was cut off and it looks good!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it guys...or girls, you&#x27;ll love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Braun with my insecurities.!!! Love this product!!! I use it every other day!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, does  the task properly, quiet and gentle. The size adjustment could be more sophisticated to handle, but not big deal. The anatomic handling is very comfortable. Like the modern look&amp;#62; Happy with the purchase, it&#x27;s reccomendable. If you ever put so many rules for the feedbacks, I won&#x27;t write another one ever!</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed a product before.  I think Braun products are great. Well, until this trimmer I did. I have a thick beard and used this trimmer just like it was supposed to about once or twice a week for the last 7 months maybe.  THis thing started out great. Strong , great recharge etc etc.  But after this short period of time I am finding the same results of many others here.  I can barely get through a full beard trim. (nothing else just my beard.) This is even after a full nights charge!!!!! This thing wants to die half way through. (5 minutes into the trim) and the blades move so slow even after pulling it off the charger that they sometimes pull my beard. Hell, Its a great trimmer if you use it while its plugged in... Problem is the cord is too short too......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this trimmer!</li>
    <li> I bought this beard and hair trimmer after my fiance got me a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for xmas. That thing couldn&#x27;t trim my facial hair without snagging. BUT not the Cruzer, it cuts right through hair, like a razor cuts through hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs great on a full charge and has multiple settings to cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cuts right through your facial hair&lt;br /&gt;Can be used on your head, chest and pubes, no problem&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, even comes with a brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Only one and it&#x27;s small, it does not have a #2 setting, it goes from 1 to 3 then up to 11, The other brush goes from 10 to 20.</li>
    <li> After bad experiences with trimmers from a competing brand, I decided to give this Bruan a try. The fact that this trimmer&#x27;s abilities include \\&quot;head trimming\\&quot; is evident in the fact that it has little to no difficulty trimming through well-established hair. I mostly use this for removing a beard or cleaning up between haircuts, and it has yet to get stuck or fail to cut evenly. The built-in detail trimmer makes this a useful and durable unit. No need to switch accessories all the time. The adjustable comb is adequate for trimming at different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test of this unit was when it fell off of a shelf onto a tile floor. Yes, the blade did separate from the unit due to the way it fell and the fact that the comb was not in place, but a few minutes of effort and a drop of the (included) appliance oil put it back in perfect shape. There are no flimsy plastic pieces to snap off, which is where this stands out when compared to similar cordless units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of an extra charger is a bit too steep, but there is an aftermarket unit from HQRP that will do the trick.</li>
    <li> It is well made but you have to clean it four or five time everytime you shave&lt;br /&gt;It is not powerful enough</li>
    <li> Does my ideal job of trimming my facial hair short and helps me avoid shaving totally! Only have to use it every 2 to 4 days to avoid that itching stubble.</li>
    <li> The main clippers are great and easily adjustable by pressing a button and sliding the guard.  However the edge trimmer is weak and has a hard time cutting sideburns.  This is in comparison to the edge trimmer on the 7 series Braun electric razor which is fully satisfactory.</li>
    <li> first of all good shape nice kolor confortable with package chargable andeasy to clean trimmer for shaving hair and beard</li>
    <li> Motor is very weak.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> If you have thin to no hair on your head or a think yetti beard on your face like I do it will take you multiple passes to get it right on both surfaces.  I had a Panasonic that died after 4 years and I should have stayed with it.</li>
    <li> Good product overall.  My previous trimmer was a little cheap thing, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to, but I&#x27;m overall very satisfied.  The guard lengths are measured in mm and I don&#x27;t know how that compares to #1, #2, etc., but there are plenty of options to get whatever length you want.  Works pretty good on chest and stomach, etc.</li>
    <li> This products is great for keeping a neat beard. The combs are very adjustable for different beard lengths. Eg. If you want ur chin hair a bit longer than ur cheek hair it&#x27;s a simple click. Comb adjustments snap in firmly and don&#x27;t move while in use. The fine shave extension works really well with marking cheek line and chin line. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the combs getting stuck so far. The motor is powerful and a lot quiter that my last few trimmers. I have not used it on my hair and do not know how it holds up agains long thick hair.</li>
    <li> Was great until, after a short time, the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge more than two minutes.  I have no idea why and it&#x27;s not exactly a product I can return after use.  So, onto another brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this almost a year now and its a great trimmer.  It works for both hair and beard but does not get low enough to be used as a shaver.  The battery lasts long enough for a complete hair cut and at least 2  beard trimmings.  I would buy another.</li>
    <li> I have it for about a year now.&lt;br /&gt;Mostly use it for trimming my beard. The head gets hot quite fast making it hard to do it.&lt;br /&gt;After about 6 month the battery could barely hold a single tream of about 5 min even after a charge of 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;After a year now, the battery Is dead. Can only operate it plugged in the socket.&lt;br /&gt;I have had better experience with Braun products in the past.</li>
    <li> I was worried that the hair trimmer may not trim well. But it turns out great both as beard and hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> I can shape by side burns, my goatee and my hairline pretty well with this. I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months and its held up really good so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this but that doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t like it. On the one hand it is quiet, which is kind of nice. But the problem I have with this is that it sounds like my old one when it&#x27;s low on battery. So I&#x27;m not always sure what the charge status is unless I&#x27;ve just taken it off the charger. I need to learn that quiet does not equal low battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it doesn&#x27;t go short enough. Even on the lowest/shortest setting, it doesn&#x27;t cut my hair as short as I like. I don&#x27;t know how to judge the length, but my old one goes shorter, which I like better. I have to say this one does cut smoother, not just because it is newly-sharp but also because the design of the way the comb part goes against the skin of your head and face.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to make a statement by wearing a beard, this will maintain it no problem.  I keep mine 5-7mm using this every 2 weeks.  Not a thick beard, but I do use Beardsley shampoo and conditioner, and this to maintain a consistent, professional appearance.</li>
    <li> This product may work fine as a beard trimmer but it did not work for me as a head trimmer as it could not give a close cut, in fact it took many passes over the same spot to  get it trim at all (i tried all the settings).  My previous panasonic is far superior.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it too much yet, but so far I am very pleased.  It holds a charge well and has a nice feel in your hand.  The settings are very easy to switch around.  Once I use it more I will update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> if you shave your head completely like I do, this not the drimmer for you.&lt;br /&gt;works much better as a body groomer if you just need to trim certain areas - a beard, moustache, goatee etc.&lt;br /&gt;comes in a small carrying pouch and is voltage universal (100-240v) but still a bit expensive</li>
    <li> It works very well and there are many options to use. You can also choose the length easily. It is just amazing !</li>
    <li> This is a well built trimmer.  It is a very fine unit and lives up to&lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s reputation.  It has two slide-on combs for cutting-length&lt;br /&gt;selection.  Also has a small trimmer built-in for close work.  The&lt;br /&gt;motor is strong and smooth and holds its speed well.  I have&lt;br /&gt;used Braun electric shavers for over 42 years and they have&lt;br /&gt;always given good service.  Braun lists a number of repair shops&lt;br /&gt;which I have used  with total satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I saw this razor and thought it looked cool and would replace my dead electric razor. Instead, it does a poor job cutting and snag hairs on my face. I wanted less hair on my face but not by ripping them off. Plus the battery life is terrible. Not a good buy.</li>
    <li> great trimming experience, very easy to clean, ideal for every man&lt;br /&gt;It takes though some time to reach its maximum battery potential</li>
    <li> i was looking for a perfect trimmer for probably good decade and finally i found one! first of all - it does cut supper close if you set it on #1, many other trimmers don&#x27;t cut that close and i went through 4-5 and all of them were waste of money. Second favorite feature - you can wash it in water! i use it for beard trimming and this is the best trimmer i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> The most useful feature is the precise trimmer for keeping the shape of a long beard and control over the unruly haired that stick in every direction especially after you&#x27;ve slept on one side of your face. You still really do need a pair of scissors if want that &amp;#34;precise&amp;#34; Edwardian look. The big trimmer&#x27;s vast number of height settings assure you do not overdo a general length adjustment and end up with an &amp;#34;oops-to-much&amp;#34; result that takes weeks from which to recover. So...yes, I would recommend this to others. The 4 instead of 5 star is probably a little unfair as it still leaves me with the need for the precise trim -- so it&#x27;s not and end-end solution...but pretty close.</li>
    <li> I used the Braun 7680 razor for years and it worked perfectly. Eventually it broke down and since it has been discontinued, I had to look for another razor. Because I had such a great experience with Braun, I looked into the newer models and found the cruzer 6. I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 months and so far I really like it. Most razors say they&#x27;ll give you a close trim, but often fail to deliver. The cruzer 6 does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the trimmer without the adjustable beard comb to get a closer trim, but it does sometimes irritate the skin a bit. Other than that it is a great product for those who want to have a trimmed beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the trimmer of the 7680 series actually provided an even closer trim than the cruzer 6. And it had the advantage that it was also a razor on top of a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed. It cut very slow and I had to go over the same spot several times to get a satisfactory cut for my beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this beard trimmer mainly for trimming my first time growing of a beard. I haven&#x27;t really used it that much, but I would buy it again. I&#x27;m also using it to trim my hair and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> I use this more so for trimming around my ears and neck line. It gets the job done, but the cordless norelco that i bought years ago is much more powerful.</li>
    <li> For short, 2-3 day old stubble of average/thin hair, this trimmer takes multiple swipes to notice any noticeable difference. Even then, not all of the hair will be cut. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my new beard, for which it was great, but then decided a beard didn&#x27;t suit me and it is now an excellent hair trimmer. My wife usually does my hair and she much prefers this Braun because it is so much lighter than our old mains trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality trimmer for awhile and this trimmer fits the bill. It&#x27;s got a good motor/razor to get through some thick hair. We all know how killer that can be when you go to trim 5 minutes before the event and your razors 80% dead. With this trimmer, it works while on the charger so you&#x27;ll never have to worry about that again. I would highly recommend it to any beardist.</li>
    <li> Battery charge lasts forever.  Easy to use and does a nice job.  Previous trimmer kept catching hairs and yanking on them.  Not so with this one.  Seems to have a much faster blade movement.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer about 18 months ago and now have to replace it.  I should have taken heed of the reviews that stated that there was a problem with this unit holding a charge. Mine started losing power after 6 months. I would have to charge it every time I wanted to use it and then the charge would only last about 10 minutes at best. It won&#x27;t hold a charge between uses either. Now an overnight charge only lasts a couple of minutes of use. You can not use this trimmer while it is charging, it works on battery only. I have had a few Braun electric razors over the years and was comfortable with their quality and functionality. Not any more. I&#x27;m very disappointed with the quality of this trimmer. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer, my only gripe is that there&#x27;s not a setting between the pop up, very close setting, and the basic shaver without the guard.  The basic shaver&#x27;s just a bit too long for a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow type of shave, and the pop up trimmer&#x27;s a bit too short.  Other than that I&#x27;ve had it for two or three months now and it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun products in the past with no problems, but I had to make use of the money-back guarantee (my first time for ANY product) on this thing. I have NO IDEA how this thing has any positive reviews... unless all the purchasers are prepubescent teenagers trimming their upper lip peach fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT HAS TWO SERIOUS FLAWS:&lt;br /&gt;1. The teeth on the metal comb of the trimmer are too wide/coarse and do not effectively lift the long stubble (3-4 days worth) off of my face. I end up just gliding the comb smoothly over my stubble in vain as the comb is not catching any hair.  Even when it does after aggressively angling this thing like a maniac, the trim is uneven and not very close. Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The first flaw makes this thing ineffective; the second one makes it unusable: The sliding trimmer!  When I use a beard trimmer, I move the device in an upward motion regardless of any instructions otherwise--going downward NEVER catches any hair.  On this thing, the sliding trimmer is on the underside of device, so when I&#x27;m trimming my face with the main trimmer (this is hard to visualize, I know) my longer stubble gets caught/snagged in the metal teeth of the sliding trimmer comb.  Since it is inactive (not slid out), I am constantly getting hair caught in the comb as I am gliding up... And it hurts. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be a masochist, but I don&#x27;t enjoy the underside of my trimmer trying to pull out stubble while the main blade makes feeble attempts at cutting the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually ignore 1-star reviews since they tend to be the nonsensical musings of irrational angry people on the internet who can&#x27;t operate a simple product or read instructions... but spending money on an absolutely crappy (for my purposes at least) product really makes me want to warn others in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS WHILE SOUNDING LIKE AN IDIOT. What can I say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(tags: Indian, thick hair, brown... hopefully someone will my find my review with these identifiers)</li>
    <li> length of shaving is not same across all beard</li>
    <li> Worked great, but less than one year into owning it, the tines of the removable headpiece broke. Apparently pretty cheap plastic. No replacement headpieces available, so I&#x27;ll have to purchase the whole thing again. I&#x27;ll probably switch to another more durable product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the worst trimmer I have ever used. Battery drain was so bad the trimmer would barely last one use. I was re-charging it constantly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year now and used it once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says Beard and Head. But it really doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well. It takes multiple passes to cut my hair, the length settings just don&#x27;t work the teeth of the combs are spaced too far apart and made out of thin plastic that can snap easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works alright as a facial hair trimmer but for hair you are going to want a real set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair really short and even without a length attachment this thing takes forever to get my head buzzed without patches of longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is good and it looks nice but other products definitely beat this one.</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for a few months now and have to say it works pretty good. I use it for beard trimming only, so this review is limited to that aspect of the device. For many years I have used corded hair clippers to trim my beard and always wished that I could find a decent cordless clipper that could do the job. Most of those devices at the time were underpowered to the point of not holding a charge long enough to get through a trimming session or not having enough power to get through my beard. Battery technology changed and now there are few choices on the market that can do the job adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the size/weight of the Cruzer in my hand and I like the fact that the settings are relatively easy to make and control. The battery charge does drain off a bit in between trimmings (I don&#x27;t use it every day; probably more like once a week) and it might not have as much power as a corded unit to get through my beard in one pass. For those reasons, I gave it 4 stars. In spite of that, I would recommend this to someone looking for the convenience of a cordless trimmer with accurate settings. I feel that the device&#x27;s positive points far out weigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a PRO and CON list to sum up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-Accurate settings&lt;br /&gt;-Cordless convenience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;-Charge duration&lt;br /&gt;-Power could be better</li>
    <li> This is the only beard trimmer I have ever owned so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. However, it does everything I need it to do and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I like my beard at about .25 to .5 inches and the trimmer does a good job of cutting it to this length. The extendable styler thing is also useful for trimming around the mouth and catching the occasional stray hair. I still use a razor for my neck but I am ok with this. I have not tried using the trimmer on my hair.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Could be a tad more powerful, but I think it&#x27;s a touch better than then peanut.  One of the blue guard teeth broke pretty easily, but Proctor and Gamble sent a replacement...</li>
    <li> Braun does not stand behind their products. The shaver&#x27;s length adjustment head, the &amp;#34;Adjustable beard comb&amp;#34; is easy to break and Braun will not send you a replacement. They tell you to order it through the parts distributors, who want $25 plus shipping! Almost the price of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the adjustable beard comb the unit is worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you Braun.</li>
    <li> works perfectly even if you move countries with the 110/220V charging. Everything works the way it should.  Time for me to retire my trusty old Remington hair trimmer for good, I think.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a remington cutter I had.  This unit is worse than my 6 year old shaver in every fashion.  Blade runs at half speed, at most.  If you&#x27;re cutting longish hair you&#x27;ll probably have to cut twice, once to shorten and another to get the closeness you want.  Can&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone.  Spend a little more money and get something that&#x27;s actually useful. Sorry Braun, you fail.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my battery operated Wahl Beard Trimmer which was extremely painful to use as it was constantly tugging hairs. I purchased the Wahl at Marshalls and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it ended up there b/c it was replaced with the rechargeable version (9918-6171) which gets excellent reviews here on Amazon. Either way this powers through my beard hairs and is very comfortable to use. I&#x27;ve owned a Braun shaver for about 15 years which continues to work flawlessly and my love of Braun products continues with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I used the trimmer only once, but I have 20 years of using beard trimmer. I can tell that this is a good trimmer. I only think a newer type battery will make it even better.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this beard trimmer. I used it to buzz my head and beard, and it worked great. The one, minor issue, previously mentioned, is that hair does get stuck in the head real fast, if your hais ir a bit long, but that does not bother me a bit.</li>
    <li> This devise sux.  I loved the previous version and when it died I bought this upgraded model.  It worked fine for the first few weeks...then it stopped holding a charge.  Now I charge it and hours later go to use it and the red light is blinking and I muist plug it in again.  This is a pain...clearly a low quality battery installed on this devise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my  own head of hair with this instrument(s) for 20 years.  It has saved me a lot of time and money</li>
    <li> I love this because it gets my goatee really short. It has a lot of power and I rarely have to charge it. I&#x27;m hoping my girlfriend can use the hair-cutting attachment to trim the side of my head too between professional haircuts, but have not done that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited about using the smaller trimmer and it&#x27;s been a slight bit of a letdown but the more I use it the more I get comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning several $20-$30 trimmers over the last decade or so, this is the best one I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Multiple settings make trimming different lengths literally a snap. Strong motor. Quick recharge. Easy to clean. Feels good in the hand.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean, trims crisply, easy to adjust, charges quickly and holds the charge well. What more could you want!?!? Using it for hair and body trimming.</li>
    <li> Changing the trimmer attachments are easy.&lt;br /&gt;The unit will run on battery power for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the unit mainly for head trimming as I wear my hair very short.&lt;br /&gt;With two barber shop visits saved...you have paid for the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the product title states &#x27;head trimmer&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;very happy I got it and of course Braun quality.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 is a super beard trimmer. It&#x27;s power and superior blades make for a smooth, non-hair pulling experience. It&#x27;s operation is relatively quiet, and the batteries hold a charge for a long time without recharging. The Head Trimmer attachment provides a precise cut, at least for my thin hair, without leaving longer, uncut strands. The price is lower than other similar trimmers, except those of obviously inferior quality. Great Buy!</li>
    <li> This trimmer has some great features. It is waterproof and can be rinsed under the faucet. It has a rechargeable battery and an individual trimming blade for sideburns or other detail work. And the regular trimming part is adjustable and very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that most of my previous trimmers were cheap AA battery operated Conairs or Remingtons, this Braun Cruzer 6 is head and shoulders above them and is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought. However, it is not perfect. Battery life of the rechargeable battery is good, but starts to die after a few trimmings. There is a warning light that flashes red when it&#x27;s starting to lose life, which helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer adjustment for beards is not adjustable enough. You either end up with a Don Johnson stubble or beard hairs that borderline on a bit too shaggy. I would have liked a \\&quot;2\\&quot; setting instead of either a \\&quot;1\\&quot; or a \\&quot;3\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, it is a good, sharp trimmer and will keep your hair suit looking happily un-hirsute.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this thing deserves one. I have always liked Braun products. I&#x27;ve always found them to be elegantly styled, functionally designed, and well-built. Not this one! Well, it IS nice looking, but that&#x27;s about all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems? 1) The cutting teeth are too coarse. I could never, ever get a &#x27;close-stubble&#x27; shave with this thing - it was not only not close, but quite uneven! 2) REALLY under powered! I used this thing without the plastic headcover length-guide, to try and get the closest shave on my head as possible. Even without that length-control plastic there to get stuffed with hair (other reviewers have mentioned the tendency for this thing to clog when using the length guide), it just would choke on my head hair! We&#x27;re not talking about long hair here, folks: I shave my head 1-2 times a week. My old Norelco, which I bought this thing to replace when it got too dull and the battery got too weak, never, ever choked on my hair as long as the trimmer was adequately charged. 3) Bad fit and finish - hard to slide the beard trimmer in and out etc. - feels cheap, moving parts are badly/loosely aligned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the biggest problem is those coarse teeth that just do a butcher job on stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get THIS instead: [[ASIN:B005PUZZR8 Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with THREE heads, and it&#x27;s WAY more powerful, and I just used it and it did a perfect, close, even job in HALF the time of the Braun. It even blows the doors off my old Norelco!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great for both cutting my hair and trimming my beard. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a reasonably priced trimmer.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is fantastic.....easy to use and especially cleanning it..It has a quiet motor and the mustache trimmer works great.  I would recommend the product to anybody who is interested in a new Braun Cruzer 6 Beard &amp; Head Trimmer.....</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer, I use it all the time on face and head.  Great a quick trim on those lazy work days or to style you up for a night out</li>
    <li> Really good.. Product works well... has 2 inter changable heads which are very simple to take out and work either on beard or head</li>
    <li> Nice design on this unit, but the trimmer adjustments are not fine enough. The settings for length are in odd numbered increments, 1, 3, 5, mm etc....1mm is too short for my liking, and 3mm is too long. Guess I&#x27;ll give it away, and keep using my old Wahl trimmer.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t run for more than 10 minutes. Braun says it&#x27;ll last at least 40.</li>
    <li> I had a Grundig (a now extinct German brand) trimmer that I had for ages. I replaced that with this one hoping it would do a good job. here is my impression:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for trimming bread, it is okay, as long as you use the blade to have a very short beard.&lt;br /&gt;for hair lines, it works!&lt;br /&gt;for hair, might work okayish.&lt;br /&gt;for body, no way! don&#x27;t think about it, it bits and make you bleed, here and there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy with this product. haven&#x27;t tried other NEW trimmers, yet this one is a miss.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer OK but it is pretty much just a trimmer for cutting length.  It does not trim out edges very well as the main blade it so wide and the detail trimmer is so small.  I guess I would prefer a size in between the two instead.</li>
    <li> Trimmer works great, very smooth, contours the face pretty well.  I bought this because of the 1mm to 11mm trim length settings.  What I didn&#x27;t realize until i opened it is that the length settings are at 1mm, 3mm, 5mm, etc.  After using it a couple times the length i want is 2mm, but i can&#x27;t get that from the length options available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great as long as you don&#x27;t want 2mm, 4mm, 6mm, etc lengths.</li>
    <li> Not available.&lt;br /&gt;Not use the charging of the battery as bad&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend&lt;br /&gt;Able to complete the return process in Korea, there is no</li>
    <li> I purchased the Cruzer a month ago for it&#x27;s generally positive reviews. What a disappointment. Battery life is basically nil. A full charge yields basically nothing. The battery sounds like it&#x27;s dying immediately and it will last maybe a couple minutes. And since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;dying&amp;#34; it&#x27;s unable to trim properly. Maybe I got a bad one, i don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m purchasing a different product.</li>
    <li> Pretty much just junk. Should have saved the money and spent it on a better trimmer. Nothing good to say about this trimmer</li>
    <li> Wish is had some of the in between lengths. ie: it comes with 1, 3, 5...needs 2 and 4.</li>
    <li> Basically a good unit, I could nit pick it but it does all I need.</li>
    <li> It works.. I thought I&#x27;d be amazed by this trimmer but its just like every other trimmer. I wish there was a setting between 3m and 1m. That seems like my sweet spot but oh well. Seems to last awhile on a good charge and works when wet. No problems so far.</li>
    <li> I was stuck in the hospital for an extended stay. I didn&#x27;t want to shave everyday. The groomer kept my beard in check every 3-4 days, and even gave me a passible haircut.</li>
    <li> Works great! Very smooth and effective. I pimarily use it to keep my beard trimmed and it works like a champ.</li>
    <li> Its a Amazing Trimmer, I never saw single body multi poupose trimmer like this and also i love to recommend this product to my friends</li>
    <li> Works very well for such a small unit. DO NOT use without the guard on sensitive skin. It will definitely cause problems and/or draw a bit of blood.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful Beard and Head Trimmer although I only use it to trim my Beard. It does a great job with my Beard. Great Product!</li>
    <li> This is my first Braun , it won&#x27;t be my last . Works great on my beard , super easy to clean major bonus .</li>
    <li> The battery is excellent, lasts exactly as long as the manual promises, no lies here.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit smaller than other cutters I&#x27;ve ever had, but still does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts the beard in a homogeneous way and its gets &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and very well designed.&lt;br /&gt;The colors and desing are cool, and the case helps in trasportation.</li>
    <li> works fine for Head trimming but not good for Beard. It is not up to the mark as i got the feedback from previous reviews.</li>
    <li> This shaver works pretty good. I think it is a bit under powered but it still seems to trim hair well anyway. I like the adjustable combs even though I only use one setting consistently. I personally don&#x27;t think you can maintain a beard very well without one of these shavers. And this one is reasonably priced. So I recommend it. But don&#x27;t be surprised if it seems a bit under powered. I still don&#x27;t know what to think about that.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, does a great job with minimal effort and cleanup.  Part of my daily am ritual.  Any guy older than 30 should have this in their kit.  If you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about then do a favor to everyone and take care of your grooming!</li>
    <li> possibly due to my unfamiliarity with beard trimmers.... one could buy cheaper and better performers @ Costco...instructions too difficult to discern</li>
    <li> This is a great beard razor - does a really good job.  The first one I had was great - until I dropped it.  The second one was never as good (battery did not last long between charges), and it has finally died completely after 10 months use.  Definitely not a durable product.</li>
    <li> The rpms/speedi is very low. Not impressed with it&#x27;s cutting at all. Narrow head combined with slow speed makes it time consuming. Pull bead when trimming.</li>
    <li> It is OK, didnt really work for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Works really well.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this Braun for a while now and I like it. Never had any problem and cuts as I want.</li>
    <li> He is very pleased with it, he very much likes the multiple length settings. Even though it is not marketed as a body trimmer, he says it works well. I felt it could have felt sturdier coming from Braun.</li>
    <li> my husband purchased this trimmer for his beard and was dissappointed with its performance. could not in good concience recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Works well, probably not recommended if you have very short hair as the brush does not seem to allow you to keep it super short, but good machine for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this Braun to replace a 2 year old Conair which failed to charge. I&#x27;m very happy with the Braun, holds its charge for at least a month, and does a superior beard trimming job, compared with the Conair.</li>
    <li> i got the prodact right on time and im vry pleased with the prodact thank you</li>
    <li> I like the cut and length choice.</li>
    <li> I bought my first rechargeable Braun foil shaver about 20 years ago. It was great for my young adult fuzz. It took about 5 years for the battery to finally die. For several years after, I decided that the razor felt better. More years passed, and I needed an electric again to trim a man&#x27;s beard. After looking at several brands and models, I decided to go back to Braun. The design is decent (pretty cool blue comb, no?). It is relatively compact and fits well in the hand. There&#x27;s a nice pop-out detailer. The trimmer without the comb works well enough. No problems with the juice just yet. My main objection has to do with the comb guides. Both the beard and hair guides don&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;comb\\&quot; very well. I think the teeth of the combs must be too far apart. This results in having to pass over the same area over and over, yet it will still miss hairs that are curled or folded close to the skin. It seems to work better on the closest settings. Maybe this is a common problem to all trimmers? I am loathe to admit that my old $15 Wahl AA-battery operated trimmer did a better job. I really want to like the Cruzer. I want to believe it is a German-engineered tool of precision. But it falls short. Maybe things will improve with more practice.</li>
    <li> great for my teenager</li>
    <li> Items are in good condition and my boyfriend is able to trim his beard with it.</li>
    <li> After 6 months use, battery life seems to be reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts hair fairly well. 2 separate attachments for hair length adjustment.</li>
    <li> My mom got this braun cruzer 6 beard and head for christmas 2 years ago. I works as good as it did the day I got it. The battery pretty lasts at least an 1 hour  before it runs out. Good for shaving and trimming beards. Nice for hair cutting as well. I use the little minnie shaver on top to shape myself up. you can even wash this thing out in the sink because all the electric parts inside are sealed off. I strongly recommend this braun cruzer 6.</li>
    <li> Beard comb broke within a few months (and I take very good care of my stuff).  Otherwise a great trimmer, but once the comb broke it didn&#x27;t do so well...</li>
    <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Have it for a year and never let me down ..</li>
    <li> I wanted this for a cordless that could trim both my beard and head. I planned to use his trimmer to replace my old beard trimmer and large corded hair clippers.  I was easily able to trim both by using the short and long comb guides.  The motor did not sound very powerful, but had no problem mowing through for a haircut.  Runs quiet but plenty of oomph to plow through my head.  I keep my hair about 3/4 inches on top, which is at the upper limit of 19 mm. Short charge time is great and gives pretty long run times.  Battery is nimh, so no memory problems when charging. Only concern is that the comb guides seem a bit flimsy.  Overall, I like this trimmer.  It let&#x27;s me trim my whole head and beard at one time, with one tool, with no cord.</li>
    <li> does what it claims, easy to use, and works well. recommended for anyone tired of trimmers and razors. worth it</li>
    <li> This product has four major flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) None of its settings are appropriate for trimming a long beard. The longest setting on the \\&quot;head\\&quot; guide will give you a slightly bushy beard, but these clippers are only really appropriate for \\&quot;Will Riker\\&quot;-style beards or for much trimmer facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The motor is weak. This thing can barely cut my hair and I have to go over everything several times. I think this is the case with every battery-powered trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The guide gets clogged very easily. If you are trimming a full beard or a full head of hair, it will require being cleaned out 10-20 times per cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The guide slips easily, so if you are trying to give yourself a #2 haircut, you are bound to accidentally slip and give yourself a #0 haircut. This happened to me twice, and the second time I was extra careful and it still happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason this item merits a second star is that it is GREAT for trimming body hair and I imagine it is pretty good for keeping perma-stubble.</li>
    <li> My husband was used to the smaller razor but he absolutely lives this razor. It&#x27;s easier to use and give an even shave and has lots more options than just shaving your beard. It&#x27;s a super quality product and worth more than we paid for it. MORE THAN SATISFIED!</li>
    <li> Used this trimmer for a year or so before it eventually died on me. Fairly reliable during the usage period and appreciated having a precision trimmer for shaping my beard. Does not have a vacuum built-in so the hairs go everywhere. Otherwise, decent product!</li>
    <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 works really well if you only have to trim less normal medium shaft type of hair and only if the trim is cutting 2 cm.  It is a trimmer not a shaver; so if you decide to use it on coarser thicker hair it clogs up quite a bit.  It you use it to trim more than 3 cm, it clogs up again.  This can be used to maintain the shape of your full beard or mustache.  On the head it can be used to maintain your established fade or close crop; but for cutting or full shaving you have to use Braun Cruzer 6 Head/Face Shaver.</li>
    <li> Well, I jammed up 3 times and eventually siezed up and broke my older trimmer due to growing a 6 month &amp;#34;winter time&amp;#34; beard that had to go due to youngest brothers April wedding and my wife&#x27;s loss of interest.  (God bless her for tolorating the giant brillow pad for so long!)  I really need to use electric clippers that break the hearts of all the new Marines in boot camp that love their long, flowing locks of hair, for use on my face!  Anyways, I have been asked to review this Cruzer 6 &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; that claims it&#x27;s for beards and head trimming...The one thing that is true about this &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; is it&#x27;s name.  You will be doing the very name that it is - right out to your trash barrel to put it where it rightfully belongs!  I&#x27;m not sure that there are any positives...(thinking)....yep, no positives.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  1 - Very underpowered.  I have thick, burly facial hair, Cruzer 6 doesn&#x27;t cut well for me at all.  If you have thinner facial hair, it might work for you about as good as most of this generations teenagers in todays work force. 2 - smaller slide-up fine trimmer runs at the same time as the larger top cutting trimmer operates.  If your not holding the top trimmer at a 90 degree angle to your face, the smaller trimmer will grab your facial hair and pluck/pinch your face, (absolutly horrible design!!! I really want to fart multiple times in a very small room with the person/s who designed this masterpiece!  The smaller slide-up trimmer should only run when it&#x27;s in the up/on position, but No, embrace the facial hair plucking!) 3 - Charging cord does not fit snug into the end on the trimmer (another bad design).  Can&#x27;t run the trimmer with the power cord plugged in, it just falls out so if you start to trim and the batteries start to die out, don&#x27;t plan on finishing by plugging in the power cord, your going to have to wait until the batteries are charged, or go out with a half trimmed face.  4 - Trimmer doesnt cut facial hair as short as you think.If you want to have a &amp;#34;5-oclock shadow&amp;#34; look, you cant get that short with the Cruz 6.  the shortest length leaves my facial hair more stubbly than I want. 5 - Dont&#x27; even think about trimming your head hair!  you will probably blow this thing up by jamming/clogging the trimmer cutter with longer thicker head hair.  6 - OVER PRICED!!  I am very dissapointed that I let myself spend around $40 for the piece of junk, then another $10+ for shipping!  no one to blame except ME!  Don&#x27;t get swayed by the online demo video from Braun about this trimmer, I fell for it big time!  watch the video and notice how short the trimmer is actually video taped being used...quick little clips of the trimmer at work...because it really stinks at what it does.  I am just being honest and telling you like it is for me and my situation.  Amazon was awesome...no problems/issues there...The moral of the story....hehehehe.....drum roll please!......this should be the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; advertising slogan....&amp;#34;Cruzer 6...THERE&#x27;S NO BRAINS WITH THIS BRAUN!&amp;#34;  Someone please forward that to BraUn and tell them that&#x27;s a freebe...on the house, no charge.  Thank you all, hope you enjoyed my review, I worked very hard on it, I wish I worked this hard in high school on my papers...If I did, I might have been able to get a job at Braun making beard trimmers...Stay well and may the good Lord Jesus bless you and your family with love, happiness and joy!....&amp;#34;Go Bruins!&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer specifically for cutting my hair and it works well. For people who like a really short trim like me, remember to buy this product and not the Cruzer 5, as the beard trimmer that comes with this product, works for your head as well and can go much shorter than 10mm. The maneuverability of this trimmer is really good and that&#x27;s what helps you get a good cut. It is easy to cut across your hair - quite smooth, and does a good job of trimming the back as well - which would be quite difficult for any trimmer. The trimmer is helping me save on expensive barber/hair-salon costs and I figure I am only going to get better at self-cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product - definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> After trying a few other products I decided to give this one a try. It works really good. the size selector stays in place and the added precision trimmer is great. Works cord or cordless which gives it an extra star against other brands and models. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Mine lasted about three years and then would not hold much charge.  It still works well on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cruzer 6 contains two AAA NiMH cells, but they are not replaceable.  The cells have spot-welded tabs which are soldered through the circuit board.  I wasn&#x27;t able to lift the circuit board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions suggest fully discharging the batteries every few months, as you would do for NiCd.  That&#x27;s not only unnecessary, but actually shortens the life of NiMH cells.</li>
    <li> Like pretty much every other battery-powered trimmer, the battery becomes almost useless after less than a year of use. As a normal person, it&#x27;s basically impossible to maintain optimal plugged-into-wall time to keep battery life good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my head after a few months and it didn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get one that just plugs into the wall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for many months now, and it works perfectly.  Never pulls, just cuts cleanly in one or two passes.  I&#x27;ve never owned another brand, so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but compared to using scissors alone, this is much, much easier and gives a cleaner look.  Charge lasts me a week or more, using it most days of the week.  I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. Good amount of power, nice mustache trimmer built in, and can be used while plugged in (useful for that eventual day when the battery goes). Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Owned for over a year with daily use and travel, still working well. Good quality for the price. Recommended; would buy again.</li>
    <li> I received this product only TWO days after ordering it on Amazon.  I like the feel of it, both in the hand and against the skin/scalp.  Nice to have a cord-free device.&lt;br /&gt;Runs amazingly quietly (after using a regular hair clipper with attachments for many years). Light in weight.&lt;br /&gt;Did a good job on my beard, eyebrows, body hair and was not difficult to work out what hair length settings I needed.&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the only suggestion I would make is that if a short, military-style haircut like mine is desired, that this be used every week or 10 days, since removing any amount of bulk tends to clog up the comb, which has to be removed each time to clear it.&lt;br /&gt;When I cut my head hair, it had been about 4 weeks since my last haircut (as is typical for me), and I must have had to remove and clean out the comb 20 times or so.  If I use it again on my head, it will be much more frequently, so lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly worth the money, needs to be handled with some care (like nearly all electronic products these days) to avoid damaging plastic parts, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I had the Cruzer 5 before, this is not that much different than the one I had, aside from the little precision trimmer and the charging light there really wasn&#x27;t too many noticeable differences about them, not to me anyway. I&#x27;ve always used braun and they&#x27;ve never let me down, so You will not be disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> The larger trimmer head works fine.  The unit has enough adjustments for length of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Did not like the smaller trimmer blade.  It is nearly too small to really use for touchup and wants to get caught in my beard as I trim mustache with larger blade.</li>
    <li> The Cruzer 6 is very portable, allows for a wide range of trimming lengths and modes, and has a last longing battery. You&#x27;ll get better results with small trimming lengths, but you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the results of larger clippers. Its portability somehow compromises the power and size of the blades. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are very good but will fall short of a professional hairdresser&#x27;s clipper. Overall, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at triming and is very &amp;#34;user friendly&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This was the worst beard trimmer I have ever had.  Did not cut evenly unless on the lowest setting and even then it was not great.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Convenient size/shape for trimming mustache and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Rubberized\\&quot; textured grip, \\&quot;micro\\&quot; trimmer for detail,&lt;br /&gt;adjustable \\&quot;comb\\&quot; for beard length and the battery seems to&lt;br /&gt;hold the charge for a while. Storage bag holds trimmer and&lt;br /&gt;charging cord, instuction book. Pleasant surprise was delivery&lt;br /&gt;earlier than expected. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Just went to Walgreens 2 nights ago because my Philips Norelco, after 3 months, busted and the battery no longer carries a charge, what a piece of garbage. So I&#x27;m at Walgreens looking at the options, knowing they will be absurdly overpriced, but I see this one for $49.99, but I decide to pass. I&#x27;m at Target tonight and its on sale for $29.99, and it&#x27;s either this one which I&#x27;ve never used, or another Philips Norelco which is a piece of garbage whose battery has run out first in about 1.5 years of use, and then the second time after 3 months, absolute joke albeit decent trimmers with nice vacuum pieces to clean up the mess. This trimmer is lightweight as others say, has guards, etc. There are fourissues&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The speed is absurdly low, it just doesn&#x27;t feel like an effective trimmer when I&#x27;m trimming my beard, it feels like a half battery charged toy even when plugged in&lt;br /&gt;2. I had to go over several areas MULTIPLE times and my beard is probably only 4 mm.&lt;br /&gt;3. It only has 6 trim settings -- for someone with a short beard like mine I need more than that, the 1 mm option is fine, but the one after that is nowhere even close to what someone who wants to keep a trimmed beard would want it at.&lt;br /&gt;4. No vacuum (expected since its cheap though so not a big factor in my review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cheap item, you get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t pay more than 30 bucks for it. Just pay another 15-20 for the Norelco even though that&#x27;s a piece of garbage as well, at least it feels more efficient, its more powerful, etc. If you really need to save 20 bucks go for this one I guess because it&#x27;s the only budget option trimmer, but its unreal how theres basically two options -- halfway decent Norelco Phillips, or this below average Braun brand. Unbelievable. People who give this a 4 or 5 have got to be kidding, they are clearly mostly fake given the way they are written.</li>
    <li> Does everything it says it does with aplomb. Excels at both facial hair trimming and at least in my case head hair trimming. This trimmer has never pulled a hair. Blade temperature remains very mild with fine hair, never requiring a break to cool though you will notice some heat. Well designed and constructed this along with the Cruzer 6 Body Shaver and High Definition Trimmer, completely cover all of my hair grooming needs. Remember to always clean and oil your trimmers after every use, or fairly routinely, to preserve blade sharpness and prevent excessive unnecessary blade wear which may lead to pulling or excessive heat buildup.</li>
    <li> Pinches all the time. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, and can&#x27;t run off of a/c power. The motor is really underpowered. I have pretty coarse hair and it takes several passes to get a clean result.</li>
    <li> This is the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers my whole adult life, but never had a Braun beard trimmer before. I previously owned Norelco trimmers, but felt the quality had declined from the first one I had. I feel the Braun is a high quality item. Feels good in your hand, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, trim my beard. I don&#x27;t mind paying more, if I&#x27;m getting more, and this was worth it.</li>
    <li> The overall product is good quality, esp. handle materials, that deserves 1-2 star rate, but definitely not worth the price I paid for a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underpower motor wastes the design of dual-battery, together with short trimmer blades, is unable to perform the task as what it supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I got this for my brand preference and Braun loyalty. What a mistake!</li>
    <li> This trimmer lasted about 10 months then the battery light started flashing.  One would think that a braun would last longer.  I recommend choosing a different brand.  Have a nice day.</li>
    <li> These guys really hit the ball out of the park with this product! Why can&#x27;t we Americans make anything that works this well, lasts this long and is such a great value?</li>
    <li> My husband had been using this beard trimmer for four months. He was happy with the performance, even though it required a number of passes to trim his beard and is not very powerful. The price and the brand name were right. A few days ago one of the blue plastic teeth on the short beard trimming comb / guide broke, rendering the beard trimmer useless. A replacement is $20 plus shipping. The part is on back order at the on line parts dealers identified by Braun. This is unfortunate and expensive for an item at this price point. We expected better durability and quality under normal use. My husband decided to purchase a professional model with magnetic clip on guides. He regrets spending the money on this model however will keep it around for light touch ups not requiring a specific length trim.</li>
    <li> Wish it had a vacuum! However it does a great job,and does more than trims beards. Happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> Hard to clean out when cutting your hair.</li>
    <li> Holds it&#x27;s charge and works great.</li>
    <li> So far this beard trimmer has proven to be a great product in keeping my goatee trimmed nicely. I personally like the attachments and the varying length adjustments.</li>
    <li> The barun trimmer is good, battery lasts long .. but it doesn&#x27;t give close trimming and my skin itches after the use. May be not suitable for my skin</li>
    <li> I did a lot of looking before buying this Braun trimmer and I feel that this is the right choice. It is well made, has solid comfortable feel and does the job intended. I have had a Braun electric razor for years that is still in use. I hope this trimmer does as well.</li>
    <li> Light weight, good charge. I especially like not having to change the heads for trimming. Easy to adjust, with a pop up trimmer.</li>
    <li> After having this for less than a year the battery is completely dead now. I am responsible with my electronics. Even leaving this charge for an entire day results in a battery that dies after 2 minutes of use. I would avoid ... I had high hopes for Braun but this product is clearly a miss...</li>
    <li> The powerful trimmer packs a punch, but still remains affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination trimmer not only packs a powerful punch while being used to combat facial hair, but can also be used to trim heads as well. Shaving the head has never been so simple with the powerful dual battery and the ability to precisely comb through and trim the hair to six different lengths, achieving a uniform look at ten to twenty millimetre settings.</li>
    <li> This has all the bells and whistles I could ask for.  It replaces another brand that wore out.  I much prefer this unit.</li>
    <li> Battery life could definitely be better.</li>
    <li> I just throw it away, just trying to trim my beard, that is not a long beard at all, just a four days beard that&#x27;s it, and this thing couldn&#x27;t do it right. I thought Braun used to make quality stuff only, not this powerless thing, because that is my biggest complaint, it does not have power at all. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time. It was a gift so I&#x27;m not sure if I can rate 5 or only 4 stars, but definitely no less than 4. Braun products are always superior to others when it comes to grooming!</li>
    <li> Works wel, and makes grooming my beard a lot easier. My beard and mustache now always look neat and nice!</li>
    <li> I am a balding late 30s male in the military.  This product shaves my head weekly with a charge only needed about once every 3 cuts.  I don&#x27;t use any attachment and it does a perfect job everytime!  I usually clean it while I am in the shower too, but am carefull nt to let water get inside the motor shaft.</li>
    <li> Like it I did not imagine it will be that good&lt;br /&gt;You have to use it and you will now what I meant</li>
    <li> I wanted to liked this... I really did.  It has a lot going for it.  It has nice sturdy design - it looks nice and feels nice on the hand.  It has a quick charge time.  You can wash it with water and it won&#x27;t rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this trimmer with the guides you&#x27;re fine, but as soon as you take the guide off it starts pulling hairs painfully.  In fact I used it only twice before the second time it drew blood.  That is inexcusable.  I have a $15 cheap Wahl trimmer that I use that doesn&#x27;t pull hairs like this... this baffles my mind.  I requested a replacement from Amazon because I thought the first one was defective.... but the replacement pulled hairs as well.  This is a problem with a product design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to stick with good dependable Wahl.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Braun Cruzer6 to replace my old trimmer. I cut my own hair and beard, so I need a trimmer that works well. I find this trimmer to be well made, quiet, and an effective tool for hair management. It charges quickly and holds a charge well. It cuts much closer than my old trimmer, so I&#x27;m sporting a shorter &#x27;do&#x27; than normal at the moment, but once I get used to the new settings I&#x27;ll be all set. I like the travel case (my old trimmer had a plastic tray with the attachments in it and it needed to stay plugged in to hold a charge)and feel confident that this will hold up well.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well.  The comb settings are strong - no slipping. The blades cut nicely. It is easy to use.  I am very happy with how it cuts with the guide combs and without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a battery operated shaver by Wahl.  It was good, too, but the comb attachments for this Braun shaver give more options.</li>
    <li> Holds a charge fairly well.  Easy to clean and cuts well.  Used it on a full beard and my head.  What more could you want?</li>
    <li> Loving the way it trims. Battery lasts long and the waterproof aspect is a huge plus. A great purchase. Recommended.</li>
    <li> As a trimmer, the Braun Cruzer works quite well, and seems like a durable, well-made product. The motor is a little underpowered for my thick hair, so at times there&#x27;s a bit of tugging --- but that&#x27;s been true of every small trimmer I&#x27;ve ever tried, and at least this one still cuts the hair evenly. With other products, I&#x27;d get regions of closer-cut hair that looked almost like bald spots. That&#x27;s never happened to me with the Braun, at least so far (and I&#x27;ve owned one for about a year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However. There is, in my humble opinion, a very serious design flaw in this machine. This is that if you accidentally forget to unplug the charger within a reasonable margin of the recommended charging time, you will burn out the battery and turn the thing into junk. The only remedy then is to ship your piece of junk someplace in Massachusetts, where they say they&#x27;ll fix it or ship you back a new one, in... oh, who knows how long. It seems completely trivial to have designed this trimmer with an internal switch that would shut the charging unit when the battery was full. It really annoys me that they didn&#x27;t bother with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to summarize: It&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer; but if you buy one, please be super careful never to overcharge it. Set a timer to one hour and be around when the hour is up, or you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> Gives you a ok breard trim.the small extendable trimmer dosent work that well..should have bought the 5srries instead</li>
    <li> If you like the Cruzer 5 stay away from this one! The head is rigid, the training guard sizes make no sense, they tried to integrate a Fusion razor on the back that no one would ever use because the overall body of the trimmer is to cumbersome. I LOVED the Cruzer 5 but one of the guards broke and I could not get a replacement. Thinking the Cruzer 6 would be better I foolishly ordered this! Sadly, the picture shown is of the far superior Cruzer 5 and I feel a bit misled. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> very very bad for the hair. The hair is always stuck inside the cutter, and I have every 2min to stop cutting my hair and cleaning the hair.&lt;br /&gt;By the way I&#x27;ve sent it back to you and ask for a refund</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the strongest power and you can&#x27;t get super short. It is lightweight though but that&#x27;s the best part about it.</li>
    <li> very good product consider the price.&lt;br /&gt;not the most powerful machine, but does the work well.&lt;br /&gt;battery is very strong and the package is nice too.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my Norelco T900 beard and moustache trimmer that was about 15 years old. It had a pop-up trimmer that was awesome and power to spare. This has the same features but not even close in quality. First, serious lack of power and the cutting blades are too course for trim work the way I am accustomed so it slows down the job.. Also, the pop-up trimmer works exactly opposite of my old one making it awkward to use. I can&#x27;t even see what I am trying to trim. I looked for several weeks before I settled on this one and I&#x27;ll continue to use it till someone makes a better one but every time I turn it on I miss my T900 which not so incidentally was made in Austria. The price means much less to me than the quality. This is a personal tool I use on myself 2x week and I would be happy to pay 4x what I paid for this one if they would correct all the weaknesses.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this Braun head trimmer, it has absolutely no use for the price. For the same amount of money you can buy a shaving kit which will do a much better job. This is a highly inferior product and does not even offer a close trim when removing all the gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly dis-recommended, massive waste of money on my part.</li>
    <li> i got this when it was 40 bucks. One of the combs is broken and on the company&#x27;s website they ask for 25 bucks for just one cheap plastic comb. other than that it works ok.</li>
    <li> A very good product. Brought this product after going through a bunch of reviews. Braun has kept up the reputation. Would definitely recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Good&lt;br /&gt;1. Extremely good handling&lt;br /&gt;2. Sharp razors and trims and cuts extremely well&lt;br /&gt;3. Works with power plugged on&lt;br /&gt;4. Easily washable and the clips fit in effortlessly&lt;br /&gt;5. Precision trimmer is very good for shaping stub&lt;br /&gt;6. Never hurts the skin&lt;br /&gt;7. Nice pouch for travel&lt;br /&gt;Bad&lt;br /&gt;1. Probably a little high priced</li>
    <li> This is probably the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had, especially given the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Its as easy to adjust as the description makes it sound; just push in the button and slide the guard to the length you want (listed in 2mm increments, 1-15).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* There&#x27;s a second small trimmer that slides out of the front which is nice for cleaning up edges; its kind of at a funny angle so getting in tight places might be tough, but I&#x27;ve not really had any major issues there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Battery life seems great.  I&#x27;ve used it 5+ times without charge in the past.  It can be used while plugged in too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Super easy to clean.  I was skeptical of the claims that you can just run water over it, but I&#x27;ve done it many times and it works great.  The main trimmer flips open on a hinge so you can blow out any hair that gets caught in there.  The guard slides right off so you can get any hair out that gets stuck in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t cut long hair (like on your head) very well.  I used it once to trim the sides of my head, and it was constantly getting clumps of hair jammed up under the guard and I kept having to take it off and blow it out.  But I really only bought it for my beard and mustache, so this doesn&#x27;t bother me much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The guard seems like it should be really easy to get back into its tracks when you take it off, and usually it is.  But for some reason every once in awhile it doesn&#x27;t go in right and I won&#x27;t notice, which makes the length setting not correct.  In fact, the first (and only) time I tried to trim my hair with it, I did this and because the guard wasn&#x27;t securely attached it popped off and I lost a small chunk of hair.  Yikes.  Just be careful putting the guard back on and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Easy and effective to use. Well-designed. Comfortable to grip&lt;br /&gt;and easy on the hand. Seems like good quality. Very pleased after the first couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;Charging cord is sturdy and well made. I highly recommend !!</li>
    <li> I like this.  The only negative I&#x27;ve found is that you really do have to hold the trimmer at the right angle for effective cutting.  This can be a bit awkward at times given that our bodies are curved.  But once you learn how, it works fine.</li>
    <li> This trimmer really doesn&#x27;t have much power. I find that I have to do frequent passes over spots and from various directions just to get an even trim. My roommate has a wahl beard trimmer and it&#x27;s exponentially better in power, maneuverability and size. I regret buying this. Would return if it wasn&#x27;t such a bitc** to do so.</li>
    <li> So pleased - the colour looks great, i was thinking about the old spice version which was red, so glad i went for this - yes it&#x27;s a little dearer, but it&#x27;s excellent. It holds charge for AGES - ie i went away 2 weeks and it was perfect, just went and went without a charge. I love this - one of my best buys ever</li>
    <li> Simply the best beard trimmer I have ever used by far.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very good battery time.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a great tool. Its easy to change pieces.  It is a good design and the battery is a huge step up from the 5.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year ago to replace a cheaper beard trimmer that had been working fine for almost 5 years but was getting a bit tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main purpose of this trimmer is to keep my beard trimmed to a short stubble (2-3 times a week). It seemed to work ok new but right away I noticed it did not do a better job than my old \\&quot;inferior\\&quot; brand trimmer. I really had to work the trimmer to get a nice uniform trim, this entailed going back over the sections multiple times. I also could not find a good length with the head attachment. 1 setting was too short, 3 was too long and there is no 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made it work, being able to rinse it was nice, it felt good in my hand. Fast forward 6 months and it appeared be working even worse than when I purchased it. It began doing funky things too, like not holding a charge at all. I constantly had to keep it plugged in, then about a month ago even when it was plugged in it had no power, sometimes it will mysteriously \\&quot;come to life\\&quot; and I seem to get full power for a few seconds, then it dies again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $50, under a year use (and not the best use at that) is unacceptable. Not much I can do at this point, I am back on Amazon shopping for a new trimmer. I won&#x27;t be going with this trimmer again and certainly won&#x27;t be buying Braun.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Cruzer6 Beard and Head trimmer because it offered the highest settings I could find. The head comb can be used for the beard, which I have done, using the second notch down from 20mm. I&#x27;ve had a full beard for the last 38 years. My vision isn&#x27;t as good anymore, making it difficult hand trimming with scissors. So I decided to look into beard trimmers. My research seemed to show that most beard trimmers were for the short stubble look, which I didn&#x27;t want to go that short. Thus my choice of Cruzer6. I&#x27;ve used it twice, the first time stopping short of the result I would have been happy with. Next day at it again trimming and finishing touches with a pair of scissors (don&#x27;t think they will be needed anymore) and using the slide out trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;m pleased with the results, looks neat and clean. Should have looked into doing this years ago. Cleanup is not bad, I always cover the sink with a large towel. When done roll the towel up, quick hit with hand held vacuum and I&#x27;m good to go. I don&#x27;t intend to use it on my head, so not comments there. Shaver feels solid and well constructed, as well as the recharger. No problems with this Braun, if any occur I&#x27;ll update.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better shavers that cost 1/2 the price. It took extra time to trim my beard and I always felt like I had to work it. There were also too many times when I got done I found spots that hadn&#x27;t been trimmed well. So, I was never very impressed with the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one year later and I&#x27;ve bought a new and different shaver that does a much better job of trimming my beard. I like is so much better in fact that I use it to trim my hair on my head also. The reason I had to buy a new one is the battery won&#x27;t even last one shaving anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> So far it is excellent. My hair was really long (hadn&#x27;t had a haircut for over 3 months), and I decided to cut it all myself, even though it took me a long time to cut all of my hair (because it&#x27;s the first time I do it myself in my life) it really worked well, and it didn&#x27;t run out of power until I finished cutting all my head hair and started trimming other parts of my body. There are no flaws in it at all so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this almost 3 years ago primarily to trim the hair on my head to stubble length every 2 to 3 weeks. About a year ago I started using it to trim my goatee to a little longer length. There&#x27;s a lot to like about this razor/trimmer but also some negatives that prevent me from recommending it for what I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- build quality: other reviews I&#x27;ve read say the plastic teeth on the length guide are flimsy and break easily. I don&#x27;t know how rough they are with theirs but with normal use mine&#x27;s lasted 3 years and I&#x27;ve never felt it was flimsy. It&#x27;s plastic, after all, so you can&#x27;t go dropping it on the floor and expect it to bounce back into your hand with no damage, but short of that it seems like it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;- length adjustment stays put: this sounds like a small thing but with my old Remington beard/mustache trimmer I&#x27;d set it for 1/4&amp;#34; and it would change to something shorter on its own, then I&#x27;d have to redo the rest of my beard to match the shorter length&lt;br /&gt;- you can use it while plugged in or cordless, which is great if you forget to charge it&lt;br /&gt;- it lasts a while on a single charge. It takes me 10+ minutes to trim my head/goatee and I use it twice before I need to recharge&lt;br /&gt;- you adjust hair length within a 10mm range just by pressing a button and sliding your thumb&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s light compared to electromagnetic (barber shop style) trimmers&lt;br /&gt;- not a lot of attachments to mess with, just 2 length guards. In fact if you stay within one range of lengths (either 1mm to 11mm or 10mm to 20mm) you never have to change anything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The guard (the thing with the teeth that allows you to adjust the hair length) clogs easily when using it on my head. I&#x27;m nearly bald on top and my hair&#x27;s not thick elsewhere so there&#x27;s no reason for that. It helps when I trim my hair every week but I&#x27;d rather go 2 weeks between trims.&lt;br /&gt;- I need to redo the same spots many times in order to get an even trim.You&#x27;d figure 2 or maybe 3 passes would be enough but it feels like 10 in some places&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve yet to find a use for the little detail trimmer. Its placement makes it awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to summarize: It works well enough that I didn&#x27;t feel the need to send it back but I can&#x27;t give it an unreserved recommendation.</li>
    <li> Good performance.  Only using for beard trimming only.  The design and size is good and easy to handle. Charge lasts long and does not have a clumsey charger, just a plug.  Would have liked a setting #2 - setting 1 is to short and setting 3 a bit longer than I would like.  Overall, very happy with my selection and I did do quite a bit of research before I made the purchase.  I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> very disappointed. it makes a great beard trimmer, but the entire reason i chose this as my husbands bday present is because he was looking for a quality beard AND head trimmer. it does not shave his head closely at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we have since purchased a wahl for the same price that works MUCH better.</li>
    <li> Have owned several beard trimmers in the past that suffered from a) weak motors/ battery charged or b)strong motor, but tied to power outlet, won&#x27;t work on 220V or c) adjustable notches that would not stay put while you shave, resulting in uneveness or having to somehow hold the head in place while shaving or d) too many interchangeable heads causing clutter and losing pieces.  This trimmer has solved all of these issues for me.  It is very solid, good strong batter powered motor, just a few heads and very solid adjustments that stay put.</li>
    <li> I love that it can be washed under water. I like the small trimmer that pops up. However, it does not shave as easily as my old norelco T980. Somehow, the blades are not as sharp or the motor less strong. Not sure. There were things about the old T980 that I did not like that are addressed by the Braun.</li>
    <li> Great device. Husband loves it!</li>
    <li> I have had this 3 years back for $45 on amaxom and it is still working strong.&lt;br /&gt;The battery dies after one use now but it is completely functional. It has been well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d paid more attention to the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love Braun stuff.  Been using their shavers for nearly thirty years; travel clocks, wall clocks, other personal hygiene gadgets. The German-made items were fine, worked well, durable, and sometimes repairable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The move into China seems to have trashed their quality control.  Had a clock not long ago that functioned almost as poorly as the Cruzer. This little trimmer works well, while it works, which is one or two days past the warranty. A good size, fits the hand, attachments work ... but what&#x27;s the point when it stops taking a charge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried leaving it on the charger for a couple of weeks [yes, I tested the charger output and that part of the &#x27;made in China&#x27; boxful seems to be fine] to see if I could &#x27;wake up&#x27; the battery.  The green charging light did finally come on after six or seven days, but would revert to flashing green with no motor function when I tried to switch it on.  Repeated this for two weeks; same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switched to a Wahl trimmer, made in USA.  Unlike some major American auto companies, this seems to be an upgrade over the German branded competition.  Here&#x27;s the link for any curious:  http://amzn.com/B001GQ3GEY  It&#x27;s showing $35 today at Amazon; some mixed reviews there, too, but so far so good in our house.</li>
    <li> My Braun shaver is the best shaver I have had. So, when I switched to having a beard, I chose this Braun model. Very happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> This product works well as a beard trimmer</li>
    <li> very good product. also buy the shaver braun 3 series. 3 Series the use Monday through Wednesday and Friday, Saturday and Sunday use is, as 1 mm, since I do not like to bring overgrown beard ... excellent, not they will regret!</li>
    <li> &#x27;EXCELLENT QUALITY&#x27;   I bought that one for three days ago and I can say it&#x27;s good and very smooth on your face the other thing is going to relieze it&#x27;s really good material yep I noticed that because I had used Philips, so i noticed that different.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the quality of the beard trimmer. The blades appear a bit chintzy and instead of cleanly cutting they pulled and tugged at my whiskers while I used the instrument to trim with. I had expected better quality from a Braun product.</li>
    <li> If you have a beard, you need one of these ASAP. It makes groom and mantaining your beard soooo much easier. I honestly don&#x27;t know what I ever did without it. The batter life is great, and the adjustable attachment is a godsend.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this purchase.  It does a great job of keeping my beard neat and trimmed.  However, the battery life is less than I expected.  I use the trimmer a total of maybe 15 minutes per week.  Yet, I am charging it every couple of weeks.  Maybe my expectations are too high but I figured it would only need a charge no more frequently than once a month based on my usage.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and am so pleased with the results!  It has a nice weight and look to it--looks more expensive than it is.</li>
    <li> I have owned many trimmers and this by far is the best one I have owned.  Clean precise anf holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he absolutely love this , easy to use and to clean and saves him alot of time in the morning.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim anywhere near close enough. Holds charge well but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a prime trimming tool. g</li>
    <li> The plastic teeth break way too easily after not much use. That includes the replacement parts I ordered. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this product. Although I love Braun, it is just a very messy trimmer to clean every day. There is not a vacuum so I had to return.</li>
    <li> Meets all expectations!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product as it seemed sturdy and well made but, as the old saying goes, you can&#x27;t judge a book by its cover. I had it for about two years and purchased it based on Braun&#x27;s reputation, i.e. German engineering and all...but it just didn&#x27;t last. Mind you, I had no trouble with the charging and operating time (follow directions for properly charging and discharging) or even how it cut and its power delivery (satisfied on both, I have a heavy, coarse beard, trimmed to stubble and  also used it on my head) but ultimately, after two years of regular use (I dropped it ONE time), it started to degrade and eventually I had to trash it.&lt;br /&gt;First the detail trimmer went (maybe from the fall but it was only knocked off my bathroom counter, maybe three feet) but I was OK with that because while I valued that function I could still trim and groom effectively but soon thereafter the cutting became erratic and I started to experience drag when cutting and that&#x27;s a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, I would not recommend this product as the bottom line seems to be &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; and all the German engineering couldn&#x27;t save it from an early demise as the components were just not up to the demands of everyday use. Just as a reminder, this is NOT a shaver but a trimmer/groomer. On the bright side I saved a bit of money not having to purchase razor blades; talk about a ripoff!&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the Braun with a Panasonic and while it is still early innings it is a promising start, time will tell.</li>
    <li> Purchased for husband for fathers day, he absolutely has no complaints.  he loves all the features, he has no complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> The plastic guard broke after five uses and has press-cut blades, not ground.  Go with a Wahl 9867 instead.</li>
    <li> I use the Braum Cruser 6 Beard and Head Trimmer mainly to trim my beard.  I have had a beard for over twenty-five years and must rate this as one of the best if not the best trimmer I have ever owned or used.</li>
    <li> Relatively inexpensive, nice and small to travel with but just the right size for trimming my beard, which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap trimmer. I went by the positive reviews of this machine, and got it. Going by the good price and apparent good reviews is not an option. The first two months worked fine, and I always followed the correct timings for full charging. After that time it just started to loose and loose power, after every full charge, to the point of as soon as you turn on to trim the beard, the red light starts going off after 2 minutes. You can&#x27;t even be comfortable doing just the beard without thinking of having enough power to finish your face. So enerving!</li>
    <li> Excellent, well-designed product. I use it for weekly beard trims and the two clips provide a good variety of lengths to choose from. I actually wear my beard rather long, so I have been impressed with regard to the height of the largest clip. With trimming once a week and each trim lasting about 10 minutes, I only charge the trimmer once a month. Even then, the battery still has plenty of charge left to it. I would highly recommend these to anyone with a beard.</li>
    <li> How well it works really depends on what your using it for.  For me it does a great job cleaning up facial hair and general trimming.  But if you try to use this to cut your hair you will run into a little trouble.  The long hairs seem to clog up the head trimmer pieces and you constantly have to take them off and remove the hair.  The design of the trimmer itself is nice, it has a nice grip and is very lightweight.  The battery holds a charge for a full haircut and trim so I&#x27;m happy with that as well.</li>
    <li> works perfectly and very smoothly, very high and comfortable usage experience&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good  money worthy product, cruzer 6 beard % head trimmer is totally what you need</li>
    <li> This product works well so when the first one stopped working after a year I tried another.  It also worked only for about a year.  I only use it about once a week, so it&#x27;s not overused.  I&#x27;m switching brands.</li>
    <li> Weak motor.  Weak battery.  This is a $12 beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Good. Worth for money</li>
    <li> Works very well for beard and mustache trimming.  I wish it were easier to clean though.</li>
    <li> Nice adjustable trimmer. Many settings. Good power. Battery lasts.</li>
    <li> I purchased it about 6 months ago and the batteries died out. There is no indication, anywhere of how or where to replace the batteries and there is no representation for Braun where I live. I guess it was bad luck and a bad investment. I&#x27;ll just have to buy a new one...Not Braun for sure!</li>
    <li> Nice tool to trim, especially hair. I would like this item more to trim my hair rather than my beard. I am satisfied with the service.</li>
    <li> I use this for trimming my beard only.  This is actually my second Cruzer6 head and beard trimmer, two of the blue prongs on the beard guard somehow snapped and broke while it was in the vanity drawer.  Not that it&#x27;s totally Brauns fault since I don&#x27;t recall gently placing the trimmer down. I never called Braun to see if they sold just the beard guard but they don&#x27;t list it their parts website either, although if you lose the little cleaning brush, you can buy that. There is some peace of mind for you. Other than that the trimmer is excellent, gave it 4 stars only because of the beard guard snafu.</li>
    <li> **2nd Update (as of 8/30/2013):  I contacted Braun by phone today.  They informed me that attachments are NOT covered by warranty.  If I want a replacement part, I have to pay $22 to a third-party website.  I&#x27;m displeased.  I could spend $16 more and buy an entirely brand-new trimmer, that would come with the replacement part I need AND one more of everything else (including another trimmer!)  Here is the site I found where Braun list the part numbers:  [...] (used bitly bcos it was a long URL).  Here is the third-party site where you actually buy the parts:  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE (as of 08/11/2013):  Several of the \\&quot;combs\\&quot; on the blue attachment broke today.  LESS THAN 1 YEAR after purchase.  For the record, I was very careful with this thing because my last trimmer suffered a similar fate, and finding replacements is just an inconvenient hassle for something used daily.  Didn&#x27;t drop it.  In fact I never once dropped it.  Plan to review warranty and/or look for replacement attachment,  but in the meantime... unkempt facial hair.  Changed 4 star rating to 3 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a TON of research by reading reviews and looking all over the internet for input on buying a product like this.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  I would buy this product again.  The one thing I would change, or intend to look for next time I buy something like this, is more variation in the length options (and maybe a stand or wall attachment vs. the travel bag this came with, even though it is sufficient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device comes with 2 attachments, one with options for 1, 3, 5, 7 , 9, &amp; 11mm, and the other with 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, &amp; 20mm lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious about what I could do with 2 &amp; 4mm lengths, because in my opinion, as the hair gets shorter, the difference in appearance becomes more \\&quot;drastic\\&quot; or clear, and therefore more fine, which affects the \\&quot;clean\\&quot;  look of the lines along the edges of my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also...  The battery seems solid so far, the weight is comfortable in my hand, the attachments appear durable (so far), and the slide up mini blade is a nice touch.The battery seems solid so far, the weight is comfortable in my hand, the attachments appear durable (so far), and the slide up mini blade is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, was hoping for a bit more oomph but maybe I just have a beard made of wire! Keep catching myself with the trimmer.....overall, a good product though.</li>
    <li> Really love it, nice even shave. Feels much better than a $15 remming ton i was using. I feel the durability with the cruzer 6. I&#x27;d recommend it for whomever. I&#x27;d about long beards, but i set it to 3 and as long as i do it every two days, its simple and doesn&#x27;t become a project. If i wait too long, then it takes time cause i have a thick beard.</li>
    <li> Item works fine overall but has a fairly weak battery and must recharge every couple of days.  Works fine for basic trimming needs.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after growing out my facial hair for \\&quot;no shave november\\&quot; and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Unlike less expensive razors this one gives you a number of lengths to choose from which is nice if your beard doesn&#x27;t all grow in at the same speed. Easy to clean and use, completely water proof, and the extra touch up razor works really well, I use that more than I expected. You could go for the Cruzer 5 and save some money, but the battery life on the 6 Is way better, makes it much easier to travel with. I&#x27;m probably buying my dad one for Christmas as well.</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelco trimmers prior to this one. I miss the adjustment length mechanism of the norelco but the Braun is more accurate at trimming facial hair.  The cut is cleaner and the small, pop up trimmer works well for details. It does seem to take a little longer to get all the cutting done.&lt;br /&gt;I used it to keep my hair very short on my head.  I already had it fairly short and it didn&#x27;t catch or pull at all for me. This was with frequent pauses to clear out any hair build up.  It might not be the best trimmer for keeping your hair extremely short if you were cutting it from a much longer length.  Once you are just maintaining after cutting it very short, it isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that the battery holds up better in this.  The Norelco&#x27;s always have a short battery life.  Other Braun products I&#x27;ve owned haven&#x27;t had issues with batteries. This trimmer is also compatible for travel to Europe while the Norelco&#x27;s(at least the older ones) were not.&lt;br /&gt;I am not super impressed with feel of the quality of the interchangeable trimmer combs.  The feel flimsy.</li>
    <li> This was my first real trimmer so I thought it was great for awhile. There are so many better trimmers out there for the same price with actual features. It&#x27;s very basic all around, and does an okay job of trimming facial hair. Battery life is horrible. If you can finally finish trimming you&#x27;ll see why investing in a trimmer with a vacuum and better battery life is best.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever had.  The length settings are perfect.  I will never buy another brand after using Braun.  Perfect gift for any man!</li>
    <li> Great Beard Trimmer for the money.  i love the fact that its water proof so i can use it in the shower and it will also clean easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been frustrated with this since I first used it, and I feel misled by all the positive press and reviews it has gotten. I give it two stars because technically it works, and it hasn&#x27;t had any mechanical issues, although it does get extremely hot, even after cleaning it and oiling the blades. But bottom line, it&#x27;s just not a good product.&lt;br /&gt;First, this thing is cheaply made. The trimmer attachment has too much play so it doesn&#x27;t achieve a consistent length. Since the first use, I&#x27;ve gotten frequent pulls with every trimming, regardless of how charged the battery is, and the battery runs out of juice like that&#x27;s its job. Another annoyance is the lack of short length settings. It seems obvious to me that there should be more options at shorter lengths, and while I haven&#x27;t seen this in any trimmer, this one forces me to choose between too short (1mm) and too long (3mm). Boo.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few beard trimmers and have yet to be very satisfied by anything, but this thing is the worst I&#x27;ve experienced.&lt;br /&gt;My advice: don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I read the poor reviews before I bought this trimmer and I still bought it. The reviews were right this is the worst trimmer ever, I&#x27;m suprised it even cuts hail at all.</li>
    <li> Had an older Phillips beard trimmer but it slow disintegrated over the years as combs shed teeth....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this Braun trimmer so far ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet,  No hair pulling, beard comb works wonderfully and I don&#x27;t need to be extra careful and fearful of having the comb change depth or worse fall off which shaving....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.....</li>
    <li> Product oozes quality.&lt;br /&gt;Love the rubber feel.&lt;br /&gt;Only criticism is that the beard comb settings jump up in 2mm increments, beginning at 1mm. There is a big difference between those two lengths if you are a designer stubble man like myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 15 months. I bought it as a beard trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be large enough to handle full haircuts though. Best feature is that  you can use it corded or cordless. The green/red LED battery level indicator makes it easy to tell when it needs a charge and when it&#x27;s full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest issue I have is with the short comb/guide. The one that&#x27;s is blue and grey. The individual blue guides break off much too easily. I haven&#x27;t subjected mine to heavy use. I trim about every 7 to 10 days. Still one of the blue guides broke within six months—less than 25 uses. Two were gone before a year was up. I&#x27;ve concluded it&#x27;s a defective design. Other reviews here mention the same problem. And all the sites that sell Braun replacement parts are backordered on that particular comb. Also the replacement part is $21—approximately half the cost of a new trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m babying mine in hopes of getting a few more months use before a third comb blade breaks. At that point I&#x27;ll probably go with a different trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to avoid this product unless you plan to use it without the comb/guide.</li>
    <li> 3 mm beard for me is too long&lt;br /&gt;While 1 mm is very short&lt;br /&gt;Cuts well though, and powerful.</li>
    <li> To trim your beard simply adjust the comb and begin trimming. It was very precise and the pop-up trimmer was great for the details!</li>
