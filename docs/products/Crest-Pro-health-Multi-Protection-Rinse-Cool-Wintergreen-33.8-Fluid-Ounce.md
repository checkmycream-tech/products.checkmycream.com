### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Cool-Wintergreen is best flavor...</li>
      <li>It is especially good if I have a snack but don&#x27;t want to brush my</li>
      <li>Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse is SUPERB...</li>
      <li>Excellent rinse.</li>
      <li>Of greatest concern is that parabens are known to disrupt hormone function, an effect that is linked to increased risk of breast cancer and reproductive toxicity.</li>
      <li>best part about this mouthwash for my family is that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your breath smelling great and lasts quite a while.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>When I saw that Crest now makes a multiprotection rinse that helps prevent against plaque and gingivitis as well as serving as a mouthwash, it seemed like a great way to boost my dental health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seems like a good mouthwash.</li>
      <li>My dentist has been very pleased at my progress.</li>
      <li>and it works better for me!  </li>
      <li>Despite the fact that the burn is what makes me feel like it&#x27;s doing its job, there is more burn in this than the version with the alcohol!  </li>
      <li>This is an effective mouth rinse.</li>
      <li>This is a nice minty flavored mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Tastes nice and does not burn.</li>
      <li>Taste is great and leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>It tastes great, and leaves my mouth feeling clean and breathe smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am completely happy with its performance; however, its cool wintergreen flavor is gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>am in no way an expert or authority on these matters-- just a reasonably intelligent woman who tries to make the best health choices I can for my daughter and myself.</li>
      <li>This has a very strong, almost biting flavor.</li>
      <li>This kind of rinse is fine, but it just did not excite me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it helps the gums as well, but it&#x27;s no substitute for flossing</li>
      <li>I am used to more &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; mouth rinse.  </li>
      <li>I like the non-alcohol versions much much better</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ll stick to my favorite one Listerine no alcohol.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because of that, this is safe for kids as well as adults.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am much more used to a milder flavor with wintergreen.</li>
      <li>Crest is probably okay on the \\&quot;winter,\\&quot; but they sure could work on that \\&quot;green.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>The label warns use of this product could cause staining and then suggests that&#x27;s okay because a dentist can remove it.</li>
      <li>Do you care about your customers more than Crest?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this wintergreen version a bit more than the mint, since I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the more refreshing taste of wintergreen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to have a non-mint option.</li>
      <li>Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse in Cool Wintergreen has a pleasant wintergreen flavor but lacks the invigorating tingling that I enjoy because it is alcohol-free.  </li>
      <li>Scope Original Mint Mouthwash 50.7 Fl Oz]] for years and liked it,</li>
      <li>My dental health is not the best due to taking prescription medication that dries out my mouth at night, which cavity causing bacteria love.</li>
      <li>(Conveniently doesn&#x27;t even address the question of taste loss; anecdotal as it is, I experienced complete loss of taste)&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
      <li>Ah, I see: they are all Vine Voices, most reviewing the product for free.</li>
      <li>rinse comes in an easy to used bottle with a pleasing contour.</li>
      <li>My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I think the mouthwash has a pretty good taste, and my fresh breath lasted for about three hours.</li>
      <li>Why is that important?</li>
      <li>Interestingly, my husband and teenager like this flavor better because they say it tastes and feels more like &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34; Clearly they have had nerve damage on the insides of their mouths from using Listerine.</li>
      <li>how a rinse tastes is important since you&#x27;ll be tasting it for some time after use.</li>
      <li>have to say that while the Crest rinse was pleasant tasting, it didn&#x27;t have that same strong burst of flavor that the Scope products have.</li>
      <li>I was excited to get the Crest pro Health multiprotection rinse until I read the label.</li>
      <li>From what I can tell, this is the non-alcoholic version of Crest&#x27;s \\&quot;Invigorating Clean Mint\\&quot; mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>Squeaky clean teeth, just rub your tongue on them mmm...</li>
      <li>But it does leave me with a clean feeling in my mouth.</li>
      <li>mouthwash makes me mouth feel clean, doesn&#x27;t burn, and still manages to provide a bit of a tingle.</li>
      <li>(can&#x27;t feel that squeaky clean anymore!)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant taste to me, and the clean smell of the rinse seems to last for some time.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t describe the taste as great, but I like it much better than harsh mouthwashes that leave your mouth burning.</li>
      <li>Crest Crest Pro Health Cool Wintergreen Mouth Wash is a mild tasting , alcohol free, mouth wash.</li>
      <li>Fresh mint, smooth mint, clean mint and invigorating mint.</li>
      <li>Wintergreen tho has no color transfer, great taste and no alcohol which even tho minimal in each bottle will add to the destruction of your teeth...</li>
      <li>you like really sweet tasting rinses</li>
      <li>The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but... it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
      <li>It works quickly, and it never develops that stinging burning that Listerine is known for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 Crest Mouthwashes in the last month and this one is definitely the best.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So while the performance of this rinse was adequate, I will pass until they change the formulation.</li>
      <li>I like to use it between brushings for a quick freshen up.</li>
      <li>do have a clean mouth after rinsing with Crest Pro-Health Cool Wintergreen, so aside from the flavor I can give it positive feedback in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you do get a &#x27;fresh&#x27; sensation after rinsing</li>
      <li>Because alcohol can be absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth.</li>
      <li>this may be worth a shot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to take this kind of a risk and only those who go to the dentist every 6 months might.</li>
      <li>short, I love the mixing of the alcohol free prohealth mouthwash with a crispy wintergreen flavor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse might be a good option for someone who really needs a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol or needs more help with plaque and gingivitis prevention, but for me, I&#x27;ll go back to Scope for longer lasting fresh breath and leave the other features to my Crest toothpaste, which does a fine job on its own.</li>
      <li>Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse (cool wintergreen) is a satisfactory rinse that does a good job freshening breath, but I&#x27;m not excited about the product.</li>
      <li>While its use has been FDA approved, I think there are more natural, less toxic and equally effective ingredients available.</li>
      <li>Second, many people can&#x27;t afford to go to the dentist for problems like cavities and live with the pain, how will they be able to go get their teeth cleaned from using this product?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and a nice change from the usual mint.</li>
      <li>mention all this because I think everyone should be aware of what&#x27;s \\&quot;out there\\&quot; and then make their own decisions about whether or not they believe the research and potential dangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Because of this, brushing my teeth resulted in extreme pain, and I was worried about whether I had done a decent job - so having this to (hopefully) do what it says was a great relief.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was concerned enough when it was on my skin, but I sure don&#x27;t want parabens in my mouthwash, which has a more direct possibility of getting into my body.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, bit I like a little more &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; and a stronger wintergreen flavor.</li>
      <li>Four stars are well deserved but be aware that this is not an anti-cavity mouth wash, it&#x27;s an anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis.</li>
      <li>I was apprehensive about using this product, for fear that it would just be more of the same.  </li>
      <li>I thought this rinse might be a more palatable alternative to Listerine Total Care.  </li>
      <li>such a prevalent problem, you would think Crest, Amazon, or the FDA would pull this off the shelves, rather than getting 3, and mostly 4-5 star ratings from &#x27;uncompromised&#x27; Vine Voice</li>
      <li>I cannot speak of the &amp;#34;multi-protection&amp;#34; benefits, but if I prefer a different mouthwash, I will use the one I like more often than this one.  </li>
      <li>The user should be aware of this, as some people claim they cause cancer (I&#x27;m too uninformed about that topic to state an opinion, but some people might wish to look into it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wintergreen taste was appealing to everyone in the family that uses mouthwash, and I found that the fresh feeling lasted for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>an antiseptic that kills bacteria and other microorganisms [and ...] has been shown to be effective in preventing dental plaque and reducing gingivitis\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dental visits don&#x27;t rate high on my fun things to do list</li>
      <li>I have used a couple of Crest Pro-Health mouthwashes, Including this one and the &#x27;Refreshing Clean Mint&#x27;, and they all have the same general affect:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>drink a lot of black coffee, so while it doesn&#x27;t give me coffee breath like with milk, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still noticeable, and I don&#x27;t want it to be!</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no alcohol in it, so no pain or stinging when you swish it around, but the taste of wintergreen lasts long and gives a refreshing taste that lingers in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Crest \\&quot;Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse\\&quot; is a good mouthwash choice for those needing help with dry-mouth (like me), but it it not very good tasting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The star is taken off because I really did find it too strong for my personal preference.</li>
      <li>so my dentist really wants me to use some sort of dental rinse.</li>
      <li>Those are reasonable.</li>
      <li>much worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Being friends with people taking Antabuse, I know they are cautioned about using mouthwash for that very reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The ironic thing is that it says they don&#x27;t use alcohol so that you don&#x27;t get that burn.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of alcohol in mouthwash, so I was grateful to realize that this particular one was alcohol free.</li>
      <li>The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash in the Invigorating Clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn&#x27;t use Yellow #5, and used #6.</li>
      <li>and I believe that my teeth were clean because I brushed them not because I rinsed with Pro-Health</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this rinse for a few weeks, and after the first week or two, I noticed that my teeth were covered with brown stains. Nothing in my diet, lifestyle, or hygiene had changed, so I waited to see if they&#x27;d disappear, but they haven&#x27;t. I went to the dentist today, and they narrowed it down to this Crest rinse I started using. The problem is well-documented in the dental community and online (just do a search for staining related to the active ingredient, Cetylpyridinium Chloride).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to get rid of the stains, especially between teeth, is an ultrasonic cleaning by my dentist (a regular cleaning today wasn&#x27;t sufficient), which will put me back $125. I&#x27;m a bit outraged that the bottle doesn&#x27;t warn you of the seriousness of the risk, even if it only happens to a minority of users.</li>
    <li> Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse is SUPERB...Cool-Wintergreen is best flavor...Crest has one that&#x27;s blue, but it transferred that blue to my gums and teeth...read it&#x27;s back label..Wintergreen tho has no color transfer, great taste and no alcohol which even tho minimal in each bottle will add to the destruction of your teeth...This should be your \\&quot;rinse for life\\&quot;..</li>
    <li> I have used a couple of Crest Pro-Health mouthwashes, Including this one and the &#x27;Refreshing Clean Mint&#x27;, and they all have the same general affect:&lt;br /&gt;1. Squeaky clean teeth, just rub your tongue on them mmm...&lt;br /&gt;2. Not much burning (it will if you do it long / vigorously enough)&lt;br /&gt;3. Odd, lasting burning that comes up an hour or so later (unless I got a pressure washer in my mouth, couldn&#x27;t rinse much better)&lt;br /&gt;3. Tongue numbness for a couple days (can&#x27;t feel that squeaky clean anymore!)&lt;br /&gt;4. Loss of taste (several days, slowly, ever so slowly returning)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why does this Product have such a high rating? Ah, I see: they are all Vine Voices, most reviewing the product for free. How&#x27;s that for not affecting the review, Amazon? All other Crest Pro-Health product reviews follow suit: 4-5 stars from Vine Voices, 1-2 star from EVERYONE else.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard time and time again people having the same experience as I: &#x27;chemical&#x27; burn feeling, kills taste, &#x27;layer of tongue came off&#x27; (was quite unnerving).&lt;br /&gt;With such a prevalent problem, you would think Crest, Amazon, or the FDA would pull this off the shelves, rather than getting 3, and mostly 4-5 star ratings from &#x27;uncompromised&#x27; Vine Voice reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be dangerous, Amazon. Do you care about your customers more than Crest?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Took a look at Crest&#x27;s product FAQ, directly debunks all claims of harm, but then admits to the problem. Here&#x27;s an example:&lt;br /&gt;-\\&quot;Does Crest Pro-Health Rinse cause taste loss?&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health Rinse does NOT cause PERMANENT taste alteration.\\&quot; (Conveniently doesn&#x27;t even address the question of taste loss; anecdotal as it is, I experienced complete loss of taste)&lt;br /&gt;-- However, it causes taste &#x27;alteration&#x27; (loss), just as long as you&#x27;re using the product --&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Oral care products containing active ingredient CPC may cause a temporary aftertaste, or temporary change in the taste of food, in a small percentage of people.&lt;br /&gt;CPC stays in the mouth for long periods of time, which allows the rinse to provide its 12-hour benefit.&lt;br /&gt;Aftertaste/change in the taste of food typically goes away shortly after product use is stopped.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;http://209.225.27.197/prohealth/mouthwashFAQ.jsp#10</li>
    <li> One note....some of the review not spitting out colored bits.  I believe those bits are plaque.  The reason I believe this is that my I have noticed my tongue is cleaner than it was before I used Crest Pro Health.&lt;br /&gt;  I have to amend an earlier review!  Some Pro Health mouthwash products DO contain alcohol.  I found this out the hard way as I happened to buy a version that did and none of the info I saw in Amazon mentioned that!  I like the non-alcohol versions much much better and it works better for me!  The alcohol to me is just not necessary!</li>
    <li> Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse (cool wintergreen) is a satisfactory rinse that does a good job freshening breath, but I&#x27;m not excited about the product. I did not experience any bad side effects with the rinse, nor did I have any moth or throat pains as a result of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant taste to me, and the clean smell of the rinse seems to last for some time. Yet I&#x27;m not sure that I would use it again since I prefer a different flavor. This kind of rinse is fine, but it just did not excite me. I prefer a stronger type of rinse.</li>
    <li> While I like non-alcohol-based rinses, I was not pleased with this. On the plus side, it provides the same benefits as other rinses and does it without the burning sensation I get from those with alcohol. Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how a rinse tastes is important since you&#x27;ll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than \\&quot;fresh mint\\&quot; tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I&#x27;ve not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like really sweet tasting rinses this may be worth a shot. For me, however, it was not something I&#x27;d use again.</li>
    <li> This Crest \\&quot;Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse\\&quot; is a good mouthwash choice for those needing help with dry-mouth (like me), but it it not very good tasting. My dental health is not the best due to taking prescription medication that dries out my mouth at night, which cavity causing bacteria love. This mouthwash does seem to help with the dry-mouth and also leaves my mouth feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> The Pro-Health mouthwash is less of an &#x27;all purpose&#x27; product and claims to be formulated to fight plaque and gingivitis. I can&#x27;t say that I have any of these but the active ingredient, cetylpyridinium chloride \\&quot;is an antiseptic that kills bacteria and other microorganisms [and ...] has been shown to be effective in preventing dental plaque and reducing gingivitis\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label lists six various &#x27;benefits&#x27; including a couple of largely meaningless ones such as &#x27;keeps teeth cleaner longer&#x27; (cleaner than what? longer than what?) or &#x27;no burn of alcohol&#x27; but, yeah, I don&#x27;t mind &#x27;no alcohol&#x27; in a mouth wash. There is no aftertaste and you do get a &#x27;fresh&#x27; sensation after rinsing and I believe that my teeth were clean because I brushed them not because I rinsed with Pro-Health but... it&#x27;s not a bad product. Four stars are well deserved but be aware that this is not an anti-cavity mouth wash, it&#x27;s an anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis.</li>
    <li> This is an effective mouth rinse. I am completely happy with its performance; however, its cool wintergreen flavor is gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering, while rinsing, if toilet bowl cleaner would have a similar taste - not that I was going to try and find out. My only other wintergreen reference comes from a hard roll candy of which I am quite fond, and based on that reference, Crest&#x27;s version of wintergreen is nothing near similar. Even without the roll candy reference, I would find the flavor of this Crest rinse displeasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a clean mouth after rinsing with Crest Pro-Health Cool Wintergreen, so aside from the flavor I can give it positive feedback in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all comes down to the flavor. Crest is probably okay on the \\&quot;winter,\\&quot; but they sure could work on that \\&quot;green.\\&quot; It is a four-star rinse with a two-star flavor - I shall average the two together for the product&#x27;s overall score.</li>
    <li> Excellent rinse. Tastes nice and does not burn. I cannot be sure that it will be effective over the long haul as i have not yet had a dental check up, but it seems to my untrained eye to be as effective as the Listerine I have been using which has considerable alcohol and is unpleasant to rinse with.</li>
    <li> I thought this rinse might be a more palatable alternative to Listerine Total Care.  But with average performance and a questionable active ingredient, it is unlikely that I will use this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rinse comes in an easy to used bottle with a pleasing contour. I did not particuarly care for the wintergreen flavor, it was rather sweet, mint-like and artificial. But my major concern come from the potential side effects for the active ingredient, cetylpridinium chloride. While it has antiseptic, anesthetic and disinfectant properties it is used in bug poisons as well as dental preparations. While its use has been FDA approved, I think there are more natural, less toxic and equally effective ingredients available. Moreover this ingredient has been known to cause browning of the teeth as well as intefering with the sense of taste. The bottle label warns of the discoloration risk but claims that the staining is neither permanent nor harmful. It claims such stains may be removed by brushing or \\&quot;at your next dental visit\\&quot;. If my teeth suddenly browned, I don&#x27;t think I would want to wait for my next regularly scheduled dental visit. Dental visits don&#x27;t rate high on my fun things to do list and I would rather not spend my discretionary income on removing tooth discoloration caused by a mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while the performance of this rinse was adequate, I will pass until they change the formulation.</li>
    <li> Typically, when one uses a mouthwash after brushing, the alcohol content in it is enough to make you feel as if you are swishing your mouth with some type of corrosive acid.  I was apprehensive about using this product, for fear that it would just be more of the same.  I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that this mouthwash does not burn or sting.  There is some tingling, but nothing like the your typical mouthwash.  It also seemed to take care of anything left after brushing and flossing better than other brands.  I would certainly buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been a Crest fan, and so, without surprise I was equally enamored by how much I enjoyed this mouthwash.  It tastes great, and leaves my mouth feeling clean and breathe smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to buy Crest products!</li>
    <li> Crest Crest Pro Health Cool Wintergreen Mouth Wash is a mild tasting , alcohol free, mouth wash. I wouldn&#x27;t describe the taste as great, but I like it much better than harsh mouthwashes that leave your mouth burning. Like another popular brand, Crest Pro Health Mouth Wash kills 99% of common germs that can cause plaque, gingivitis and bad breath. I like to use it between brushings for a quick freshen up. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wintergreen mouthwashes always suit me better than the various mint flavors that come in blue rinses. I don&#x27;t think this flavor is too different from any wintergreen product that doesn&#x27;t contain sugar or the artificial sugars in many mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash makes me mouth feel clean, doesn&#x27;t burn, and still manages to provide a bit of a tingle. I have used the various other Prohealth rinses off and on for years and my teeth are no more stained than they ever were...and this is with copious coffee and tea drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I love the mixing of the alcohol free prohealth mouthwash with a crispy wintergreen flavor.</li>
    <li> Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse in Cool Wintergreen has a pleasant wintergreen flavor but lacks the invigorating tingling that I enjoy because it is alcohol-free.  It does leave a little aftertaste and it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride which is helpful for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I think that Crest mouthwashes tens to have a bitter aftertaste. For first few second I like this one, it taste almost like a spearmint chewing gum, except there&#x27;s no sweetness. It is a bit bitter and this lingered in my mouth for quite a while. i&#x27;ll stick to my favorite one Listerine no alcohol.</li>
    <li> I am used to more &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; mouth rinse.  I cannot speak of the &amp;#34;multi-protection&amp;#34; benefits, but if I prefer a different mouthwash, I will use the one I like more often than this one.  It&#x27;s ok, bit I like a little more &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; and a stronger wintergreen flavor.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to this mouthwash&#x27;s long-term dental benefits...that takes months to determine, and even then, who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use mouthwash/rinse for basically one reason, to enliven the mouth after the grunge of the day or morning. I&#x27;m sure it helps the gums as well, but it&#x27;s no substitute for flossing, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink a lot of black coffee, so while it doesn&#x27;t give me coffee breath like with milk, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still noticeable, and I don&#x27;t want it to be! So I use rinses for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this one and immediately noticed an improvement. It works quickly, and it never develops that stinging burning that Listerine is known for. I felt refreshed and cleaner, and didn&#x27;t have that coffee aftertaste, which I assume indicates coffee breath. I like it, at least for this specifc use.</li>
    <li> The mouthwash burn sensation in the Crest Pro-Health mouthwashes is stronger than in some of the other Crest formulas, but is similar to the Scope mouthwash burn. I&#x27;m a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn, so the strength of it is usually the first thing I notice when trying out a new mouthwash. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband. So it seems to work well. It leaves your breath smelling great and lasts quite a while. I like this wintergreen version a bit more than the mint, since I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the more refreshing taste of wintergreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this mouthwash, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a sever food allergy to Yellow #5 and can&#x27;t use or eat anything with that food coloring it it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead to create the mouthwashes green color. The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash in the Invigorating Clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn&#x27;t use Yellow #5, and used #6. So anyone with this food coloring sensitivity who wants to try these out, can do so knowing these won&#x27;t have Yellow #5 in them.</li>
    <li> I have problems with my teeth so my dentist really wants me to use some sort of dental rinse. I tried this version because it is alcohol free but still claims to kill 99% of the germs that cause plaque, gingivitis and bad breath. It does not have fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the wintergreen taste and it does not have an alcohol taste. It makes my breath smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a fluoride mouth rinse at night and this during the day.  It is especially good if I have a snack but don&#x27;t want to brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> From what I can tell, this is the non-alcoholic version of Crest&#x27;s \\&quot;Invigorating Clean Mint\\&quot; mouthwash.  Instead of the alcohol, which is a natural (and tasty) preservative, you get parabens.  The user should be aware of this, as some people claim they cause cancer (I&#x27;m too uninformed about that topic to state an opinion, but some people might wish to look into it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, this actually tastes very good, whereas every non-alcoholic mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever had before (mostly in hotels) has been horrible.  The ironic thing is that it says they don&#x27;t use alcohol so that you don&#x27;t get that burn.  Despite the fact that the burn is what makes me feel like it&#x27;s doing its job, there is more burn in this than the version with the alcohol!  Admittedly, that burn is slightly different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a good mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used mouthwash after brushing and flossing for years. When I saw that Crest now makes a multiprotection rinse that helps prevent against plaque and gingivitis as well as serving as a mouthwash, it seemed like a great way to boost my dental health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B000052YD8 Scope Original Mint Mouthwash 50.7 Fl Oz]] for years and liked it, but of course it is only a mouthwash. Also, unlike the Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse-Cool Wintergreen, Scope contains alcohol. Not a big deal for me, but if I can achieve the same results with a product that doesn&#x27;t contain alchohol, why not do it? For recovering alcholics, this would be a much bigger selling point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that while the Crest rinse was pleasant tasting, it didn&#x27;t have that same strong burst of flavor that the Scope products have. Perhaps that is due to the lack of alcohol in the Crest version, but perhaps it is simply another difference in the formulas. Whichever the case, I don&#x27;t feel that the Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse lasts as long as either the original mint Scope or the new [[ASIN:B002P8F4ZG Scope Outlast Mouthwash-Long Lasting Mint-25 oz, 750 milliter]] that I have recently tried as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse might be a good option for someone who really needs a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol or needs more help with plaque and gingivitis prevention, but for me, I&#x27;ll go back to Scope for longer lasting fresh breath and leave the other features to my Crest toothpaste, which does a fine job on its own.</li>
    <li> I seriously do not like mediciny tasting anything - and this was as close to Listerine as you can get without the stinging sensation. Interestingly, my husband and teenager like this flavor better because they say it tastes and feels more like &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34; Clearly they have had nerve damage on the insides of their mouths from using Listerine. Clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now understand that we need two kinds of Crest rinse, 6 kinds of Crest toothpaste, four kinds of shampoo, three kinds of conditioner, and three different razors. It&#x27;s really gotten pretty silly.  Except the razors.  Those are reasonable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of alcohol in mouthwash, so I was grateful to realize that this particular one was alcohol free. Why is that important? Because alcohol can be absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth. Being friends with people taking Antabuse, I know they are cautioned about using mouthwash for that very reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of that, this is safe for kids as well as adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor - I am much more used to a milder flavor with wintergreen. This has a very strong, almost biting flavor. But it does leave me with a clean feeling in my mouth. At the time I tested this, I had a severe ear infection and was unable to open my mouth except for the tiniest amount. Because of this, brushing my teeth resulted in extreme pain, and I was worried about whether I had done a decent job - so having this to (hopefully) do what it says was a great relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The star is taken off because I really did find it too strong for my personal preference.</li>
    <li> This is a nice minty flavored mouthwash. It does not contain alcohol so you won&#x27;t get that burning feeling, but you still get a bit of a tingling sensation on your tongue. These alcohol-free mouthwashes tend to give me a dry-tongue feeling that I find annoying. I also don&#x27;t feel the fresh breath sensation lasts very long with these kinds of mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get the Crest pro Health multiprotection rinse until I read the label. The label warns use of this product could cause staining and then suggests that&#x27;s okay because a dentist can remove it. First, I don&#x27;t want staining, so I did a web search on pro health products and decided this wasn&#x27;t going anywhere near my mouth. Second, many people can&#x27;t afford to go to the dentist for problems like cavities and live with the pain, how will they be able to go get their teeth cleaned from using this product? No thanks</li>
    <li> Crest has a bunch of specialized mouth rinses, and the Pro-Health Multiprotection rinse in Wintergreen is one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no alcohol in it, so no pain or stinging when you swish it around, but the taste of wintergreen lasts long and gives a refreshing taste that lingers in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been working hard on reversing the gingivitis in my mouth through a variety of methods. My dentist has been very pleased at my progress. Crest Pro-Health products are part of that regimen. Depending upon your taste, I can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough.</li>
    <li> Wintergreen flavor rocks&#x27;!</li>
    <li> First, the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium chloride 0.07%&lt;br /&gt;Inactive ingredients: water, glycerin, propylene glycol, flavor, poloxamer 407, methylparaben, propylparaben, sodium saccharine, yellow 6, green 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in no way an expert or authority on these matters-- just a reasonably intelligent woman who tries to make the best health choices I can for my daughter and myself. A few years ago I began reading about the potential harmful effects of parabens, which are used as preservatives in cosmetics. According to the respected nonprofit Environmental Working Group, \\&quot;Parabens are linked to cancer, endocrine disruption, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity and skin irritation. Since parabens are used to kill bacteria in water-based solutions, they inherently have some toxicity to cells... Of greatest concern is that parabens are known to disrupt hormone function, an effect that is linked to increased risk of breast cancer and reproductive toxicity. Parabens mimic estrogen by binding to estrogen receptors on cells.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed to find parabens in mouthwash; before this, I&#x27;d heard of them only in cosmetics/sunscreen. I was concerned enough when it was on my skin, but I sure don&#x27;t want parabens in my mouthwash, which has a more direct possibility of getting into my body. (Sure, you spit it out, but you also swallow small amounts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention all this because I think everyone should be aware of what&#x27;s \\&quot;out there\\&quot; and then make their own decisions about whether or not they believe the research and potential dangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I think the mouthwash has a pretty good taste, and my fresh breath lasted for about three hours. I just think there are safer options.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 Crest Mouthwashes in the last month and this one is definitely the best.  The wintergreen taste was appealing to everyone in the family that uses mouthwash, and I found that the fresh feeling lasted for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this mouthwash for my family is that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol.  Thus this bottle is going in the children&#x27;s bathroom.  Not that they would be stupid enough to drink mouthwash, but currently my daughter is on medication where any form of alcohol is best avoided.</li>
    <li> The Crest Pro-Health line has several different flavors of mint. Fresh mint, smooth mint, clean mint and invigorating mint. How much mint do you actually need? It&#x27;s refreshing to have a non-mint option. I like the wintergreen flavor. It&#x27;s refreshing and a nice change from the usual mint.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been to a dentist in years- no cavities. P&amp;G admits it can stain my teeth and the dentist can remove it. I&#x27;m not going to take this kind of a risk and only those who go to the dentist every 6 months might. So no twice a day for me. I prefer the Wintergreen taste over the Mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Multiprotection after breakfast because I would like the benefits for my gums. Then I&#x27;m using the Crest 3D White Rinse at bedtime to whiten and if need be counteract any staining by Multiprotection. I do notice the coffee and tea stains are lightening and there seems to be no staining from the Multiprotection after one week of use.</li>
    <li> Thus mouthwash contains no alchol!  Taste is great and leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  Have used it after brushing and flossing and also just to freshen my breadth before leaving house.</li>
</ol>
