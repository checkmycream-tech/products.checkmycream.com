      <li>especially good for long hair.</li>

      <li>This brush is not only attractive, it feels nice in your hand and it serves</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand easily.</li>
      <li>However, the design is easily scratched, but this does not affect the performance, just its aesthetic appeal.</li>
      <li>This brush is still going strong.  </li>

      <li>but it still works fine as a brush</li>

      <li>and it was cheap so for the money I paid</li>

      <li>It is exactly as advertised :)</li>
      <li>The handle does have a nice feel to it, its not a hard, slippery plastic, it has some traction to it</li>
      <li>This works great, nice paddle brush, but after a while whole plastic inside kept going down</li>

      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything amazingly special about it.</li>

      <li>On top of that amazingness it also works wonders when blowing drying hair straight.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a new paddle brush to replace one that broke and this one ended up being a suitable replacement.</li>
      <li>As others have said, it feels nice in the hand, and it really does make my hair look very silky.</li>
      <li>I mainly use it for blow drying purposes and it controls the frizz and static of my hair.</li>

      <li>It is large, but light.</li>

      <li>This brush is such a nice design.</li>
      <li>It is worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>She likes the handle on this one a little more: it has a silky texture that&#x27;s very pleasing, and it&#x27;s aesthetically nice on the eyes.  </li>
      <li>For some reason we don&#x27;t really own them long without them falling apart.  </li>
      <li>Guess the super glue wasnt strong enough eh?!?!?!</li>
      <li>It was SO pretty</li>
      <li>- it suits us both really well!</li>
      <li>I ordered it because it looked pretty.</li>
      <li>It is a okay brush it broke by the 3rd week.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am 50 years old and have never been able to make my hair look flat and silky. Part of it was my blow drying technique, the other that I was using the wrong type of brush. Found out on the web that I should be using a paddle brush. I went to the local store and bought a paddle brush, it was good for detangling, and made my hair look a little better when I blow dried it. BUT - I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied, so I searched on Amazon, read all the reviews, and decided to order this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lovely. As others have said, it feels nice in the hand, and it really does make my hair look very silky. There is a big difference between this brush and the one I already had. I was skeptical when I ordered it - how could a brush make so much difference? I don&#x27;t know, but it does.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product a few weeks now and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly and precisely as featured... leaves my hair soft without any tangles!</li>
    <li> This is got to be the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. My hair feels like silk and is so soft from using it. Buy it you wont be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Ok. Nothing special. Just a hairbrush. I don&#x27;t notice any difference with use. Not really falling for the claims that it ,akes the hair softer or anything.</li>
    <li> This brush is so cute! I absolutely love it! It definitely takes out any tangle and leaves the hair silky soft. A great product to invest in!</li>
    <li> The handle on the brush feels as if it where dipped in powder. It&#x27;s super soft and looks very nice.  The brush works great, it leaves no static behind.</li>
    <li> Is very gentle on getting out any tangles and love the feel of the brush on my scalp. I would recommend this to anyone with short, medium or long hair. Also the design is very cute.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week and I can tell the difference between this brush and my $4 Relvon brush. It detangles my hair easier, less frizzy, and made my hair a bit silky. The handle&#x27;s design is cute. Lightweight, easy handling, but not that fantastic!</li>
    <li> Good price for a Hair Brush , and the quality is not bad. The only thing is the surface seems not have a decent material.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really have any expectations for this product, i just needed a new brush. When i received it i was amazed at how pretty it was. After showers i used it to brush through my hair, i have really curly and knotty hair so sometimes it can be a challenge, but this brush didn&#x27;t catch or anything. On top of that amazingness it also works wonders when blowing drying hair straight. I never knew how fast it could be done and all i needed to do was change what brush i was using!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Love Love this product, i would recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I love blowdrying my hair with this brush. It spreads my hair out so I can cover more each time. Quality is great, too.</li>
    <li> And here I thought all brushes were created equal.  Apparently shape matters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels well built.  Feels good in the hand.  Has a cool, dual-color finish.  I don&#x27;t know how, but it seems to make brushing a bit easier for my long hair.  It also looks really nice, which isn&#x27;t something to cared about in a brush before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about it.</li>
    <li> It is durable and soft. My toddlers like to find my brushes and play drums with them so durable was a must for me. This brush is wonderful.</li>
    <li> The brush is a basic paddle brush. I didn&#x27;t notice anything amazingly special about it. I have long, straight hair, so I got a paddle brush hoping for healthy shine. It seemed to work adequately, but after 8 months, the handle started feeling loose at the joint where it attaches to the paddle. It turns out that the handle part is glued in and made of not-so-durable plastic, so once a small piece of it broke, it became irreparable. I looked on Remington&#x27;s website, but they only offer a refund within 60 days of purchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this brush that long and it&#x27;s already falling apart.  The rubber bristle area has come away (in one piece) from the handle and the finish on the handle is coming off.  I usually love Remington products but this one didn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Super-fast delivery. Everything just as presented!</li>
    <li> The brush is good it was for my wife and it was cheap so for the money I paid it was worth five stars but it was missing some bristles when I got it but it still works fine as a brush and my wife likes how its large and flat because she has big curly hair</li>
    <li> Husband has very curly, thick hair and nothing seems to do the trick for him when he needs to brush his hair. Every brush we&#x27;ve tried just ends up snapping in a matter of weeks/months. This one lasted about a month and a half before snapping where the handle and head of the brush meet.</li>
    <li> I really like the brush.  It is very durable and leaves my long hair super silky and smooth when I am done brushing.  The paddle style brush makes brushing easier for my long, thick hair.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Got this brush for my wife. She had it about three weeks before she dropped it and the handle broke right off at the pink ring. There is a very small linear area that is holding the handle to the pink part so it can snap there very easily. You&#x27;d think making a single piece head and handle would be common sense but I guess it isn&#x27;t for some reason. Got a new brush from another company that is a solid single piece construction. No issues with that brush after a year of many drops. I would not buy this brush again.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I mainly use it for blow drying purposes and it controls the frizz and static of my hair. It also straightens my hair very well and the design is very cute.</li>
    <li> It is a good quality brush. It works like it is supposed to and does it&#x27;s job. Would definitely order again. Also ordered one for my little sister since I liked it so much. The design is also beautiful.</li>
    <li> A few months ago my straightener that I have had for 9 years broke. I replaced it with a Remington Ceramic pearl one and I love it. A few days ago my brush broke. I got online and did some research and the brush that I found had the best reviews on Amazon was this one. I purchased it and I couldnt be more happy with my choice. Like one other reviewer said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know how this brush does it but it just does.\\&quot; You wont be dissapoined with this product!</li>
    <li> This brush works miracles.  Every time I brush it feels fantastic . I feel it brings such a new feel to my hair. It is worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I regretted buying this hair brush. I bought it because I like the brand but the brush is not soft at all. I was expecting something better. Anyway, is still brushes my hair. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t worry so much about a hair brush.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 brushes like a set and leave only one of them. This is round like I did not fit. It is large, but light. Suitable for those who have thick and long hair (or at least dense). For my thin sparse hair, it is inconvenient. Nice disign</li>
    <li> I got this for my Daughter and she liked it alot. it was just what i ordered. She really likes it.</li>
    <li> For some reason we don&#x27;t really own them long without them falling apart.  This one looks better made than the last two we have bought at the local store.  I hae high hopes for this one.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Its a hairbrush. I ordered it because it looked pretty. The handle does have a nice feel to it, its not a hard, slippery plastic, it has some traction to it so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand easily. I also bought the vented brush in this style too.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this brush! I read all the great reviews and when I received it I was super excited. It was SO pretty and I loved the feel of it and everything. Unfortunately, FOR ME... the whole rubber part ended up coming out and when I tried to put it back in, it wouldn&#x27;t stay in long. :/ I am Caucasian (just for hair type purposes) and my hair is naturally very straight but quite thick. I don&#x27;t have curly or wavy hair or ultra thick hair just.... normal to thick hair. It lasted only about 2 weeks (of every morning use) before the rubber came out of the brush and basically was unusable. :/ I was sad, I really wanted it to last!</li>
    <li> Nice brush. I will have to figure out a way to clean it out easily. I just received it and was bummed that one of the bristles were missing, which is why i gave it a 4 and not a 5. I like the little &#x27;pearl&#x27; tips too, not too hard or pokey; perfectly stimulating on the scalp.</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful paddle brush and works well for what I bought it for.  It is exactly as advertised :)</li>
    <li> This is a great paddle brush, it detangles very easily and is worth the price. However, the design is easily scratched, but this does not affect the performance, just its aesthetic appeal.</li>
    <li> This brush was really wide and comfortable. especially good for long hair. I have an angled bob cut, but this brush helped speed up my drying time. I Loved it. It&#x27;s really cute and girly too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this brush really makes hair any smoother than other brushes but it seems well made for the most part. I did notice one of the needles had come out. Not sure if it came like that or if it fell out.</li>
    <li> I got this, the curling brush and the blowdryer all together. Awesome products! This brush is such a nice design. Very attractive too. It&#x27;s fun to have your brush look as good as you! LOL</li>
    <li> This works great, nice paddle brush, but after a while whole plastic inside kept going down so you had to fix it every few minutes.</li>
    <li> I have very long and thick hair and have always used much narrower oval shaped brushes. I have been missing out. This brush is wide and brushes my thick hair in just a few swipes. It&#x27;s really a great brush. I didn&#x27;t feel it pull and I haven&#x27;t seen any hair in the brush at all, which I used to get in my old brush a lot. Highly recommend. Very good construction for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in late July of this year.  By September, the handle had started peeling and the rubber insert (to which all of the teeth are attached) pulled out of the brush head.  I have never succeeded at re-attaching it.  I tried to return the defective item, but apparently the window of time for returns had closed after only two months.  Save your time, energy, and money; don&#x27;t buy this brush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have enough hair for this one, it&#x27;s too hard and rough. It&#x27;s probably fine and maybe even very good if you have thick and very long hair; but unfortunately, I&#x27;m not in the category.</li>
    <li> The junction (neck) is weak, and broke already</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It is a great brush for drying your bangs.  Sturdy and pretty, too!  The best on the market.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This brush wasn&#x27;t used or treated roughly by me. My hair isn&#x27;t long or very thick. I brush my hair once a day and it only takes 2-3 brushes and then the brush gets set down on the counter. The rubber mat that holds the bristles started pulling out every time I used it within a week of arriving. The pretty design coating started peeling off in little flakes that stick to everything and the handle broke off shortly after that. It now resides in a landfill somewhere.</li>
    <li> handle broke off after a few days or regular use. I&#x27;m pretty sure my 8 year old doesn&#x27;t press that hard when brushing her hair.... if anything, she skips over all the rats for fear of &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; her hair. Maybe we just got a faulty one.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money! This is not the strongest brushes ever, as it is two separate pieces, and made of plastic.  The bristles are nice and the product is aesthetically pleasing.  Looks great on the dressing table!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy my wife the best hairbrush of this kind after I broker her last one and I couldn&#x27;t tell from the reviews which she would like, so I went ahead and bought this one and the \\&quot;Conair Anti Static Paddle Brush\\&quot; at the same time.  Now that my wife has used both for a while I can compare the two based on her feedback.  She has very long, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes both brushes.  She likes the handle on this one a little more: it has a silky texture that&#x27;s very pleasing, and it&#x27;s aesthetically nice on the eyes.  However, she ends up preferring the other and choosing it whenever both are available.  The reason is that the flexible rubber that the bristles are affixed to on this one is a little firmer, which means when she brushes the top of her head it&#x27;s a little less comfortable because the bristles don&#x27;t flex as much as she would like.  For doing the rest of her hair the two are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing particularly wrong with this brush, but I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the Conair is better and, when I made the purchase, it was a few dollars cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Edit a few months later &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair handle broke in half irreparably while my wife was brushing her hair.  No unusual treatment.  Anyway, I no longer recommend the Conair over this.  This brush is still going strong.  Upgrading this brush&#x27;s rating to 5 stars (from four) and downgrading the Conair to 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with this brush...it has better construction.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t know about the \\&quot;real crushed pearls\\&quot; but the brush is really good. It gets a lot of hair at once and detangles very efficiently. I saw one like it at my cousin&#x27;s place and when I used it I wanted one. I have long, straight-to-wavy hair, my cousin has curly hair (permed) - it suits us both really well!</li>
    <li> I bought one earlier this year, then my daughter used it and loved it and wanted to know where I got it.  Now my granddaughter wants one so just bought this for her and loved the little matching paddle brush for her thick long hair.  This is going to be a big hit for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Busted a week after I got it. Bristles and pad fell out. Guess the super glue wasnt strong enough eh?!?!?! NOT recommended. Posting photos now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she hasn&#x27;t complained, she wanted to have all the pearl collection from Remington, she loves it!</li>
    <li> This brush came just as it was talked about. It was completely packaged and brand new. It is easy to use, and detangles hair very well and it is also a great brush to use while blow drying your hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is not only attractive, it feels nice in your hand and it serves it&#x27;s purpose well. I love big paddle brushes for my long, straight hair, and this one is a winner.</li>
    <li> not sure what the pearl stuff does but i like it.  it big so if you have a small purse it is not going to fit</li>
    <li> Grate quality, grate price and made well, I gave it for Christmas to my mom, she loves it and one can tell it is made well !</li>
    <li> I only use flathead brushes. I usually get Goody but I liked the design on this, so got it. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I liked this brush, however after only 3 months it just snapped in half while using it.&lt;br /&gt;However I contacted Customer Service and I was promptly given assistance on this issue.&lt;br /&gt;Truth is, you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll spend a little more on my next brush and hopefully it will last longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter for Christmas. It is a okay brush it broke by the 3rd week. It just snapped but overall the best part was the decor it was a pretty brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this Brush and i loved it. My hair is very long and most brushes pull on my hair painfully. The wider flat head works well. However After only 2 Months of use i was touching up my hair and the handle snapped away from the head. I guess i can still use the head to brush my hair but the nice long handle cannot be fixed. It appears to have been glued together poorly. I cannot return it so now i have to buy another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful brush, and works just as good as any other, but I find that the really stiff bristles are somewhat uncomfortable, I&#x27;m used to a little give with a hairbrush... I recommend you find something else.</li>
    <li> Brush broke after less than a month of usage - my hair is not even thick - waste of money</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new paddle brush to replace one that broke and this one ended up being a suitable replacement. It cute and it works well.  Unfortunately, it still takes forever to dry my hair!!</li>
    <li> Its a really good hair brush, my hair feel softer after brushing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a little big, but when adquiring it, no other smaller models where available.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for people with thin to meduim hair.  Hair does not get tangled in it. I&#x27;ve used several similar products and recommend this one.</li>
