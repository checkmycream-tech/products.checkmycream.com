      <li>Helps my gums stay healthy.</li>
      <li>I love the products.</li>
      <li>It costs more than a good single malt scotch, but it&#x27;s excellent and leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
      <li>This one is probably best used in the mornings, because when I used it at night, my mouth would get very dry overnight.</li>
      <li>Though the nimbus may have been sweeping perio pockets gently clean, there was nothing to keep bacteria from regaining their foothold, so I think this tonic was the reason why my tissues were able to heal.  </li>
      <li>Easy to order on amazon.</li>
      <li>Mouth tonic is awesome, keeps your breath feeling fresh for long time.</li>
      <li>They say in one instance that their products contain no synthetic fluoride and in another that they are fluoride free.  </li>

      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  </li>
      <li>but, if I run low between visits, it&#x27;s good to have a backup.</li>
      <li>I was hoping Amazon would have it at a more reasonable price though.  </li>
      <li>Your mouth feels fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>It is kind of stingy when you have a mouth sore, but it&#x27;s so worth it when it starts going away the next day!</li>

      <li>I developed gingivitis from a medication I was put on and panicked trying to take care of it quickly!  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth, after using this for a month, I could tell a HUGE difference in my tooth sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>It is lighter, so I am trying to use the whole bottle before I decide if it worth purchsing again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE it! Would have loved to have received a small TRAVEL size one though, because I travel :(  Maybe the company will send me one, and I&#x27;ll do an update! ;)</li>
    <li> My dentist sold this to me Monday when I had a dentist appointment. I really like it. It makes my mouth feel really clean and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol in it and is all natural. I have used it daily before using Prevident 5000 Booster prescription toothpaste (yes, my teeth are that bad). My point is I have neglected them for a while but actually enjoy using this and it has a pleasant taste whereas I usually hate the taste of mouthwash.</li>
    <li> My dentist  recommended it.  It did the job!  Taste little nasty but it works for my problems.  It was cheaper online</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this mouthwash after seeing I was having some receding gums and sensitivity from grinding my teeth at night. I use it once daily for 30 seconds, at night... like a regular mouthwash. I love it! It has a cinnamon/herbal flavor, but is not too overpowering - and it does not have that alcohol burn like listerine. It has done wonders for my gums and periodontal issues.. my teeth are even less sensitive. Absolutely no staining - and this size bottle lasts for 3 months! I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I agree that this is the best mouthwash out there. I was hoping Amazon would have it at a more reasonable price though.  I will continue to get it from my dentist at $26.00 which I thought was spend.:(. 5 stars for great product but deducted 2 stars for price</li>
    <li> great stuff makes my teeth and gums feel so healthy.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t go wrong using this oral rinse  ......best I have ever found</li>
    <li> My Dentist gave me this to use after having a root canal.  This is wonderful for your irritated gums or oral ulcers.  I immediately went back to his office and bought a larger bottle.  Now that I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon I will buy it here.  You cannot go wrong with this mouth rinse.....  Hold two teaspoons in your mouth and swish for 30 seconds, then don&#x27;t rinse for 15 minutes and you will see an amazing difference in your gums.  Use it twice a day, in the morning after brushing, and before bedtime.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it and although I was a little concerned with a high price for a mouth wash, you don&#x27;t use as much of it as a regular mouthwash, it&#x27;s strong and very effective and natural at the same time.  Helps my gums stay healthy.</li>
    <li> Great, but my dentist sells the same bottle and same ounces for tons less...I mean less than 25$.  This price is nuts</li>
    <li> Best. Mouthwash. Ever.  EVER.  I have sensitive teeth, after using this for a month, I could tell a HUGE difference in my tooth sensitivity.  Sensodine never did that for me!  Plus, it&#x27;s alcohol-free (won&#x27;t dry out your mouth) and has a lovely minty herbal taste that&#x27;s super fresh feeling.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that truly helps to heal canker sores. I bought my first bottle from my dentist then we changed dentists and it wasn&#x27;t available online at that time.I was really excited to find it when I recently looked again. It is kind of stingy when you have a mouth sore, but it&#x27;s so worth it when it starts going away the next day!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before was satisfied and still am. It was priced fair and arrived when it was suppose to.</li>
    <li> Not the special &amp;#34;cure all&amp;#34; that people may be expecting.  Did not produce any change in my oral health.  View it as an expensive version of a &amp;#34;Tom&#x27;s of Maine&amp;#34; like all-natural remedy and maybe you won&#x27;t be disappointed too.  I am going back to Scope when done with my bottle (1/4th of a bottle left).</li>
    <li> Excellent! The item even came a few days before I expected, thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this product, but jeez the price!  5 stars for the product - but demoted 2 stars for the price tag.</li>
    <li> Entire dental clinic reccomended it, said the research behind it the overall best they&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> This is a really great mouthwash! No chemicals. It really freshens your mouth and kills bacteria. It is strong so only a 1/4 of the lid is enough. It&#x27;s really effective. Great product!</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> An amazing blend of herbs that leaves my gums tingling. Both of my dentists of the last ten years have recommended it; my current one sells it.  I&#x27;m told my gums have receded less than others my age; I believe this product is partly why.  It&#x27;s great for the back of the throat too - really attacks the bad breath.  No alcohol or other laboratory ingredients is a plus. Because my dentist recommends a fluoride rinse (44 yrs old), I use the T&amp;G tonic in the morning and a fluoride rinse at night.  Best of both worlds. --[...]</li>
    <li> tastes great as well as helping your gums.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product and cannot honestly say whether it works or not, however I am not an advocate of fluoride treatment and this company tries to hide the fact that it has fluoride added to its products.  They say in one instance that their products contain no synthetic fluoride and in another that they are fluoride free.  As far as I know no one else uses &amp;#34;synthetic&amp;#34; fluoride for their dental products.  Dental fluoride is almost always from waste by-products of the phosphate and aluminum industries.&lt;br /&gt;When I called the company&#x27;s help line the person told me that there is fluoride in their products but it comes from added natural green tea extract, an ingredient not listed on their products.  I responded that their advertising was misleading and that all tea was loaded with fluoride.  She responded that &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t hear you.  You&#x27;re breaking up.&amp;#34; and that was that.&lt;br /&gt;My point is that their advertising is totally deceptive about their product&#x27;s fluoride content therefore I cannot believe any of their claims about their product effectiveness.  I am absolutely against the ingestion of fluoride in any form and one cup of black tea for instance, contains, on average, over ten days worth of the recommended daily allowance of fluoride.  Green tea, though touted for it&#x27;s many health benefits, is also loaded with fluoride and green tea extract is even more so.</li>
    <li> Was having trouble with my gums, however not ant more -  My dentist recommended this product</li>
    <li> My dentist recommendeded using this product years ago.  It helps control tooth decay bacteria.  Usually, I buy this tonic from the dentist but, if I run low between visits, it&#x27;s good to have a backup.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist and really helps keep my gums healthy.</li>
    <li> My family loves this natural mouthwash. It still has the kick that Listerine has yet just makes my teeth feel stronger (somehow).&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt use it everyday but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this tonic through my dentist.  It is expensive but lasts a long time.  Bad breath and bad taste in my mouth vanished instantly!</li>
    <li> Originally got this at a previous dentist. My teeth feel amazing, helped with oral health (I am prone to cavities) and it is gluten free. Nice company.</li>
    <li> Great taste and does what it claims it will do.  Makes my breath smell wonderful.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I had this tonic that i purchase through my dentist but ran out. I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on line.DHC is what i was looking for, works great.</li>
    <li> Beneficial for those with receding gums. Same product from my holistic dentist is the same price... but I like the convenience of not having to drive over there.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash is powerful! Your mouth feels wonderful after you use it and your gums will continue to improve the more you use this mouth wash. Actually works!</li>
    <li> This is expensive but an excellent natural mouthwash. My husband uses it per recommendation of his holistic dentist to help keep his mouth healthy.</li>
    <li> tastes, good - mouth feels clean, no alcohol</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Recommended  by my dentist.</li>
    <li> When your dental hygienist says, &amp;#34;Wow, what are you using?&amp;#34; it&#x27;s a good thing. When you have periodontal disease like I do, it&#x27;s even more impressive. I can&#x27;t honestly think of any cons besides the burning sensation the first few uses. Even the cost isn&#x27;t as bad as it may seem since this bottle lasts me about 6 months and is reducing my dental cleanings from every three months to every six months. I have recommended this to all of my family and friends as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product delived in a reasonable time.</li>
    <li> Has stopped the bleeding when i brush my teeth. It kills oral bacteria and works unlike scope or listerine which did not. I love the products.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended.  Helps gums to stay healthy and even to heal.  Your mouth feels fresh and clean.  Easy to order on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have to cut it with some water.</li>
    <li> Very Strong.  Just takes a few drops.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I went to a holistic dentist for the first time like a week ago and he had this stuff in his office and in the bathroom for people to use whenever. It has a very strong mint taste and it is SO clean it amazes me! The herbs in it are extremely healing and beneficial to not only the mouth, but the entire body as well. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price and fast shipping. This tonic has a great taste and makes my whole mouth feel refreshed. My teeth and gums feel stronger already!</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and my dentist recommends it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. With all the news about the dangers of triclosan, this rinse is a refreshing alternative. It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh for hours. It has also opened my eyes to the properties and benefits of thyme, one of the key ingredients.</li>
    <li> This stuff is world&#x27;s greatest mouthwash.  It costs more than a good single malt scotch, but it&#x27;s excellent and leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> i could see the improvement with my gum.they look much more healthy, good product would recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive... But I&#x27;m telling you, there is simply nothing else on the planet that works like this stuff. Awesomely fresh and healthy breathe.</li>
    <li> TASTE BAD BUT IT&#x27;S WORTH IT, promotes good health</li>
    <li> I developed gingivitis from a medication I was put on and panicked trying to take care of it quickly!  My dentist recommended this product and after using it for a week or so my gums were better than ever!  I couldn&#x27;t believe that a product that was all natural would help so quickly and better than any other mouthwash I had ever used!  My husband loves it too!! It freshens breath and really promotes healthy gums.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is alcohol-free, plant-based and recommended by my holistic dentist. Science tells us there is an intimate link between oral health and cardiovascular health, so I am invested in getting my dental act together.  I can report that my gum health has significantly improved by making this my morning routine. The gotu kola in the formula may be one reason why my gums look so much better now, as it&#x27;s supposed to heal tissues.  One bottle lasts one person about 6 weeks of almost daily use.  UPDATE: At 6 months use I had a stellar dental check-up. The changes I made to improve my gums (my main issue) were adding this tonic and switching to Nimbus toothbrush.  Though the nimbus may have been sweeping perio pockets gently clean, there was nothing to keep bacteria from regaining their foothold, so I think this tonic was the reason why my tissues were able to heal.  The proof is in the numbers and I no longer dread the dental gum probe.   Update: I&#x27;ve bought 14 full-sized bottles since, at full retail price on amazon, since my non-compensated, non-couponed review. My husband and i have been using it nearly every day since and are still pleased with the results. Wish the price was less.</li>
    <li> It was recommended decades ago by my dentist and it is a consistent winner. I will use it forever.</li>
    <li> Compliments the toothpaste. You really need both to enhance the benefits. Mouth tonic is awesome, keeps your breath feeling fresh for long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 10 years. It has a strong mint taste, so works great for a mouth wash, but the best thing is what it does for your gums! Mine are so healthy they are almost white! I have found it can be diluted a bit with water to make the product go farther and still its works great!</li>
    <li> Found it and tested in biological dentist office. Stunning product! Screaming healthy ingredients! Love it. All family use it. 100 percent natural herbal dental tonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this tonic and the dental paste for years. Recommended by my dentist, no alcohol or additives. Little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes as this product was highly touted. I used it faithfully for almost 6 months. I also increased my brushing time and waterpik usage. There was no improvement at my dental check-up. Also, my wife increased her brushing time but did not use this mouthwash. She received a good report. This product was a big waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a registered dental assistant for 15 yrs, this is the best product out there! Hands down! Its natural ingredients kills germs and leaves a long lasting fresh clean taste.  Great for smokers and non smokers,  no alchohol ingredient to give that burning sensation that Burns gums. Keeps your gums and teeth healthy! We started selling it at our dental practice and all the patients are very satisfied. Try it once and you will be addicted!</li>
    <li> The rinse has not taken away the bleeding when I brush. It is lighter, so I am trying to use the whole bottle before I decide if it worth purchsing again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  Dentist gave to me after Deep Cleaning, stuff is STRONG!  But, it works to cure gigivitis.  ALL NATURAL!  No alcohol or chemicals.  SUPER AWESOME PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> The product keeps my teeth clean after rinsing. It also reduces the bad breath problem. Would recommend to others in my family too.</li>
    <li> A little pricey for a mouthwash, but nevertheless a good natural product. I use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> Even though it is a little expensive...this product works well. My Dentist recommended that I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I had gingivitis. Twice a day with Tooth &amp; Gum Tonic took care of it.  Tastes good, makes my mouth feel fresh, and DOES NOT foam when I gargle!</li>
    <li> I love that this is natural. It has a pretty strong taste, but really nothing as bad as some brand-name mouth washes I&#x27;ve tried, which tend to sting a lot. This one is probably best used in the mornings, because when I used it at night, my mouth would get very dry overnight. I think it&#x27;s improved the condition of my gums - they are definitely less swollen and I don&#x27;t have as much problem flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it and like that it&#x27;s not all processed chemicals and alcohol.</li>
    <li> The bottle that I received had a different label and it tastes different because it has different ingredients too even though it is call Tooth and Gum Tonic</li>
    <li> The taste takes a little bit of getting used to and I really won&#x27;t know if it worked until I see my hygienist again in June. But I&#x27;m hoping it works as intended.</li>
    <li> this product is just wonderful as a natural mouthwash.  there are no chemicals or artificial ingredients.  and the best part is that it is very effective at keeping your mouth healthy (dare i say that it is far more effective than listerine mouthwash? yes!).</li>
