<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I buy this lotion every time. This is my third bottle and I love the color it gives me. Three times in a level two bed excellent color. I am straw berry blonde and have a hard time tanning. This lotion I would recommend. The delivery was fast, standard mail. Not sure it if the bottle was suppose to have the plastic around cap but nothing bad was wrong with bottle. Buy and try it today !&lt;br /&gt;  Happy tanning :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning off and on for years and I am fair skin. You see a tan fast!  But its sticky and it smells kinda. I usually go with playboy glow girl which doesn&#x27;t smell and isn&#x27;t sticky. I would recommend this product if you plan on showering right after tanning</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fare skinned and live in Central Florida so I need help getting a nice bronzy color. I was told by a friend who works at a salon that this product can be used both in and outdoors.. as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I prefer it outdoors. I&#x27;m not a fan of indoor tanning, I enjoy the fresh air and this product helps produce color and allows me to enjoy the sun :) Will buy again! xo</li>
    <li> Smells a little different but it definitely gives you great color.  Wash your hands right away!</li>
    <li> The smell of this product was great and did not streak!</li>
    <li> I had to buy a small packet of this lotion at my tanning salon because I left mine (a different type) accidentally at home.  After the unbelievable pricegod $8.00 for less than an ounce of product, I scolded myself for forgetting my own lotion.  The full bottle (12.5 oz) was $89.99, I was told.  I went to use the sample and was very happy with the nice smell and smooth, non-greasy application.  After the time in the bed I could immediately tell that the new lotion was working.  Unlike many of the lotions out there that claim to eliminate that &#x27;after tanning&#x27; smell, this one actually works. For the most part, the after tanning scent is gone and only the nice scent of the lotion remains.  As a side note, with this and all other tanning lotions that have cosmetic bronzer in them in addition to the bronzers that help the bed tan your skin, make sure to wash your hands very well after tanning, or you will get bronzer lines in between your fingers and your palm will orange.  I&#x27;ve used several different Devoted Creations tanning lotions. This \\&quot;Anything Goes\\&quot; brand is, in my opinion, the best of their lotions and of the others that I have tried in the past.  I did not burn, and have a nice golden brown base to take with me to Tahiti.  I am really happy to see Amazon has this lotion for a quarter of the price the salon is charging.  I&#x27;m so glad I came home and checked before buying it tomorrow at the salon!!!  Overall a great tanning lotion with great results, and only on Amazon, a great price!!</li>
    <li> Must have! I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of lotion &amp; this one is the best! Actually does tan you,smells great even after I tanned! The only thing is that u have to wash ur hands right away! But I love it! I finally found one that I am not disappointed in buying!</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon so I try almost every product. I bought this one to try it out before purchasing for the Salon. I give it five star.. noticable darkness as soon as I got out of the bed and I have never smelled such a great lotion!!</li>
    <li> I love LOVE love this lotion. It smells good so if you don&#x27;t care for the usual tanning lotion smell, this one is kind of fruity. Even better is that it helps protect my tattoos from fading.</li>
    <li> This product is...just...wow, so awesome, it gave me an instant tan, after I used the tanning bed, amazing.  I&#x27;m tatted up too, and this is just a great product and highly recommend this.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I wish I could show you all how dark I got with this lotion in one use.   Tonight is New Years eve 2012 baby, and I hopped over to the salon and grabbed a bottle of this and headed into a level IV bed for 12mins, and OMG I am so glad I did!  I was like yellow and sorta dull feeling from the day before using the Trust Fund Baby, which I love, but it just cannot do what this lotion does in one use.  The bronzer is extreme, but I actually turned darker from this in one use than the DC Special Reserve that I also love cause it smells like cookies\\&quot;^-^\\&quot;  The Anything Goes smells like fruit punch when you put it on, but its not bad once you&#x27;re done tanning.  So this is a good one for guys too!  Most people I know think that bronzer is too extreme, but I have good results with them both.    I am fair skinned naturally too, so for me to find a bottle I love, well its rare.  Now of course I over paid in the salon by like 60$&#x27;s, but I needed to try it, so I recommend getting it here.  Side note,  minimal redness, except my face, but I always get that at first, and no tingling itchy feeling from chemicals.   DC has done it again!  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do.  Peace &amp; Kandie kids!</li>
    <li> smell&#x27;s really manly and leaves you orange instead of brown .... never buy again !!!</li>
    <li> This prices at maximum tan for $88 i purchased this for $38 and it was such a bargan. 100xxx bronzer is amazing and tattoo fading, not quite sure if that works because my tattoos dont fade, color is still in tact. you see results right when you step out of the booth. use it for like a week and it will get you dark. 50x isnt all that it seems and i used alot of tanning lotions but devoted creations did it! and amazon is the best way to go if you are looking for this type of lotion. Smells great and theres no gimmics, 5 stars all the way!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  I have great color from it and it smells good.</li>
    <li> The smell is ok. It does darken your skin but stains the hands worse than others that I have tried and it&#x27;s a little sticky. I can&#x27;t say if it protected my tattoos or tightened my skin because I didn&#x27;t use it as regularly as I should if I wanted to really test the product. That&#x27;s really why I paid the price difference but in the future I will probably just buy cheaper bronzers since I don&#x27;t really use it every day or even every other day to really see the difference. It does make you dark though.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning bed lotion.  Goes on light not heavy, instant color, fragrance is nice, light, not heavy, no tanning bed smell aterwards.  A keeper.  This product lived up to its advertisement.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion. Just after using it once I was noticeably darker. The only down fall is it will turn your hands orange. I suggest bringing baby wipes with you so you can clean your hands off after you apply it. Other than that it&#x27;s amazing and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> The only tanning lotion I can use without getting burned! Gives you a beautiful brown color and smells great even after tanning!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this lotion. It has a great smell even after you get out of the tanning bed,no burnt smell.you can tell a difference using this lotion i look darker and my skin doesnt get dry. the ony con to using this lotion is it can stain ur hands so you have to be careful to wipe your hands off good or they will be orange.I havent had any problems with streaking anywhere else though. I have just finished my first bottle and i am coming back for more.</li>
    <li> I do not go to tanning beds because they dry out my already dry skin. When do use it is after being in the pool or the days following. I tan easily, but this Anything goes bronzer makes my tan dark and is a great moisturizer. I love Devoted Creations for making this product!No streaks and no leaving the palms of my hand orange.</li>
    <li> The bronzer works well gives an all over even tan and helps keep tatoos from losing their colors. Much cheaper then the same thing that are sold in tanning salons.</li>
    <li> They sell this tanning lotion for $90 in a tanning salon!! CRAZY! I bought it on here &amp; LOVE LOVE LOVE the price!! Will be ordering more for sure! I started tanning a month ago &amp; it looks like I&#x27;ve been on an island for a while. Lotion is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; I&#x27;ve been tanning for 22 years. Arrived VERY quickly, packaged safe &amp; can NOT beat this price! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> I usually like Devoted Creations lotions but I can barely stand myself after using this.  The ATO is baaad.  I purchased it because of all the great reviews, and I do get decent color with it (it&#x27;s streaky if you aren&#x27;t careful). I just hate that I need to plan on taking a shower after I use this.</li>
    <li> I have always been very please with this product. I recommend this product to anyone . but only but the on from american</li>
    <li> love this lotion tans fast and easy the only thing that bothered my was my hand turned orange you MUST whip your hands or they will be orange(: but all around great lotion love the tan love the smell love everything</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for the past 2+ years &amp; it is the ABSOLUTE BEST to get fast, deep, dark brown color. I have been a regular tanner for over 10 years (5+ days a week) &amp; I swear by this lotion! Great price &amp; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, can even be used as a scented moisturizer during the day :)</li>
    <li> So great! I felt that I was at a plateau with my tan and even though it is not a tingle I&#x27;m the darkest I have ever been! I&#x27;ve been tanning for a little over 5 years off and on. I used this about 2 months into my tanning and it&#x27;s achieved a wonderful brown color. No after smell. Will be purchasing another bottle! Yay!</li>
    <li> this product gives you a great color and u keep getting a color even after your tan. it smells really good and my skin stays smooth afterward.they stopped carrying it in our salon so my husband and i had to purchase it online.</li>
    <li> I love the results I get from this product. I do not tan easy and with this high bronzer I get good color.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. It does have a heavy toner great for if you are just starting out to get you color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product through amazon for $35 after shipping and saw immediate results.  I would defiantly buy it again. My wife loves it as well, I&#x27;m going to either have to hide it from her or purchase another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> first time buying from amazon and i must say def saved a ton of money and this product was like 80 bucks in the salon def saved a lot and received it really quick love the product def seen results in 2 days</li>
    <li> this tanning lotion is BOMB! best stuff ever, gets you dark QUICK and isn&#x27;t streaky. and i love the smell so i can tan before work and not have to shower before i go in to my job. that&#x27;s a huge time saver.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites and I am a dedicated Devoted Creations user, this seems to work pretty well and I notice darkness after each use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Anything Goes for 2 years now &amp; this product I received is not the correct lotion, IT HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH! The bottle may look the same but the color of the lotion is not! Lotion is much lighter than it should be, therefore it doesn&#x27;t give the same results as a bronzer. DO NOT BUY FROM ALL AMERICAN TANNING, you will disappointed with this product from them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice much difference with using it and not using it. It makes my skin soft but still kind of has a wierd smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered my first bottle from All American Tanning and liked the lotion until I ordered my second bottle from Thee Tanman and realized my first bottle had probably been diluted with another lotion. The color of the lotion in my second bottle was much darker then the first bottle. I love this lotion from Thee Tanman! My skin is very fair and this gets me dark.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this lotion the first / days of usage it made me feel lighter then what I was I don&#x27;t feel the skin tightening and now my stretch marks are noticeable the 3rd day I used I did seem to be darker didn tan the following day and now the tan I had the other day is gone defintly doesn&#x27;t stay long smell after tan is defintly a tanning smell specially when it&#x27;s wet!!!! Overall wouldn&#x27;t buy it again I would spend the extra money and buy the one I really wanted</li>
    <li> I use to only use Designer Skin products but switched over the Devoted Creations about two years ago.  I am very happy I did so because this is my new favorite tanning lotion brand.  It lasts forever/goes a long way and smells great!  I would buy this lotion again and recommend it to anyone who was debating which lotion to purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion but my favorite is black ink by Ed hardy.</li>
    <li> So I bought this cause it had gotten a five star rating from all the other users. I had tried a sample of the trust fund baby from devotions and liked it so when I seen this one and read the reviews I thought I can&#x27;t go wrong getting the next step up. Well the first time I used it as I was putting it on my hands started getting really orange. Now I have used tanning lotions in the past that had self tanners in it that I could usually wipe of with the towel they leave in the room for you, but not with this it wouldn&#x27;t come off. I didn&#x27;t have any streaks the first time, but my hands we&#x27;re orange for 3 days. So the the next time I used the lotion I actually put on latex gloves to keep my hands from getting orange. It does give you color pretty fast considering the strong self tanner that&#x27;s in it but I wish I would have just gotten the trust fund baby lotion. I will continue to use this until it runs out then I won&#x27;t be getting any more that&#x27;s forsure.</li>
    <li> It works well but didn&#x27;t work as efficiently as I&#x27;d expected.</li>
    <li> Not a great lotion.  I ordered this by mistake some how and decided to keep vs. the hassle of returning.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you are just starting out to tan.  After you have a tan going, it does very little.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites from DC.  I also like Forever Black.  Both smell great and work well.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Instant reaults are always nice with the wonderful bronzer! Best lotion ive ever bouggt! Makes me feel like a new sexy woman :)</li>
    <li> Love these lotions.  I&#x27;ve never had an issue with fake.  I&#x27;ve bought both from salon and here and it&#x27;s the same product yet cheaper</li>
    <li> You will notice a difference right away in making you darker, however, if you don&#x27;t wipe your hands off right away, they will stay orange. I still smell like a tanning bed when I get done tanning, no surprise there. For some reason, it gets sticky after use. After I&#x27;ve tanned and get dressed, my skin sticks to my clothes and I have not sweat one bit while in the bed so I know it&#x27;s not sweat sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have just stuck to the lotion I know I like, but wanted to try something new. The seller was great and I received the lotion faster than expected, this review has no reflection on the seller, just the lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought Anything Goes because it had very high reviews so I thought what the heck, why not give it a go! When I first got this in the mail I opened it and it smelled awesome! I thought it was going to continue to smell awesome after I tanned but I was wrong! I had the after tan smell so bad that it took 2 showers to smell normal again! I went to a local salon to buy samples to try out to find what I wanted and Anything Goes was one of the sampes...The product from the salon was a COMPLETELY different color from the one I got through Amazon. The Amazon one was a dark muddy color leading me to believe that I was sold a product that was old and had turned bad! I do not believe that I will be buying a tanning lotion from anywhere but the salon from now on! The only bonus to buying it here is that I am able to ship it back for free! I&#x27;m trying the salon sample today so I hope it turns out better than this one did!!!</li>
    <li> U can&#x27;t go wrong on this!!!I have used all the 50xxxand higher lotions and by far this is the BEST EVER!!!I get so many compliments\\&quot;u have a pretty tan\\&quot;what do u use\\&quot;lol!!and even the owner if the tanning salon I go to one day asked\\&quot;what are u using\\&quot;and when I told her and asked her why?she said she could smell it and it smelled so goood!!!and she went out and ordered a case of it and sildvit in 3 days and boy she charged 69.00 each bottle.....well I buy all my tanning items from Amazon for good prices!!!lol!!!so all I can say is all fingers up and a high five or 10 lol!!!!0n this tanning lotion!!will not buy any other kind ever!!!!:)and as with any bronze wash or wipe your hands and in-between  Ur fingers so they don&#x27;t turn out funky!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best bronzing lotion I have used. I have used Snooki&#x27;s Bronzer, JWOWW&#x27;s One and Done, and a handful of other bronzers as well. This lotion will absolutely leave your hands streaky if you don&#x27;t rub it in well enough. Others have suggested washing your hands after application, but I would rather not have different colored hands than the rest of my body. I apply the lotion to my hands just as I would to the rest of my body; just rub in very well and make sure you get in between your fingers. It leaves you feeling somewhat sticky, but I can live with it for the results it gives me. I noticed that I was definitely a couple shades darker even after the first application. As with all bronzers, it works best if you rotate it with an accelerator and a tingle. I love the smell - it reminds me of grapefruit. It hasn&#x27;t given me the \\&quot;orange\\&quot; that we all hate. The lack of natural bronzers helps to give you that dark brown color as well, instead of the light brown. Make sure you leave it on at least four hours before you shower or else you will see the color running down the drain! It&#x27;s not the best moisturizer, but that&#x27;s not one of my main concerns in a lotion. If I feel I need more moisture, I will use a different lotion after I tan. Also, I didn&#x27;t notice an obnoxious odor after I got out of the bed. My boyfriend said I \\&quot;smelled like I had been tanning,\\&quot; but he didn&#x27;t tell me that I had a bad odor. When I use Snooki&#x27;s lotions, he tells me that there is a bad odor, so this lotion seems to be superior in that regard. Overall, I recommend if you are looking for an advanced bronzer. I do not like to tan more than 2-3 times per week, and this lotion allows me to keep my color throughout that time. Very impressed for an \\&quot;older\\&quot; lotion!</li>
    <li> If only every lotion had a thick consistency like this one does. Doesn&#x27;t eel greasy, goes on nicely. Fabulous bronzer. And the antifade complex for tattoos oh he&#x27;ll yes. Get a bottle. Of this stuff. My most trusted distributor is allamericantanning</li>
    <li> I have used many tanning lotions.  With this lotion I seen results after my second tanning session and the color is VERY natural.  I also like the fact it does not wipe off on my bath towels.  I will use this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I tan 2-3 times a week, especially now that summer is approaching and I was not impressed by this. First time I used it, I noticed a bit of color right away (surprised!) but after that didn&#x27;t really see any difference. What really bothers me is that days after tanning, and showering, I smell like fake tanner.. it takes forever to get the smell to fade away. Very disappointed in this lotion! I have a whole bottle I wont use now.. UGH!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this after reading all the great reviews. However I was very disappointed with the results. Its streaky and what orange color I did get washed down the drain. It did smell good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tanned 5 times now and I am already pretty dark and it does not leave you orange looking at all very satisfied with this product and company!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion that anyone can use. It does help for the tatoos as well. This lotion does not give off a fake/orange look either and smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  It gets me nice and brown in a week, perfect for vacation prep.  I do take a wet paper towel in the booth though and wipe my palms off after application or my palms turn orange.  This lotion smells good too!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really get to use this but it smelt great and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion works good and smells amazing. The only downside is that you get orange hands if you don&#x27;t wash them right away</li>
    <li> The bronzer stains my hands, no matter HOW many times I wash after using it.  But I&#x27;m not getting hardly any color from tanning with it.  Very disappointed in this product, but the shipping turnaround was great.  Can&#x27;t complain about that at all.</li>
    <li> OK, super dark to put on but no issue, did not stain me or hands then again I wash after use,&lt;br /&gt;Smells just fine, apply before tan and enjoy same quality of a tan to I guess a bad cheap lotion I&#x27;ve used so many This is the worst so can&#x27;t com pair there.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> I already soak up color quick, but this really helps get that awesome tan that you want to have! Great product.</li>
    <li> WOULD HAVE LOVED IT I GOT SOME FROM THE SALON AND WORKS REALLY WELLLEAVES YOUR SKIN SOFT AND DOES NOT STREAK</li>
