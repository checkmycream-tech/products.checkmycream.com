### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>or if I won the lottery, but I will never stop taking these ever! :D  </li>
      <li>It is a perfect combination!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it.  </li>
      <li>very happy.  </li>
      <li>the best part!!!  </li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>Works great, speedy delivery</li>
      <li>This stuff works great.</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>So when I saw this I had to order it and this stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>Body Mint is amazing!</li>
      <li>Body Mint has been really good at reducing the odor.</li>
      <li>My friend told me about body mint and it is amazing.</li>
      <li>seller was excellent and these really work</li>
      <li>So I had already written a really nice review on Body Mint Lady.</li>
      <li>Great breath, sweet smelling pits, and even my feet have no funk.</li>
      <li>Love them.  </li>
      <li>Love this Product because when I work out I do not have body odor</li>
      <li>I love this product, but let me tell you, drink a lot of water.  </li>
      <li>I have been in the background mostly all my life because I smelled..</li>
      <li>I love Body Mint</li>
      <li>The Sport brand as more of an &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; than the one for ladies</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>And it got even better a day after that.</li>
      <li>I thought it would do more.</li>
      <li>and it also was more &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I suppose this could also be as a result of taking in more water, but I&#x27;ve tried to to drink more water since stopping this product, and I just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m assuming if I take 2 a day as the directions state, I&#x27;m sure it will help.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>It seems to work better than anything else I have tried.</li>
      <li>I will give it one more try as I know it can take time to cleanse your system.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it...</li>
      <li>Works ok, but I find the original Body Mint to be more effective</li>
      <li>But this made it really easy</li>
      <li>Well after a week I felt fine and in this time I wasn&#x27;t taking body mint.</li>
      <li>they always give me a free tea sample with my order....</li>
      <li>I primarily got this for armpit odor.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t wait to hang out with a boy now either because I will never be self conscious about how I smell (or taste) down there because this stuff is awesome.</li>
      <li>I never thought I would be so excited to get a pill in the mail</li>
      <li>I had gave it a 5 star and will buy more before I finish the first bottle.</li>
      <li>I still feel clean despite living in a tropical environment.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t be certain, but I felt better after I stopped taking them.</li>
      <li>This is a perfect product for individuals who are allergic to certain ingredients commonly found in deodorant, and works better than the deodorant crystals, or those who struggle with foot odor.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does, even if you skip a shower one day, if you are taking this regularly all smelly areas smell great.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s full benefits.</li>
      <li>not overwhelming... but a nice floral fragrance as if I were in a gorgeous spring garden.  </li>
      <li>I have used Body Mints off and on for several years and I am very pleased with them.</li>
      <li>After using body mint, I noticed a difference on the very first day of using it.  </li>
      <li>I would need a little longer to see if it is effective but seems to be ok..</li>
      <li>I feel like I have  found the right product for my problem.</li>
      <li>and they also have vitamin D which most woman could use a little more of.</li>
      <li>I am pre-menopausal and sweat like a married man in a room full of mistresses, so I need as much help as I can get.</li>
      <li>They really work too!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I would most definitely but from this seller again; it came in two days as promised!</li>
      <li>Perhaps I needed to drink more water, which is what I&#x27;m currently doing with the body mint sport.</li>
      <li>I have found that in the hot humid southern summers taking one &amp;#34;Body Mint Lady&amp;#34; and one reg &amp;#34;Body Mint&amp;#34; works better.  </li>
      <li>it makes my whole body smell fresh.</li>
      <li>The bonus: Totally LADY CONFIDENT.</li>
      <li>the third day, my breath is now sweet.  YAY!  </li>
      <li>I prefer the coating on these over the body mint sport, but these weren&#x27;t strong enough for me.</li>
      <li>the only thing i strongly advise is as the box says drink plenty of water when taking this product or you will suffer the consequences.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been taking these for a couple months now and they work really well.</li>
      <li>no matter how much I try to force myself.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>So much so that, even with clinical deodorant, the items that I&#x27;d wear every day like my sweaters and pajamas would stink by the armpit area.</li>
      <li>So much so that sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like I need to shower at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I have now finished off this whole bottle, taking one in the morning and one in the evening.</li>
      <li>It was really embarrassing.</li>
      <li>It really does work.</li>
      <li>The product really didn&#x27;t work and I did everything I was supposed to while using it.</li>
      <li>Body Mint Lady really works.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really notice a difference either way</li>
      <li>i have tried others but none have help much.</li>
      <li>I am a Registered Nurse and have recommended them to many other people.</li>
      <li>Special soaps were just not enough.  </li>
      <li>They definitely need to be taken every morning and night to have the full effect</li>
      <li>I had high hopes owell</li>
      <li>Normally I take a shower at night before bed and one when I wake up in the morning.</li>
      <li>Is has not gone away permanently, but it&#x27;s been reduced to the normal level.</li>
      <li>the pill itself - It is not hard to swallow, doesn&#x27;t have a taste and there is no after taste.</li>
      <li>I got this product because a new prescription medication started changing my body chemistry, and I didn&#x27;t like the new &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34; as a result of it.</li>
      <li>I am relatively new to this type of product, but I would recommend it without any hesitation.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>I am actually a fan of this product, but again, I wish it came in a higher strength.</li>
      <li>Really, WOW!</li>
      <li>I feel so much confident now that I do not have to mask the odor with excessive bathing and products.</li>
      <li>I feel extreme clean after every use.</li>
      <li>I am 40 years old</li>
      <li>It seems to work well so far.</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell this is snake oil.</li>
      <li>These mints really work and I can&#x27;t recommend them enough.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t really helped with my breath, but I only take 1 pill a day</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, I did notice an unexpected bonus benefit from using this product....</li>
      <li>WOW.  </li>
      <li>The odor was completely gone.</li>
      <li>I was very self conscious about raising my arms and it really started to hinder just everyday life and wanting to work out, etc.</li>
      <li>I would not necessarily go that far, however I would say that the lady odor is far reduced.</li>
      <li>I am only taking one pill per day and alternating it with the Original Body Mint (green label/green cap).  </li>
      <li>(also, it&#x27;s possible this didn&#x27;t work as well for me exactly BECAUSE my change in body chemistry is due to prescription medication, as opposed to natural biological causes).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i like this product. it works well for me. i have tried others but none have help much. the only thing i strongly advise is as the box says drink plenty of water when taking this product or you will suffer the consequences. i think this would help alot of women if they had a commerical for it.</li>
    <li> seller was excellent and these really work</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really notice a difference either way</li>
    <li> I thought it would do more. No difference was detected by me.</li>
    <li> Body Mint Lady really works. I was looking for something and even asked my doctor if there was a pill for the problem and there wasn&#x27;t. Special soaps were just not enough.  I was skeptical at first, but you don&#x27;t need to be. These mints really work and I can&#x27;t recommend them enough.</li>
    <li> Works great, speedy delivery</li>
    <li> It does work.... U need to drink plenty of water</li>
    <li> There are cheaper products that do the same thing.  &amp;#34;Lady&amp;#34; is just a word for this product.</li>
    <li> I am only taking one pill per day and alternating it with the Original Body Mint (green label/green cap).  It seems to work better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> With the &amp;#34;change&amp;#34; have come other lady things that I did not know would occur. One reviewer said her lady bits smelled like candy. I would not necessarily go that far, however I would say that the lady odor is far reduced. I primarily got this for armpit odor. Now that I am going through a change in my body, I noticed that my flora is a bit different now. I wanted something that would cut down on the stronger smells. Clinical deodorant was not doing anything for me, and my armpits seemed like they hated me and hated life. I have now finished off this whole bottle, taking one in the morning and one in the evening. I am out, and I am panicking now. This product absolutely does cut down on odor. If you are a lady, maybe a little bit older, experiencing the change of life, or maybe just naturally sweaty, this is definitely a game changer.</li>
    <li> Love this Product because when I work out I do not have body odor</li>
    <li> I have suffered from excessive underarm perspiration which comes with an odor for as long as I can remember. Normally I take a shower at night before bed and one when I wake up in the morning. I have used a lot of expensive products to keep the odor under control. One day after taking Body Mint Lady, I have noticed a difference. I took my second pill before bed, I did not use any deodorant because I wanted to smell the difference. The odor was completely gone. I feel so much confident now that I do not have to mask the odor with excessive bathing and products. THIS PRODUCT DOES WORK AND I WILL USE IT FOREVER. THANK YOU, BODY MINT LADY.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Whatever was going on with me is now neutral. I actually noticed a difference the next morning after just one dose. And it got even better a day after that. Take it twice a day or you will notice when you don&#x27;t take it.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell this is snake oil. It does turn your Pee a different color. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Ladies, this is not the answer. Product fail, for sure. I went back to my $1.54 deodorant just 3 days after taking this, as directed.</li>
    <li> No more sprays and worries about people noticing any offensive odors! I don&#x27;t have any side effects!!  I like this product because I only take two a day a forget about it until tomorrow!  I feel like I have  found the right product for my problem.</li>
    <li> So I had already written a really nice review on Body Mint Lady. However, after a few weeks of use I noticed I had some severe chest pain. I thought I was having a heart attack! Then the worst part came I couldn&#x27;t breathe well for three days. One night It was so bad I had a panic attack and had to go to the emergency room. After a night in the emergency room they couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong with me. My white blood count was elevated and they thought I could of had a blood clot!  It was terrifying to say the least. They did all the test x ray, CT scan and couldn&#x27;t find anything. So they just wrote it off as a lung infection. Well after a week I felt fine and in this time I wasn&#x27;t taking body mint. So the day before yesterday I decided to start back on it and that is when I noticed the chest pain trying to come back. So I googled body mint and chest pain and found out that chest pain and breathing problems is a side effect!! I saw the lesser side effects that they provide but no where did they state chest pain and breathing difficulties. So buyer beware especially if you have food allergies. Just recognize that if you begin to have chest paint and breathing troubles discontinue immediately!!!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work as well as the regular Body Mint.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it.  I&#x27;ll stay with the regular type.</li>
    <li> I prefer the coating on these over the body mint sport, but these weren&#x27;t strong enough for me. Perhaps I needed to drink more water, which is what I&#x27;m currently doing with the body mint sport. This one does seem to be a bit get let than the sport and does not have the nasty &amp;#34;potted plant&amp;#34; smell that the other one does, but it just needs to be a tad stronger. I am pre-menopausal and sweat like a married man in a room full of mistresses, so I need as much help as I can get. I am actually a fan of this product, but again, I wish it came in a higher strength. I would most definitely but from this seller again; it came in two days as promised!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I order it all the time.  I feel extreme clean after every use. I will continue to order.</li>
    <li> Helps neutralize to some extent body odors. You will burp the fragrance!</li>
    <li> I got this product because a new prescription medication started changing my body chemistry, and I didn&#x27;t like the new &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34; as a result of it. So as far as the &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34; go, I&#x27;ve only noticed a very small difference - a difference that I&#x27;m not sure is worth the current price (also, it&#x27;s possible this didn&#x27;t work as well for me exactly BECAUSE my change in body chemistry is due to prescription medication, as opposed to natural biological causes). HOWEVER, I did notice an unexpected bonus benefit from using this product.... It made me crave water. I know the directions say that, in order for it to work, you need to consume plenty of water, but this is something that&#x27;s always been very difficult for me, no matter how much I try to force myself. But this made it really easy - like I said, I actually CRAVED water! And it decreased my sweet and sugar cravings. I also have fibromyalgia and chronic pain, and for some odd reason, I had less pain, better sleep, and my legs were less fatigued while taking this. I suppose this could also be as a result of taking in more water, but I&#x27;ve tried to to drink more water since stopping this product, and I just can&#x27;t do it. So I am re-ordering again simply for the benefit of the cravings for water.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these work as well as the regular body mint do but it works ok. I think I&#x27;ll just stick to the regular but I do appreciate the coating on them</li>
    <li> Body Mint is amazing! I am 40 years old and I have been noticing my odor has recently become stronger.  My friend told me about body mint and it is amazing. I don&#x27;t have  any foot odor or body odor.  I&#x27;m hooked!!!</li>
    <li> These made me feel really awful. I got really bad headaches stomach aches, cramps, &amp; dry mouth. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic. My only allergies are environmental/seasonal, so I guess it would make sense that I would be allergic to chlorophyll. I&#x27;m not a doctor so I can&#x27;t be certain, but I felt better after I stopped taking them.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for bo.... my poop did turn green.</li>
    <li> I took it for a month. I wouldnt buy this product again. Didn&#x27;t see any change. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> The title says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was a little skeptical at first, but a pill that makes me smell lovely?  Even my terrible stinky feet?  Well, I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First day I didn&#x27;t notice any changes, this is from following directions by taking one in the morning and one at night.  But by day two... WOW.  I noticed the change after my workout that my sweat smelled floral...not perfumey...not overwhelming... but a nice floral fragrance as if I were in a gorgeous spring garden.  This effect has lasted ever since. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the third day, my breath is now sweet.  YAY!  And my feet no longer stink, they also smell like flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the best part!!!  OMG.  My lady bits smell and taste like candy (Husband&#x27;s testimonial).  BONUS!  I am not sure if this a normal side effect or if I won the lottery, but I will never stop taking these ever! :D  So far, I haven&#x27;t had any negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the pill itself - It is not hard to swallow, doesn&#x27;t have a taste and there is no after taste.</li>
    <li> I love Body Mint it makes my whole body smell fresh. I had gave it a 5 star and will buy more before I finish the first bottle.</li>
    <li> This keeps me from having embarrassing odor.  I&#x27;m menopausal and I sweat a lot.  I don&#x27;t mind now that I know it will not have a bad odor.</li>
    <li> I like it  because it works as long  as you drink the water as directed. A little on the high price side.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a change while using this product.</li>
    <li> I think it worked. It didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I am never going to be without it. It does exactly what it says it does, even if you skip a shower one day, if you are taking this regularly all smelly areas smell great.</li>
    <li> It does not work on body odor!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing some horrible body order lately.. unsure what is causing it, but I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing helped. It was really embarrassing. After using body mint, I noticed a difference on the very first day of using it.  I love it!! It hasn&#x27;t really helped with my breath, but I only take 1 pill a day so I&#x27;m assuming if I take 2 a day as the directions state, I&#x27;m sure it will help.  I will always use this product from now on.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I must admit I was somewhat skeptical, but this product does exactly what it says it does and you don&#x27;t have to wait days to see it.  I literally took a mint the night of receiving my bottle and saw a difference the next day.  I absolutely love it...no more spending extra money on advance deodorants.</li>
    <li> Works ok, but I find the original Body Mint to be more effective</li>
    <li> I have been in the background mostly all my life because I smelled.. I came across this product so I decided to try it.. it is working for for me, people at work talk to me, I feel like I can have a life now.... thanks</li>
    <li> This product works...as body odor decreased.... does not really make you smell better.....but I would say it works but not all that it seemed like looking at the packaging.</li>
    <li> Cannot tell a difference in body sweat from this supplement.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would be so excited to get a pill in the mail as I was when I ordered this. The past year I have become a lot more active and my body odor was getting out of control, I was buying CertainDri and using mens deodorant to help the terrible BO... but nothing was working. I was very self conscious about raising my arms and it really started to hinder just everyday life and wanting to work out, etc. So when I saw this I had to order it and this stuff is amazing! I took it the night I got it and woke up and put deodorant on and the only smell I smelled was my deodorant, it was not just covering up the smell, but the smell was gone! I honestly can&#x27;t wait to hang out with a boy now either because I will never be self conscious about how I smell (or taste) down there because this stuff is awesome. Not only does it help with foul odors, but I have a problem with constipation and this oddly seems to keep me regular. I would highly recommend to anyone that thinks deodorant is not enough and need something a little more serious. LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the products for about a month now. I started taking both items (2 a day - 1 in AM and 1 in PM). I work out 3 - 4 times a week and while I still sweat I didn&#x27;t smell as &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34;! The Sport brand as more of an &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; than the one for ladies and it also was more &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34;. When I went to the bathroom it did turn my stool green...sorry to sound gross...but it did. I am anticipating on seeing additional benefits as time progresses but at this time I would recommend both or either products.</li>
    <li> Uh...wow! Really, WOW! I had been trying remedies for bad breath when I came across Body Mint. Then I saw the Body Mind Lady and figured, why not cover all the bases. Holy cow! Within two days everything was, like, in balance. Great breath, sweet smelling pits, and even my feet have no funk. The bonus: Totally LADY CONFIDENT. Also, I only take one per day. (BTW, I am so not getting paid for this review.)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I will give it one more try as I know it can take time to cleanse your system.</li>
    <li> I would need a little longer to see if it is effective but seems to be ok..</li>
    <li> It seems to work well so far. Except my bowel movement is green. Not sure what that is all about.</li>
    <li> The only thing it helped with was underarm odor .....everything else it made worse..back to the drawing board for me...</li>
    <li> very happy.  they always give me a free tea sample with my order....&lt;br /&gt;love this product !!!</li>
    <li> Im halfway through the bottle and i notice nothing and i read the reviews about drinking alot of water that is all i drink all day anyway i guess this just doesn&#x27;t work for anyone!!!! I had high hopes owell</li>
    <li> I will keep taking these as long as I can.  Love them.  They really work too!</li>
    <li> This product is formulated especially for woman with Vitamin D and Calcium added.  It also is coated so that the chlorophyll doesn&#x27;t leave your hands dirty.  I am relatively new to this type of product, but I would recommend it without any hesitation. The only problem is that after awhile, this product works so well I forget to use my deodorant!  This is a perfect product for individuals who are allergic to certain ingredients commonly found in deodorant, and works better than the deodorant crystals, or those who struggle with foot odor.  I have found that in the hot humid southern summers taking one &amp;#34;Body Mint Lady&amp;#34; and one reg &amp;#34;Body Mint&amp;#34; works better.  It is a perfect combination!</li>
    <li> One of my medications causes me to have stronger underarm odor than I used to. So much so that, even with clinical deodorant, the items that I&#x27;d wear every day like my sweaters and pajamas would stink by the armpit area. Body Mint has been really good at reducing the odor. Is has not gone away permanently, but it&#x27;s been reduced to the normal level. My underarms are the only places that needed help, but I do agree with the other women who say they feel fresher overall. So much so that sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like I need to shower at the end of the day. I still feel clean despite living in a tropical environment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for a couple months now and they work really well. I noticed results after two days of taking them morning and night. Compared to other Body Mint or chlorophyllin products, these are coated so they don&#x27;t have that icky chlorophyll taste and they also have vitamin D which most woman could use a little more of. They definitely need to be taken every morning and night to have the full effect but if you forget you can always just take it as soon as you remember and start again.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I think of these pills.  I think they were o.k.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but let me tell you, drink a lot of water.  I hate drinking water if M not working out, but with this, you need a lot of water to reap it&#x27;s full benefits.</li>
    <li> I continue to order this over and over again. . I swear by this product. It really does work.</li>
    <li> No noticible difference over the coarse of going through the bottle.</li>
    <li> The product really didn&#x27;t work and I did everything I was supposed to while using it.</li>
    <li> No, I  couldn&#x27;t  tell  any difference  at all.</li>
    <li> I have used Body Mints off and on for several years and I am very pleased with them. I am a Registered Nurse and have recommended them to many other people. They do work!</li>
