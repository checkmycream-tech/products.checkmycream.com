      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite, along with L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s lemon verbena, which is a TAD sugary, but delightful if you&#x27;re a lemon freak like I am.</li>

      <li>I was thrilled when I saw the perfume.</li>
      <li>Kind of makes you wonder why they call it Lemon Eau de Parfum???</li>
      <li>This is by far the best smelling perfume/body spray I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t smell like you just sprayed pledge all over yourself, it really is the perfect lemon scent.</li>
      <li>it is a very light fragrance that lingers.</li>
      <li>It smells very light and neutral.</li>
      <li>With that said, I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite scents and BBW no longer carries it.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m really enjoying wearing it.</li>
      <li>so I must just get used to the scent to the point of not being able to smell on myself.</li>
      <li>Most perfumes give me a headache, but not this one.</li>
      <li>you have a nice light summer fragrance..</li>
      <li>Give me a couple more strongly-scented hours, C.O. Bigelow, and I&#x27;ll buy this stuff in bulk.</li>
      <li>I was quite pleased to find it online.</li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;m most bothered by it because it smells like my uncle&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
      <li>Love this scent.</li>
      <li>Love this parfum and body lotion....  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of lemon.</li>
      <li>and now I won&#x27;t be able to find it.  </li>
      <li>I just love this spray.</li>
      <li>love it and will buy it again..</li>
      <li>I love the smell of lemons, and for a while had been looking for a perfume smelling of it.</li>
      <li>Love this clean, lemony scent!</li>
      <li>Very clean.</li>
      <li>Even after a full shift at a restaurant I still smell like lemony goodness!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re into light scents for warm weather but aren&#x27;t a floral or musk type of girl, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>I thought this was too subtle, but upon wearing on a warm day it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
      <li>I paid a lot of money for something that I was really excited about but now strongly dislike.</li>
      <li>If I were to describe this fragrance, I would say that it reminds me of a lobby of a very fancy hotel, maybe like a Ritz Carlton, somewhere in warm weather.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t cheap either</li>
      <li>The price was right and it shipped right away - I LOVE THIS SCENT!  </li>
      <li>I find it just very fresh.</li>
      <li>Clean smell and not over powering.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good buy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh, clean and just a tad fruity.</li>
      <li>Perfumes turn very sweet on my skin so as a result the musk really comes out on this perfume.</li>
      <li>it smells clean, fresh and like lemon with a bit of nice clean white musk..</li>
      <li>Fresh lemons off of a tree describes this clean crisp scent.</li>
      <li>I liked the scent of the cream and assumed that the perfume would smell the same...</li>
      <li>It smells like fresh lemons, with maybe a hint of spice to it.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>It smells just like fresh cut lemon.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a fresh and fruity, citrus/lemon scent.  </li>
      <li>Smells like fresh lemons, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I love this scent and it is the only perfume I have ever used until its completion.</li>
      <li>It smells sort of citrus-y on first spray, but then it mellows out to a unisex, creamier scent.  </li>
      <li>glad it&#x27;s back.  </li>
      <li>Exactly like a bowl of lemons.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal; pure, freshly-squeezed lemon perfume!</li>
      <li>It is not overly strong and it is a very simple lemony fragrance.</li>
      <li>If pure lemon juice wasn&#x27;t so sticky, I&#x27;d squeeze a lemon on myself every morning.</li>
      <li>My daughter tried it too, and you could really smell the lemon on her.</li>
      <li>To me, that just shows the real versatility of this product.</li>
      <li>On my skin, it goes on lemon, but the musk notes really stand out on me.</li>
      <li>This scent is very androgynous.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery too...</li>
      <li>I sprayed it on and waited a few hours to see if I liked it.</li>
      <li>I have major issues with selecting a scent, no sales lady has ever been able to help me, I just don&#x27;t like the traditional musk/sandalwood/heavy combos I find.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clean fresh scent without the chemical tones of other perfumes, and doesn&#x27;t smell like a cleaning product either!</li>
      <li>I particularly like the barbershop smell of Pinaud Clubman aftershave and talc powder, to me</li>
      <li>It also has done pretty well in the bottle, I&#x27;ve had my same one for almost 3 years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a man who leans towards masculine scents.</li>
      <li>first I was a little worried that this would make me smell too girlish, but far from it.</li>
      <li>Like another reviewer, this is the only perfume I have completely used up (and the only one I have repurchased).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Several hrs later I could smell my fresh lemon perfume drying down!</li>
      <li>It is very light and short acting unfortunately.</li>
      <li>It is Hard to find the fresh sent of Lemon..</li>

<li> Was disappointed as I really more lemon smell..</li>
<li> I know this product is in the Women&#x27;s section of Amazon, but if you walk into the Bath &amp; Body Works, you&#x27;ll find it in the Men&#x27;s section by the other Bigelow products, which is where I stumbled upon it.</li>
<li> so I would have expected the fragrance to linger a little longer.  </li>
<li> I am a perfume and a scented lotion fanatic and never stick with the same fragrance.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t help but sniff my arm for the next few hours!!  </li>
<li> less then 40.oo</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it is a tad expensive for me and doesn&#x27;t last on the skin as long as I would like.</li>

    <li> this is a great summer/spring perfume. it smells clean, fresh and like lemon with a bit of nice clean white musk.. it is a very light fragrance that lingers. but is not overwhelming..&lt;br /&gt;for less then 40.oo you have a nice light summer fragrance.. love it and will buy it again..</li>
    <li> I just saw this today at Bath n Body. I received the lotion, body wash and hand soap as a gift. I was thrilled when I saw the perfume. I sprayed it on and waited a few hours to see if I liked it. I couldn&#x27;t help but sniff my arm for the next few hours!!  I LOVE IT!! On my skin, it goes on lemon, but the musk notes really stand out on me. My daughter tried it too, and you could really smell the lemon on her. I think this is FABULOUS!!! Now I need to go back and buy it!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a citrusy scent, this one is not that. Kind of makes you wonder why they call it Lemon Eau de Parfum???</li>
    <li> This is by far the best smelling perfume/body spray I have ever used. I am a perfume and a scented lotion fanatic and never stick with the same fragrance. I am considering stock piling this one. Please C.O. Bigelow don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and it is the only perfume I have ever used until its completion. It is not overly strong and it is a very simple lemony fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of lemons, and for a while had been looking for a perfume smelling of it. This is a really good smelling one. Fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t smell like you just sprayed pledge all over yourself, it really is the perfect lemon scent.</li>

    <li> I thought this was too subtle, but upon wearing on a warm day it&#x27;s just perfect. Several hrs later I could smell my fresh lemon perfume drying down!</li>
    <li> Returning a car at the rental agency--grumpy guy employee says, &amp;#34;You smell good&amp;#34;!  Even though I can&#x27;t smell it on myself after an hour or two, it must be lasting because others comment on it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad it&#x27;s back.  I&#x27;m hording a couple of bottles in case it goes away again.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume! Smells like fresh lemons, but not overpowering. Scent fades to me over a couple hours, but my clothes still smell like it the next day so I must just get used to the scent to the point of not being able to smell on myself. Most perfumes give me a headache, but not this one. Love it!</li>
    <li> I know this product is in the Women&#x27;s section of Amazon, but if you walk into the Bath &amp; Body Works, you&#x27;ll find it in the Men&#x27;s section by the other Bigelow products, which is where I stumbled upon it. To me, that just shows the real versatility of this product. I&#x27;m a man who leans towards masculine scents. I particularly like the barbershop smell of Pinaud Clubman aftershave and talc powder, to me that&#x27;s the ultimate. For colognes, I typically like heavily spiced smells like Egoiste Platinum and Abercrombie Woods. With that said, I absolutely love this fragrance. It smells like fresh lemons, with maybe a hint of spice to it. It&#x27;s amazing. If I were to describe this fragrance, I would say that it reminds me of a lobby of a very fancy hotel, maybe like a Ritz Carlton, somewhere in warm weather. Very clean. Very refreshing. It also lasts a very long time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a little worried that this would make me smell too girlish, but far from it. I find it just very fresh. Exactly like a bowl of lemons. And I&#x27;m really enjoying wearing it. And it&#x27;s a great price for a product that lasts.</li>
    <li> Too coconut  and not enough lemon.  Was disappointed as I really more lemon smell..I do know that a real lemon perfume is hard to find</li>
    <li> Amazing seller and amazing perfume I love the smell of lemon.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Great for a nice summery time scent. Floral lemons but not overpowering. The only negative feedback on this product is that it does not have a long time for the scent to stay.  It is very light and short acting unfortunately. Respray is inevitable.</li>
    <li> Great smelling perfume. It&#x27;s fresh, clean and just a tad fruity. My only concern is that it&#x27;s not lemony enough when it sets on skin. Overall, a good buy. I reccomend.</li>
    <li> This scent is very pleasant, however it has a strong musk smell. Perfumes turn very sweet on my skin so as a result the musk really comes out on this perfume. The scent also fades very fast within half an hour, but you can slightly detect it on your skin five hours later.</li>
    <li> You need to keep spraying this for the scent to last.  I don&#x27;t think they put in enough fragrance for this spray.  I like the scent buy hate that it doesn&#x27;t last at all.  It wasn&#x27;t cheap either so I would have expected the fragrance to linger a little longer.  They need to fix that problem.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents and BBW no longer carries it.  I was quite pleased to find it online.</li>
    <li> This scent is very androgynous. It smells very light and neutral. You don&#x27;t walk around smelling like a giant lemon. It&#x27;s just really really good. However, the scent only lasts about half an hour to an hour after I spray it. After that, there is only a faint linger.</li>
    <li> I am angry that they are discontinuing this product.  It smells just like fresh cut lemon.  It is my signature scent and now I won&#x27;t be able to find it.  I understand they are discontinuing the cream body wash as well, I depend on that in the winter to keep from drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> Get a compliment every time I have every worn it! It&#x27;s a clean fresh scent without the chemical tones of other perfumes, and doesn&#x27;t smell like a cleaning product either!</li>
    <li> It is Hard to find the fresh sent of Lemon..Love this parfum and body lotion....  Clean smell and not over powering.</li>
    <li> I smelled the body cream, but the fragrance was out-of-stock at the 2 store locations I visited.  I liked the scent of the cream and assumed that the perfume would smell the same... it doesn&#x27;t.  It smells sort of citrus-y on first spray, but then it mellows out to a unisex, creamier scent.  In fact, I&#x27;m most bothered by it because it smells like my uncle&#x27;s cologne.  It works for him, but it&#x27;s not for me.  I wanted a fresh and fruity, citrus/lemon scent.  I paid a lot of money for something that I was really excited about but now strongly dislike.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather snobby about my citrus perfumes. I want to smell like a lemon or a grapefruit, not a flowery mush with fruity undertones. If pure lemon juice wasn&#x27;t so sticky, I&#x27;d squeeze a lemon on myself every morning. That&#x27;s how devoted I am to smelling like a citrus fruit. So believe me when I say, this stuff smells like a freshly-squeezed lemon! I always get compliments when I wear this perfume. Like another reviewer, this is the only perfume I have completely used up (and the only one I have repurchased).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very educated on the notes used in fragrances or the cheesy terms to describe them, but I truly think \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; when I smell Lemon Eau De Parfum. No Lysol smell or vanilla hints. This is the real deal; pure, freshly-squeezed lemon perfume! My only complaint is that it is a tad expensive for me and doesn&#x27;t last on the skin as long as I would like. Give me a couple more strongly-scented hours, C.O. Bigelow, and I&#x27;ll buy this stuff in bulk.</li>
    <li> When a local retailer discontinued this item, I was devastated.  Nothing compares to the clean scent it provides - perfect for Summer.  The price was right and it shipped right away - I LOVE THIS SCENT!  KUDOS!!</li>
    <li> I have major issues with selecting a scent, no sales lady has ever been able to help me, I just don&#x27;t like the traditional musk/sandalwood/heavy combos I find. The best luck I&#x27;ve ever had is with this lemon scent. It&#x27;s my go to in spring/summer, and it lasts forever on my skin. Even after a full shift at a restaurant I still smell like lemony goodness! It also has done pretty well in the bottle, I&#x27;ve had my same one for almost 3 years and it hasn&#x27;t denatured or started to get funky undertones. If you&#x27;re into light scents for warm weather but aren&#x27;t a floral or musk type of girl, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I just love this spray.</li>
    <li> Love this clean, lemony scent! It is made for men, but women love it too!</li>
    <li> The best lite lemont scent I have&lt;br /&gt;found.  Bath and Body Works does&lt;br /&gt;not carry this cologne anymore.</li>
    <li> What a great deal!  Fast delivery too...</li>
