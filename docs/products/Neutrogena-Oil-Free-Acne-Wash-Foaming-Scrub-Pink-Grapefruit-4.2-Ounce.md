      <li>Good luck!!</li>
      <li>I also take a womens one-a-day and my skin went from looking like a teenagers to basically flawless.</li>
      <li>but its the best stuff ive used.</li>
      <li>I also have always had incredibly oily skin.  </li>
      <li>So I used it and loved it!</li>
      <li>The product is GREAT.  </li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>Works great, smells awesome and feels nice on the face.</li>
      <li>So I bought it myself and it has been amazing!</li>
      <li>The smell is good too.</li>
      <li>and NO it doesnt look good....</li>
      <li>Ended up costing me way more! UG</li>
      <li>so I know for sure it  was caused by this face wash!     </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>- I thought it could be from the warm water</li>
      <li>Best of all, this remedy is absolutely affordable.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s better to just practice good hygiene than to fill yourself up with hormone killing medicine to stop your face problem.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, I&#x27;ve been using an oil free \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; mosturizer after each wash to replenish some moisture, so that may make a difference.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Smells refreshing</li>
      <li>when using this product --there are tons of better products out there -</li>
      <li>We both decided to use this product having enjoyed the scent of grapefruit.</li>
      <li>While it didn&#x27;t make me break out like most face washes do</li>
      <li>It seems these products aided in producing MORE oil on my face.     </li>
      <li>The first time I used this I loved it.  </li>
      <li>delicious smell, leaves my face soft and with a very fresh clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Oh, and I don&#x27;t find the smell to be overly strong either.  </li>
      <li>well she probably has a huge acne problem as well (that she hides by smothering on makeup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you have a huge crush on...</li>
      <li>I got the mirror and BAM, huge hives all over my face.</li>
      <li>I like the light grapefruit scent and the exfoliating beads.</li>
      <li>Do NOT use if you have sensitive skin prone to quick drying!!!</li>
      <li>I decided to purchase from internet for a fairly significant savings.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel clean without it.</li>
      <li>I love this face wash as it does really help out with clearing up my breakouts.</li>
      <li>It helps with mild acne without drying your skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this product with intentions of using it to wash my face while I was taking a shower - after the first time I used it, I stepped out of the shower and my face was BRIGHT red</li>
      <li>The smell was a bit strong, but I thought it exfoliated my face really well</li>
      <li>First let me say that I am a redhead and Scottish which gives me the wonderful benefit of having sensitive skin, but not really.</li>
      <li>We love this stuff, and it&#x27;s cheaper here than any store near us.  </li>
      <li>Its an acne cleanser, right?</li>
      <li>Perhaps if your skin isn&#x27;t dry and/or sensitive, this product will work great for you.  </li>
      <li>It effectively takes off my make up and exfoliates dry spots on my face.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a couple different flavors, and each one has a moderate price tag (~$5, Amazon has them in bundle packs), but it sure is satisfying to wash your face with this scrub in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product it works so well especially for people like me with oily skin it gets rid of blemishes fast and it feels fresh</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product consistently until about a week ago.</li>
      <li>It got rid of the impending zits, but it also took care of the first couple of layers of skin.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash line since I was a teenager, and was pleasantly surprised when they came out with this grapefruit scented wash.</li>
      <li>For the first time, I am seeing results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fairly harsh scrub, more so than some of the microdermabrasion scrubs I&#x27;ve used, and has a strong chemical/grapefruit smell that my husband wrinkled his nose at.  </li>
      <li>I heard of this product from a friend that promised it would heal my *very mild acne* and not dry my skin out in the process.</li>
      <li>Pretty much crack.</li>
      <li>Okay, well it made my skin EXTREMELY dry, and it made my eyes puffy.</li>
      <li>bright red still, and felt so tight that couldn&#x27;t smile without my face hurting.</li>
      <li>My skin after using it felt very clean and soft, not dry at all.</li>
      <li>maybe you can&#x27;t really stop the acne</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it...</li>
      <li>(though couldn&#x27;t afford one of those haha).  </li>
      <li>Also my skin is usually very oily</li>
      <li>I know that sounds gross, but it&#x27;s a dream come true for me.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty normal but sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to have to be more careful about getting this stuff on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This product is highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Instead of using your bacteria-laced nails, this soap has little balls of magic that scratch wherever your face is itching.  </li>
      <li>(from a 33yr old mother of 2 who has fought acne her whole life)</li>
      <li>I used it everyday for months, and my acne was WAY BETTER.</li>
      <li>Pretty gross.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Once i tried it again my skin did not dry out to bad but the best part was all the acne was almost 100% gone in like 3 days...</li>
      <li>More often than not left my face red and dry.</li>
      <li>If this doesn&#x27;t clear up by Monday, I might have to go see a doctor.</li>
      <li>Clear, but peeling.  </li>
      <li>I have a combination complexion, which can sometimes be sensitive, and this product does not aggravate my skin.</li>
      <li>I have combination/fairly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>I decided to stop using it all together and by the time I was 22 years old my acne stopped.</li>
      <li>my skin was extremely dry, my sister broke out even more than before, and we both had these gross looking dry patches near our mouths and cheeks that we couldn&#x27;t even hide with make up.</li>
      <li>i decided to keep using it hoping that the slight dryness was only an initial thing and that it would just get better.</li>
      <li>My skin looks the clearest it has since as far back as I can remember.  </li>
      <li>it is VERY acidic and VERY harsh even on normal skin.</li>
      <li>My skin tends towards being sensitive and somewhat dry, but there aren&#x27;t any warnings on the package, so I went ahead and scrubbed.  </li>
      <li>I have never had dry skin, a problem with acne, or sensitive skin -</li>

<li> I have never had dry skin, a problem with acne, or sensitive skin -</li>
<li> So the first time that i used this product my skin got extremely dry and it pissed me off because if i rubbed my face on my shirt all this dead skin would be on the shirt.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews of people with similar reactions, it definitely wasn&#x27;t an allergic reaction, just this product completely burned my face ..</li>
<li> If you have sensitive skin, you probably should not buy this due to the obvious problem of the added scent.</li>
<li> After only two days my skin started feeling strange.</li>
<li> I continued however to get dry skin and have occasional pimples close to my menstrual cycle.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve struggled with oily skin for years and have spent major bucks on Proactiv, Clinique products, and prescription creams only to be let down in the end.</li>
<li> It took me nearly a week and a few days to get my skin to recover from the damage.</li>
<li> I never really write reviews, BUT, i just wanted to warn about this cleanser b/c I ended up having to go to an immediate care for facial swelling and hives.  </li>
<li> However, washed my face with this on Friday night, felt a bit strange.  </li>
<li> Neutrogena has done it again and earned a long time customer in me.</li>
<li> You can try it out for yourselves, but I have spoken with other strangers who have tried the product and they all claim the same happened to them.</li>
<li> Monday morning i woke to extremely parched, red, irritated skin.  </li>
<li> My skin was so dry that I had to put loads of lotion on it for a week until it went away.</li>
<li> Your face won&#x27;t feel dry at all after using it.</li>
<li> I used it twice, two days ago, and my skin is still peeling and dry.  </li>
<li> No new cyst type pimples have taken their place.  </li>
<li> the swelling/hives would not go down and ended up having to go to an allergist to double check about my reaction.  </li>
<li> The area around my lips was tight and it felt SO dry, even though I had moisturized last night.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> More often than not left my face red and dry. Getting a &amp;#34;microbead&amp;#34; in your eye can be extremely painful and very hard to remove.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works so well especially for people like me with oily skin it gets rid of blemishes fast and it feels fresh</li>
    <li> I have never had dry skin, a problem with acne, or sensitive skin - I bought this product with intentions of using it to wash my face while I was taking a shower - after the first time I used it, I stepped out of the shower and my face was BRIGHT red - I thought it could be from the warm water so I went on with my day..  I woke up the next morning and my face was peeling, bright red still, and felt so tight that couldn&#x27;t smile without my face hurting. I have never had any other problems with sacilyc acid products for my face .. this product is just awful - so awful that I never normally take the time to review products, I just thought it completely necessary to warn you all - I&#x27;ve read other reviews of people with similar reactions, it definitely wasn&#x27;t an allergic reaction, just this product completely burned my face ..so please be cautious when using this product --there are tons of better products out there - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product consistently until about a week ago. After a few days of use I noticed that my lips and the skin around my mouth felt tight, numb, and just plain weird. No I don&#x27;t scrub my lips with it but I must get some on them when I rinse. I&#x27;m going to have to be more careful about getting this stuff on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I loved it.  About a week after using it I started complaining my lips felt weird.  A few days later my lips started cracking and peeling.  While it didn&#x27;t make me break out like most face washes do it is VERY acidic and VERY harsh even on normal skin. I&#x27;d say use it once or twice periodically.</li>
    <li> This product did NOT do it for me. I have combination/fairly sensitive skin. I used this product three times- once saturday night, once sunday morning, and once sunday evening. Already by sunday evening my skin was starting to feel a bit odd. Monday morning i woke to extremely parched, red, irritated skin.  A coworker described my skin as looking as though i had broken out in hives and had an aklergic reaction. I discintinued used, it is now tuesday night and i am fighting back from clawing at my poor, dehydrated, parched skin. It feels tight and almost scaly to the touch.    Do NOT use if you have sensitive skin prone to quick drying!!!</li>
    <li> I actually found this product by stalking a perfect-skinned lady through the skin care aisle to see what she bought.  So I bought it myself and it has been amazing! I&#x27;ve always been one to have tiny baby pimples all over my forehead and cheeks, and then those big underground ones on my chin and temples.  I also have always had incredibly oily skin.  This wash gets rid of the oil and tightens up my skin.  After 2 weeks of use (twice daily) all the forhead pimples are gone and the underground chin pimples have come to the surface and relieved themselves and are clearing up.  I know that sounds gross, but it&#x27;s a dream come true for me.  No new cyst type pimples have taken their place.  My skin looks the clearest it has since as far back as I can remember.  To be fair, I&#x27;ve been using an oil free \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; mosturizer after each wash to replenish some moisture, so that may make a difference.  Oh, and I don&#x27;t find the smell to be overly strong either.  I give this scrub five stars!  (from a 33yr old mother of 2 who has fought acne her whole life)</li>
    <li> First let me say that I am a redhead and Scottish which gives me the wonderful benefit of having sensitive skin, but not really. I for years had problems with acne and didn&#x27;t find a cure until I used Proactiv, which worked wonders for me until I would stop using it and would then break out worse then when I started it. I decided to stop using it all together and by the time I was 22 years old my acne stopped. I continued however to get dry skin and have occasional pimples close to my menstrual cycle. I heard of this product from a friend that promised it would heal my *very mild acne* and not dry my skin out in the process. So I used it and loved it! My skin after using it felt very clean and soft, not dry at all. Which is saying allot cause most acne products dry your skin out horribly. The other plus was I didn&#x27;t have any reactions from it with my sensitive Scottish skin! Great product but I wouldn&#x27;t expect a miracle to happen if you have bad acne and are looking to this product to fix it. It helps with mild acne without drying your skin.</li>
    <li> Pretty much crack. I can&#x27;t stop using it. I don&#x27;t feel clean without it.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to do. Its an acne cleanser, right? Okay, well it made my skin EXTREMELY dry, and it made my eyes puffy. My skin was so dry that I had to put loads of lotion on it for a week until it went away. Everyone knows its not good for your skin to put lotion on it, but the dryness was so painful and irritating that I had to. Just as the dryness finally went away, I began breaking out because of the lotion! So basically the product MADE me break out rather than protecting me from breaking out. Moral of the story, don&#x27;t buy this. Its not worth the pain.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use this face wash. I like the light grapefruit scent and the exfoliating beads. Unlike some other face washes, I find this one doesn&#x27;t completely dry my skin out after I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with oily skin for years and have spent major bucks on Proactiv, Clinique products, and prescription creams only to be let down in the end. It seems these products aided in producing MORE oil on my face.     I bought this product a couple of days ago and already, the papules that have plagued my jawline are almost gone. The bumps along my forehead have cleared up. I definitely recommend this product to anyone with oily skin.     For the first time, I am seeing results. Best of all, this remedy is absolutely affordable.</li>
    <li> Well.  The product is GREAT.  I use it all the time.  But I usually buy it in store.  I decided to purchase from internet for a fairly significant savings.  However, it came in those &amp;#34;padded&amp;#34; envelopes and thus the caps on 2 of 3 of the items were smashed and thus completely busted.  :(</li>
    <li> Recently I have been breaking out around my cheek area. So I went to walmart and bought this product. I used it three times. The smell was a bit strong, but I thought it exfoliated my face really well and it did got rid of some of the little pimples. The next morning, my face felt weird, tight and my left eye was a bit swollen. After moisturizing/rubbing my face with a handful of lotion, it was still tight and it had a burning sensation all over my face. I didn&#x27;t think much of it...(Because I had been going to bed kinda late, so I thought it was due to that)     So...Yesterday morning i used it again, and so did last night. But this morning I woke up and realized my face felt really weird! So I jumped out of bed and went to the mirror and OM(F)G! Both of my eyes were swollen!!!! The area around my lips was tight and it felt SO dry, even though I had moisturized last night. All morning I have an ice pack on my eyes...and NO it doesnt look good....*cries..... The only changes I&#x27;ve done recently was switching my face wash so I know for sure it  was caused by this face wash!     It Labor Day weekend and it&#x27;s a BUMMER that I have to walk around with these swollen eyes. Even with makeup on, I don&#x27;t even look like myself... If this doesn&#x27;t clear up by Monday, I might have to go see a doctor. I will never use this product again!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this the other day, to get rid of the beginnings of a few unsightly zits.  It&#x27;s a fairly harsh scrub, more so than some of the microdermabrasion scrubs I&#x27;ve used, and has a strong chemical/grapefruit smell that my husband wrinkled his nose at.  My skin tends towards being sensitive and somewhat dry, but there aren&#x27;t any warnings on the package, so I went ahead and scrubbed.  It got rid of the impending zits, but it also took care of the first couple of layers of skin.  I used it twice, two days ago, and my skin is still peeling and dry.  Clear, but peeling.  Not quite the look I was going for, even if it is close to Halloween. Perhaps if your skin isn&#x27;t dry and/or sensitive, this product will work great for you.  As for me, I might try to use it as rust remover on some projects...</li>
    <li> I have pretty normal but sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t break out often but when i do i seem to get them all at once. My sister is the same way. We both decided to use this product having enjoyed the scent of grapefruit. After only two days my skin started feeling strange. i decided to keep using it hoping that the slight dryness was only an initial thing and that it would just get better. It definitely only got worse! my skin was extremely dry, my sister broke out even more than before, and we both had these gross looking dry patches near our mouths and cheeks that we couldn&#x27;t even hide with make up. It took me nearly a week and a few days to get my skin to recover from the damage. You can try it out for yourselves, but I have spoken with other strangers who have tried the product and they all claim the same happened to them. Stay away!</li>
    <li> I never really write reviews, BUT, i just wanted to warn about this cleanser b/c I ended up having to go to an immediate care for facial swelling and hives.  I have fairly sensitive skin, but nothing too crazy and have never had a bad allergic reaction from a product (save for a few breakouts from a lotion etc.) However, washed my face with this on Friday night, felt a bit strange.  Then, the next morning, I felt like my face was swollen  and decided to go on a run to depuff.  During my run, I felt like my cheeks were SO swollen, they were almost pushing into my eyes! I got the mirror and BAM, huge hives all over my face. I looked like I had a bad acid peel (though couldn&#x27;t afford one of those haha).  I had to go to immediate care b/c the swelling/hives would not go down and ended up having to go to an allergist to double check about my reaction.  So silly for this \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; cleanser. Ended up costing me way more! UG</li>
    <li> I have used the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash line since I was a teenager, and was pleasantly surprised when they came out with this grapefruit scented wash. It effectively takes off my make up and exfoliates dry spots on my face. I have a combination complexion, which can sometimes be sensitive, and this product does not aggravate my skin. It keeps pimples at bay.     If you have sensitive skin, you probably should not buy this due to the obvious problem of the added scent. Neutrogena has done it again and earned a long time customer in me. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> We love this stuff, and it&#x27;s cheaper here than any store near us.  Works great, smells awesome and feels nice on the face.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a teenager, acne&#x27;s probably a problem for you.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s better to just practice good hygiene than to fill yourself up with hormone killing medicine to stop your face problem.  So you&#x27;re embarrassed that your acne problem will hinder your advances towards that girl you have a huge crush on... well she probably has a huge acne problem as well (that she hides by smothering on makeup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay maybe you can&#x27;t really stop the acne cause it has something to do with hormones and stuff.  But at least you can sooth the itching in a non-infective way with Neutrogena&#x27;s scrubbing face wash.  Instead of using your bacteria-laced nails, this soap has little balls of magic that scratch wherever your face is itching.  There&#x27;s a couple different flavors, and each one has a moderate price tag (~$5, Amazon has them in bundle packs), but it sure is satisfying to wash your face with this scrub in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5</li>
    <li> So the first time that i used this product my skin got extremely dry and it pissed me off because if i rubbed my face on my shirt all this dead skin would be on the shirt. Pretty gross. After a week of healing my skin I decided to try it again. Once i tried it again my skin did not dry out to bad but the best part was all the acne was almost 100% gone in like 3 days... so weird but its the best stuff ive used. ive tried clearasil or whatever that crap is ive also tried nanocleanse which worked alright but i lost the bottle of it at my gym. So i reverted to this item and it worked so well..</li>
    <li> delicious smell, leaves my face soft and with a very fresh clean feeling. I used it everyday for months, and my acne was WAY BETTER. I have A LOT of acne so I don&#x27;t expect miracles from a face scrub, it does the job. Also my skin is usually very oily and I had to wash my face multiple times a day, but when I use this I have to wash my face less frequently, only two times a day.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells refreshing</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase. I love this face wash as it does really help out with clearing up my breakouts.</li>
    <li> i tried everything, otc and proactiv, even prescribed meds. But I wanted to give this a try and I did- i couldnt be happier. I wash my face with this every night using a facial exfoliator pad (purchased at Duane Reade for $2). I also take a womens one-a-day and my skin went from looking like a teenagers to basically flawless. I dont wear makeup anymore and I dont need to. This product is highly recommended. Cosmo also suggested using it with benzoly-perozide (or however its spelled). Use that for spot treatment. Good luck!!</li>
    <li> Used for about 3 years. Your face won&#x27;t feel dry at all after using it. The smell is good too.</li>
