      <li>It leaves your face feeling very clean but not stripped or anything.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the scrub, but have gotten so much more use out of it since I saw a consultant demonstrate this product as a mask.</li>
      <li>The best part is that it&#x27;s a little thicker than most scrubs</li>
      <li>so it is easy to use</li>
      <li>This is very effective at gently cleaning the face and leaving it feeling fresh and clean.</li>

      <li>is fabulous as are all the Arbonne skin care line.  </li>
      <li>but this is by far the best and only that has truly worked.</li>
      <li>leaves skin clean and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I also use their primer after I clean my face and do the serum, eye cream and moisturizer.  </li>

      <li>This stuff has really simplified my face routine, I&#x27;ll definately be buying more when I run out.</li>

      <li>It leaves my skin soft but also helps keep the blackheads at bay!</li>

      <li>I love this product, I use all the Arbonne products on my face and do not have one complaint.  </li>
      <li>Ran out of old bottle....  </li>

<li> I have combination skin that does not do well when it is dried out with harsh products or slathered in rich &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; products.</li>

<li> and this product doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
<li> I have dry skin and use this twice a week.</li>
<li> I rub on my dry face with wet fingertips, then let dry, then scrub and rinse.</li>
<li> , my skin was very dry.</li>
<li> so you may want to use a little extra lotion after.</li>
<li> And this product will probably last me for the entire year because all you need is a very small amount every time you use it.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other exfoliating scrubs.</li>
<li> It also burns your face, and yes I followed the instructions and use other Arbonne products.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other product lines like Origins, Mary Kay, and Clinique and none of them measure up.</li>
<li> It seems when the company changed its formulas and packaging, they went down hill.</li>
<li> Previously, any exfoliating scrub I had used would irritate my skin and cause me to breakout.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m usually allergic to the microbeads in other face scrubs even if they claim to be hypoallergenic.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I also use it to spot treat trouble areas.</li>
<li> What a waste.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with clogged pores.</li>
<li> A small amount is all that is needed.</li>
<li> I have very few breakouts when I use this exfoliating wash once a week.</li>
<li> IT ISN&#x27;T TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE AND LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
<li> I can scrub as hard as I want and there is NO irritation.  </li>
<li> Not too harsh or irritating.</li>

    <li> This product arrived before the scheduled time and was new and intact. It provides gentle exfoliation and I liked that. A small amount is all that is needed.</li>

    <li> I use this product every morning and I love it. I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;m usually allergic to the microbeads in other face scrubs even if they claim to be hypoallergenic. But for whatever reason, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout or allergic reaction to this face scrub. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. My boyfriend even compliments how smooth and even my skin tone looks since I began using it about 3 months ago. It lasts a good while. I bought it back in May and I&#x27;m still using the same container. It&#x27;s great!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product for my OILY OILY skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Arbonne, including the exfoliating scrub. I have been using it for more than 2 years, and my skin is soft and glows every time.

    <li> Oooooo La La!  Oh Yeah, I had to come back for more.  I love Arbonne.  Feels cool, and dries on like a mask.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use all the Arbonne products on my face and do not have one complaint.  When I had my last facial the women suggested I start exfoliating, my skin was very dry.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the scrub, but have gotten so much more use out of it since I saw a consultant demonstrate this product as a mask. I have dry skin and use this twice a week. I rub on my dry face with wet fingertips, then let dry, then scrub and rinse. It leaves my skin soft but also helps keep the blackheads at bay!</li>

    <li> Great product! Leaves my skin so soft. Not too harsh or irritating. My favorite exfoliater. I use it every 2-3 days, also as a mask.</li>
    <li> Great product love the feel of my skin after use.?</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference using this product versus others&lt;br /&gt;I do like Arbonne and use their products....this scrub is just ok</li>
    <li> The best skin care product line out there</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this makes my skin so much healthier and looking clean.  I have very few breakouts when I use this exfoliating wash once a week.

    <li> awesome product and arrived very quick.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other exfoliating scrubs. It also burns your face, and yes I followed the instructions and use other Arbonne products. It seems when the company changed its formulas and packaging, they went down hill. I shave stopped using them. This scrub sits under the sink and doesn&#x27;t get used after the first two times. What a waste.</li>
    <li> will buy this again. Love, love the product</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliating scrub I have ever used.  The results are glowing, smooth skin!</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub, it leaves my face feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product along with arbonne face wash and toner, so it could be a combination of all the great product working together. I love it. I also purchased the day cream too!</li>
    <li> Love arbonne and this is great for exfoliating and still gentle on my skin. My husband is a tough critic when it comes to washes and he approved this one. *thumbs up*</li>
    <li> I used to love this product, but I feels like they changed the formula somewhat and my pores are getting kind of clogged. It&#x27;s too expensive for the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with clogged pores. This is very effective at gently cleaning the face and leaving it feeling fresh and clean. I also use it to spot treat trouble areas. Be aware that it can dry out the skin a little bit so you may want to use a little extra lotion after. I&#x27;ve used various products like proactiv and exposed skin care etc. but this is by far the best and only that has truly worked.</li>
    <li> ARBONNE HAS WONDERFUL PRODUCTS AND THIS EXFOLIATING SCRUB IS MILD YET DOES THE JOB.  IT ISN&#x27;T TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE AND LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The granules are very gentle.  I can scrub as hard as I want and there is NO irritation.  Previously, any exfoliating scrub I had used would irritate my skin and cause me to breakout.  I tried this product as recommended by my sister-in-law and I&#x27;m now on my 2nd tube.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scrub.  I have acne prone skin and this product doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, I love it! I haven&#x27;t had a break out in months since I&#x27;ve been using this scrub.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it once a week and use the cleanser the rest of the week.</li>
    <li> Most facial scrubs make my face break out, but this doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s mild enough to use every day, but firm enough to feel like you&#x27;ve used a scrub! I recommend.</li>
    <li> This prdt. is fabulous as are all the Arbonne skin care line.  This one is a must if you are serious about your skin care.  Use it at least once a week to remove dead cells which build up so much you will be amazed at how much this removes.  Your make up will be much smoother.  I also use their primer after I clean my face and do the serum, eye cream and moisturizer.  A Dr. told me years ago to use vit. C oil drops on my face after I wash it in the mornings. It is not greasy and will soak right in.  You can find that also online.  Obaji.  15 or 20%.  THEN.....continue with your regular skin care routine.  Pat these prdts. on and do not rub your face.  Wa Lah!  You will still be beautiful at 70 !</li>
    <li> leaves skin clean and moisturized.  I use it with a facial scrubber and it really exfoliates without drying out my skin.  I am very happy with the product and would buy it again.  Skin is more youthful and clearer.</li>
    <li> love the product, will buy again</li>
    <li> Ran out of old bottle....  This item helps give my face a smooth finish....  Seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arbonne for years and I love it. I&#x27;ve tried other product lines like Origins, Mary Kay, and Clinique and none of them measure up. I always go back to Arbonne. This scrub is just what you&#x27;d expect. It leaves your face feeling very clean but not stripped or anything. The best part is that it&#x27;s a little thicker than most scrubs so it is easy to use and it smell great!</li>
