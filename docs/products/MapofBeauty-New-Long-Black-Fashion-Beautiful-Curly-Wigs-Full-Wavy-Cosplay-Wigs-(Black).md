      <li>Awesome bargain!</li>
      <li>This is an awesome product weather it&#x27;s for Halloween or</li>
      <li>I bought this for my witch costume and it is excellent for the price.</li>
      <li>Great length and comes styled as seen in the picture,</li>
      <li>My daughter purchased this for a cosplay and it looked great for the price.</li>
      <li>but it goes great with my witch hat.</li>
      <li>Very nice wig...</li>
      <li>Used this for my Aradia cosplay and it looked amazing!</li>
      <li>This wig is beautiful fit well and have received nothing but compliments on this!!</li>
      <li>This product was really good quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very believable.</li>
      <li>Used it for a Vriska Serket cosplay and it works better than the ones selling for 40+ dollars - it practically comes styled!</li>
      <li>Love this wig!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice wig, but I bought for cosplay and it doesn&#x27;t take well to styling.</li>
      <li>Looks great And very real!</li>
      <li>love love love!</li>
      <li>great wig.. stays on secure and looks fabulous</li>
      <li>It felt very secure and stayed styled.</li>
      <li>Fits really and comes in great condition.</li>
      <li>Can survive many nights of dancing.</li>
      <li>It looks great for a really cheep wig.</li>
      <li>Plus, it even comes with a free wig cap!</li>
      <li>The wig is okay.</li>
      <li>definitely one of the best wigs I could&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
      <li>Also if you have a lot of hair don&#x27;t bother because you probably won&#x27;t be able to fit it on your head.</li>
      <li>The ends tangle easily</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t come across many wigs that are comfortable, cheap, and still look legitament.</li>
      <li>This wig was comfortable for several hours and looked good!</li>
      <li>I have recommended this wig to several friends and they have all been happy with their product, especially at this great price.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a nice cool tone black wig and worked perfectly for my last minute cosplay.</li>
      <li>It looks very natural, I have an $80 wig from gothiclolitawigs and this is easily comparable to it!</li>
      <li>The wig looks real and it doesnt tangle easily.</li>
      <li>Bought this &#x27;cause of the price, and yes it&#x27;s not as good as wigs with a higher markup by the same name.</li>
      <li>Its a little bit shiny, but great for the price.</li>
      <li>The wig itself cannot even fit over my head, I was very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>Though if your not going to do anything that requires styling, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>But it holds its style but isn&#x27;t very easy to style itself, I used it as-is for a female Loki and Vriska Serket cosplay.</li>
      <li>Light weight and very breathable, dosn&#x27;t get very hot, and holds to my head very well.</li>
      <li>It turned to be really good,  for less than 10 bucks?</li>
      <li>Very well made and very pretty on.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s quite pretty in person.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much curlier and shinier than the picture.</li>
      <li>If you want a cheap wig for a costume party or maybe you are low on cosplay funds then</li>
      <li>I do not think it could pass for real hair though if that is what you need.</li>
      <li>Not only is it soft, it doesn&#x27;t easily tangle.</li>
      <li>It still works for my cosplay and I love it, but if you&#x27;re looking for a jet black wig this may not be for you.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this wig considering the price and quality</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really great, but it&#x27;s not heat resistant, which makes it difficult to style.</li>
      <li>The wig cap is smaller than most and my head is pretty small.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this wig and after trying it a few different ways and finger combing it just wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this for other reasons, but now I just wear it because it is soft and bouncy, and it feels and looks natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rate this wig is passable, especially for young cosplayers...or those low on funds ; )</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this since it&#x27;s a high-quality wig at a very low price.</li>
      <li>and it was hard for me to fit the wig over it.</li>
      <li>I barely combed it and it began shedding like it was allergic to the comb.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap enough but not very good quality.</li>

<li> I barely combed it and it began shedding like it was allergic to the comb.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s cheap enough but not very good quality.</li>
<li> Color was accurate but bangs were a little thick.</li>
<li> minus 1 star for the constant shedding though.</li>
<li> I had to trim the bangs because they were really long</li>
<li> given it shortened on me a little bit because I have a larger head.</li>
<li> Money well spent.</li>
<li> It was thick and looked so natural,</li>
<li> I have relatively short hair, because my natural hair is thick and hard to control in the summer heat of Texas.</li>
<li> Wehn I bought the wig I expected a black wig</li>
<li> The only minor complaint I have is that the wig isn&#x27;t exactly black, but a really dark brown.</li>
<li> I thought it would be a very bad wig for the price, but I only wanted something cheap for Halloween.</li>
<li> It was also a bit tight on me so not recommend for people with a lot of hair.</li>
<li> Though like any cheaper wig a few of the hairs will fall out when brushing or combing it.</li>
<li> Bought for Vriska Serket cosplay, it&#x27;s a bit thin but once brushed out</li>
<li> On the first wear, it tangled badly.</li>
<li> I like it and yet the wig is small.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s difficult because it&#x27;s shedding everywhere and gets tangled so easily. :-(</li>
<li> I also happened to have noticed weared smaller hairs from the edge of the wig that is cut awkwardly.</li>
<li> Not exactly natural, but very dramatic.</li>
<li> I mean this looks like a party city wig type of shiny.</li>
<li> For people with larger heads, it will be VERY difficult for them to wear it.</li>
<li> this wig is not good the hair kept falling out as i tried to style it... unsatisfied with product...wish i couldve returned it</li>
<li> The hair was very thin as well</li>

    <li> Awesome wig!  Looks great And very real!</li>
    <li> This product was really good quality. I haven&#x27;t come across many wigs that are comfortable, cheap, and still look legitament. This is an awesome product weather it&#x27;s for Halloween or whatever you need it for.</li>
    <li> Not the thickest wig I&#x27;ve purchased but it&#x27;s a nice cool tone black wig and worked perfectly for my last minute cosplay.</li>
    <li> Used it for a Vriska Serket cosplay and it works better than the ones selling for 40+ dollars - it practically comes styled!</li>
    <li> Used this for my Aradia cosplay and it looked amazing! It was thick and looked so natural, definitely one of the best wigs I could&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great, but it&#x27;s not heat resistant, which makes it difficult to style. Also, the bangs reach my chin.... i had to cut it multiple times,,, 4/5.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my witch costume and it is excellent for the price. I do not think it could pass for real hair though if that is what you need. I had to trim the bangs because they were really long but it goes great with my witch hat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig, but I bought for cosplay and it doesn&#x27;t take well to styling. The ends tangle easily and when I try to comb it clumps of hair come off. I&#x27;ve had mine for awhile and I&#x27;m looking into investing in a straighter wig. Though if your not going to do anything that requires styling, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> The wig itself cannot even fit over my head, I was very dissapointed. The hair was very thin as well</li>
    <li> I attended a Murder Mystery dinner party with friends, where my character was a Southern gothic writer. This wig was comfortable for several hours and looked good! Not exactly natural, but very dramatic. I still have this wig for possible future Halloween costumes.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to cosplay Feferi and it passes my expectations. Not only is it soft, it doesn&#x27;t easily tangle. Plus, it even comes with a free wig cap! Would highly recommend this since it&#x27;s a high-quality wig at a very low price.</li>
    <li> Great length and comes styled as seen in the picture, given it shortened on me a little bit because I have a larger head. But it holds its style but isn&#x27;t very easy to style itself, I used it as-is for a female Loki and Vriska Serket cosplay. Light weight and very breathable, dosn&#x27;t get very hot, and holds to my head very well. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this wig! I used it for a One Piece cosplay. The wig looks real and it doesnt tangle easily. I would recommend this wig!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this wig and after trying it a few different ways and finger combing it just wasn&#x27;t working. I barely combed it and it began shedding like it was allergic to the comb. It does have the potential to look like the one in the photo but it takes a lot of combing and re combing but it&#x27;s difficult because it&#x27;s shedding everywhere and gets tangled so easily. :-(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very believable. It stays on my head. I wear it often in public. Money well spent. Can survive many nights of dancing.</li>
    <li> I like it and yet the wig is small. For people with larger heads, it will be VERY difficult for them to wear it. I also happened to have noticed weared smaller hairs from the edge of the wig that is cut awkwardly. I don&#x27;t understand why but maybe that was the design. Wehn I bought the wig I expected a black wig but instead I got a deep brown shade so I don&#x27;t know if it will work for my Vriska cosplay. I am hoping it will.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig... minus 1 star for the constant shedding though.</li>
    <li> I got this piece as an add on item. I thought it would be a very bad wig for the price, but I only wanted something cheap for Halloween. It turned to be really good,  for less than 10 bucks? Awesome bargain!</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased this for a cosplay and it looked great for the price. On the first wear, it tangled badly. She combed through it to get the tangles out, but the next time she wore it, it was a mass of tangles and the back/nape and we don&#x27;t dare try to brush it out...too tangled! I&#x27;d rate this wig is passable, especially for young cosplayers...or those low on funds ; )</li>
    <li> Very well made and very pretty on.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this wig considering the price and quality - it&#x27;s quite pretty in person. The only minor complaint I have is that the wig isn&#x27;t exactly black, but a really dark brown. It still works for my cosplay and I love it, but if you&#x27;re looking for a jet black wig this may not be for you.</li>
    <li> Bought for Vriska Serket cosplay, it&#x27;s a bit thin but once brushed out it looks thicker. It looks very natural, I have an $80 wig from gothiclolitawigs and this is easily comparable to it!</li>
    <li> Fits really and comes in great condition.</li>
    <li> I wore this wig for halloween and it was great! It felt very secure and stayed styled. Its a little bit shiny, but great for the price. (Ignore my friend it the background, we went as frank iero and helena from the MCR music video)</li>
    <li> Color was accurate but bangs were a little thick. Came with a cap.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a friday afternoon and received it monday afternoon. This wig is beautiful fit well and have received nothing but compliments on this!! love love love!</li>
    <li> Took about a month to get here. And the hair started falling out while trying to put it on.</li>
    <li> Bought this &#x27;cause of the price, and yes it&#x27;s not as good as wigs with a higher markup by the same name. It&#x27;s a bit difficult to brush and style, but if you&#x27;re just wearing this for photos then it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much curlier and shinier than the picture. I mean this looks like a party city wig type of shiny. The wig cap is smaller than most and my head is pretty small. I have collarbone length hair and it was hard for me to fit the wig over it. It sheds. It isn&#x27;t heat-resistant at all. The ends feel coarse. If you want a cheap wig for a costume party or maybe you are low on cosplay funds then yeah it&#x27;s cheap enough but not very good quality. Also if you have a lot of hair don&#x27;t bother because you probably won&#x27;t be able to fit it on your head.</li>
    <li> I have relatively short hair, because my natural hair is thick and hard to control in the summer heat of Texas. I originally bought this for other reasons, but now I just wear it because it is soft and bouncy, and it feels and looks natural. I have recommended this wig to several friends and they have all been happy with their product, especially at this great price.</li>
    <li> It looks great for a really cheep wig. Though like any cheaper wig a few of the hairs will fall out when brushing or combing it. It was also a bit tight on me so not recommend for people with a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> this wig is not good the hair kept falling out as i tried to style it... unsatisfied with product...wish i couldve returned it</li>
    <li> great wig.. stays on secure and looks fabulous</li>
    <li> The wig is okay. It will suffice for what i&#x27;m using it for but it definitely could be thicker. Buy a difrent wig if you&#x27;re looking for replacement hair or a permanent cosplay item</li>
