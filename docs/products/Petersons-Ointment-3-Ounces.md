<li> This product is very hard to find, so glad I can finally get it on Amazon!</li>
<li> Absolutely nothing negative about it but the high price</li>
<li> Used for minor abrasions and itchy hemorrhoid issues.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t allow the poison ivy to dry out, so that it will heal.</li>
<li> Minor detail, but its the only complaint I have.</li>
<li> A little goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It seems to pull out any infection or other problem we may have.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Little bit goes a long way, but the few times I need to reorder</li>
<li> have tried other salves and nothing else compares.</li>
<li> Peterson&#x27;s Ointment was the hands down winner for pain reduction, itch relief.</li>
<li> And it keeps down infection and is soothing and pain relieving as well as shrinking to your piles.  </li>
<li> I even rub it on black &amp; blues or sore muscles.</li>
<li> My sisters and I have been using this product since we were little kids...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Petersons Ointment since I was  little.</li>
<li> For cuts and scrapes we put a little dab on the wound after cleaning, add an adhesive bandage.  </li>
<li> We inherited a couple of little tins and have used them for years.</li>
<li> I think its a waste of $$</li>
<li> Stays put, no overwhelming odor and lasts forever.</li>
<li> I put the Petersons on &amp; it keeps the cold sore from even starting.</li>
<li> Petersons works on minor scrapes, slivers,insect bites, pimples, cold sores!</li>
<li> and I was unable to find it thru my pharmacy.  </li>
<li> As soon as I feel a cold sore coming on</li>

    <li> I dont see a change with this nor prep. H....I think its a waste of $$</li>
    <li> An old and tested product. They still sell it because it works.</li>
    <li> This is does not work on poison ivy.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t allow the poison ivy to dry out, so that it will heal.</li>
    <li> My mother in law told me about this product 50 years ago. We used to be able to go to Resol Drug store to buy it...Now that there is no longer a Resol I have order this product over the net. It is great for any cuts, piles, anything... I use it for everything over the last 50 years. IT WORKS.... Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was born and raised in PA and Petersons Ointment was used all the time.  I bought it for my cat, who has a skin condition, but could not use it because it contains zinc oxide.  However, I and other family members have used it and Petersons is still the best for all types of &amp;#34;human&amp;#34; skin conditions!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my grandma, because she swears by it. She said it cleared up skin problems that she has been struggling with quicker than anything else she has tried. I liked how it used to be sold in a tin container, personally, now it comes in a plastic container. Minor detail, but its the only complaint I have.</li>
    <li> There is nothing in the world as valuable to a person who has itching piles.  Without it your itching till you bleed .  With it,  your not itching at all.  And it keeps down infection and is soothing and pain relieving as well as shrinking to your piles.  My mother used it for most of her adult life and so did my uncles and aunts.  I have been using it all my adult life too,  and with great results.  I went to great lengths to find the product because the original company went out of business.  I was elated to find it on Amazon.  Thank You Amazon for stocking this wonder cream of yesteryear.  If it was advertised more ,  I&#x27;m sure it would have a comback.  BC</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Petersons Ointment since I was  little. I grew up in Buffalo,NY, when I moved away in my 20&#x27;s  I couldn&#x27;t  find it anywhere (this was pre-internet) so my mom would have to buy it in NY &amp; mail it to me. Petersons works on minor scrapes, slivers,insect bites, pimples, cold sores! As soon as I feel a cold sore coming on I put the Petersons on &amp; it keeps the cold sore from even starting. I even rub it on black &amp; blues or sore muscles. I call it my miracle salve !</li>
    <li> This product has been used for many yrs. by our family. Used for minor abrasions and itchy hemorrhoid issues.  Much better than  Preperation H by far!!!!  So happy it&#x27;s still available...  -:)</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED PETERSON&#x27;S FOR YEARS AND THEN IT DISAPPEARED. I MADE MY OWN REPLACEMENT PRODUCT, BUT A FEW YEARS PASTED AND I DISCOVERED THEY HAD CHANGED LOCATIONS BUT I FOUND IT CONTINUED TO WORK AS BEFORE. A LOT EASIER TO ORDER FROM AMAZON.COM THAN TO FORMULATE YOURSELF!</li>
    <li> Nothing heals faster than Peterson&#x27;s ointment, and is great for those cracks you get on the heels of your feet.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be w/o it..........great all around treatment for so many things, not just what the box says. Got an ingrown toenail? or fingernail? Great stuff, got &#x27;zits&#x27;, great to bring them to a head. It does say not to use on an open wound and I never have.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING PRODUCT, HAS USED IT FOR YEARS, IT IS GOOD FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN&lt;br /&gt;THINK OF.</li>
    <li> Love it works well on itches.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping, no problems</li>
    <li> This stuff works on everything ... cuts, sores, general boo boos.  Got an infected wound, smear some Petersons on it.  Got a splinter, put some Petersons on it.  Got one of those fish-related fin wounds that take forever to heal .... Petersons.  Yay.  It also works great on the occasional sore butt problem.</li>
    <li> I researched and purchased hundreds of lotions/potions/unguents/salves and even recruited suffering friends and family to help find the best solution. I ordered from Thailand and India and dug through all kinds of obscure US drug and discount stores. Finally we found a winner. Peterson&#x27;s Ointment was the hands down winner for pain reduction, itch relief. Stays put, no overwhelming odor and lasts forever. Immediately calms inflamed skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Petersons Ointment for 40 years and I was unable to find it thru my pharmacy.  I highly recommend Petersons Ointment over Neosporin.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing.  It seems to pull out any infection or other problem we may have.  Absolutely nothing negative about it but the high price, thus I rated it a four.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the price- so much better than any other ointments on the market!&lt;br /&gt;Miss the old tins, but buying in bulk is a much better value...&lt;br /&gt;Little bit goes a long way, but the few times I need to reorder I always know where to find it!!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff use it for all kinds of conditions.</li>
    <li> Best OTC salve for relief of itching of piles and hemorrhoids. Love it!  I recommend this product to anyone with the same problem I have. Just one dab will do you for the day.</li>
    <li> Have love it from the time I got it... works great, and was priced right . Would buy it again when needed</li>
    <li> My husband grew up with Peterson&#x27;s around the house.  We inherited a couple of little tins and have used them for years. So grateful to find on Amazon when we ran out. Peterson&#x27;s should be in every medicine chest. For cuts and scrapes we put a little dab on the wound after cleaning, add an adhesive bandage.  By morning the wound doesn&#x27;t amount to much - prevents infection eases irritation. Great stuff! Wish it still came in those nice little tins.</li>
    <li> My sisters and I have been using this product since we were little kids...my grandmother swore by the healing powers of it and used it all the time as well.  Had trouble finding Peterson&#x27;s Ointment at a reasonable price,  until I came upon this website.  Absolutely love this product...especially on cracked fingers...great price!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many, many years. A little goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other salves and nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> i love this product! we bought 2 to send it to my family to the Philippines.</li>
    <li> This is a great, great product.  I have used it for years.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> My family has been using Peterson&#x27;s ointment for years. And it always works great! This product is very hard to find, so glad I can finally get it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of things for my hemorrhoids, which started acting up in my early sixties.  Some of these applications worked OK, but nothing has worked like Peterson&#x27;s, which shrinks them right down.  I use it every morning as part of my routine.</li>
