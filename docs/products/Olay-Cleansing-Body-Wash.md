      <li>Olay makes great products and this is no exception.  </li>
      <li>This is a great body wash for spring/summer.</li>
      <li>it has a very nice aroma and it doesn&#x27;t cost alot for all it provides.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
      <li>But the product has good quality and smells good.</li>
      <li>The body wash is good</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s really good.</li>
      <li>Still a good body wash though.</li>
      <li>This is the best body bath wash and the cucumber smells so fresh.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and softness of this bodywash!</li>
      <li>Really a nice product from proctor and gamble.</li>
      <li>Smells great and gets you clean.</li>
      <li>Good thing this soap is not too strong scented.</li>
      <li>The smell is so refreshing and the quality of body wash is really nice.</li>
      <li>I love this body wash.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of cucumbers</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this bodywash.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>I love Oil of Olay products, this is no exception.  </li>
      <li>The size the perfect and will last a while.</li>
      <li>Not any more.</li>
      <li>I love the cucumber scent Olay puts out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d prefer this body wash has slightly more lotion function in it.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a rich scent.  </li>
      <li>This order was not packaged correctly and the tops come off easy on the bottles.</li>
      <li>good body wash, smells good, i expected it to have some moisturizing but its</li>
      <li>Fantastic smell</li>
      <li>not, it does not have a conditioner on it..i&#x27;ll not buy again because of this, but as far as smell, cleaning, its good, i just like my body wash to be a moisturizer as well</li>
      <li>It makes your skin nice a soft and does not leave a gressy feeling.</li>
      <li>When I purchased, the price is lower than its current price in Amazon, so it was a good deal.</li>
      <li>I believe that this could be for men or women, as the scent is fresh and asexual.</li>

      <li>I was able to pour some back in that spilled in the bag.</li>
      <li>Only reason I wouldn&#x27;t rate it higher is cus I was expecting something more.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like cucumber at all.  </li>
      <li>and it really hydrates your skin.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and is not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>The body wash is very thick and rich, and leaves you smelling clean and feeling fresh.  </li>
      <li>OK, leaving skin total washed and grease free is not a good practice, so either the body lotion or the body wash need to remedy the dryness.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product cleanses as well as conditions my skin</li>
      <li>Not as moisturizing as other bodywashes, but it says right on the bottle that it&#x27;s cleansing, whereas Olay has a separate moisturizing purposes.</li>
      <li>This makes your skin soft and smelling terrific.</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t have that green, earthy scent of a fresh cucumber.  </li>
      <li>and it had a subtle cool smell.</li>

    <li> OK, leaving skin total washed and grease free is not a good practice, so either the body lotion or the body wash need to remedy the dryness. I&#x27;d prefer this body wash has slightly more lotion function in it.</li>

    <li> great product.  would buy it again because it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it had a subtle cool smell.</li>
    <li> Olay makes great products and this is no exception.  It&#x27;s thick, luxurious and lathers well.  But it doesn&#x27;t have that green, earthy scent of a fresh cucumber.  Rather, it smells cloyingly sweet and perfumey like an overripe green melon or the pervasive \\&quot;green apple\\&quot; scent of the 1970s.</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay products, this is no exception.  My only concern is its difficult to find.  Walmart carried this product for under $5.00.  I love all of Olay Cleansing Body Washes, but they are so expensive according to the various providers.  I just don&#x27;t understand why its so expensive here and some suppliers requires a shipping cost.  This is great soap...</li>
    <li> good body wash, smells good, i expected it to have some moisturizing but its not, it does not have a conditioner on it..i&#x27;ll not buy again because of this, but as far as smell, cleaning, its good, i just like my body wash to be a moisturizer as well</li>
    <li> I love the cucumber scent Olay puts out. It is soothing, as it states in the product name. The body wash is very thick and rich, and leaves you smelling clean and feeling fresh.  I believe that this could be for men or women, as the scent is fresh and asexual.</li>
    <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t soothing.  It is creamy &amp; moisturizing but the scent isn&#x27;t quite on the money.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of cucumbers so I picked this up at Walmart.  Fantastic smell and it really hydrates your skin.  This is a great body wash for spring/summer.</li>
    <li> When I purchased, the price is lower than its current price in Amazon, so it was a good deal. Not any more. But the product has good quality and smells good.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gets you clean. You definitely feel noticeably cleaner after showering with this bodywash. Only reason I wouldn&#x27;t rate it higher is cus I was expecting something more. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s really good. Not as moisturizing as other bodywashes, but it says right on the bottle that it&#x27;s cleansing, whereas Olay has a separate moisturizing purposes. Love the smell of this bodywash.</li>
    <li> I have ordered body wash from amazon before with out any issues. This order was not packaged correctly and the tops come off easy on the bottles. When i opened it up one bottle was half empty and the soap was all over the plastic bag it was sealed in.  The bag leaked a little but no soap got on my other items just the body wash. I was able to pour some back in that spilled in the bag. Good thing this soap is not too strong scented. The body wash is good however i do not know if i will continue to purchase body wash from amazon. I did not want to take stars off the item since it is great but the tops could be on firmer.</li>
    <li> it has a very nice aroma and it doesn&#x27;t cost alot for all it provides.&lt;br /&gt;will continue to use this in my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and softness of this bodywash! Procter and Gambles makes THE BEST products! Everything made from that company is excellent!</li>
    <li> Excellent product  as advertised and great price.  I have very sensitive skin and this product cleanses as well as conditions my skin</li>
    <li> Really a nice product from proctor and gamble. I bought it on a deal with save and subscribe options. It saved money but not the quality.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. It has a nice smell and is not overwhelming. It makes your skin nice a soft and does not leave a gressy feeling. The size the perfect and will last a while. it makes a great lather and I love it</li>
    <li> I like this Olay product very much. The smell is so refreshing and the quality of body wash is really nice. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. The moisturizing quality of this body wash keeps it ahead in rating compared to the other products I have used so far,</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance, but it does not lather up as the other ones do. I find that I have to use more of this one to get the same lathering effect as Olay Body Was with Quench or Olay 2-in-1 Advanced Ribbons...</li>
