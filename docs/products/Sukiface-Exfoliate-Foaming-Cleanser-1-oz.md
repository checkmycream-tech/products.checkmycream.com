      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s delightful to be able to use something that &#x27;polishes&#x27; my skin, but is gentle enough not to cause breakouts.</li>
      <li>When it arrived, it was hard as rock, but I put 2 drops of water in it and since then the consistency is perfect - so don&#x27;t give up if yours arrives</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
      <li>It will start foaming right away, but you want the grit to exfoliate, so don&#x27;t rub until it turns smooth.</li>
      <li>This leaves your face feeling do fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like that!</li>
      <li>This scrub is not only intoxicating in its fresh lemony scent, but it makes your skin feel amazing.  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend noticed that there is always a glow on my face, which is an added bonus :) My acne spots are considerably diminished.</li>
      <li>I must say I noticed a difference right from the first usage!</li>
      <li>I was happy to find this in the 1 oz as the bigger size is about double the price - yes, more for your money, but I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out that much for a scrub.  </li>
      <li>It feels very gentle, but yet takes away all make-up, dirt...</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their skin quality!</li>
      <li>Also if you keep your face cleansers in the shower, be aware this is a glass jar.</li>
      <li>I love this facial scrub!</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft, clean, and not over-dry.</li>
      <li>Your skin feel so clean but not tight afterwards, just super soft!</li>
      <li>: First, it feels like rubbing sugar on my face, but then it transforms into gentle foam.</li>
      <li>it is gentle, so I can imagine it works pretty well with any skin</li>
      <li>I was looking for an exfoliating cleanser that would be gentle, help me retain my natural moisture, but also make me feel squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>I love this product if I use it on a relatively dry face.</li>
      <li>Nice clean scent, but too harsh for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It is gentle yet very efficient.</li>
      <li>I used to purchase it at Whole Foods Market, but they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it.</li>
      <li>and you can&#x27;t really revive it</li>
      <li>However, after trying a very small sample I fell in love with it and had to have it so was thrilled to see it came in a smaller size.  </li>
      <li>It smells good and you don&#x27;t have the grit left in the tub like other scrubs.</li>
      <li>like the product, love the scent.. but really not worth the cost per weight.</li>
      <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
      <li>Just rinse it off with cool water and pat dry!</li>
      <li>I only used it very gently</li>
      <li>and I do not get any exfoliation action.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural and uses sugar as the exfoliate.  </li>
      <li>I know that my skin has improved considerably.</li>
      <li>they say 100% natural?</li>
      <li>Try this and am sure you wont be disappointed :)</li>
      <li>For me, if it gets to wet then it just melts too much into a foam</li>
      <li>I was surprised this tiny 1oz jar lasted so long, by my est, it will last about 40 washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Recently, my already sensitive skin has been very irritated due to weather/allergies, I get dry patches, itchiness, and minor acne.</li>
      <li>/&gt;CLEAN: I have oily, blemished skin, so it is quite hard to find a cleanser that will not leave my skin dry and will clean my pores enough.</li>

<li> would highly recommend it to others to use a few times a week.</li>
<li> I recommend purchasing the smaller jar so that it does not dry out by the time you are half way through.</li>
<li> So, now I&#x27;m testing out how long this one ounce will last to see if I want to invest in the bigger one down the road.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Tip: Scoop it out with a dry fingertip into the palm of your damp hands, rub palms together 2-3 times.</li>
<li> My boyfriend has extremely dry skin, he always used to complain about his skin.</li>
<li> Apply to wet face.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, you just need to scoop a pea size amount with your finger and indulge yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I use it every other day.</li>
<li> Its very thick when it comes out, but once you apply to your wet face it seems to multiply as its working.</li>
<li> I tried this product as a sample that Suki sent me from a previous purchase.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m about half way through the jar.  </li>
<li> Just a few drops of water to &amp;#34;melt it&amp;#34; ever so slightly.</li>
<li> Leaves your skin feeling refreshed and with the sugar base, its gritty yet gentle.</li>
<li> i&#x27;m not sure i like this.</li>
<li> it is hard as a rock and started out very hard to get from the heavy glass</li>
<li> This product gave me a crazy type of breakout, clusters of tiny whiteheads the morning after using.</li>
<li> Got a very small sample from Birchbox.  </li>
<li> Only bad thing is it dries up</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just love this scrub. It is gentle yet very efficient. I use it every other day. My only con is that it is in a glass jar. Already broke one, because I keep it in the shower.</li>
    <li> like the product, love the scent.. but really not worth the cost per weight. Also if you keep your face cleansers in the shower, be aware this is a glass jar.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as a sample that Suki sent me from a previous purchase. The product smells quite nice- a sweet lemon. On your hand, it feels like gritty sugar in oil. It feels quite nice on my skin, however it leaves my skin with a soap residue.</li>
    <li> This scrub is not only intoxicating in its fresh lemony scent, but it makes your skin feel amazing.  It&#x27;s all natural and uses sugar as the exfoliate.  You don&#x27;t need a lot. Its very thick when it comes out, but once you apply to your wet face it seems to multiply as its working. I use about a tsp. and as you rub it into your face the sugar gradually dissolves and it becomes a mousse-like velvety texture.  Your skin feel so clean but not tight afterwards, just super soft! I was happy to find this in the 1 oz as the bigger size is about double the price - yes, more for your money, but I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out that much for a scrub.  However, after trying a very small sample I fell in love with it and had to have it so was thrilled to see it came in a smaller size.  So, now I&#x27;m testing out how long this one ounce will last to see if I want to invest in the bigger one down the road.  I&#x27;ve had it almost a month and use it about three times a week and I&#x27;m about half way through the jar.  So, I&#x27;d say it is a good deal for your money and results.</li>
    <li> I love this facial scrub! It smells good and you don&#x27;t have the grit left in the tub like other scrubs.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lemon smell and cleans skin without drying out the face....would highly recommend it to others to use a few times a week.</li>
    <li> This product gave me a crazy type of breakout, clusters of tiny whiteheads the morning after using. It also made my skin red. I only used it very gently and ive used regular sugar on my face before so I don&#x27;t think it was the grains, I felt like it left a very obvious film so maybe it was culprit.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves skin smooth and luminous. Only bad thing is it dries up and you can&#x27;t really revive it cause once you add water it activates the cleansing property of the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliating scrub I&#x27;ve ever used!  It&#x27;s become part of my daily shower routine...the cleanser smells SOOOO good and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  I have very sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s delightful to be able to use something that &#x27;polishes&#x27; my skin, but is gentle enough not to cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> Best facewash! Smells like sugary citrus dessert! Makes my face squeaky clean! Love this product!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this item - I assume she is satisfied, since she has said that she isn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> This is the BEST cleanser EVER, let me tell you why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEAN: I have oily, blemished skin, so it is quite hard to find a cleanser that will not leave my skin dry and will clean my pores enough. This Suki cleanser does a great job. It feels very gentle, but yet takes away all make-up, dirt... it is gentle, so I can imagine it works pretty well with any skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXFOLIATE: First, it feels like rubbing sugar on my face, but then it transforms into gentle foam. It is so much fun to convert sugar to foam! When it arrived, it was hard as rock, but I put 2 drops of water in it and since then the consistency is perfect - so don&#x27;t give up if yours arrives hard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL: Ooooh, imagine the scent of lemon and sugar... It smells exactly like that! I always look forward to morning and evening to smell it! BONUS: if some gets into your mouth, IT IS SWEET! Do I need to say more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, smells great and is FUN to use. A little goes a long way, you just need to scoop a pea size amount with your finger and indulge yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they say 100% natural? I am so in love!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing, I just want to eat it! It also works like a charm. Recently, my already sensitive skin has been very irritated due to weather/allergies, I get dry patches, itchiness, and minor acne. I was looking for an exfoliating cleanser that would be gentle, help me retain my natural moisture, but also make me feel squeaky clean. Suki does the trick. I use about 1/4 tsp on the daily. My skin feels soft, clean, and not over-dry. I was surprised this tiny 1oz jar lasted so long, by my est, it will last about 40 washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Scoop it out with a dry fingertip into the palm of your damp hands, rub palms together 2-3 times. It will start foaming right away, but you want the grit to exfoliate, so don&#x27;t rub until it turns smooth. Apply to wet face. At first, it will get nice and foamy, then as you scrub until the sugar gets smooth, the foam will disappear leaving a slippery film on your face. Just rinse it off with cool water and pat dry!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not sure i like this. i can&#x27;t really say if it works because unfortunately i haven&#x27;t been consistent with doing it every day. also i think i prefer the pads it is easier</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent, but too harsh for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I love this product! its organic</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I love the way my skin feels after I&#x27;ve used this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin and my acne was quite problematic couple of years back, so I was advised to give up soap usage on my face. After that though I had been using all-natural flours like besan to cleanse my skin, I used to get pimples every now and then and when it is gone, it will leave a mark. My skin condition was definitely better since I gave up soap but it was nowhere close to perfect. I came across this product in youtube, I wanted to try it since its all-natural. After I read amazon reviews I was convinced that I should definitely try it. I must say I noticed a difference right from the first usage! I know that my skin has improved considerably. My boyfriend noticed that there is always a glow on my face, which is an added bonus :) My acne spots are considerably diminished. All these within about just 10 days of using this product. Now I can&#x27;t live without this product. My boyfriend has extremely dry skin, he always used to complain about his skin. I have been pestering him to use this on his skin since the day I tried. For some reason, he kept avoiding. He finally tried it yesterday and he absolutely loved the way how this product made his skin refreshing and moisturized. I could see a difference on his skin right away, which is amazing! :) Now I know that we are going to be a repeat customer! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their skin quality! Try this and am sure you wont be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> I love this product if I use it on a relatively dry face. Just a few drops of water to &amp;#34;melt it&amp;#34; ever so slightly. Then I do get the most amazingly smooth face ever and make up application is sublime. For me, if it gets to wet then it just melts too much into a foam and I do not get any exfoliation action.</li>
    <li> This leaves your face feeling do fresh and clean. It has a very pleasant scent. I use it at night and the scent of the lemon grass relaxes me. My skin is so smooth feeling after exfoliating with this product.</li>
    <li> Got a very small sample from Birchbox.  Smells great!  Lemongrass but more lemony to me.  Sugar-like texture but nice exfoliating.  Am I a Metrasexual or what?  But I digress.  Anyway, this stuff be good.  Leaves my face feeling lemony fresh!  No, I&#x27;m not using it in my wash too.  I like it.</li>
    <li> i bought the big one 7.0 oz&lt;br /&gt;i wasn&#x27;t able to get more than a scoop out.  it is hard as a rock and started out very hard to get from the heavy glass jar.&lt;br /&gt;will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> A great product for exfoliating your skin. Leaves your skin feeling refreshed and with the sugar base, its gritty yet gentle. I love it</li>
    <li> Love this product. I used to purchase it at Whole Foods Market, but they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it. I recommend purchasing the smaller jar so that it does not dry out by the time you are half way through.</li>
