      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and it does work for sure.</li>
      <li>My butt is fuller and more plump and my man notices too</li>
      <li>but I would not spend 30 more dollars in hopes that another jar will work.</li>
      <li>Of course I love mint.</li>

      <li>I also wasnt sure on much cream i needed to apply</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s has this bubble gum sweet smell</li>
      <li>So minty and fresh and clean.</li>

      <li>&quot; one underneath the picture of the Mobutta product here)I am wearing the white colorful tights :)&lt;</li>

      <li>:).going to try the tummy cream next.</li>
      <li>I already have a nice round butt and \\&quot;Super Flat Tummy\\&quot;; I absolutely love my shape</li>
      <li>I love that because that let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s really doing something back there!</li>
      <li>so i used a good amount each time,the only problem was its only been a week and now its almost at the bottom.</li>
      <li>, i have nothing to say other than that it smells good and that it makes your butt soft.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m very slim</li>
      <li>This cream really works and you can feel it tingling on your booty after it&#x27;s applied..</li>
      <li>there you have it, a real review, by a real person..</li>
      <li>Hahaha   </li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing but made my skin smell.</li>
      <li>I am a REAL customer</li>
      <li>the whole nine.</li>
      <li>You can tell its really doing it works.</li>
      <li>This really works, I been using it 4 days now.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and leaves my skin soft but it does not fulfill the reason why I bought this product (to see even a little increase in butt size).</li>
      <li>It works for a little while because the ingredients in it swell up the tissue of your rear to give it a smoother more plump look but it fades over time.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical of buying this product till i saw the great reviews.</li>
      <li>I take my shower normally</li>
      <li>so i can be nice and fluffy back there</li>
      <li>I have been using it and so far I see no results whatsoever except for a smoother rump, no roundness, no inch gain, nothing!</li>
      <li>The cream smells like a strong peppermint and it looks like green baby poo.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that I have never had a booty. I&#x27;ve been flat and shapeless all my life until I ordered this cream. I have been using this cream for about two weeks but I have noticed results already. My booty is rounder and fuller. It even has a little jiggle and wiggle to it. I&#x27;m not fond of the cream&#x27;s smell but I&#x27;m getting use to it now. Even my boyfriend has noticed a difference in the booty. He tells me all the time that my booty is getting fatter and juicier LOL!!!! But I&#x27;m very happy with the results and I will order a second jar of this cream. Mo Butter gave me Mo Booty :-)</li>
    <li> I have used my Mo Butta Cream for a month so far and it does work for sure. My butt is fuller and more plump and my man notices too and he doesnt even know im using anything lol. Im sure everyone body will react a little different than others so be patient. I purchased the 8oz. jar and it will last 2 months. I am very happy with my results and im looking forward to using the rest of my jar up so i can be nice and fluffy back there :) Im going out of town in the next month and when my friend, Family and old coworkers see my new booty, there going to be so happy for me.</li>
    <li> I decided to also comment here although i bought the 8oz bottle i feel the 5oz customers should see my progress as well...Anyway! I started this today (3/07/2012) and when i am done i&#x27;ll post a \\&quot;after\\&quot; picture...(You can see my \\&quot;before\\&quot; one underneath the picture of the Mobutta product here)I am wearing the white colorful tights :)&lt;br /&gt;P.S I am 5&#x27;5 130 pounds black female i am doing butt exercises,eating more and using a bath brush so we&#x27;ll see if this stuff REALLY works!</li>
    <li> 1st off.. let me jus say something bout me so know the background. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8, 145lbs and I already excerise and tone all areas of my body, take vitamins, drink water, eat right everyday, not over weight, never had been; basically a health nut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my product 2/27 and STILL have some left. Applied twice a day and scrubbed the skin w a body brush.. the whole nine. After 3 wks I measured 1/2 inch difference which i will credit to the increase and switch up in my workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the product makes the skin feel nice.. oils do that. Smells ok. But did I achieve a big ole ass-- no maam?!&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again, probably not. I&#x27;m just gonna stick to my workouts and buy more DVDs that apply to the area I want to shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and fyi.. Maca DOES NOT make the butt big. I have been taking this supplement long before the use of this. If it where that easy, I&#x27;d already wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this..&lt;br /&gt;Maca is for balancing hormones, stamina, energy, and an increase in libdo. That&#x27;s it. Saw Palmetto increases breast size and for prostate health. Because I&#x27;m a vitamin junkie, I read alot on what I&#x27;m taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it, a real review, by a real person..&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
    <li> Well! I orders this taking a chance...   So I get it the 4oz in the mail, I was damn upset this thing was soooo LITTLE! I was like \\&quot;what is this gonna do for me!\\&quot;   But it lasted for a little over a  month. I was surprise it looks like throw up! :p   But it smells AMAZING!!!! And its kinda chunky thick texture   So I followed the directions and did like 5squats every week I kind you not I&#x27;m so lazy and barely did anything but it WORKED for me! I can 1000% tell my butts so cute and plump like a perfect berry! Hahaha   I&#x27;m getting more :D the 8oz and the tummy stuff</li>
    <li> OMG that&#x27;s all i half to say. I was standing in the mirror brushing my teeth. my husband was like daaaammm baby yo ass is getting plump ...lol  I said for real daddy, oh ah!!! I&#x27;m exercising..</li>
    <li> it took about 9 days until my product arrived. when i opened the bottle it wasnt filled all the way to the top. I also wasnt sure on much cream i needed to apply so i used a good amount each time,the only problem was its only been a week and now its almost at the bottom. I believe i underestimated the potency of this product. I dont see much of any results, but like i said its only been a week, the thing is, im sure ill see some results within the next week because i def. feel twitching in my butt and thighs frequently, its just that by the next week it&#x27;ll probably all be gone by then, and the bottle is only so big for 30 dollars. if i notice a change within the next week that is if i have some left, ill purchase this again, other than that, i have nothing to say other than that it smells good and that it makes your butt soft. It would be nice if i knew how much cream i needed to apply, im sure id have much more left.  OK so im just doing a follow-up on this cream, it is Feb 19th 2012 and i ordered another jar about a a week ago, ive learned that loofahs help penetrate the pores and im not putting as much on either, not only have i been feeling tingling but moderate twitching in my butt, hips and thighs, my mother taught me that when your muscles twitch, that means that its growing. I woke up one morning around the 5th day and i damn near had a heart attack, my butt is actually growing. I am a REAL customer and i kid you not, this cream is worth your money, if anything, its best to buy in bulk once you get the hang of it, to prevent you from constantly buying, but by golly, my ass jiggles when i walk, in the mirror its showing that curve right under the cheek, its at a point to where now im talking to my ass 20 times a day, like \\&quot; look at that ass!!\\&quot;lol.all in all....its.....amazing. SO SATISFIED!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small but works like it says.... Its a cream that says what it&#x27;s it gonna do...   What I love bout this cream that it&#x27;s has this bubble gum sweet smell</li>
    <li> this lotion. smells great i finish the hall bottle but sorry to tell you this i dint get any results even my girlfriends said it.i took pictures before and after but see no different.sorry waste of my money</li>
    <li> I just got my cream in the mail yesterday it has a minty smell you definatly dont smell the fish oil that is in it it kind of reminds me of a exfoliating mask for your face it has those little exfoliating beads in it after rubbing the cream on your tush you will have to wash your hands because the cream will leave a residue on your hands but it leaves your tush super smooth I will def update my review i hope I can see results in a month at least...Its been six days and my bottom is more round and a little bigger im glad to see some improvement will update again in another six days or so...Its been 20 days now and yes i def see a difference i should have used a measuring tape to see where i was before i started using this cream and to see where i am now but i didnt but my bottom has a much better shape and is bigger i am so happy and my confidence has went up alot it will be a month on usage on january 6th will give another update then</li>
    <li> I am now on my 2nd jar. I ordered the 5.5 oz tub a little over a month ago. I took before and after pics and belive when I tell you the before pics were HORRIBLE. I did see results after first 2-3 weeks or so. However, I noticed whenI didn&#x27;t put eneough workouts during the week my butt would tend to look flat and smalller. So I followed the directions, wached what I ate and put in 3 one hour workouts a week. After 4 weeks and my tub being out, my butt is more firm, and is growing bigger along with my hips. Believe me, I was skeptical but as a REAL consumer thiss stuff works! I am now on my second jar which is 8 oz and will order one more after this one. It works and I can feel it working, but for the BEST results you have to also put in work unless you already have a nice plump booty.</li>
    <li> While researching online for butt enhancing creams, Mobutta sparked my interest. I was skeptical at first but decided to just buy it. I liked how she included a letter with instructions with my name on the envelop. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two weeks (twice a day after eating) and I do not feel or see any results :(. I am also really sad because the product is so fluffy that it looks like a lot but it runs out so quick. I feel like i won&#x27;t have any product left to even see results, if any. My jar is almost empty. It smells nice and leaves my skin soft but it does not fulfill the reason why I bought this product (to see even a little increase in butt size).</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS ITEM AND I HAVE NOT SEEN A DIFFERNCE I DONT KNOW IF IAM DOING SOMETHING WRONG I DO I HAVE TO KEEP ORDERS THIS PRODUCT AND IT DOSENT WORK AT ALL..</li>
    <li> Ok. So I am on a regimen to get a fuller butt. my measurements are 34 28 371/2. I was trying to get my waist to 24inches. which is what it used to be, and my hips to a 40. Oh, and I bought the  mo butta tummy cream too. So, I did squats and increased my calorie intake,I would work out 4x per week. 3hrs on Tuesday and Thursdays, and 1hr Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I have not really noticed any change in  my hip size within the past month.This stuff doesnt work save your money, and btw I do agree that most of the reviews are fake!.......I guess that is why I bought it, and hoping it would work, because these FAKE reviews convinced me. SAVE your money and don&#x27;t waste it.Just take Maca root Pills, its cheaper and you get results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a plump butt. I was skeptical of buying this product till i saw the great reviews. I just got it in the mail today and put on some right away!. It gives you this tingling feeling on your butt after rubbing it &amp; it smells great. You can tell its really doing it works. I cant wait to see the results, Im very positive &amp; i have faith that it will work!!!!! :). I will post pictures and come back to comment of my results</li>
    <li> So I just got my Mo Butta Cream in the mail today and I am super excited to try it out for the first time. It came promptly and arrived way earlier than I expected...hope it does wonders for me this is all I really wanted for Xmas for myself! Will keep everyone posted on my success!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to order my 3rd jar, it works!!! I only gained about 1.5 inches but my booty has fullness, it&#x27;s so soft, jiggley lol and has more definition, everyone notices. My only concerned is the price, I&#x27;ve been ordering since June and it seems that I&#x27;m paying more everytime I order, not cool, please set a price point and stick to it!!!</li>
    <li> Well this stuff if working great!    Been using it for almost a month now and I&#x27;ve gained over five inches already!    I&#x27;m not stopping till I hit sixty inches (I want my man to faint!).</li>
    <li> OK I brought two jars of this stuff and let me tell you the smell is amazing. So minty and fresh and clean. This stuff however doesn&#x27;t work. It works for a little while because the ingredients in it swell up the tissue of your rear to give it a smoother more plump look but it fades over time. I did have a booty before I started this but only 34 inches. I noticed no change with this over time. But I can tell you my butt never felt softer. If you look at other Some other customer reviews you will notice that this is the only item they ever reviewed. This seem so suspect to me. I gained a bigger booty by doing squats everyday and Maca root. This product comes with instruction that tell us to do squats.    To keep in mind I never believed the pictures but whatever. Try it if you want to but keep in mind I gain a little then a lot with squats so whatever.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today and am so excited to begin to use it. I will follow up in two weeks with progress!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled ladies. Every customer who has left reviews on this product has only reviewed this ONE product....nothing else on Amazon. SCAM!</li>
    <li> OMG! This really works, I been using it 4 days now. I use it in the morning and at night after my shower. I already have a nice round butt and \\&quot;Super Flat Tummy\\&quot;; I absolutely love my shape but I want my booty just a little bigger. Since I already have a butt, I&#x27;m not going to order another container. Just one should do the trick for me.  But I do recommend that you give it a try. It might not work for everyone. But it&#x27;s working for me. Good Luck ladies &#x3D;) ugh I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> I bought some mo butta cream about a month ago. I have been using it almost every night when i get out the shower(sometimes i forget lol). I take my shower normally and when I get out I dry everything but my butt. Then i take a quarter sized amount and rub it on each cheek. Sometimes I use a little scrub brush. I almost always feel tingly, sometimes soreness. I noticed a difference after 3 days. My butt felt softer and jiggly. Now its been almost a month and I can see a difference in some of my pants. It does work I think you have to be consistent!  I hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> All my life I had the shape of a tomboy, with very muscular legs and a little tight butt. After having 3 kids my once little tight butt was a \\&quot;little\\&quot; not so tight, and flat booty. I still didn&#x27;t have hips so my self esteem was at an all time low.. That was the reason I began researching to find a way to get a bigger booty and hips. Mo Butta Cream has given me just that!! This cream really works and you can feel it tingling on your booty after it&#x27;s applied.. I love that because that let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s really doing something back there! My man, my family members I haven&#x27;t seen in a while, coworkers, and even my kids can see the difference in my booty. I am amazed at how well it works and yet how affordable it is, even for college students! I have gone from a size 34 3/4 to 40 1/2 using Mo Butta Cream and I&#x27;m so happy with my new booty! This cream is a \\&quot;MUST TRY\\&quot; so you can see for yourself how well it works! I give this cream two thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited! i&#x27;m really starting to see a lil change in my booty and hips i&#x27;m very slim 5\\&quot;4 123 and i&#x27;m starting to see big improvements! thank you very much for making this cream this time instead of me buyin the 6oz i will purchase the 8oz.</li>
    <li> I received this product on time HOWEVER it was very oily and the container was  diferent for what is showing in the web site and the seal was open I wrote to the seller (one plus smell good ..that is about it) and basically I was told SORRY but u stock with it!! sorry customer service no warranty at all or maybe return the container for so much percent off nothing to me the customer service was bad and I will check next time where any product I order come from and if is any warranty at all too much money for nothing at all again.....I wont take a chance or recomend anybody unless is some type of warranty about this product or any from this seller.</li>
    <li> Delivery was great. Got it in time. I started using it and loved the minty smell right away. Of course I love mint. I noticed a bit of firmness while using it. I only used it at night and made sure to massage it in till absorbed.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work really, but smelled really nice! Ill stick to my maca root pills.</li>
    <li> Hi, I purchase Mo butta in hopes of trying to get the curvier butt I had once upon a time before my children. I read constant reviews about the product and of course was extremely skeptical because of so many schemes that are out here. I decided to purchase the product in these hard trying times. This is my honest review it took me about 3 weeks to even decide to buy it.  I ordered it and it came in the mail in a timely fashion in a week!. I will agree with other reviews it smells good and it is like a scrub at the same time, when I first put it I felt the tingling sensation like other reviews had mentioned but I did not have any soreness or pain. The product smells minty so I figured that is why you get the sensation. I have the 4 oz jar as it was the least expensive at $24.99 plus tax I spent $30.00. I have been using it and so far I see no results whatsoever except for a smoother rump, no roundness, no inch gain, nothing! I am not saying the product does not work but I would not spend 30 more dollars in hopes that another jar will work. The cream comes with instructions and states it should last about a month but the 4oz will not last a month , i mean unless you use it once a day and use very little of it, if your using it 2x a day. Overall, I dont think the product works but it does smell nice and you will feel the tingle but at this point I dont think that means anything, my butt is rounder but no one has noticed my booty looking different and I have not either, if the price was a bit cheaper I would maybe try a second jar but other than that I would not buy this product again. If anyone has used it and has had results please feel free to tell me what specifically did u do.</li>
    <li> bought this march 12th.took a few weeks for me (im caucasian) to see results but i do.i use a loofa, and i do a butt workout once a week, very tough one though lol.i dont work for this company and i do not know them but im a happy cutomer :).going to try the tummy cream next. im a little over weight and  lacked butt shape. this stuff hlped me thank u mo butta :)</li>
    <li> It worked for me !!! It just a little oily and grainy !!! I would biy again ! The jar is a little small tho !!</li>
    <li> Its works.My hips got bigger and I was loving it!But after 1 week, I got rush all over my body and it was Horrible experience.I stop using it.</li>
    <li> The cream smells like a strong peppermint and it looks like green baby poo. It made my clothes smell. I only used it after my shower hoping it will take effect because my pores were open. It did absolutely nothing but made my skin smell. I tried it for about two months and I saw no improvement.</li>
    <li> Well, the scent is not that appeal and then it actually runs. Too messy and the scent is there after a shower. I think the product could have some potential but the scent is what kill the job because i disconnected after the second day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product is doing what it was intended to do. I will not purchase it again in the future!</li>
