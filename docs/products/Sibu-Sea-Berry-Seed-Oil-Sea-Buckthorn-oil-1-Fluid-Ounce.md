      <li>It quickly became my holy grail skincare product.</li>
      <li>Received quickly.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product, especially for acne treatment!</li>
      <li>I was stopped by a stranger in the post office the other day, another woman on the search for good products.</li>
      <li>My face is bright red, and I was having to wear a lot more makeup to make it less noticeable.</li>

      <li>and if I have any they heal fast!</li>

      <li>and I mix in 3 drops of this oil and mix it around first.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s lookin ever so much clearer!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This morning was a real shocker!</li>
      <li>It smells a bit &amp;#34;planty&amp;#34; and it should it is a pure organic oil.</li>
      <li>It works very well to heal the bumps, redness and pustules.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really changed my skin.</li>
      <li>Absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>this is making it really disappear.</li>
      <li>and I really noticed the difference.</li>
      <li>Seems to really help my Rosacea outbreaks.  </li>
      <li>It really helps speed up the healing of acne as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I put some on that morning under makeup (too much I think, my makeup didn&#x27;t wear well).</li>
      <li>Really has made a difference with my face skin, seems brighter, less wrinkled, more youthful,</li>
      <li>there was a slight but noticeable difference in the amount of redness, the bumps were gone and my skin felt very smooth and not flaky.</li>
      <li>That said, my issues are due to food allergies, so the external oil only does so much (but it helps great where it does work).</li>
      <li>I purchased this for sunburn/normal sun treatment mainly for my face.</li>
      <li>High fives</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m saving money compared to the high end products I was using.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I used pure aloe immediately after treatment and the combination kept my skin soft and it never hurt.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rare to find something that actually makes a visible difference.</li>
      <li>I normally have oily skin</li>
      <li>Other than that the product appears to be fine.</li>
      <li>This is new to me</li>
      <li>If anyone is looking at this product because they suffer from acne or other skin issues (such as eczema), then I&#x27;ll say from experience that this product didn&#x27;t magically make my issues go away</li>
      <li>Glad I tried it, but probably won&#x27;t purchase again because there are other oils that moisturize equally well for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>This works great on cold sores/fever blisters.  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin clear and supple.</li>
      <li>her skin is clear-</li>
      <li>The Sea Buckthorn from Sibu has COMPLETELY cleared up my condition.</li>
      <li>I developed this three years ago and believe it to be contributed to menopause.</li>
      <li>Heals &amp; elbows become soft again.  </li>
      <li>Everyone has different skin types and this doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
      <li>My skin used to get very oily especially during the day</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a weird sun spot that was like a scab and this is making it really disappear. Does smell odd, but you get used to it. It&#x27;s not fishy, it&#x27;s more earthy, but doesn&#x27;t smell like it&#x27;s gone bad. Really has made a difference with my face skin, seems brighter, less wrinkled, more youthful, and I&#x27;m in my 50s... Gave it to my mother in law who has rosacea and she feels it&#x27;s helping her as well.</li>
    <li> I used this oil every night when I was going through radiation treatments for breast cancer. I used pure aloe immediately after treatment and the combination kept my skin soft and it never hurt. I have recommended this oil to many people.</li>
    <li> This works great on cold sores/fever blisters.  Put a dab on as soon as you feel it.  It&#x27;s better than anything else I have tried - tea tree oil, oregano oil, lysine, over the counter crap, prescription worse than crap, and a bunch of other long forgotten stuff.</li>
    <li> Pleased with product.</li>
    <li> This takes the red out of my skin.  Was out of it for awhile and I really noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, I have symptoms of all four rosacea types. I developed this three years ago and believe it to be contributed to menopause. I have been treated by two dermatologists with numerous prescriptions. Dermatologists can not cure your rosacea, they can clam the symptoms. Very sad I know, but this oil has been a ego booster. It works very well to heal the bumps, redness and pustules. Sometimes over night!  I started using this oil twice a day morning and night in Jan. and I also took the Sea Buckthorn Oil pills two per day.  Two months later I have a big improvement and now using the oil once per day and haven&#x27;t taken the pills (because and ran out) for two weeks.  I have ordered more pills and will start them again as soon as I get them.  This oil absorbs quickly which is wonderful for using in the morning under makeup and at night for not getting on your pillows. I share this with my dermatologist and he said someone else showed him the same oil and had improved skin.  He said continue using the oil and pills.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and the Sibu sea buckthorn supplements. My skin feels softer and much more hydrated when I use these products.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product for those people who have problems with the skin such as irritation, acne, etc. I&#x27;ve got an allergy to the sun, and every time when I don&#x27;t cover my face enough and get some irritation , I put this oil with cotton swabs on the irritated spots, and I&#x27;m done; after a couple hours my skin is calmed.</li>
    <li> I have battled and struggled with rosacea for years. I&#x27;ve taken antibiotics ( begrudgingly) and used prescription ointments only to have it somewhat soothed. The Sea Buckthorn from Sibu has COMPLETELY cleared up my condition. Not to mention, even a friend commented, my skin looks dewey and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sibu!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in place of my Proactiv moisturizers for a few months now and I love it. The oil absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave an overly-oily look or feel on your face, and it hasn&#x27;t caused me any breakouts (I have acne prone skin, so that&#x27;s very important). I use 6-7 drops on my face after using my face wash and toner, and it helps to keep my skin moisturized all day, which is especially important since I work in an air conditioned office. If anyone is looking at this product because they suffer from acne or other skin issues (such as eczema), then I&#x27;ll say from experience that this product didn&#x27;t magically make my issues go away but it does seem to help with the redness and the speed of healing. That said, my issues are due to food allergies, so the external oil only does so much (but it helps great where it does work).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great stuff and I&#x27;ll never be w/out it.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my aunt. This made the skin on the sole of her foot grow back. Pretty amazing for an oil.</li>
    <li> This is new to me but i like it and hope to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It is the best oil,  goes on smoothly.  It smells a bit &amp;#34;planty&amp;#34; and it should it is a pure organic oil.</li>
    <li> If the typical dermatologist prescribed gels and treatments work for you, awright! High fives... I&#x27;ve tried a bunch to no avail. For me, they&#x27;ve never proved to improve my Rosacea situation, aaah awwlll. Lemme tell you, I&#x27;ve only been usin this Sea Buckthorn seed oil a few days and I&#x27;m already seeing much less redness in my face, my skin is looking smoother, and I&#x27;m generally really super happy that I gave this stuff a shot. Noticeably healthier looking skin, every day! I&#x27;ve been rubbing a thin layer of the oil all over muh grill every night, and I wake up with skin that&#x27;s lookin ever so much clearer! The fact that Sibu Sea Buckthorn Sees Oil is an all natural remedy makes my hippy dippy heart happy, t&#x27;boot. Rosacea sufferers: TRY THIS!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this oil. After adding this Sibu Sea Buckthorn to my previous mixture of essential oils I started to notice significant improvement to my 55 yr old complexion. My skin tone is more even and redness in the corners of my nose, chin and cheeks (which I&#x27;ve had for most of my adult life) is almost gone. I am getting compliments regularly. I sent some to my daughter who has severe acne and for her, after two weeks of use this Sibu Sea Buckthorn -mixed with other essential oils (listed below)- her skin is clear- she has discontinued her heavy duty anti-biotics which were causing other health issues due to the nasty side-effects. I mix with the Sea Buckthorn a variety of other essential oils I purchased on Amazon: Rosehip, Apricot Kernel, Geranium, Carrot Seed, Vitamin C. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results I achieved and am now maintaining with daily use of my concoction- and I&#x27;m saving money compared to the high end products I was using. I understand that some folks cannot tolerate oil on their face, but for me and the climate (dry, high altitude mountain air) my skin couldn&#x27;t be happier. I do use this mixture faithfully, frequently twice a day- morning and evening. It&#x27;s so rare to find something that actually makes a visible difference. I was stopped by a stranger in the post office the other day, another woman on the search for good products. She said my skin &amp;#34;looks beautiful&amp;#34; and asked what I use. I had my hair in a sloppy ponytail and wasn&#x27;t wearing a lick of makeup- I am sold!</li>
    <li> I was desperate to get my eczema under control and read on a few holistic sites this would do the trick.  I&#x27;m a believer!  It has a strange smell, but my flare ups are under control. I mixed a few drops (little goes a looong way) with my favorite carrier oil (almond oil, coconut oil, etc) and let it soak in. This bottle will last a while, but I&#x27;ll be back when I run out.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> i love this oil! sinks in nicely without oily residue and helps rosacea.</li>
    <li> I tried this sea buckthorn seed oil for the sole reason that it claims to reduce redness from rosacea. After using this product regularly for two months now, there is no redness reduction. The oil itself has a nice texture and smells wonderful (it smells like hay), but for me it performs the exact same way as all the other oils I use (coconut, jojoba, grapeseed and olive). All oils moisturize effectively, including this one. I think for someone who has been using chemical moisturizers their whole life and is trying any oil for the very first time, I think they would probably be more impressed with this product. I have used the oils mentioned for years and this sea buckthorn seed oil does not appear to perform any differently like I was hoping. Glad I tried it, but probably won&#x27;t purchase again because there are other oils that moisturize equally well for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> So good for acne prone sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product used generously twice daily cleared up my adult acne like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I put it on under a moisturizer.  I am also prone to exzema, and it has never caused a flare-up.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from worsening rosacea for the last couple of years, and this winter it&#x27;s become ridiculous. My face is bright red, and I was having to wear a lot more makeup to make it less noticeable. After reading the reviews, I bought this with honestly low expectations, based on the fact that nothing else seemed to help at all. Well, I put on a little the first night and the next morning there was a slight but noticeable difference in the amount of redness, the bumps were gone and my skin felt very smooth and not flaky. That was enough to impress me. I put some on that morning under makeup (too much I think, my makeup didn&#x27;t wear well). Then I used a little before bed. This morning was a real shocker! My redness is DRAMATICALLY reduced today, my skin looks and feels radiant. You could have knocked me over with a feather. I was able to wear just a bit of mineral makeup and feel great. I am buying this for my mom too. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I am forty with combination skin. (That is the pc way of saying i am treating acne and wrinkles simultaneously: )&lt;br /&gt;This is a great moisturizing oil. It needs to be used sparingly, the smell is a bit odd but you become accostomed to it.  The best part seems to be that it helps soften the skin, and the appearance of wrinkles without making me breakout!  Definitely will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a family member with roseacea and her skin has improved. We will purchase this again</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Makes my skin clear and supple. I make sure to let it absorb for 5-10 minutes before dressing.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I&#x27;ve been using it in the past 2 wks. The oil gives me a nice smooth texture and a great moisturizer for my combination skin type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for over a month now but no results for me. Rosacea is still there, skin has no changes.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that I can use to moisturize my skin after I developed dry skin AND acne after giving birth to my son.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Like this oil - and it does NOT stain my skin or clothes.  Prefer it over Seabuckwonders oil.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Seems to really help my Rosacea outbreaks.  I used it everyday!</li>
    <li> Love the product,  liked last year&#x27;s pricing better!</li>
    <li> Great oil for your skin.  I use it every night on my face.</li>
    <li> Smells nasty.  Don&#x27;t see any improvement at all.</li>
    <li> Received quickly. It seems fine. The expiration date was smudged off so that was my only concern. Other than that the product appears to be fine.</li>
    <li> Okay, the oil is thin like water. Not sure I like. I have tried other brands and prefer as it is thicker.</li>
    <li> I like it. Oil was very good but smell is bad.</li>
    <li> Highest quality, best price I&#x27;ve ever seen. Anywhere!</li>
    <li> Its not greasy. Absorbs fast. Great for scars.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and absolutely LOVE it.  It&#x27;s helped my rosacea quite a bit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really changed my skin. I put it on before bed and wake up with glowing skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> Me and my husband has been used it for more than 6 months and we are loving it. It prevents us from break out because both us are combination and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product, especially for acne treatment! I have recommended it for many friends.</li>
    <li> All of the good reviews about this product are correct! This totally cleared up my hubby&#x27;s rosacea. I have since used it myself and it gives me a glow. I literally received compliments on my skin tone after just 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We now use it in the winter in lieu of facial lotion and to treat minor cuts and scrapes so that we don&#x27;t have lasting scars. It really helps speed up the healing of acne as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not experienced the quality change over the past 2 years of using it. It does make me (slightly) breakout in my T-zone, but otherwise it is mind blowing how well it works.</li>
    <li> I was not sure if the reviews could possibly be true.  I have been trying to figure out what was wrong with my skin for a while now.  After trying a variety of products, I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  WORKS!!  FAST!  I saw improvement within 3 days of starting the oil.</li>
    <li> This is the best buckthorn seed oil on the market - I love how it makes my skin feel - Don&#x27;t need much - little goes along way</li>
    <li> My first bottle had to be returned because the security seal was broken.  I&#x27;m not sure about this second bottle. I ordered this because a co-worker let me try hers.  I only put a dab on a pimple that I had.  It started to clear it up the same day without me popping it, etc.  I was very impressed with the results of just one dab.  This bottle doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same potency as her bottle.  I say this because it isn&#x27;t doing anything for the emerging pimples that I have.  The verdict is still out on it clearing up a dark spot I have on my leg.  I&#x27;ve been applying it to the spot for a week now. I&#x27;m also putting on my skin to see if there is a difference.  I will repost in a few weeks to see if there are any changes with using this product.</li>
    <li> Sea buckthorn oil has been my go to for years.  Sibiu is a good brand.  Heals &amp; elbows become soft again.  Use sparingly though because it does make skin orange.  But no worries because by morning orange color is gone.  The important thing is that it works !</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this product has really worked for me. Some friends of mine put it on pimples and say that it disappears overnight, but that doesn&#x27;t happen for me. I mix this with my moisturizer, and it keeps my face soft. But I do like this product and just don&#x27;t know what it does to my face. Everyone has different skin types and this doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for sunburn/normal sun treatment mainly for my face. I have some carrot lotion and I mix in 3 drops of this oil and mix it around first. It&#x27;s awesome! I have no burning on my skin and it feels soft and the oil isn&#x27;t greasy, it stays on all day long. I actually like the smell too. I normally have oily skin so I was worried about this, but it&#x27;s perfect. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Though berry oil is supposed to have more benefit on skin but it&#x27;s too oily on face and make me breakout, so I tried Sibu Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil.  My face seems less oily and clear my red bumps on my forehead.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. My skin just drinks it up and no bad side effects! Will be a permanent staple in my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> If you have combination or oily skin prone to blemishes, even acne, this oil will change your life - I mean the skincare bit of it. My skin used to get very oily especially during the day but since I have been using this oil as my nighttime moisturizer, my skin is finally getting the moisturization that it needs and is not acting out being overly oily during the day anymore (or night for that matter)! When I started using it on nightly basis I also noticed less breakouts and blemishes along the way and if I have any they heal fast! This product has given me what every woman wants - good skin days. It quickly became my holy grail skincare product. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed!</li>
