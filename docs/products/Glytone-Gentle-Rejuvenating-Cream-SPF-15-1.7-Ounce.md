      <li>I love this product!</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I had been purchasing this product from my dermatologist for much more money.  </li>
      <li>I have so many allergies to cosmetics</li>
      <li>Where it does not remove or reduce wrinkles, it does keep them from getting more pronounced as age and gravity run amok across your face.  </li>
      <li>It is great for dry skin on my face and a wonderful moisturizer, especially during the winter months.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easy</li>

      <li>Great for a little exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>Light yet very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so worth the cost and</li>
      <li>It took another wash and a good night&#x27;s sleep to get my eyes back to normal.  </li>
      <li>Keeps face smooth and free of blackheads, blemishes, and actually does reduce color of age spots, discoloration.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and there was something about the texture that just wasn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
      <li>At first it seemed to be doing something for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Glytone Daily Cream and am not ready to give it a good review, but so far it has been working better than a well-known moisturizer that I have tried, so I am sticking with it.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products and this one really helps my skin to remain soft and clear.</li>
      <li>Diminishes fine lines and spots over time while protecting against further sun damage.</li>
      <li>The reason is that by midday, much of it had melted into the area around my eyes, and my eyes were burning all day.  </li>
      <li>This product was originally recommended by my dermatologist and I continue to use it three years later.</li>
      <li>Have used this product for a few years and it is consistent, tried and true.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy and makes my face feel alive!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder if this had been used or was it just old.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for a whole year because the lady who does my facial sold it to me.  </li>
      <li>I have used this cream for at least 10 years and I really love it.  </li>
      <li>Really like the results from using Glytone Daily Cream SPF15.</li>
      <li>I will stick with the previous supplier and pay full price.</li>
      <li>Maybe before my next order, I will, but for now, I will use my new jar.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately I was not as thrilled with this product as I was with the Glytone starter kit.  </li>
      <li>First bought it from my dermatologist but this was half the price.  </li>

    <li> Unfortunately I was not as thrilled with this product as I was with the Glytone starter kit.  The reason is that by midday, much of it had melted into the area around my eyes, and my eyes were burning all day.  I washed my face and put on a blander moisturizer since I wasn&#x27;t going outside, but it still continued to burn.  It took another wash and a good night&#x27;s sleep to get my eyes back to normal.  Not a repeat product for me, although my skin looked great that day.</li>
    <li> Light yet very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was recommended by my Dermatologist .  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only my third day using this cream and it works wonders. My darkspots have already begun to fade and my face is noticeably smoother and even. Goodbye all other face products and HELLO glytone.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. First bought it from my dermatologist but this was half the price.  Would recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>

    <li> I love this brand!  Great for a little exfoliation.  Dermatologist recommended it - found it cheaper (by a lot) on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;  PS was NOT expired</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for at least 10 years and I really love it.  To begin with Glytone was recommended to me by a dermatologist.  I have so many allergies to cosmetics I of course was skeptical but love the feel of the crèam on my face.  Glytone is not oily and makes your face feel great.  The sun protection doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for me. The glycolic acid helps with my occasional acne and smooths my skin. It can be a bit heavy during the summer months because my skin is very oily. I like the SPF protection because I don&#x27;t have to apply anything else in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Love the Glytone - Amazon has best price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to have any tightening effect on skin. I like that it has sunscreen but that&#x27;s about it. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product for daily use.  Diminishes fine lines and spots over time while protecting against further sun damage.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and transaction.  Excellent price on this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a whole year because the lady who does my facial sold it to me.  At first it seemed to be doing something for my skin.  But, after a while, my skin always looked dry and dull.  I have acne prone skin and I&#x27;m in my late 20s.  I thought I need something strong to fight the oils in my skin, but I didn&#x27;t.  My future mother-in-law told me about Origins products.  This Mushroom Skin Relief line has literally changed my life.  It&#x27;s so worth the cost and a little bit goes a LONG way.  I have had the same jar since May and it&#x27;s now August and I don&#x27;t see the bottom of the jar yet. [[ASIN:B0050GEEBK Origins Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Soothing Face Cream 1.7 oz]].  I also use this: [[ASIN:B0050GEEJM Origins Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Soothing Treatment Lotion 6.7 oz]].  For my face wash, I use this: [[ASIN:B001AHJJJA Origins Checks and Balances(tm) Frothy Face Wash 5 oz]].  This is wonderful stuff.  Not cheap--but you WILL see results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m your basic get out the door person who doesn&#x27;t fuss with hair, makeup or clothes, but this is one product that although I think expensive, is worth enough of my time to apply and continue to buy. It goes on easy (doesn&#x27;t take forever to rub in), seems to make my face shine and look healthy, I think has helped keep elasticity (no wrinkles), and keeps me from getting sunburned. I may get rosy cheeked as if burned but then later in the day, the red is gone. It stings a little when first applied especially if my face is dry or I used a defoliating product, but the sting goes away in a minute. It&#x27;s the only day moisturizer I use even in the winter. The smell is chemically, not pleasant, but the smell goes away quick. I haven&#x27;t looked at the ingredients to see if there are any I shouldn&#x27;t be applying to my skin such as parabens. Maybe before my next order, I will, but for now, I will use my new jar.</li>
    <li> I have been applying this product to my face daily for several years and I like the results!  Not greasy and makes my face feel alive!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a few years and it is consistent, tried and true.  Keeps face smooth and free of blackheads, blemishes, and actually does reduce color of age spots, discoloration.  Where it does not remove or reduce wrinkles, it does keep them from getting more pronounced as age and gravity run amok across your face.  I would recommend this product to anyone over the age of 30.  Glytone replaced the Genesis Wellskin product line.  No need to buy the day and night creams; the only difference is the SPF in the day cream.  Use in conjunction with the cleansing wash.</li>
    <li> I use with other facial system.  Very good for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin.  I use on conjunction with Obagi; prescribed by dermatologist.  Excellent vendor; good service.</li>
    <li> For keeping your skin exfoliated it&#x27;s great.  I use it every morning and my foundation just glides on.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years it was sold to me in my doctor&#x27;s office but it is easier to purchase online.</li>
    <li> Really like the results from using Glytone Daily Cream SPF15. This product was originally recommended by my dermatologist and I continue to use it three years later.</li>
    <li> I had been purchasing this product from my dermatologist for much more money.  Nice to get it at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and this one really helps my skin to remain soft and clear.It is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002D48QP2 Glytone Daily Cream SPF15, 1.7-Ounce Package]] I love this product! I have to order it only once a year, because a small amount is enough each time I use it.  I use only a dime size amount.  It is great for dry skin on my face and a wonderful moisturizer, especially during the winter months.  It was recommended to me by a dermatologist. I was ordering it from another skin product online website. Saved $10 from Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> Good product starting to see difference</li>
