<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works great and looks good</li>
    <li> I chose this product because the magnifying strength was high, however, the full size is much smaller than I anticipated.  It does magnify well.</li>
    <li> I liked the magnification, but the unit was too small.  I was looking for something bigger. Guess I&#x27;ll have to look at size of magnifying Glass  next  time. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Write your review here</li>
    <li> Be sure you look at the size. It is kinda small but as described. We bought it to show the kids how to start a fire using the sun. For this it works great. Smoke within about 3 seconds.</li>
    <li> arrived as promised, high quality, just what i wanted thanks</li>
    <li> 20x magnification my ass!</li>
    <li> Better than most.  Small viewing area of the glass.  A little pricey if too much more than $5.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, was a lot smaller than what I thought it would be, I&#x27;ll keep it and still use it, but will pay closer attention to the size, I still need to find a very large handheld, magnifier, if I don&#x27;t find one on Amazon I know some Antique Shops Carry the sets I&#x27;m looking for,</li>
    <li> too small to use and read things</li>
    <li> functions as expected</li>
    <li> I was VERY DISAPPOINTED by this product - it is far too small, and the magnification is terribly inadequate.  The product is actually less than  six inches long, and the diameter of the glass is not even two inches across.  I want my money back!!    I would recommend that these products be shown alongside  rulers, so shoppers will know the actual size.  Ordinary Americans know very little about measurements in metrics.  Had I been aware these magnifying glasses were so TINY, I would never have ordered them.    It is a very pretty magnifying glass, just disappointingly small.</li>
    <li> Looks great, with class.  The only issue I see/have is the size of the magnifying lens.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smaller than I expected. By about a third.  The size makes it harder to use &amp; dial in&lt;br /&gt;to what youi want to magnify. I should have bought a larger size unit.</li>
    <li> Almost to nice for practical use .. But it meets my needs .. I bought it get to a closer look at the newly hatch brine shrimp and the daphnia culture I feed the fish. (If I wanted to study them I&#x27;d got a microscope) These old eyes just needed to &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; them and that they are alive.</li>
    <li> All the other magnifiers listed their size as lens only - I got this puny little 3&amp;#34; thingincluding the handle</li>
    <li> This is a very nice magnifying glass; it should last us for many years, as it has heft and quality products in it.</li>
    <li> goodness but has this come in handy... and it looks great on my desk.It&#x27;s a good size for my desk, not too obstrusive, and I&#x27;ve even taken it in my purse oncewhen I was doing some research in old books.Perfect.</li>
    <li> the $4 price tag was good if this was a 20x. . . the fact that my sons 8x magnifier has the same power is not good and this is actually really small magnifier glass (size of a dollar coin or slightly bigger then a Oreo cookie)</li>
    <li> I bought this as an &amp;#34;explorer&amp;#34; toy for my daughter.  Works well for that, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very high quality.</li>
    <li> magnifier works great, and light is very bright!</li>
    <li> Perfect just what we needed nice style and rich looking</li>
    <li> Big enough to really help but not heavy, this magnifying glass is just right for me. It&#x27;s attractive, too. Good for very small type of every sort, from sports scores to assembly directions too small to read otherwise.</li>
    <li> iT IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE PHOTO.  iTIS TOP HEAVY AND THE PENCIL THIN HANDLE IS HARD TO HOLE ON TO AFTER A WHILE.  yOU HAVE TO BE 4&amp;#34; FFROM RHE PRINT FOR CLARITY.  tHE HANDLE  NEEDS TO BE BIGGER AROUND AND A COUPLE INCHES LONGER.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t  realize just how small the glass is in the magnigying lens.  I wouldn&#x27;t order again  Nothing else to say</li>
    <li> GOOD MAGNIFIER, FITS IN MY PURSE, LOVE IT. THE PRICE IS RIGHT, MAGNIFIES REALLY BEAUTIFULLY, THE PRICE IS RIGHT, DELIVERY QUICK, IT WAS WHAT I EXPECTED TO BE.</li>
    <li> has two lens and won&#x27;t even start a camp fire in needed.</li>
    <li> The handle and frame are of average quality.  I was expecting the magnification to be greater. Overall, a nice gift for a small child which is why I purchased it.</li>
    <li> It appears that they omitted a decimal point in the magnification. I would say that the magnification is 2.0 (at least to my eyes).</li>
    <li> GREAT IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BIGGER SIZE.</li>
    <li> This is not 20x magnification, it is more like 4x at best.</li>
    <li> This is a good lens, the handle is OK, I have low vision, and this comes in really handy. Very few magnifiers rated as 20X actually are, this is the closest one I&#x27;ve found so far.  It&#x27;s DEFINITELY worth the price.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but is smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Works great and looks great!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. As I get older I keep getting stronger and stronger magnifiers, 2X 5X 8X.  These babies are 20X and I can now read the fine print on the fine print.  It looks cool to.</li>
    <li> This 20x Gold Tone Metal Frame Magnifying Glass is a little smaller than I expected but it is well made &amp; very elegant for a desk top display. It is also a good size for a purse / pocket. I am considering ordering a few more for gifts.</li>
    <li> Not only is this magnifier beautiful, it is the largest 20X maginifier I could find! I suggest you try it.</li>
    <li> Attractive, solidly buil.</li>
    <li> This is at most a 2X magnify glass.</li>
    <li> Very nice magnifying glass, clear magnified view. Quality piece.</li>
    <li> When they say the lens is 50 mm they mean it.  That&#x27;s less than 2 inches.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father who has difficulty seeing close up.  This is perfect for him.  I do wish someone sold one with a larger viewing area.</li>
    <li> love this magnifying lens</li>
    <li> Works fine for reading fine print on labels, etc.  Was smaller diameter than I expected, but that&#x27;s on me for not reading the dimensions more carefully.</li>
    <li> It was very small but nice.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small magnifier with lots of magnification. This one is not powerful, it doesn&#x27;t seem any different than my 2.5x pocket glass. The product is nicely finished and the price was cheap. I think the power is falsely advertised.</li>
    <li> Compact, just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received this magnifying glass.  The quality was much nicer than I expected. The price was also very fair and shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this to look through old coins my folks have saved over the years and I needed a glass with higher magnification.  This 20x works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my purchase.  Highly recommend to anyone with a need for a closer and clearer view.</li>
    <li> its kinda small but that&#x27;s not necessarily a con</li>
    <li> too small does not magnify enough</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I expected, though I didn&#x27;t really closely look at the specs.  Pretty sure its not near 20x, probably more like 5x.</li>
    <li> Thanks like this item as it is sturdy and works well.</li>
    <li> High quality. Excellent size. Great optics.</li>
    <li> Lens was smaller than I pictured when buy, but it does ok.</li>
    <li> 2x at best do not buy.</li>
    <li> part of my Sherlock Holmes kit for my grandson&#x27;s Christmas present.  beautiful and functional, will be used for many things a curious boy gets interested in (like his current mineral, rock and fossil collection).</li>
    <li> small and powerful exactly what i needed and it was exactly what the the advertisment decribed it to be and a very good price</li>
    <li> little smaller than i wanted</li>
    <li> much too small, I am greatly disappointed at your false advertising campaign..&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER purchase this item again, nor recommend it to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I love this, it works great.  I have 3 now, one at work, and in two places in my home.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Jan in Idaho</li>
    <li> The magnifier is 2X not 20 X as expected, i am very disappointed. It&#x27;s beautiful but not supply my necessities.</li>
    <li> Bought for my cousin and she loves it.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done for the price, Bought it for my daughter for school. Much superior lens compared to ones for the same price I bought at a local store.</li>
    <li> Too small and poor quality</li>
    <li> I like this thing but it&#x27;s so small. How I wish they had made a larger one. I will know more this summer if the sun shining through it will make a fire.</li>
    <li> This is a magnifying glass and it works as a magnifying glass should.</li>
    <li> Low power not 20X  I tried to cancel it but they never responder</li>
    <li> Decent glass, some distortion around the edges.  Handy to keep in your bag if you need one on hand.</li>
    <li> Does this NOT look to be a halfway decent or even adequately sized item?  THE you read the misleading item description.  It&#x27;s written in cm.  I missed that one.  From end to end this little, near Cracker Jack box prize sized thing is NOT what it appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we ARE in the U.S. and the item SHIPS from the U.S. I feel the product dimensions could have been given in &#x27;inches&#x27; instead of centimeters given the nature of the merchandise.  Personally I feel the seller&#x27;s representation is a deception.  An intentional, sneaky way to unload merchandise that THEY (the seller) got tricked into buying or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End to end it measures 5 inches in length.  Not the 7.x, WHICH if you&#x27;re like me you pretty much skimmed over.  The metric system the Canadians tried so hard to standardize for us here in the U.S. back in the 70&#x27;s that just didn&#x27;t fly.  Me?  I&#x27;m accustomed, for the most part except when buying liters of soda, to seeing dimensions given in feet and INCHES, NOT centimeters.  I&#x27;m REALLY supposed to accept full responsibility for misreading the description by skim reading?  Even reading earlier reviews, even though only 2 Stars were given, I would have appreciated more detail as I am setting forth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass itself, including the &#x27;gold-colored&#x27; frame, is 2 inches across in diameter.  (For those not sure: The &amp;#34;diameter&amp;#34; is the total distance across from any two &#x27;parallel&#x27; sides.) 2 inches across, measured point to point in a straight line, outside edge to outside edge.  YES including the relatively thick frame holding the glass: 2 INCHES. PERIOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnification wise, it should okay 4 u if you have 20/20 vision, or something close to 20/20 vision, and say you&#x27;re looking at stamps or coins.  Anything else, no offense, but I don&#x27;t care; it doesn&#x27;t concern me;  I bought it to look at dates on coins and/or whatever I might need some closer look at.  In terms of &#x27;Value?&#x27;  In my opinion it&#x27;s worth about...$3.99 to $4.99 tops.  $4.99 might be pushing it a little.&lt;br /&gt;The handle on this thing?  Well I told you the entire length of this thing is 5 inches.  Again FIVE INCHES TOTAL.  So, if the total length is 5 inches which it is: and the diameter of the viewing part is TWO INCHES, that leaves a length of a 3 INCH HANDLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put: THIS THING AIN&#x27;T WORTH IT.  Piece of sh*t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost completely unhappy with my purchase, I think the person or people who put the item description out there are dishonest and I will never again buy something from Rosallini.  What a deceptive, dishonest, selfish, cheat.  My thumbs down to anyone who thinks anything that the representation in tandem with the picture of the item (ca. 2/14/15) is okay.</li>
