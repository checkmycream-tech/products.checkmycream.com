<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the brush and comb combination - I have several brushes with the same detangling design and curve. It is a good brush for my hair, which is thick and frizzy. I&#x27;ve found the comb to be fantastic on my thick hair or if I need to part my hair. The duo is a fantastic welcome to my hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the products courtesy of Bella and Bear&#x27;s customer rewards club, which I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this detangling brush and comb set from Bella &amp; Bear. Not only is it yet another adorable brush and comb with this elegant design, they perform amazingly. I love the detangling brush for getting all the knots out of my hair after a shower. It doesn&#x27;t pull and tug or rip out tons of hair like normal brushes do. The handle is so comfortable to hold. This set goes through my hair so quickly and effortlessly. It&#x27;s so relaxing to brush with it too! It gives your scalp a nice massage and stimulates the natural oils in my scalp to keep my hair healthy, shiny, and smooth. The comb is wide toothed and perfect to use. I even caught my husband brushing his beard with my Bella &amp; Bear comb! *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> This works very well on a thick head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t prove that, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m told :)</li>
    <li> Three best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> It has a weird shaped brush but I cant complain cuz that is seriously the cutest.brush ever &amp; It works really well even tho it sounds like its tearing your hair but its not. I have hard time finding brushes that detangle my messy hair. I enjoyed it. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely best brush and comb set I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m somewhat a product junkie so I have 3 of the top brands of detangling brushes already. The handle and cute floral design make this one unique. I must say using this on myself, my toddler and my husband has been very successful. My husband has a low cut but he loved how this brush feels as a scalp scratcher. I have very thick unmanageable hair but following the instructions and using this set on my hair has been like a dream. It makes my hair smoother and definitely gets the tangles out.I still have my other brushes but this one is now my go to. This is also the first brush my daughter chooses when it&#x27;s time for her to get her hair combed or detangled. She says it doesn&#x27;t hurt her and its soft. This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon. This company has awesome customer service and the cutest products. I highly recommend them and would not hesitate to purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> great product.easy to use.good detangler</li>
    <li> I am all about hair! I believe hair in general can make or break your look. Whether it be the hair on your head or your eyebrows, the way you style and shape your hair says tons about you.  When Bella and Bear asked me to review their Detangling Brush and Comb I was psyched!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair.  It falls all the way down to my waist. I refuse to cut it short, however I get it trimmed often to keep the dead ends away.  Nonetheless my hair is wavy/curly and gets tangled right out the shower.  I normally blow dry and flat iron my hair to keep it manageable.  However before I can get there, I have to comb it out when wet and that is where the dance starts.  I first apply a leave in conditioner and then I grab my comb.  I love Bella and Bears comb because its a wide tooth comb which glides through the hair easily without breaking, damaging or adding too much tugging to hair.  Once that is done, I grab my blow dryer and and flat iron and straighten away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my hair is dry, I comb it out 2-3 times and away I go. I have seen these new type of hair brushes at Sephora, but they were going for $25-$30 each JUST the brush.  Bases on that I always shy away from it.  However I have to say, this is the best brush I have ever tried.  It glides though my hair with no breakage and really leaves it with a nice shiny look. I have no idea how the brush does that, but with my other brushes, my hair does not look anywhere next to that shiny when using those other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both the comb and brush on my two year old daughters hair when wet and dry, and it helps massively to detangle her hair without all the crying she puts me through when combing out her hair after a shower.  I am truly amazed on how well this brush works.  I am just in love with this brush and comb set.  It is honestly worth the money. Now a side note. If you have really thick and/or curly hair then the brush might not work for you.  The bristles are short so it might get through really curly hair or hair that is very thick.  However the comb in that area works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have all the other Bella and Bear products and honestly so far I have not been disappointed by any of them.  All their products have to do with taking care of some sort of hair issues and truly they work.  I would high recommend looking into this company!</li>
    <li> Good&lt;br /&gt;Ship is very quick&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy&lt;br /&gt;Because I get good itemed</li>
    <li> Great brush for fine hair.</li>
    <li> The comb: 4 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty nice. It does what a comb does, and it&#x27;s nice to use in the shower when conditioning. But as a result, it feels really slippery and uncomfortable. I really wish the grip had rubber or a more ergonomic grip. Admittedly, I use brushes more than combs, so this could be an amazing comb in comparison to other combs--but it&#x27;s still not amazing enough to impress me. I also don&#x27;t like the printing on it, because while the quote is nice, I don&#x27;t like designs with words. I would&#x27;ve preferred if they kept it plain or with the trademark flower pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush: 2.5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I like it or not. It&#x27;s cute, but that&#x27;s the main thing it has going for it. It&#x27;s incredibly lightweight, and so it feels cheap. When I brush my hair, it barely brushes the surface of my hair, instead of going into it--though that might be its method of detangling? The lack of beads at the end of the bristles is supposed to be a good thing, but as a result, it hurts when the bristles touch skin (and I usually brush my hair against my palm or body so that all the hair gets through the bristles, which also explains why when using the brush, it barely brushes the surface). Even though it&#x27;s supposed to hurt less, brushing is still relatively the same painfulness (maybe less when my hair is wet though), plus my skin hurts when brushed against it. But, I mean, it does still get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag: 3.5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it, and no one buys this product for the bag, so it really isn&#x27;t a big deal. It&#x27;s nice, I guess, if you bring both brushes somewhere. While I don&#x27;t use it, I was kind of bothered by how unsaturated the floral print was, especially when the pattern on the brush is a lot more saturated. It&#x27;s a cheap, unnecessary bag, but if it&#x27;s going to be included anyways, I woulda preferred it to be done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, unless you&#x27;re looking for both a brush and a comb, really love the designs, and have pretty short hair, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it. The comb is alright, but not as cute and not worth the cost alone; and if your priority is the brush, then it&#x27;d be better to invest in a more sturdier brush.comb is alright, but not as cute and not worth the cost alone; and if your priority is the brush, then it&#x27;d be better to invest in a more sturdier brush.</li>
    <li> Bella and Bear products are a delightful find! The brush feels great on scalp and in hand. Spacing on the comb teeth is great. The retro styling makes me feel happy. What more can I say.. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> The comb was fine. The brush was broken when it came but I snaped it back on. I left it in my bag and the brush bent. Not the brush literally, but the combs in it:/</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. It also seems as if this is only for right-handed people. It pops out of my hand when I use my left...maybe the contouring?</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the comb much but I like the brush, it works really well at the end of the day while brushing out my &amp;#34;work hair&amp;#34; which involves curling irons, flat irons and a significant amount of hair spray(the bigger the hair closer to god) it does a great job of undoing the day without all the yanking and ripping I previously endured.</li>
    <li> Eh, they&#x27;re ok, but no miracle.  I keep being lured in by new gadgety brushes that I think won&#x27;t hurt my curly-haired, tender-headed 8 year old, but these are on par with the genie brush and &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; wet brush.</li>
    <li> It feels good when I use it....doesn&#x27;t catch or snag my hair..  I appreciate it&#x27;s storage bag.keeps it together and colorfull and easy to find  on dresser or table.</li>
    <li> This brush has less stiff, more flexible &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; which works well for my thinner, dyed, long hair. I preferred this for myself to the Curve detangling brush. However, my husband uses the aforementioned brush for his thicker, curly long hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE how pretty the box and brush are! I wanted to get a detangling brush for my 2 year old&#x27;s curly hair.  After looking at several plain ones I saw these pretty ones with a matching comb for only a few dollars more, AND they are a pretty pattern and saying that makes them special. Thank you Bella and Bear for making your products a little bit more special than the others.</li>
    <li> The brush works well when my hair is really tangled and wet.  The comb is perfect for really getting product into wet hair after it&#x27;s tangle free.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter loves this set! She said it no longer hurts when she brushes her hair, which is long, mid back length. The brissels are short enough that the hair comes out easily if there is a major knot. They are also the perfect amount of flexibility! Love the curved shape of the brush rather than a rectangle shape.</li>
    <li> Just used and the top of the comb broken. I would like a refund</li>
    <li> I love the comb, it detangled my hair with no trouble but the brush was sort of bended and felt cheap. Still workable tho.</li>
    <li> I love this set so fashionable and works good .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I like my conair paddle brush better.  It feels flimsy.  The bristles have bent and my hair isn&#x27;t even coarse.  I would not recommend this item to anyone with coarse hair.</li>
    <li> This set is very pretty. It comes with a fabric pouch to keep them in. It would make a nice gift!  The brush would be nice for little girls with tangled hair. The comb is not too impressive. The tines are too wide in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the Detangling Brush and Comb! I always comb and brush my hair when it is still damp and I have noticed it is so much easier to go through the hair, smoother, less hair on the brush and it tangles less. I love the cute packaging, the cute brush and comb look great on my vanity.  I have never gone wrong so far with any of Bella and Bear products! This also got here quick!</li>
    <li> really pretty and it works great on my fine hair :)</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair that has become a tangle nightmare since I got it colored and it dried my hair out. This actually works and doesn&#x27;t seem to break my hair off. It&#x27;s not just surface untangled either. I&#x27;ve used this and then used my regular brush and the tangles are gone!</li>
    <li> Our daughter loves this set and says it does not pull her hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great set, it looks so pretty in my bath bag! When it arrived, the pieces were bigger than I expected. At first I worried that the comb might not catch knots, since it was a little wider-toothed and larger than my previous, and my hair is very thick and curly but short (just about above the shoulders). No problems there! It caught the knots and tangles, but it was actually gentler going through them than all my previous combs. I use it to detangle my hair while conditioner is on, and it worked great on wet hair, got all the tangles out (and I had a lot since my only good comb had been lost about a week). I was anxious about having to replace my standby comb, but the search is over with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush I have not used on my hair when it&#x27;s curly, since I never do anything to my hair other than comb it the once during conditioning every time I wash my hair. However, when I used it on my hair after a flat-ironing, it was great for keeping the style in shape. I put a tiny but of jojoba oil on the bristles and glide it through, really keeps my heat-flattened/tortured hair from getting too brittle. I also love that it came with a carrying case (also floral and pretty) because keeping a brush in a toiletry bag can be messy unless you wash it every single time you use it (and who has the time for that?). This keeps any stray hairs on the brush from getting into any other cosmetics and stuff in the bag, and it&#x27;s cloth, so I believe it should be easily washable with just a little soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this set, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with either product in it so far. Great value, too!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and quality product, Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought the detangling brush and comb on a whim when I saw it on Amazon because I knew my wife struggled with her hair each day with a small pick and a difficult brush.  She absolutely loves your brush and comb.  She has much pain in her arms and your brush and comb have made it easier for her.  Now if we could just find something else to help her finish curling her hair!  Thank you for your great product.</li>
    <li> I have long thick curly hair that tangles easy. This might be a great product for someone with less hair. The brush wouldn&#x27;t even go through half of my hair. I have to divide it into small pieces in order to untangle. The comb was pretty strong though.</li>
    <li> My daughters love it, only thing is that they bought want their own to keep in their purse</li>
    <li> Very cute and nice quality.  It comes with a little bag for storage and fits nicely into my young grandaughters vanity.</li>
    <li> Cute, pleasant pattern. Does detangle my long thick hair, the comb is even better.</li>
    <li> Great for detangling my Virgin (Brazilian, Indian &amp; Peruvian) Hair Extensions. I use this set on wavy, curly and straight textures. The brush is perfect for even distribution of conditioner on deep wavy hair. The comb works well for styling large bouncy curls.</li>
    <li> This is a really cute brush and comb set. I think the colors and pattern are really adorable. I usually love all Bella and Bear products. As you can see in one of my pictures below, the brush is coming apart. I&#x27;m not very happy about this. I thought these products would be made out of a better and stronger material. The brush is like it&#x27;s made in two pieces and the pieces are coming apart. The brush also has hard, thin bristles which may be good for use in the shower only. I don&#x27;t think the brush will last long at all. I really do like to comb though. It is made a lot sturdier than then brush. I like to use it in the shower and out of the shower. I like the quotes, It makes the set special and different It does have really cute packaging. If the brush was made better, I would definitely recommend this product. It would make a really great gift. For now, I would pass on this set. I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I only recommend products that I would use myself.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes in the set I enjoyed, the other was poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bigger brush was hollowed on the inside and seemed like it was made of plastic. It was like a doll brush, not a brush for a person&#x27;s hair. It works great if your hair is already brushed through and tangle free. Otherwise, it pulls and yanks on your hair, not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the smaller, flat brush (the comb) works great for detangling and brushing through wet hair. It&#x27;s thicker and more heavy duty than the other brush. The combs are bigger with more space in between to make it easy to glide through wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product through a promotion in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> i love this brush soooo nice on my curly hair!! my son broke the comb though which sucked but i think the print is soo cutee and works amazing on my hair</li>
    <li> Very cute and well received by gift recipient.</li>
    <li> Bella and Bear make some of the cutest items I have ever seen. I got this brush and comb set free in exchange for a product review. The comb is great for when your hair is wet and you want to comb it - it&#x27;s a wide tooth so it doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair up. The brush is also nice because if you have long hair you can get it through your tresses without tangling. It definitely does what it states it does.</li>
    <li> I love this brush easy and fast to brush</li>
    <li> In my honest opinion this is not worth $25. The brush bristles are flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t do a good job with brushing my thick hair. Some of the bristles were already bent right out of the box. The comb is just your average comb. You can get the same type at target or walmart for cheaper. The only thing good about this is the design.</li>
    <li> LOVE! This actually works in the shower! no more tangling days! The packaging and the products are uber chic and cute too! I am so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> The comb is amazing and nice and very lite but the brush on the other hand seems very cheap but works nice and leaves the hair very smooth</li>
    <li> Great tangle remover. No more tears.</li>
    <li> Where has this brush been all of my life!!!  I was a little skeptical about this purchase because some reviews mentioned that the brush would fall apart.  Well I got this and immediately noticed that it was made of plastic and the bristles are a thin, spiky, and flexible plastic.  I thought for sure it wouldn&#x27;t work.  However, when I got out of the shower and used this on my hair.  It went right through 99% of the tangles without a problem.  My hair is long, thin, and tangles very easily. I wish I had know this magical hair brush years ago!</li>
    <li> Absolved a life saver for fine easily tangled hair. Works very well frdetanglement . Would buy again.givenprompt and courteous service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a brush that will brush through my long curly hair for quite some time now. When I wash my hair it gets so snarled and when it&#x27;s time to brush it, I have to literally rip my hair out going through it. I took a chance with this product because the reviews seemed good. I&#x27;m glad I took that chance. This is the best brush ever! It works through my hair rather than pulling it all out. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another brush again. I am so in love!</li>
    <li> I love the shape of the brush.  It makes is so much easier to hold and use in my hair.  I will admit that having used other types of bristles before, it took me a few times to get used to the bristles on this brush.  But now it&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do leave the comb in the shower to use with my conditioner.  I had a black one that I had previously used, but this one is so much prettier!&lt;br /&gt;Love the girly-ness of this set.</li>
    <li> I really love almost everything about this brush set. The package itself is just to cute, and the pattern on the brush is just too adorable. It gives your hair a shiny and silky feel like it states on the box. However, I wish bristles on the brush where made better because I have thick coarse hair. After using the brush the bristles have bent and seem as if it might slightly break. Other than that, it is a great product :)</li>
    <li> I love this brush it works great.</li>
    <li> Cute item. Was a gift, seems to work great! Ships fast and arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> Crappiest, flimsiest,  useless brush. All the teeth on the brush just bend. Doesn&#x27;t brush well at all. Period.</li>
    <li> Super cute and works very well! I wish it were a little bit heavier, but works really well!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I was really hoping for something great. I am currently overseas, and I am looking for something that will still untangle my hair after (or during my shower). Unfortunately, I have to wash my hair in unpotable water and it&#x27;s quite abrasive. The comb doesn&#x27;t work, and neither does the brush too well. It&#x27;s the same quality as one would find in any other &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; comb or brush brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair, look elsewhere. In order to brush  my hair out with this, I have to separate it into different section. Otherwise, it won&#x27;t comb through my hair at all and will get stuck.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my curly hair!!! It doesn&#x27;t hurt, get caught in my hair - just runs smoothly out on dry or wet hair!</li>
    <li> The comb was great the brush on the other wand was very cheap and flimsy. The first time I used it the bristles went flat. The brush must be made for people with thin or very little hair I on the other hand have alot of hair so the brush doesn&#x27;t do much. I stop using it and decided to give it to my mom to use on her dog.</li>
    <li> I love the comb and use it for conditioner in the shower.  The detangling brush is good, would work really well for children.  I have long hair that tangles easily and I actually prefer to use the Bella &amp; Bear paddle brush.  But overall love this brand, it looks so cute but also does what it says.  I also have the eyelash curler and love that too.</li>
    <li> I use this for all types of hair, very universal</li>
    <li> good brush.. would recommend to friend</li>
    <li> Love the comb, not so much the brush, I have really thick hair, the brissels bend really easy. Not great for thick hair!</li>
    <li> I love this comb and brush combo! I have stick-straight hair that&#x27;s very damaged, so if I lean my head back against anything my hair turns into one big tangle. The cute brush in this set has taken care of even the worst disasters in just a few minutes! I love that I don&#x27;t have to rip half of my hair out just to get it to behave! I did receive a discount on this but price doesn&#x27;t effect my review!</li>
    <li> Great value! Lovely vintage floral print! Great detangling set. The brush went right through my little girls hair, that is always a tangly disaster! Really well made. Also comes with a super cute bag. I am happy I was able to pick this up during a promotion. Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading reviews about it and I&#x27;m glade I did purchase it , it worked perfectly on my hair with out any problems love the product</li>
    <li> My daughter got this set as a gift and we both love it!  Her long, fine hair tangles very easily and gets matted if the tangles aren&#x27;t brushed out right away.  We put this brush to the test with the worst tangled, matted mess her hair had ever been in.  I was afraid that we might have to cut some of the especially bad areas out, but this brush saved us!  It did take a long time, but with patience, this brush will unravel even the very worst tangles.  I posted a picture to give you an idea of what it can do.  I added lots of conditioner and brushed it while it was still wet.  The brush was a bit hard to hold while my hand was covered in conditioner, but what wouldn&#x27;t be? Other than that it was perfect.  I&#x27;m confident that she can use it on her own now to keep the tangles at bay.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Bella &amp; Bear&#x27;s products. This comb and brush set is a great addition to the other products I own. I love the floral print on the detangling brush. It&#x27;s so cute and fashionable that I leave it out on my dresser just to look at when I&#x27;m not using it. I can&#x27;t see shoving this in a drawer or closet. The comb is made from a hard and durable plastic and is solid colored with the company logo. The comb also has the phrase &amp;#34;People will stare, make it worth their while&amp;#34; on it which I think is a nice touch. As for both products, I have no problems using them with my hair. They go through fairly easy. The brush is especially great when my hair is wet to reduce getting stuck and knotted up. My 4 year old daughter loves this brush as well. It&#x27;s the only one she will let me use on her hair because she says it&#x27;s the only brush we have that doesn&#x27;t hurt her head.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair always tangles.  This product is amazing.  She is able to easily work the tangles out on her own without tears.</li>
    <li> Really pretty!!  I love the packaging and the nice bag that it came in.  Will buy more of these!!</li>
    <li> The brush and comb set is AMAZING!!! No lie, I am in love! I have never encountered a brush that works well with my hair. I have really curly hair and if I put any kind of brush on it it will instantly turn puffy and/or frizzy! Trust me curls and brushes are not friends; that it until now. I was a bit skeptical to brush my hair so naturally I tried out the comb first and I loved it. It didn&#x27;t pull my hair and it made my curls bouncy. Sure there was hair on the comb but my hair falls out a little everyday so that was expected. The next day I  reluctantly tried the brush and was surprised when it worked beautfiully against my hair. In fact, I dare to say that I think I love the brush more than the comb! The brush detangled my hair and also made my curls bouncy and even defined them. I loved the way it left my hair feeling and looking that I locked the look with some hair spray to keep the look lasting all day! This set is wonderful and I truly encourage you to try it. You will not regret it; with the cutest designs ever and great customer service you really can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Use it for my 4 year old and my 2 year old and they love them.</li>
    <li> I like the comb. It does a good job of going through your hair with snagging it or pulling. Not a fan of the brush. Out of the box, some the ends were already bent and while trying to detangle my hair, I found the brush keep slipping out of my hand. It is not a good detangling brush for very thick hair. The design is beautiful.</li>
