      <li>what a wonderful smell!</li>
      <li>Best product for face</li>
      <li>This was an absolutely wonderful shampoo!</li>
      <li>so finding this shampoo and also using the matching conditioner was a great find!</li>
      <li>Incredible product.</li>
      <li>it bubbles well and smells good, i buy it again!</li>
      <li>or so I use Acure to strip anything out, works great.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Smells great though.</li>
      <li>Smells great</li>
      <li>Plus, this shampoo smells very nice.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
      <li>It works awesome for my dreads! :)</li>
      <li>Will be purchasing more and more!!!</li>
      <li>All around a very good sulfate free shampoo!</li>
      <li>I love Acure&#x27;s products, all of them are good for you!</li>
      <li>Love them all!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this shampoo!</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>A lot of the time, my hair will get used to products and they won&#x27;t perform optimally any more - NOT the case with this one!</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo on another website after reading great reviews there, and could not have been more pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Nice smell too.</li>
      <li>Very clean and nice.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the conditioner as well.  </li>
      <li>I love that this doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; or</li>
      <li>I never found anything that worked better for my hair and skin even when I used non-natural products.</li>
      <li>Well 2 weeks later, the blisters and itching are gone AND my hair looks great!</li>
      <li>it has a nice light scent, however, this doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this shampoo and i love that there are not any toxic ingredients in it that can harm me.</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>The smell is to die for, I love the ingredients (and what is NOT included!), and the price is right.</li>
      <li>That said, it&#x27;s one of the better Gluten Free shampoos I have found, but I would like to see if I can find another in their line</li>
      <li>This would be a good product for anyone hoping to add more natural shine to their hair.</li>
      <li>This one, to my surprise, lathered extraordinarily well!</li>
      <li>I think the price point is reasonable for what you get - amazing smelling (clean!), practical, natural, effective shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I am blessed with decent hair</li>
      <li>Having recently returned to America from 3 years in Europe, I began experiencing some kind of allergic reaction which was causing my scalp to itch and break out in blisters!</li>
      <li>Unlike many eco/natural hair cleansers out there, this clairifying shampoo actually improves the texture of my hair, leaving it shinier and more conditioned and does not leave my hair feeling drier!  </li>
      <li>I made sure to check for any kind of parasite, head lice etc, although I haven&#x27;t been anywhere I would pick them up ( Paris, Spain, Germany, Brugge , Belgium etc./no third world countries here!)</li>
      <li>With most sulfate-free shampoos, they do not lather all that much.</li>
      <li>The lemongrass smell was quite nice and refreshing, it did not really last after the shower for me, but I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
      <li>My hair stayed clean and smelling nice for a second day as well!</li>
      <li>I kept double checking the ingredients to make sure that there weren&#x27;t any sulfates in this product!</li>
      <li>LOVE that it s natural and organic with no chemicals, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel washed after.</li>
      <li>Love the natural smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also super healthy since it only contains one harmful ingredient.</li>
      <li>Acure Organics is my absolute favorite natural brand.</li>
      <li>and I have definitely found my favorite shampoo ever in this product.</li>
      <li>Definitely lathers more than I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I love it, it definitely has a lemongrass smell</li>
      <li>I decided to try this shampoo as I liked the natural ingredients (and the lack of chemicals; didn&#x27;t need anything aggravating my scalp further)</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair super soft!</li>
      <li>My scalp felt very clean without being completely stripped of natural oils.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the zesty lemon grass scent of this product and it lathers rather well, but I found that it seems to make my hair (which is normally not oily) feel a bit more heavy / oily pretty quickly on.</li>
      <li>Acure really helps to maintain the moisture in my hair far better than many other natural products, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!  </li>
      <li>I tried this one just to see and do not like it nearly as much.</li>
      <li>Overall an excellent product; one that I will definitely come back to in the future!</li>
      <li>Been trying to find a reasonably priced botanical shampoo that I like, this Acure shampoo meets all that criteria.</li>
      <li>but once I started color treating a year ago, I really noticed issues with dryness.  </li>
      <li>I wash my hair every few days and it cleans well without over-drying (I have very fine, straight hair).  </li>
      <li>My hair was very soft after rinsing out the shampoo; so much so that I almost didn&#x27;t use a conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally a light brown, and I dye it platinum blonde, so you can imagine that my hair can be quite dry if I&#x27;m not using the right products.</li>
      <li>I have super fine straight hair that lay flat to my head if product weigh it down,</li>
      <li>Got this for my 20 yr old grandson, who is very health conscious.</li>
      <li>I actually bought it from whole foods cheaper than this, but not by much.</li>
      <li>Oh WOW!  </li>
      <li>Not too sure how well it really cleanses excess by products from past shampoos, but it definitely cleans out your hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gentle, deep cleansing shampoo, that has worked well for my color treated hair, and now, as I am choosing to no longer color my hair.</li>

    <li> it bubbles well and smells good, i buy it again!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 20 yr old grandson, who is very health conscious. He loves it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for over a year now, this was a repurchase since my supply was running low. It&#x27;s a gentle, deep cleansing shampoo, that has worked well for my color treated hair, and now, as I am choosing to no longer color my hair. All around a very good sulfate free shampoo!</li>
    <li> what a wonderful smell!</li>
    <li> Acure is my go to for shampoo and conditioners these days.  Unlike many eco/natural hair cleansers out there, this clairifying shampoo actually improves the texture of my hair, leaving it shinier and more conditioned and does not leave my hair feeling drier!  I&#x27;ll be honest, I am blessed with decent hair but once I started color treating a year ago, I really noticed issues with dryness.  Acure really helps to maintain the moisture in my hair far better than many other natural products, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!  I absolutely love the conditioner as well.

    <li> This was an absolutely wonderful shampoo! With most sulfate-free shampoos, they do not lather all that much. This one, to my surprise, lathered extraordinarily well!

    <li> Best product for face that&#x27;s sometimes prone to acne.</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely lathers more than I thought it would. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair less shiny. Sometimes, I feel like if I wear other hair products like hairspray or pomade, it doesn&#x27;t get these products out completely.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of product on my hair but once a month or so I use Acure to strip anything out, works great. Use conditioner afterwards!</li>
    <li> I’ve tried quite a few &amp;#34;non-toxic” shampoos (that have limited chemicals and such in them).  This is my favorite.  I wash my hair every few days and it cleans well without over-drying (I have very fine, straight hair).  Nice smell too.</li>
    <li> Been trying to find a reasonably priced botanical shampoo that I like, this Acure shampoo meets all that criteria.</li>
    <li> Having recently returned to America from 3 years in Europe, I began experiencing some kind of allergic reaction which was causing my scalp to itch and break out in blisters! I made sure to check for any kind of parasite, head lice etc, although I haven&#x27;t been anywhere I would pick them up ( Paris, Spain, Germany, Brugge , Belgium etc./no third world countries here!) and I have no children.&lt;br /&gt;I tried 3 or 4 different Shampoos and was scratching my scalp until it was bleeding and I was in tears. I decided to try this shampoo as I liked the natural ingredients (and the lack of chemicals; didn&#x27;t need anything aggravating my scalp further) Well 2 weeks later, the blisters and itching are gone AND my hair looks great! Thank You Accure!</li>
    <li> Very clean and nice. Love the natural smell.</li>
    <li> I have three different shampoos and two conditioners from Acure. Love them all!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and i love that there are not any toxic ingredients in it that can harm me.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo on another website after reading great reviews there, and could not have been more pleased with it. I have colored hair. My hair is naturally a light brown, and I dye it platinum blonde, so you can imagine that my hair can be quite dry if I&#x27;m not using the right products. This shampoo is hydrating without ever making my hair greasy. The smell is to die for, I love the ingredients (and what is NOT included!), and the price is right. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and I have definitely found my favorite shampoo ever in this product. A lot of the time, my hair will get used to products and they won&#x27;t perform optimally any more - NOT the case with this one!</li>
    <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; or parabens and it has a nice light scent, however, this doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. I have long, wavy, &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (not dry, not oily, not thick or thin) hair and this leaves it a little dry and a little frizzy. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work for wavy hair</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this shampoo, leaves my hair feeling greasy. LOVE that it s natural and organic with no chemicals, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel washed after. Smells great though.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! It works awesome for my dreads! :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this!  Oh WOW!  The smell, the quality, the yummy-factor, how my hair feels......it&#x27;s perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Looooooooooove this stuff!!!!  Will be purchasing more and more!!!</li>
    <li> Incredible product. Smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> Smell is divine, and it does not leave me with that soapy feel once I&#x27;m done with my shower. Not too sure how well it really cleanses excess by products from past shampoos, but it definitely cleans out your hair.</li>
    <li> I use this same brand but in the bottle with the blue leaves.  I tried this one just to see and do not like it nearly as much.</li>
    <li> I love it, it definitely has a lemongrass smell but it&#x27;s very nice. My hair stayed clean and smelling nice for a second day as well!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the zesty lemon grass scent of this product and it lathers rather well, but I found that it seems to make my hair (which is normally not oily) feel a bit more heavy / oily pretty quickly on. That said, it&#x27;s one of the better Gluten Free shampoos I have found, but I would like to see if I can find another in their line that is not so shine-prone. This would be a good product for anyone hoping to add more natural shine to their hair.</li>
    <li> Acure Organics is my absolute favorite natural brand. I never found anything that worked better for my hair and skin even when I used non-natural products. Plus, this shampoo smells very nice.</li>
    <li> I still broke out using this. Not sure why.</li>
    <li> It did not make my hair healthier, but it did wish it :-/</li>
