<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has being my signature perfume for over 8yrs now,so feminine,sexy,clean &amp; fresh.just &amp;agrave; little spray and u good to go.it holds all day too.i would definately buy it again again &amp; again</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and airy with a flowery scent... I sprits some on my running jacket yesterday as soon as I got it and today I wore the same jacket... It still smells of this perfume. Definitely one of my new favorites.</li>
    <li> My biggest worry when I purchased this was this would be a knock off because of the low price . But it was not it was the real deal and I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Great product,arrived in timely manner</li>
    <li> just ,terrible&lt;br /&gt; It is not genuine</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance.very floral scent. Love it so much</li>
    <li> Arden Beauty is green but not too green, sharp but not too sharp. At the heart, AB is crystal clear and there are no cloying white florals for my skin to amplify. The base is perfect for me, so AB morphs into a second skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top notes are orris, bergamot and rice flower. Middle notes are orchid, ginger, rhubarb and lotus. Base notes are sandalwood, amber and musk.</li>
    <li> I  absolutely love this perfume😍😍😍</li>
    <li> Maybe I am a fan of Elizabeth Arden.  Simply love all its products including this perfume.  Simple bottle design but perfume is good for its size and price.</li>
    <li> I got this fragrance for my friend ,she liked it ,its light and crispy clean fragrance is a perfect all time wear and is good for all ages.</li>
    <li> It is I expected. I like it so much.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and purchased this product without EVER having smelled it.  To my surprise, it smells VERY NICE!  Actually, I have it on today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it!</li>
    <li> This perfume was a gift for my mother, she says that it is a nice perfume, she loved it and apparently everyone asks what perfume is she wearing.&lt;br /&gt;So if you like the fragances by Elizabeth Arden, you&#x27;ll probably would like this one.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVES THIS SCENT! SHE WEARS IT EVERYDAY AND RECEIVES MANY COMPLIMENTS FROM MEN &amp; WOMEN!&lt;br /&gt;IT LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance.  It is soft, romantic, and feminine.  My husband really enjoys when I wear it! A lovely gift to receive. The bottle is beautifully designed. A welcome addition to my perfume tray. I also enjoy Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s \\&quot;Pretty\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice light scent that would compliment any pH Balance. I could not imagine this perfume not working for someone.</li>
    <li> Great price. Wife likes it a lot. Was able to get multiple for what one would have cost in retail stores.</li>
    <li> I like it and would buy another when this one finish any time soon. Thanks so very much. See you some other time</li>
    <li> I was looking to purchase cinnabar and I thought I would try thus product.  It is a pleasant scent but not as bold as cinnabar.  So good smell but I personally prefer a bolder scent.</li>
    <li> Very bad. It&#x27;s a fake do not purchase. I got a rash after using this perfume. I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents. It has a soft floral flair that lasts throughout the day and is perfect for day or evening wear. I often have allergy problems with perfumes, not only with headaches and sneezing, but also itching and irritation on my wrists where it&#x27;s sprayed. I don&#x27;t have any reactions at all with Arden Beauty. (And my husband likes it which is a nice bonus.)</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorites. Every time I wear it I get compliments and people ask me what perfume it is. It is hard to imagine that it has been around for a long time!!</li>
    <li> If you re a Elizabeth Arden fan then you must purchase this scent. Its very inexpensive and it leaves you smelling fantastic.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell at all. I read the reviews and thought for sure I was going to love it, but it&#x27;s horrible. I kept it but won&#x27;t use it to go out.</li>
    <li> I have a glycerine allergy and this is one of the only parfums that i can wear.  I love it.  it was delivered timely and in great condition!!!  Thank you for having this for me</li>
    <li> The best price I could find. Fast de livery as usual. My wife loves this stuff and I do too.</li>
    <li> The smell goes out as soon as u put it on....</li>
    <li> Light pleasant scent that last all day.</li>
    <li> I would give 10 stars. My husband use this perfume only and amazon has it with good price. Couldn&#x27;t find at any other place.  It is favorite for me too.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The scent is not strong and very good to use in summer though we use it all year long.</li>
    <li> Friend introduced this perfume.。Love this perfume. Faint, large doses. I can use at home beds, sofas, curtains and so on.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really describe this, as it smells nothing like any other fragrance I have ever tried.  Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t think it is light.  I find it somewhat heavy; a little is all that&#x27;s needed.  I really like the smell.  It just makes me happy.  A strange man asked me what I was wearing.  He loved it.  Figures all the good ones get discontinued.</li>
    <li> This is my second or third purchase for myself or sister/ friend. I am an Elizabeth Arden fragrance fan and truly love this one. Got it at an even better price this time.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of this perfume spray. It&#x27;s long lasting and not very strong. Fragrance is very appealing. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just used up the bottle my sweet husband gave me so I got a new one. I love this perfume, it smells romantic!</li>
    <li> İ buy for my girlfriend she is fan of classic red door parfume however they sent me new edition whereas choised classic version im dispointed a lot.</li>
    <li> This scent is not over powering and stays on you for the whole day. I wear it often, it is the perfect scent for older women,</li>
    <li> Sweet aroma .love the fragrance</li>
    <li> I love anything by Elizabeth Arden. I heard so many people talk about this fragrance and I just had to experience it myself. And I have no regrets !</li>
    <li> The smell does not last at all, in an hour or so, you can not smell it... very weird ( I love the &amp;#34;door&amp;#34;.).  I am not sure if it is watered down, I will not get it again.</li>
    <li> This was the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made for my mother-in-law.  It is so light &amp; pretty smelling.  She usually wears beautiful &amp; must spray it on herself 5 times when she applies it.  This is a must for an older lady whose sense of smell is on its way out.  Now when she comes over, she doesn&#x27;t clear out our whole house.</li>
    <li> Smells great and long lasting</li>
    <li> I loved it and thanks so much because you made my purchase a really good purchase and a amazing item like this I&#x27;m excited</li>
    <li> i dont usually review but Its a good buy  smells nice, lasts long, it reached pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;buy it you wont regret</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores, my wife loves it and after 28 years, I reap the rewards!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this, I expected it to be LOW QUALITY. I WAS WRONG, it&#x27;s NOT as good as RED DOOR but it comes in at a close second. You get a lot for the price as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have received nothing but COMPLIMENTS on the fragrance &amp; they are in SHOCK over the price. :)</li>
    <li> aroma is the same as the one i had from 6 years ago, but the bottle is no longer has red hue in its glass and sprayer head is cheap plastic.  Well we all need to save money, including the manufacturers.</li>
    <li> really nice size and about $50. cheaper than if I wereto go to Macys or Dillards such a great deal</li>
    <li> Great price for this large size bottle.  Lovely floral scent. Lots of compliments when wearing it. Buy two and get free shipping.</li>
    <li> It gives me the womanly feeling I need.  Feeling all grown up and sophisticated. It is mild yet lasting.  Really awesome scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this not too long ago and very disappointed. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last even for five minutes!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. She loves it, I will be buying her more. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for almost 10 years (from my late teens to my late twenties) and I&#x27;ve yet to find a more versatile scent. Perfect for every day use and dressing up. My husband (who has smelled it for 7 years) loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I was heartbroken when I heard it had been discontinued, but was overjoyed when it was on Amazon! Maybe Elizabeth Arden will change their minds...</li>
    <li> Arden Beauty is my go-to \\&quot;green\\&quot; scent because&lt;br /&gt;1) it is well-blended&lt;br /&gt;2) it is inoffensive and non-allergy inducing (a must for an office!)&lt;br /&gt;3) it is so inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I wasn&#x27;t a fan.  From the name, I was expecting something more feminine and floral. The initial whif is quite synthetic, but within minutes it becomes all green notes (mostly bamboo to my nose), lily, and a light musk.  This definitely isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, but on days when I just want to smell fresh and clean, I&#x27;ll reach for Arden Beauty.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, does not last.</li>
    <li> Has a very nice fragrance that lasts all day long. Got it for my girlfriend but steal out of it when she isnt looking because of the nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is great! I would describe the impression it makes as &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34;: no juvenile fruitiness or excessive floral notes, which I was hoping to avoid. I am a surgery researcher starting medical school soon, and wanted a scent that would say, &amp;#34;mature, sophisticated, educated young adult&amp;#34;. Right on the money.</li>
    <li> I got this one for my friend. She loves it and wears it everyday. Good price range too.</li>
    <li> great smell and great price</li>
    <li> Love this scent, I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this parfume.</li>
    <li> I GET COMPLIMENTS EVERY TIME</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite. I put on just a tiny spray on me and it lasts all day. Smells wonderful.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I loved this perfume, I think I&#x27;ll buy for my girlfriend, I am a man and women they like smell that fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is not good perfume at all. It&#x27;s fragrance goes off immediately soon after you put it. It&#x27;s utter wastage of money, really disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> Oh man...I LOVE IT!!!! Its super good, so romantic, so sweet &amp; floral and best of all lasts long. So glad I made this purchase &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I recommend it to those who love floral perfumes, it reminds me of one very floral scent from givenchy -an old one... don&#x27;t remember the name. Yes, certainly good choice, but not for me - for my mom, as she loved the fresh smell of givenchy&#x27;s  Fleur D&#x27;interdit  (searched for the name for you :) ) I hope this review helps u to make the right choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Quite a bold parfume, but a very classic fragrence.</li>
    <li> I am not very pleased with this Eau de Parfum as no matter how much I spray myself with this the scent does not last.&lt;br /&gt;I have had Elizabeth Arden products before such as Red door and the scent last all day however, not with this one!</li>
    <li> not what I thought it would be from other reviews I read.  I would not purchase this scent again.  The smell is not something I want to smell all day, much less make others around me do so.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, great product and I cover the last expectations that I wanted, very responsible seller, Thanks</li>
    <li> YES IT DO SMELL REALLY GOOD LAST A LONG TIME IT WORTH EVERY DOLLAR THANK YOU</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll never regret buying this one !!!</li>
    <li> Good presents for relatives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for 6 years now and I don&#x27;t ever get tired of it. Its light, but romantic and stays all day.</li>
    <li> I was very much satisfied with the product, the price and the time of delivery.</li>
    <li> Love this !! Glad I can still find it</li>
    <li> The fragrance is delightful.</li>
    <li> I have all of Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s perfumes and they are my favorite!  This scent is lovely and can be worn for any occasion.  Fifth Avenue is my favorite of all but you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of this collection!</li>
    <li> Very Nice... Very nice... Very nice!!  Very nice.... Very nice! Very Nice. Very Nice. Nice scent. Light and lucious. Can wear everyday.</li>
    <li> Nice perfume great prize and good size bottle.</li>

    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this perfume and receive compliments regularly by others when applied. I became familiar with this product when I smelled it on a person sitting next to me in a waiting room. I immediately purchased this product and continue to be a loyal fan.</li>
    <li> Totally fake do not buy it i was so sad when I open this and realized t was not real as this is my favorite perfume.</li>

    <li> I love it... really wonderfull parfum.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my mom and she has told me that the scent is pretty awesome. She likes it a lot</li>
    <li> This was part of a larger collection of gifts I took back for people traveling 5000 miles away. Not something I was very knowledgable about, I was requested to get these and they were shocked to know how reasonable these were. I&#x27;m glad they got what they wanted, as I wasn&#x27;t sure this was the real deal.</li>
    <li> My Mom loves the scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best Arden perfume for me. I love it, it smells amazing! I always get compliments when I spritz this on.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Have used it for years.  Arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> Seems to become harder and harder to find...but I continue to receive compliments.  Very light, not over powering.  Men love this!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Smells good !</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to scents and perfume additives. This one is one of my favorites. Lovely fragrance, use it every other day as I rotate depending on the event. Definitely does not give me headaches like many others. Soft, clean scent for this 40 year old!</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents! It&#x27;s so inexpanive too! I just brought 3 bottles from here for less then 60$... You can&#x27;t beat that! It&#x27;s gonna last me a long time! Im so excited!!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I have no idea why someone rated it a 1 star. I spray some on and it lasts all day. Even people who hug me at 5 p.m (when I sprayed the perfume at 7 a.m) ask me about the perfume I use and compliment me on the smell. It might be that the person who rated it low might be naturally stinky. I absolutely love this product. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this parfume and believe I got a deal</li>
    <li> The best, just love it</li>
    <li> i THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT IS OKAY. NOT MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE.</li>
    <li> Beautiful feminine scent. I love it, and so does my husband.</li>
    <li> There is something about this fragrance - it&#x27;s so clean and light.  I don&#x27;t know why Arden stopped carrying this in the stores.  It&#x27;s my everyday scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top notes are iris, bergamot, rice flower and green notes; middle notes are orchid, ginger, rhubarb, lotus and lily; base notes are sandalwood, amber and musk.</li>
    <li> this has been my everyday wear perfume for years but i changed to someffin new.Lady gaga fame!.However,while i was making a purchase on amazon recently i stumbled on it again and couldnt resist ordering it!.&lt;br /&gt;lovely long lasting perfume and highly recommended to any lady of taste!.&lt;br /&gt;delivery was very prompt and came 2 days earlier than the scheduled arrival date info.&lt;br /&gt;Am so loving my purchase and gonna stop by and shop at beauty encounter store again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.exactly what my wife wanted.smell is not too strong and it lasts pretty much the whole day.something I will recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews on this product, when I first put it on I had to wonder, what I really thought of it... It took a few minutes to mix with my chemistry but after a few minutes I started to enjoy the scent... After I had it on for part of the morning and clients came into the office I received several compliments on what a pleasant fragrance I was wearing, so... I now have experienced several of Elizabeth Arden fragrance&#x27;s and could kick myself for not trying them earlier on, Thank you Amazon for having them available at a price you can afford to try and experience them at.</li>
    <li> love this gentle smell</li>
    <li> Smells so good. My day perfume</li>
