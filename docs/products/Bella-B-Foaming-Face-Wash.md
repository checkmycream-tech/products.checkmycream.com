      <li>Just started using this product and was pleasantly surprise how gentle it is on my face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy that my skin is clear and I&#x27;m not harming my baby!</li>
      <li>The product is all natural and smells great.</li>
      <li>I feel good about using this product as it seems more natural than a lot of the products out on the store shelves.  </li>
      <li>This face wash saved my life and is very mild and not over drying despite its ability to diminish oil.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it to expectant mothers.</li>
      <li>Although promoted for &amp;#34;pregnant women&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t think that should sway anyone away from trying this product -- I haven&#x27;t been pregnant for years :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for my sensitive skin but also gets the job done!  </li>
      <li>My skin looks fabulous.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight foam, and leaves my face feeling very clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>This site refused to publish my first review, because I mentioned where you can get it for a che@per price and better shipping costs - but I trust that you all can use a search engine.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and washes my makeup off as well.</li>
      <li>So it must be doing something right!</li>
      <li>and it has a nice soft scent.</li>
      <li>I started when preggo and love it so much I still use it.</li>
      <li>It was a mild soap and may be good for you if you dont want all of the extra chemicals in face washes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had acne issues for ages and had been using a prescribed face wash (sodium sulfacetamide), but had to stop using it once I became pregnant.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it while pregnant but its not something I will repurchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would recommend for anyone, pregnant or not.</li>
      <li>As soon as I found out I was pregnant, my face began breaking out.  </li>
      <li>It also lasts very long quantity wise, about 5 or 6 months.</li>
      <li>I wish I had found it for my first!  </li>
      <li>My wife struggles with acne on occasion and has used just about every product under the sun with varying levels of success.  </li>
      <li>far as the brand I love it, I used the other products to prevent stretch marks and just gave this a try since I loved the brand.</li>
      <li>and I know its better for my skin than most other face</li>
      <li>Cleared up my pregnancy breakouts super fast!</li>
      <li>Pregnant and was really optimistic about this product.</li>
      <li>When she became pregnant, we wanted to cut out the harsh chemicals and, honestly, she was lucky to hit up the Bella B first.  </li>
      <li>My skin looked aweful for the first 16 weeks of my pregnancy</li>
      <li>When I first started using this, my acne and oily face didn&#x27;t improve immediately.</li>
      <li>When I first became pregnanct</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that this will be the one I will finally keep as I&#x27;ve gone through many.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very careful now to use products that are safe for my pregnant body.  </li>
      <li>The product kept her face clean and clear while not drying her skin out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had acne prone, dry, and oily skin most of my life.  </li>
      <li>I started using this product when I fell pregnant as my skin became extremely sensitive.</li>
      <li>I used this face wash religiously during the last 6 months of pregnancy and am very glad I did.</li>
      <li>I really like this product &amp; order it</li>
      <li>If you really want something organic than this is the thing for you but for me I can get by with a bar of soap</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think there is much that can be done with pregnancy acne.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>The reason i bought it, because i like Bella B&#x27;s stretch mark prevention products so much, also i got them as gift from my girl friend, she likes them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But overall, I recommend this to everyone looking for a more natural product or ladies with babies.</li>
      <li>When I first got pregnant, I noticed that my face started getting very oily, especially around my forehead.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  This face wash continues to work very well with my skin - I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>It was amazing the difference it made in just a few days!  </li>
      <li>This is the FIRST real product that I&#x27;ve used consistently that has actually produced results.</li>
      <li>Bought it while pregnant, and still using it almost two years later.</li>
      <li>So, I am definitely going to be a loyal customer to this product.</li>
      <li>They haven&#x27;t totally disappeared, but my skin is starting to look much better than before.  </li>
      <li>Once I became pregnant and could no long use benzoyl peroxide, I had to find a new skin care regimen.</li>
      <li>I bought it when I was pregnant to combat a little bit of acne and still use it, two years later :)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The foam is very light and delicate and when I first dispensed it, I thought that the bottle was small and I would end up having to buy more.</li>
      <li>One pump will clean my whole face and neck, so I think one bottle will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>The scent is a little strong, but I&#x27;m very sensitive.</li>
      <li>What a great combination! :(  </li>
      <li>I noticed that my skin would break out more than usual because of all the hormonal changes my body was going through.</li>
      <li>When I first tried it my skin felt no different.</li>
      <li>Pregnancy made my skin extremely oily and the further pregnancy progressed, the more acne I got.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and has a fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Huge let down.</li>
      <li>I use the Bella B Foaming Face Wash along with Belli Acne Control Spot Treatment and find that the products together work just as well, if not better than what I was using before (Acne.org products which were the first thing that really controlled my mild to moderate adult acne).</li>
      <li>it uses natural products.</li>
      <li>The ONLY thing I do not like so much is the smell.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, my face feels smooth, and it seems to have limited or prevented any breakouts.</li>
      <li>I also became very cautious of applying anything to my face that could cause long term damage to my skin, since your body is very sensitive to whatever you use especially during pregnancy.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne issues for ages and had been using a prescribed face wash (sodium sulfacetamide), but had to stop using it once I became pregnant. In looking for a replacement, I tried a couple of gentle/natural alternatives and this was the most effective for me. I&#x27;ve continued using it beyond my pregnancy. I find that one bottle lasts me a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Once I became pregnant and could no long use benzoyl peroxide, I had to find a new skin care regimen. I use the Bella B Foaming Face Wash along with Belli Acne Control Spot Treatment and find that the products together work just as well, if not better than what I was using before (Acne.org products which were the first thing that really controlled my mild to moderate adult acne). I&#x27;m happy that my skin is clear and I&#x27;m not harming my baby!</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty good. Everything else I have tried makes my face breakout like crazy but  this stuff cleared up my face in a few days! I barely get any breakouts now. My only problem is that it leaves my skin dry, so I just use a vitamin e moisturizer. Small price to pay for not looking like a teenager with bad skin. Would recommend this product overall.</li>
    <li> As soon as I found out I was pregnant, my face began breaking out.  I have never had problems with my skin before, but all of a sudden it was horrible.  This was a miracle worker!!  It&#x27;s good for my sensitive skin but also gets the job done!  Will probably keep using this after my pregnancy is over!</li>
    <li> I really like this product &amp; order it all the time.</li>
    <li> The reason i bought it, because i like Bella B&#x27;s stretch mark prevention products so much, also i got them as gift from my girl friend, she likes them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i grade Bella&#x27;s stretch mark product as 5 stars, this one, foaming face wash i would like to grade it as 3 starts. since it has nice smell, and rich foam. but is too \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; for my crazy oily face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a nice product, specially in this price, I&#x27;d like to use it in the morning time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very careful now to use products that are safe for my pregnant body.  I&#x27;ve had acne prone, dry, and oily skin most of my life.  What a great combination! :(  This product works great.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, but I&#x27;m going to stick with it.  One pump will clean my whole face and neck, so I think one bottle will last a long time.  I only wish they made one in travel size.  The 4 ounce bottle is too big for a carry on bag.  That would be my one request from the company.  But overall, I recommend this to everyone looking for a more natural product or ladies with babies.</li>
    <li> Good product, five stars. Organic ingredients, nice scent.</li>
    <li> My wife struggles with acne on occasion and has used just about every product under the sun with varying levels of success.  When she became pregnant, we wanted to cut out the harsh chemicals and, honestly, she was lucky to hit up the Bella B first.  The product kept her face clean and clear while not drying her skin out.  Now that the kids are here, she still uses the product because it works so well and is not as harsh compared to the old stand-by.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  I used it throughout my second pregnancy and barely broke out.  I wish I had found it for my first!  It lasts a long time and has a fresh scent.  It is a great deal for the price.  I have already rrecommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend recommended this product and I have to say it is great!  My skin looks fabulous.  The product is all natural and smells great.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I fell pregnant as my skin became extremely sensitive. I have a combination to oily skin and love this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and was pleasantly surprise how gentle it is on my face. It has a nice smell and has helped with breakouts as well. I strongly recommend it to expectant mothers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for about a week now and I really like it.  I&#x27;m hoping that this will be the one I will finally keep as I&#x27;ve gone through many.  It&#x27;s difficult to find a face wash that really cleans out the pores and gets all the makeup out without over-drying my skin but this one does.  I have combination skin (t-zone oily but am worried about over-drying because I&#x27;m 50 so I have wrinkles too).  I love that this product doesn&#x27;t have any parabens or benzoil peroxide and instead uses tea tree oil.  I&#x27;m a big fan of essential oils and use them for everything.  I feel good about using this product as it seems more natural than a lot of the products out on the store shelves.  Although promoted for &amp;#34;pregnant women&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t think that should sway anyone away from trying this product -- I haven&#x27;t been pregnant for years :)</li>
    <li> LOVE it!  Bought it while pregnant, and still using it almost two years later.</li>
    <li> When I first got pregnant, I noticed that my face started getting very oily, especially around my forehead. I wanted to stay away from benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid so I looked up alternative face washes on Amazon. When I first started using this, my acne and oily face didn&#x27;t improve immediately. I changed my face lotion to cetaphil and then noticed that my acne was drying out and the oil was diminishing. I don&#x27;t have perfect skin but I am in my second trimester now and don&#x27;t get horrible breakouts and nasty cyst like zits anymore. This face wash saved my life and is very mild and not over drying despite its ability to diminish oil. I will continue to use this face wash throughout my pregnancy and probably afterwards.</li>
    <li> Works better than Belli for me..  The scent is a little strong, but I&#x27;m very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my pregnancy breakouts super fast! Love it</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. I bought it when I was pregnant to combat a little bit of acne and still use it, two years later :) I like that it uses natural products. It also lasts very long quantity wise, about 5 or 6 months. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this cleanser. I have oily/combination skin when I&#x27;m not pregnant and when I was, my skin was normal to combination, it was way less oily. This product worked great then and now. It cleans well without over drying. It feels like it sorta soothes my skin as well. Think this may be the tea tree in it. I will be purchasing it for  very long time to come.</li>
    <li> My skin looked aweful for the first 16 weeks of my pregnancy and then I purchased this product.  It was amazing the difference it made in just a few days!  This works wonders. I probably will use it even after I have the baby&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> I gave this four stars because it seems to work. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good (in my opinion) but any sort of relief from this acne is appreciated. My skin still isn&#x27;t what it was before pregnancy, but I went a night and a morning without using it (I usually wash my face at night and in the morning) and I was already starting to break out. So it must be doing something right!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great---still using it post pregnancy.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed at this foam based face cleaner. It doesn&#x27;t smell that great and lacks a density that makes you feel like you&#x27;ve getting clean, which I know is partly because it&#x27;s a foam. Not a fan, though, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
    <li> I used this face wash religiously during the last 6 months of pregnancy and am very glad I did. When I first became pregnanct I noticed that my skin would break out more than usual because of all the hormonal changes my body was going through. I also became very cautious of applying anything to my face that could cause long term damage to my skin, since your body is very sensitive to whatever you use especially during pregnancy. When I first tried it my skin felt no different. Of course, its not a miracle face wash, but after a couple of days of using this I noticed that my skin was clearing up, any pimples and blemishes were drying up faster, and it was improving the overall texture and complexion of my skin. More so, this is great i f you have dreaded combination skin like mine (oily at the T-zone and dry everywhere else). The foam is very light and delicate and when I first dispensed it, I thought that the bottle was small and I would end up having to buy more. I was wrong, a quarter sized squeeze of the foam was enough for my entire face and I only had to purchase this one other time. I am no longer pregnant and still using this, it smells great and I know its better for my skin than most other face washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for anyone, pregnant or not.</li>
    <li> Bought this product after trying BELLI Acne Clearing Facial Wash (which I was disappointed by). Previous to pregnancy, my skin was quite dry and I didn&#x27;t have issues with acne. Pregnancy made my skin extremely oily and the further pregnancy progressed, the more acne I got. I&#x27;ve used this product for 5 days now, no new acne has surfaced, and the current acne is dissipating. It leaves my skin feeling clean and washes my makeup off as well. It leaves my skin on the dryer side (feels a little tight after I wash it) but I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s uncomfortable or problematic. The smell isn&#x27;t great but it&#x27;s a great product so it doesn&#x27;t effect the overall rating.</li>
    <li> My face is typically clear,  however pregnancy resulted in my forehead breaking out with little bumps/pimples.  I&#x27;m grateful to have found this product.  So far, it seems to be working very well, and my little pimples have subsided.  They haven&#x27;t totally disappeared, but my skin is starting to look much better than before.  It&#x27;s a lightweight foam, and leaves my face feeling very clean and fresh.  I would definetly recommend this product to other expecting mothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This face wash continues to work very well with my skin - I highly recommend this product.  :)</li>
    <li> Love this item - it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, my face feels smooth, and it seems to have limited or prevented any breakouts. Will not purcha$e from this company because the only option for shipping was &amp;#34;expedited,&amp;#34; which doubled the cost. This site refused to publish my first review, because I mentioned where you can get it for a che@per price and better shipping costs - but I trust that you all can use a search engine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne and when I got pregnant it got worse. Unfortunately I could no longer use my normal products as I wanted something safe for my baby, so I bought this on a whim with Belli spot treatment. My skin looks better than it ever has please never stop selling this!! I will continue to use both products after baby is born.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the severe pregnancy acne I have. I wouldn&#x27;t say it works all that great but it is safe to use and it has a nice soft scent. I don&#x27;t think there is much that can be done with pregnancy acne. Its hormonal and this isn&#x27;t going to stop it or control it at least it didn&#x27;t for me. I will continue to use it while pregnant but its not something I will repurchase. I&#x27;ll be going back to AcneFree.</li>
    <li> I liked this but it wasnt necessary. If you really want something organic than this is the thing for you but for me I can get by with a bar of soap so it seemed a little expensive for what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brand I love it, I used the other products to prevent stretch marks and just gave this a try since I loved the brand. It was a mild soap and may be good for you if you dont want all of the extra chemicals in face washes.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the wash but it is not a spectacular product if you are trying to see results.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as Belli Anti Blemish facial wash. Caused my face to itch and I had a horrible complexion and breakouts. Had to go back to Belli.</li>
    <li> received product with no plastic seal and a missing cap!  the face wash itself smells horrendous and seems worse in quality to drug store products.</li>
    <li> I have ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE acne. I&#x27;ve had this horrible acne since I was a young teenager, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried got rid of it. I&#x27;ve tried using Proactiv (what a waste of money, I had NO results), Yes to Carrots (again no results), Neutrogena Grapefruit Extract (I had moderate results, but nothing I&#x27;d write home to mom about), AcneFree (no results), Cetaphil (nothing), Clean and Clear Advantage Kit (moderate results), Clinique (nothing), Bare Essentials Face Wash (nada), so as I said, NOTHING  got rid of it. This is the FIRST real product that I&#x27;ve used consistently that has actually produced results. The ONLY thing I do not like so much is the smell. The smell is of cucumbers, which just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. BUT, I will gladly smell all the cucumbers in the world if it means getting rid of my acne. By the way, my acne didn&#x27;t get any less worse when I was pregnant. So, I am definitely going to be a loyal customer to this product. I will definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> The only face wash I use. I started when preggo and love it so much I still use it. Helps with my hormonal acne.</li>
    <li> Broke my face out really bad. Pregnant and was really optimistic about this product. Huge let down.</li>
