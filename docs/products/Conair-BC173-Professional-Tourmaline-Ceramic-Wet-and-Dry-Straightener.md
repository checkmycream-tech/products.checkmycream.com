      <li>I absolutely love this dryer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially great for the current \\&quot;bob\\&quot; hairstyles.  </li>
      <li>My daughter and I love this blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>So glad it&#x27;s still available.</li>
      <li>It is easy to manipulate and you don&#x27;t need to work with a brush.  </li>
      <li>It is extremely easy to use.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I’ve been waiting for a hair dryer like this my whole life!</li>
      <li>So easy and a huge improvement.</li>
      <li>but it did make it nice looking and manageable and so easy and fast to use.</li>
      <li>It suddenly broke and I was so happy to find it again at amazon.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While it was working, it did a fabulous job of straightening out my kinky-curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It was as simple to use as brushing my hair, and was great for straightening the roots of my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is short and it does a great job.</li>
      <li>Very useful tool.</li>
      <li>It works quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>OK, so the dryer doesn&#x27;t perform exactly like the video from Conair suggests.  </li>
      <li>As the owner of the full-size version of this dryer, I was excited to see it in a lighter model as I have some rotator cuff issues.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to master the \\&quot;flip\\&quot; but don&#x27;t really need to.  </li>
      <li>COOL.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t know how it has such good reviews.</li>
      <li>The first one is still working fine after three years of use.</li>
      <li>Well....it dries your hair well and fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>I have wavy (not in a good way) hair that gets frizzy when I blow dry it.</li>
      <li>I pull the hair thru the bristles, kind of an outward motion (not just hold it like a hairbrush and brush down from the top).  </li>
      <li>The only thing that keeps my hair healthy and shiny!  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair that is very prone to frizzing and curling.</li>
      <li>I love this product and would definitely recommend it to others who have shoulder length, fine, wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I have a waivy, really dry kind of hair.</li>
      <li>The first comments I put in on this item were actaully intended for my cell phone accessories ..</li>
      <li>but it does make my hair look pretty sleek</li>
      <li>but I love it anyway and give it five stars because this is the only product I would use because I don&#x27;t have to think about it at all.</li>
      <li>but if you wantto go hotterit does not it is stuck on the first setting</li>
      <li>This one leaves your hair feeling soft, silky and full of body.</li>
      <li>I own a pretty expensive (about $100) ion hair iron and with blow drying on top of that</li>
      <li>After being at the Beach yesterday in humid, misty weather and waking up to a frizzy mess, I just sprayed a little water on my hair, used the Conair, and \\&quot;voila\\&quot;, my hair looked great again!  </li>
      <li>Just in case this current one follows it predecessors, I am glad to see a new source for this product.</li>
      <li>First I get most of the moisture out using my other Conair ceramic tourmaline dryer, then I use this to style.  </li>
      <li>This handy little device has brought me as close as I&#x27;m ever going to get to looking like</li>
      <li>My wavy strands weren&#x27;t perfectly straight.  </li>
      <li>it does NOT make anything straight or close to straight....</li>
      <li>This product eliminated one step in getting ready.</li>
      <li>damaged straight pieces from using it.</li>
      <li>it takes quite awhile to get ready.  </li>
      <li>Rather than return the item I decided to try it out and found I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I sometimes follow up with a straightener on the bangs (as I can&#x27;t get them totally straight with the dryer).</li>
      <li>a whole lot better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This makes it much easier since it holds the hair for me.  </li>
      <li>The lowest heat does absolutely nothing, and the highest temp makes your hair smoke.</li>
      <li>I hold it in one spot for a few seconds, then move to another, kind of scrunching the curl.</li>

    <li> Very useful tool. I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> This product eliminated one step in getting ready. I can dry and straighten my hair in one step. This is the second one I have purchased. The first one is still working fine after three years of use. I just wanted an extra one to leave at my daughter&#x27;s house. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I had a hair designer for years but never used it until just recently.  I began using the dryer daily and it worked great on my curly hair.  It was the only dryer I could use that would straighten my hair and not make it \\&quot;flyaway\\&quot;.  It suddenly broke and I was so happy to find it again at amazon.  I absolutely love this dryer and I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> This blow-dryer is no different than any other blow-dryer. I&#x27;m an African American female with natural coarse Type A hair that goes to my shoulders when wet in it&#x27;s natural state and goes to the middle of my back when straightened.. The are two different heat temperatures, one high and one low and one cold air temp. The lowest heat does absolutely nothing, and the highest temp makes your hair smoke. Now I&#x27;m not saying that this blow-dryer doesn&#x27;t work for other hair types, but for type 4a-4c hair, this blow-dryer is a no no!!!!! This is pretty much like all other cheap blow-dryers, but it makes your hair smoke alot. I tried this blow-dryer on my hair in two different ways, the first way was with product and the second way was without any product in my hair, it was just not right for my hair, because it doesn&#x27;t straighten it. I mean, it stretches the hair out a little when your hair is naturally curly, but by no means does it straighten it. You most definitely would have to use a flat iron on your hair to make it straight. Would i recommend this product to other. Yes, possibly, but not for anyone with type 4a-4c hair. I know it has the capability to do what it&#x27;s suppose to, but only for certain hair types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the not-so-proud owner of an over-processed, burnt to a crisp, deep fried, platinum blond, chin length bob.  I&#x27;ve never been able to get my hair to look as nice as my hair dresser can, not even with my very expensive CHI hair iron.  This handy little device has brought me as close as I&#x27;m ever going to get to looking like I just left the salon.  Makes my hair look like I spent forever styling it, even though it only took a few minutes.  First I get most of the moisture out using my other Conair ceramic tourmaline dryer, then I use this to style.  Works like a charm.  No more frizz and no more struggling with a large round brush and dryer.  Very happy.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> I have never written a product review before but I had to for this straightener.  In three short words-IT REALLY WORKS!! I have baby fine hair that is very prone to frizzing and curling. I bought this straightener and my hair is silky soft, straight and no frizz. I love this product and would definitely recommend it to others who have shoulder length, fine, wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She likes it and she is happy with it.   I recommend you to deal with these people. It has delivered with in 5 days and it has a great condition no damage. Also I have compared the price with other and they were the cheapest :)  Thanks</li>
    <li> It gives my hair more body and seems less damaging than my flat iron.  However, I think the cost is too high.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth or fifth time I have purchased this dryer/straightener.  It works quickly and easily.  My naturally wavy hair is always in a beautifully straight and shiny bob style within less than 10 minutes. The only problem is that I tend to burn the dryer out after about 8-12 mos.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It is easy to manipulate and you don&#x27;t need to work with a brush.  It is light weight  and easy to hold, and you can use it with wet or dry hair.  I would recommend this product for anyone wanting to straighten their hair. It&#x27;s great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I own a pretty expensive (about $100) ion hair iron and with blow drying on top of that it takes quite awhile to get ready.  Was hoping this would do the job in half the time.  Well....it dries your hair well and fairly quickly. My hair just has a little wave and that was still there for the most part.  No shine like the iron gives you and the frizzy top layer was only tamed a little. That&#x27;s about it.  Save the 50 bucks and put it toward a GOOD ion iron.</li>
    <li> As the owner of the full-size version of this dryer, I was excited to see it in a lighter model as I have some rotator cuff issues. I bought it &amp; found it did a great job on drying and straightening my hair - until it burned out within a year. I bought it again &amp; buried that within a year too. Now, we are working on #3. Prior this bad boy, I have never had a hair dryer burn out.Just in case this current one follows it predecessors, I am glad to see a new source for this product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair dryer/straightener! I had an older one that broke and I was lost until I got my new one. I can&#x27;t style my hair without it!</li>
    <li> this s*** is wack DONT SPEND UR MONEY NOT WORTH IT TOATAL WASTE OF MONEY I GOT ONE FROM WALMART THAT WORKED WAY BETTER</li>
    <li> This Conair Wet/Dry straightener is the only tool I have found to quickly straighten and smoothe my hair.  I depend on it daily, and when I decided I needed an extra one for my travel bag, I found I found it on Amazon for half the price I paid for the original.  Good deal and great product.</li>
    <li> This product causes my hair to frizz and causes fly-a-ways. Sending product back. I was so hoping it would work, but did not.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the purchase.  Works equally well on wet or dry hair.  My hair is short and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> The BEST hair dryer and de-frizzer out there! This is my second one (nothing lasts forever) and I hunted all over to find it. So glad it&#x27;s still available. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she said it made her hair more frizzy, and she promptly returned it, and I was able to get a refund.</li>
    <li> Very nice helps straighten hair.....</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this blow dryer.  It helps straighten hair without having to use to much heat as a regular straightener would.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> my daughter hated to blow dry her hair, once I got this product it made life a whole lot better.&lt;br /&gt;I have no issues with the product, convenient for drying hair while excessively wet.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong, I even bought a second one for my niece</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener, and now it&#x27;s all I use after I shampoo and condition my hair. It&#x27;s quite easy to manipulate, and it really gets my long bangs straight.  Before I was using a round brush and hair dryer, but the Conair Ceramic Straightener does it all.  After being at the Beach yesterday in humid, misty weather and waking up to a frizzy mess, I just sprayed a little water on my hair, used the Conair, and \\&quot;voila\\&quot;, my hair looked great again!  This is the best item I&#x27;ve discovered, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this styling tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, it is perfect for coarser hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was not frizzy or out of control after using it. It works wonders! To be honest, I’ve been waiting for a hair dryer like this my whole life! Simply amazing! Well worth the investment!!!</li>
    <li> I was actually searching for a Normal Blow dryer and found this product instead. After reading couple of reviews, i decided to give it a try. I have a waivy, really dry kind of hair. Although, it doesn&#x27;t work like a flat Iron Hair Straightener, it does make your hair dry fast and makes your hair look neat and straight. I am really happy with Conair BC173 Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Wet &amp; Dry Straightener. The best thing about this product is it is really easy to use. You could save lot of time. !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit when I ordered this item I thought I was getting a \\&quot;straightener\\&quot; with ceramic plates not a hairdryer.  I don&#x27;t think I read things closely enough.  So I was shocked to open a hairdryer of sorts.  Rather than return the item I decided to try it out and found I really like it.  I used to blowdry my hair and then use a straightening iron.  The blowdying used to be a workout for my arms, especially when my curly hair was really long (currently it is almost shoulder length when it is curly and I have fairly tight curls).  This makes it much easier since it holds the hair for me.  Which brings me to the reason for the four-star rating:  It doesn&#x27;t always hold the hair snuggly enough and I usually have to have a light grasp on my hair to guide it through.  Also, I usually have to go over my hair lightly with a ceramic plate flatiron to smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Botttom line is that it is not a perfect system for me but much easier than my old system.  I do recommend this product because overall my experience has been unexpectedly positive.</li>
    <li> I bought my first one a few years ago.  Used it almost every day.  Finally the cord had problems and I had to junk it for safety issues.  Using my second one now and wanted to have one on hand in case they quit making them.  I have course, curly hair in a short style. I use it to dry my bangs and around my face.  I pull the hair thru the bristles, kind of an outward motion (not just hold it like a hairbrush and brush down from the top).  It loosens up the curl.  I dry the rest of my hair with it by just holding it against my head.  I hold it in one spot for a few seconds, then move to another, kind of scrunching the curl. (I use some mousse before I start.)  I keep going till my hair is just a little damp here and there. I sometimes follow up with a straightener on the bangs (as I can&#x27;t get them totally straight with the dryer). I think it would take a lot of time to dry long hair with this dryer.  I have never loved my hair, but this dryer helps me manage it better than I could before.</li>
    <li> So this depends on what you are looking for. If you are willing to spend hours a day making yourself look perfect, this is probably not the product for you.  I&#x27;m very busy and don&#x27;t have the time or patience to spend alot of time on my hair, and for that purpose this is the ideal product. It is extremely easy to use. I have wavy thick frizzy hair (so really tough to make manageable) and this product didn&#x27;t make my hair shiny and straight but it did make it nice looking and manageable and so easy and fast to use. Perfect for somebody who normally doesn&#x27;t bother doing anything and just throws their hair in a bun. So easy and a huge improvement. I usually use it when I&#x27;m reading because it takes so little effort it doesn&#x27;t distract me at all.  Not perfect but I love it anyway and give it five stars because this is the only product I would use because I don&#x27;t have to think about it at all. Perfect for somebody who does not prioritize styling but would like the results anyway. And maybe if your hair wasn&#x27;t quite as unmanageable as mine, it would leave it perfect</li>
    <li> Great for straight styles.  Some irons are too hot, and leave your hair looking dry and brittle.  This one leaves your hair feeling soft, silky and full of body.</li>
    <li> I am an African American w/ natural 4b kinky curly hair &amp; I have NEVER been able to blowdry my hair without it feeling brittle and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This styler has been heaven sent. I purchased it for around $30.00 from an Amazon seller back in September 2012. ((Now I see that the price has TRIPLED through Amazon-- no bueno)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with all the reviewers that said that it does not straighten like a flat iron.. but thats not the reason I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my styler weekly on low/medium heat to stretch out my hair after washing and deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no split ends or heat damaged straight pieces from using it. I need to sell or give away my EXPENSIVE Chi rocket blowdryer because it is useless to me now.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for years and loved it. I have wavy (not in a good way) hair that gets frizzy when I blow dry it. I use it to take out alot of the friz and waves before I straighten it. It also does a great job at adding volume and it can curl too. My old one died and so I tried to get a new one... discontinued. I ended up finally finding one on Amazon and gladly paid probably two and a half times what I paid for the origional one. If you can find one, I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wife is happy about this product and she uses it regularly without any complaint. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have not been as happy with a hair dryer since the schick styling stick. You don&#x27;t need a brush or comb. It is all you need to dry and style your hair - one tool. COOL.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law said it works great!  I love it, I told my sisters and friends that they should get one.</li>
    <li> Ihave thin fine wavy hair.  I am not very experienced with a straightener.  I found that this did not dry well &amp; my hiar was quite frizzy.  This was evern with use of quality products.  Not what I would have expected.</li>
    <li> This dries out my hair, does not dry fast at all. I can do it in half the time with the blow dryer. it does NOT make anything straight or close to straight.... i don&#x27;t know how it has such good reviews.</li>
    <li> OK, so the dryer doesn&#x27;t perform exactly like the video from Conair suggests.  My wavy strands weren&#x27;t perfectly straight.  I didn&#x27;t get any extra shine than I didn&#x27;t already have.  Because of that, I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 start rating.  With that said, I am glad I purchased this little baby because it is so much easier to use than holding a brush and and a dryer both.  If you are plagued with arthritis in your hands, I suggest you give this a try!</li>
    <li> The first comments I put in on this item were actaully intended for my cell phone accessories .. Sorry but I got my boxes confused. This item came perfect t and very quickly just as it was suppose to.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these about 3 years ago and it finally stopped working after everyday use for all that time. I paid about $50 for it. When I went for a replacement I could not find it anywhere. I was so happy I found it here at Amazon at more that 1/2 of what I paid with free shipping. I have short very wavy hair and this straightener smooths it out leaving it shiny and soft in the process. I will probably buy another one as an additional back up at this price.</li>
    <li> I purchased the conair infiniti about 3 weeks ago and love it.  I have used it almost every day since purchasing.  I&#x27;ve had lots of compliments on my hairstyle since I&#x27;ve been using the infiniti.  I actually had to take it to work to show other women.  Several of my coworkers purchased the product after seeing how it works.  I&#x27;m not young and my hair is thinning, but tends to get frizzy after blow drying.  No more!!  The infiniti gives me very smooth shiny hair.  I&#x27;m a klutz and this appliance is very easy to use.  I have not been able to master the \\&quot;flip\\&quot; but don&#x27;t really need to.  I would recommend this product to anyone with short to medium length hair.  It&#x27;s especially great for the current \\&quot;bob\\&quot; hairstyles.  This is the best hair appliance I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> it dries my hair very quickly(i have short  fine hair) and has tremendously  cut down on the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;The package did not look brand new but maybe  it was  old stock.</li>
    <li> I have used this item for years. I was afraid that I would not be able to find to purchase again after so many years and was very please that I found it on Amazon. In fact I purchased 2 so I have a back up down road. In the 10+ years that I have used this item this is my 3rd and 4th purchase so they do last a while. I use it every single day.</li>
    <li> I like this item because I&#x27;m very impatient when it comes to drying my hair, which is almost waist length, and I hate having to dry it completely to straighten it out. That said, I don&#x27;t have particularly frizzy hair, so I don&#x27;t know how it works on a really, really, really bad hair day ... but it does make my hair look pretty sleek (when my arm doesn&#x27;t tire out from separating it into small sections ... which hairdressers in the know you recommend you do). Then again, hairdressers have more muscles and arm strength than I do ....</li>
    <li> i had one before but this one has three setting but if you wantto go hotterit does not it is stuck on the first setting but it still works nice</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought this product about six months ago.... Product just stopped working yesterday for unknown reason...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not durable&lt;br /&gt;The product does not dry very wet and thick hair very well.... Unless you wait for half hour until most of the dampness in your hair is naturally gone.&lt;br /&gt;Works effectively only on slightly damp hair&lt;br /&gt;NOT a durable product.... Just stops working after a few uses....This product is not worth its cost I am currently looking for some other less costly product that will do the job... Any suggestions?????</li>
    <li> i have frizzy hair by nature and this is a great tool to smooth them out.  I use it more as a styler after I&#x27;ve blown dry to barely damp and then out comes the conair.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I had one of these that lasted for about four years, and then one day it gave up the ghost.  So I bought another one.  It died within weeks.  So I bought another one.  It lasted about eight months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it was working, it did a fabulous job of straightening out my kinky-curly hair.  It was never smooth enough to forgo the flat iron, but was a vast improvement over my blow dryer-round brush skills.  It was as simple to use as brushing my hair, and was great for straightening the roots of my hair.  The tension controls never made any difference to my results.  I&#x27;ll miss this styler for it&#x27;s ease of use, but I think I need to upgrade to something more durable.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item in the past... the only problem is that the device tends to heat up quickly causing smoking smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U0ISV8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title.</li>
    <li> The only thing that keeps my hair healthy and shiny!  Styles are great too.  Recommend to anyone looking for something that gives you beautiful hair.</li>
