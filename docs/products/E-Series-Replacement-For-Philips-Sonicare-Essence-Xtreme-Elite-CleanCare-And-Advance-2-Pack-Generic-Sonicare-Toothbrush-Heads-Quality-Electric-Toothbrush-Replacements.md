      <li>so I went to my favorite store, Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use and much more effective than I&#x27;ve found flossing to be.</li>
      <li>whereas my brushing experience was quite pleasant with the name brand, this is not as much.</li>
      <li>Bite the bullet, spend a bit more money and buy the original sonic head replacement for your brush.</li>
      <li>These heads came promptly, are easily put on,good value for money.</li>
      <li>The vibration doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as the sonicare brand.  </li>

      <li>Look the same,they fit the tooth brush.  </li>

      <li>they look nothing like the original heads.</li>
      <li>The first time they were better than the retail versions.</li>
      <li>Works just like the original.  </li>
      <li>No difference from the original head</li>
      <li>I did not notice it to be any noisier than the original brand name head.  </li>
      <li>Worth buying!</li>
      <li>Not as the original brush head.</li>
      <li>His gums were bleeding around 1/3 of his teeth, the plaque build-up tests for one-week old plaque and 24-hour plaque were astounding.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  They work fine.</li>
    <li> OK product.  I would not recommend.  Spend the money and get the good ones.  These are extremely loud, and they do not work properly.</li>
    <li> They brush well but they rattle making an annoying sound while brushing.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper than the store and works great.</li>
    <li> Just as predicted;  a wonderful buy and would purchase again.. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> They work but the feel is different. The brushes are harsh and the noise is annoying. The activating magnets are smaller. I have zero confidence that they are producing the desired sonic vibration. Instead, it is a rattle. I will not buy them again.</li>
    <li> Great generic product</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference between the OEM and these. Sound the same, feel the same, look the same. Used for a few weeks now and they are just fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only tip is always take them off and rinse them daily!</li>
    <li> I have been using my first one of these for a few weeks now, and it works just like the original so far.  I did not notice it to be any noisier than the original brand name head.  The bristles seem the same stiffness and have not fallen out.  For the money, I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 packs of this. After 3 months, I am already up to the 4th head unfortunately:  - First one: it lasts 2 months without any problems. I switched to a new one prematurely before my holiday trip.  - Second one: it only lasts 2 weeks, then it suddenly lost of power. Feels like the sensitive mode -- but that&#x27;s extra sensitive I bet.  - Third one: vibration is weak even though it&#x27;s brand new. I have to throw it away after 3 days.  - Fourth one: so far so good. But this time I have lower expectation -- hopefully it could last as long as the first one.  I would stick with the genuine brush heads in the future.</li>
    <li> My first one or even two star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are times on amazon lately where I&#x27;m left scratching my head over inflated reviews.  These are terrible in all respects.  Ridiculously loud, I know that&#x27;s subjective but all 4 of mine are nowhere near the tolerable noise level of the OEM heads.  Tons of vibration through the handle.  Unquestionably less effective - if you apply too much pressure the bristles can become stationary (no pulsing).  Tucked away in the glowing reviews on these I read they looked like factory seconds- they look nothing like the original heads.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted at a reasonable price. Will be buying more as/when needed...</li>
    <li> Good replacement and cheap price!</li>
    <li> Amazing. better than the real thing :-)!!!!</li>
    <li> These are great! I found them to be just as good as the Sonicare replacement brushes. They are WELL WORTH the money which is 1/4 of the price.....a no brainer. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Only got 3 brush heads in the package that said it was 4.</li>
    <li> These generic toothbrush replacements are great. They fit onto my unit perfectly and get the job done. Last but not least, the price was much cheaper than buying original Sonic toothbrush replacements. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I will NEVER purchase the originals. These work just as good and actually seem to last LONGER than the eseries. Only regret is that I did not find these sooner.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly and seem fine.</li>
    <li> it fits the handle but, not too well, bought the four pack and they all do the same thing..tried it with a different handle...same thing..makes an excessive rattling noise..i would not order them again..</li>
    <li> Crap . Rolled the dice thinking how bad can they be . That bad . Noisy, inefficient, mushy bristles .&lt;br /&gt;Save yer dough</li>
    <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the originals as far as performance. The only thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s a little louder due to possibly a lesser fit with battery, but a tighter squeeze when tightening will suffice.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product!  I thought I would save some money by doing so and am horribly disappointed. The first thing I noticed was the head is difficult to screw in and have the head lined up with the on/off button. Then the noise it makes is horrible. Loud, loud, loud. And the brush head does not vibrate and move like the originals. I threw all four away. What a disaster. Please do NOT waste your money. Bite the bullet, spend a bit more money and buy the original sonic head replacement for your brush. Big sigh on my end. Tried to save money and lost out.</li>
    <li> Low quality, does not clean the same as original.</li>
    <li> I purchased these only to make me really appreciate the original sonic care replacements I&#x27;m surprised to hear so much good comments. It must be a bad batch that I received cause it rattles so much.</li>
    <li> These were not the same brush heads as I had.  The magnets were smaller and abutted each other, which made the worst noise.  The seller promptly took them back.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Packaging was great and the product arrived on time.  Not very happy with the product itself due to the loud vibration.</li>
    <li> Great value but a little noisier than the real deal</li>
    <li> Great price and seem better than the originals although a bit noisy.  Not sure about durability yet.</li>
    <li> Made the soniccare VERY  loud.  Bristles are also different than original- doesn&#x27;t fit to the teeth as well.  On the other hand -  low price!</li>
    <li> much too loud when running. brush was ok</li>
    <li> I read these reviews and decided to give them a try. They are, as at least one reviewer noted, LOUD. They felt a little different, stiffer or harder as other reviewers also noted. But we kept using them. Today, after using these for approximately two months, my other half had a dentist appointment. We changed nothing else about our dental hygiene. We are both inveterate flossers and have had stellar dental reviews over the past 10+ years. He also has some gum disease that had been under control since we started using the SoniCare system. He called after the routine cleaning (with the hygienist he&#x27;s been seeing since 1994) to say that we needed to chuck these. His gums were bleeding around 1/3 of his teeth, the plaque build-up tests for one-week old plaque and 24-hour plaque were astounding. She asked if we had been securing them down tightly, and we had, so her advice was to use the new brushes to clean grout. I ordered new OEM brush heads today.</li>
    <li> Works great and price is very reasonable compared to the brand name of Sonic.</li>
    <li> Loud and excessive vibration.</li>
    <li> They make a really, really loud noise when brushing. Can wake up the house. Doesn&#x27;t feel like the brush head moves.</li>
    <li> I have bought these toothbrush heads twice. The first time they were better than the retail versions. This time they&#x27;re so much a waste of money it&#x27;s laughable. They make a horrible buzzing noise, they don&#x27;t clean your teeth. It&#x27;s obvious nobody even tested them against the originals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good ones have lids that slip over the top, the bad ones have lids that push on from the front.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on the Oral B E-series</li>
    <li> Seems to make the toothbrush noiser whne using</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like the OEM part.  Sometimes it would stop vibrating and you had to turn off the toothbrush and turn it back on.  Would stay away from these.</li>
    <li> exactly as claimed,will buy again,good as original mfg</li>
    <li> These brushes are so loud when attached to my sonicare elite.  I don&#x27;t think they work as well, either.  The vibration doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as the sonicare brand.  I would beware of the product reviews as well, as I feel that some of these reviews were paid for.</li>
    <li> Best find ever. Works just like name brand but way better than the generics you can buy from the store.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both used each.  It made so loud of a noise that it woke me up when she used it in the bathroom next door!!  Mine was slightly better.  I don&#x27;t even think it is doing any &#x27;sonic&#x27; brushing...  So I decided to replace mine with the 3rd one.  It is perfect so far.  The sound is smooth and I feel the sonic difference brushing on my teeth.  The 4th one will be a mystery...  I think I will go back to the genuine pack paying a bit more after that.</li>
    <li> these heads do not fit my Sonic.  ANNOYING!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have to return them</li>
    <li> Unlike the native brush that came with the product, these replacements are extremely loud when used. They brush fine, but I wish it didn&#x27;t sound like I was using a Weed Whip in my house..</li>
    <li> good value; works great</li>
    <li> I had one in the pack that worked very well, but the rest were weak in their pulsation and LOUD!</li>
    <li> These work as well as the OEM version except they&#x27;re a bit noisier. That was my reason for only three stars. They&#x27;re being used by two family members and both of their auto brushes are louder than before. Bristles are soft enough to offer a comfortable experience. Price was decent in comparison to others.</li>
    <li> It sort of fits, I can use it.</li>
    <li> work fine. a good deal.</li>
    <li> Feels exactly like the original Philipps brush head, but I can see the tightness is different. This one fits in the toothbrush tighter, making it harder to clean the gap between the brushhead and the base. Not sure if I want to keep using them though.</li>
    <li> I bought these before from this vendor and they worked well. However it looks like these brushes now come from another source since the inside looks different. They barely vibrated and made a ton of noise. I returned the brushes. these were simply awful.</li>
    <li> They fit well, they clean well but they make a very loud noise when working.</li>
    <li> they do just as good but they are loud</li>
    <li> best price affords more convenient replacing to have more effective cleaning.</li>
    <li> Look the same,they fit the tooth brush.  hopefully they last a good long time. They&#x27;re about a quarter of the price.</li>
    <li> Garbage, just gargbage.</li>
    <li> A little loud but work great</li>
    <li> Good to be able to purchase replacement heads for my Philips E series which I really love! These heads came promptly, are easily put on, and continue to keep my teeth cleaner than they could ever be with manual toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> I could not find a replacement head for my Phillips tooth brush locally so I went to my favorite store, Amazon. I received the replacements within two days and they fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Fit my toothbrush perfectly. Quick shipping and great price.</li>
    <li> First of all, the brushes we received are NOT the brushes shown in the image for this product. Second, they rattle quite loudly and feel cheap. I would not buy them again.</li>
    <li> VERY noisy; VERY harsh brushing action.  I am returning them.</li>
    <li> These are the noisiest brushes I have ever had. I feel like my entire head is vibrating. It makes 2 minutes of brushing time a LONG two minutes. Other than that, they are soft and nice.  Would not buy them again</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t have the color changing blue bristles that tell you when it&#x27;s ready to change, but works just as well.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are not the same quality as the name brand. They seem to be louder and not brush as well but they do work somewhat. I&#x27;ll probably buy the name brand next time. If you&#x27;re looking to save a buck, go ahead and get these but know they aren&#x27;t as good as the original E Series.</li>
    <li> Works great with my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly.  It will screw on with some maneuvering but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get off.  I have to enlist my son&#x27;s muscle since we share the same base and switch out the heads.  Because it doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s brushing as hard as the genuine replacements.  It may just be that I&#x27;m used to the power, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to vibrate with the same intensity.  Again maybe I&#x27;m just desensitized.</li>
    <li> Product are as described</li>
    <li> These brush heads work as well as the name brand for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t feel exactly the same in my mouth, but perfect for the price point.</li>
    <li> they are as good as the brand name and a little less pricey. i would buy again.</li>
    <li> They are just what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> DID NOT RECEIVE THE  REPLACEMNT BRUSHES  WITH MY ORDER</li>
    <li> They fit but don&#x27;t seem as good as the retail version. The plastic seems to rattle more and less vibration at bristles, tried 2 and same result.</li>
    <li> As good as I expected. Worth buying!</li>
    <li> It turn pink don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> These are great-much better than the Equate ones I tried last time, they fit, are quiet and very powerful. I will be buying these from now on. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These work great. They look identical to the actual replacement heads and work perfect. These are awesome for half the price.</li>
    <li> Brushes caused tooth brush to be extremely noisy. Usable but not good. Eli</li>
    <li> These are a great value and do exactly what they say they will.  These heads rattle way more than the name brand heads. The sound is louder and a little annoying but nothing you can&#x27;t live with.  I&#x27;ve only used one so far, so maybe this head is a little defective.  Either way, they do the job at a better price.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush heads work perfect for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Actually better than I thought</li>
    <li> I bought this product and using it for last 3 months and OMG! I am free from yellowish teeth. I am so pleased with the improvement! It&#x27;s quick and easy to use and much more effective than I&#x27;ve found flossing to be. Moreover I found this product very economical. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> They are great and would of gotten 5 starts but the band&#x27;s were all the same color so we had to use nail polish to identify whose is which brush.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are excellent! I too was disheartened by the high price of the OEM brush heads from Philips and embarked on a quest to find a cheaper alternative. My journey led me to Walmart which had the Equate brand that I prefer not to talk about. Then on to the Target brand whose brush heads would rattle so loud I could not brush my teeth if the baby was asleep! On to these, which match the Target brand in price but excel in quality. I did not experience the &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; odor mentioned in other reviews, but I can say that these must be slight rejects from the Philips factory. They are as quiet as the originals and brush with the same vigor. And with that my journey ended with much success!&lt;br /&gt;You can try the store brands but I will swear by these.</li>
    <li> It is very loud compared to the original heads. Sounds cheap but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great product and supplier!!!</li>
    <li> very nice item.  works great.  excellent price.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about buying a generic product for my Phillips toothbrush. However, I am truly amazed that I feel no difference. It works just as good as the brand name. I will definitely use these all the time. Great product and excellent price! A bonus for me was that the seller mailed it right away. Got mine in a couple of days. Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying replacement Brush Heads for 12 years. This was the best price I  ever got for this product. .</li>
    <li> Everything was great - thanks much.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads fit the toothbrush base however that is all they do. The toothbrush heads are just regular toothbrush heads and do not serve the purpose of suitable replacements.</li>
    <li> These heads came promptly, are easily put on,good value for money.</li>
    <li> These generic heads are perfectly functional, and a great price, but they are at least FOUR times as loud as the OEM heads. I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
    <li> I paid for a cheap imitation and that is exactly what I got.  The brushes are OK but not worth the saving over the brand product.</li>
    <li> Pay a little extra for the real thing. I had to send mine back. THEY ARE NOT WHAT YOU SEE IN THE IMAGE! Cheap,films, tiny brush heads. Hardly fit properly. I must say though, returning them was a smooth process....thanks to Amazon!</li>
    <li> does not work quite the same as the name brand. the brushes have a more &#x27;generic&#x27; feel to them. also, it&#x27;s a much harder vibration than the name brand brush head. whereas my brushing experience was quite pleasant with the name brand, this is not as much. I find myself watching the clock and counting down the time when I use this. still, they do their job (so far).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews… These things are LOUD!!  I am hoping that I don&#x27;t get woken up by them..they do work and are cheaper if you don&#x27;t mind it being super loud then a good purchas.</li>
    <li> These are just as good as Sonicare replacement brushes for less than half the cost.</li>
    <li> Terrible replacements! The vibration and noise is so loud feels like you have a chainsaw in your hand - you need ear plugs to brush your teeth. Tried changing different brushes but they are all too loud for comfort.  What a waste of money!!</li>
    <li> They are very loud, will be spending the extra money next time I buy tooth brushes</li>
    <li> Am on the 2nd of the four I purchased and am very happy with the product.  Can not tell any difference from factory brush and a lot less expensive.  Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Work GREAT!! No difference from the original head I love the price!</li>
    <li> My biggest qualm with this product is the noise.  Someone three rooms away said that it sounded like I was running a sander in the bathroom.  The OEM heads are rather quiet in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;Though these heads sound like they are far more powerful, they seem to do a far worse job.  I think these heads even have less of a range of motion.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using one these for about three weeks now and I am purchasing OEM and throwing out the three I have not used.</li>
    <li> Generic is right!!!! Too noisy and does not clean as well as Phillips brand. I would not recommend to anyone to buy these. SPend the money on better ones.</li>
    <li> I have been using one brush out of the four so far.  It is noisier than my old Sonicare, non-generic brushes, but I don&#x27;t know if all the generic brushes will be noisier.  The brush cleans well, like the non-generic brush.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my wife.... she says they are just as good as the originals</li>
    <li> Works just like the original.  Enjoyed the fact that they were delivered quickly.  Definitely has helped my dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Loudest pieces of junk.  So loud my husband almost threw my toothbrush away while I slept.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are excellent! They are cheap, easy to use and much comfortable than the other similar products. These don’t make noise. My teeth feel stronger, cleaner and leaves my mouth fresh. It saves my money and time. They are as quiet as the originals. These are great! Just buy and enjoy it!</li>
    <li> Nice comfortable bristles, but very loud compared to the original motorized brush.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than going $50 of 2-3 heads for name brand sonicare.  They almost look identical.  No complaints here they work and that is all that matters to me.</li>
    <li> Bleh. I&#x27;m so sick of getting generic replacement heads that make so much noise I&#x27;m afraid to brush my teeth while the baby sleeps. The heads rattle so loud and don&#x27;t work as well. I&#x27;m never buying generics again as far as these stupid tooth brush heads go. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought generics and this has happened- rattling, loud noise and not as good clean. Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re time or money with a return. I have prime so I&#x27;m not as ticked as I would have been if I paid for all this outright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if for some reason you feel compelled to buy these- they came quickly and packaged safely. Just wish they weren&#x27;t so horrible.</li>
    <li> Bristles where not as good quality as name brand</li>
    <li> Very noisy,  vibrates too much. Stick with the name brand. Missing an extra gasket or something that sonic gives with their heads</li>
    <li> Not as the original brush head. Got soft very quickly.</li>
    <li> Very noisy and less vibration.</li>
    <li> these are not the same as the oem and branded items.  These are so freaking loud and make an insane buzzing sound that my kids can hear in the basement.  Seriously, unless you have earplugs... I would strongly advise you spend the 2-3 extra dollars and upgrade to the real e series replacements. Nightmare.</li>
    <li> They are very loud and vibration shows up more in handle than in brush. Very disappointed in them, will not buy again. Name brand beats these hands down.</li>
