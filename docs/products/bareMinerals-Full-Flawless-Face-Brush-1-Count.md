      <li>This is a great brush especially for a travel cosmetic bag.  </li>
      <li>Goes on like light powder.  </li>
      <li>Fluffy, fabulous, flawless brush.</li>
      <li>After watching commercials, was excited to try this makeup and brush.  </li>
      <li>Good price, like it a lot, better than other brand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>In both cases the brushes do not really have a great life.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend this to anyone wanting full coverage.  </li>
      <li>I had one before, lost it, and tried several others, but have not found one as good as this.</li>
      <li>So glad I was able to find this at a cheaper price but with the same quality</li>
      <li>Its very durable, and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Quick shipment and product was as described.</li>
      <li>Very durable, made well, and my powder goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Worth the $12.00 compared to $20 something...</li>
      <li>Arrived quick, and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>They as super soft, last a really long time and cleanup perfectly.</li>
      <li>Love Bare Minerals.  </li>
      <li>The product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was user error and tried a different brush and got a better over-all result when applying the powder.</li>
      <li>Like I said it is not a fake</li>
      <li>Exactly as said.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>When you first start using the brush</li>
      <li>I am still using the brush because it is really soft and gives great coverage for the first few months.</li>
      <li>I have never really found a foundation powder brush that I thought was worth splurging on, but this brush is everything and more.</li>
      <li>Most of the brushes I have seen have really short handles on them, this one is longer and the bristles are very soft and don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
      <li>I clean the brush often with bare minerals brush conditioning shampoo.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The brush arrived so fast.  </li>
      <li>Man, this brush sheds SO much-</li>
      <li>This is the same exact brush I already had that had worn out tremendously.  </li>
      <li>The brush washes really well with shampoo and conditioner and dries just as soft as it was the first day.  </li>
      <li>When I first purchased bareMinerals foundation, I opt to get the starter kit complimentary with three different brushes.</li>
      <li>I am giving it a 4 because this brush will last less than a year with good cleaning and starts to shed about months in.</li>
      <li>Great brush for applying loose powder but the bristles begin falling out after just a few months of using it.</li>
      <li>perfectly soft and doesn&#x27;t loose many fibers</li>
      <li>It ensures even application everytime and allows me to build more or less coverage as needed.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY brush in my huge collection of brushes that plays well with bare mineral products.  </li>
      <li>This is the second one of these brushes I&#x27;ve bought- the last one is still going strong after two years-</li>
      <li>Sometimes a hair or two will free itself from the brush and get into my eye, but other than that it&#x27;s perf.</li>
      <li>It is very soft.</li>
      <li>My only advice would be to keep this, or any brush, cleaned and conditioned regularly and it will easily last a year or more without sacrificing quality.</li>
      <li>I have bought this brush from them multiple times and every time the delivery is on time and the product is exactly what it should be.</li>
      <li>The first big issue is the shedding.</li>
      <li>Those are both two pretty big design flaws in my opinion; however, the fact that the brush is so inexpensive allows me to have no problem buying a replacement when this happens.</li>
      <li>It is really soft.</li>
      <li>I went into the Bare Minerals store and the same product was priced higher.</li>
      <li>I have been using bare minerals products for over 7 years now and am extremely brand loyal.</li>
      <li>Holds just enough powder, is very soft, and it hasn&#x27;t lost ANY bristles!  </li>
      <li>so currently I just keep buying new ones every 4-5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Quick shipment and product was as described.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY brush in my huge collection of brushes that plays well with bare mineral products.  It ensures even application everytime and allows me to build more or less coverage as needed.  I appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to switch brushes to use the mineral veil after the foundation.</li>
    <li> Exactly as said. Love the product and I SUGGEST bareMinerals to anyone!</li>
    <li> One of the best make up brushes I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Meh. The quality of the brush is not comparable to the brushes you get from the actual store. The bristles are not soft and did not distribute product as it should. I thought it was user error and tried a different brush and got a better over-all result when applying the powder.</li>
    <li> The coverage is great, it can be as sheer as you want. This foundation never feels heavy.</li>
    <li> Brushes seem to last about 4-6 months.  They do break down because of the recommended method for using the Bare Minerals makeup.</li>
    <li> The brush sheds it bristes</li>
    <li> The brush is so soft and works really well with both my bare minerals loose powder foundation and my bare minerals compact foundation.  It covers evenly and isn&#x27;t scratchy on my skin.  This is the second one of these brushes I&#x27;ve bought- the last one is still going strong after two years- and I bought this one so I&#x27;d have two when traveling and could keep one at home.  The brush washes really well with shampoo and conditioner and dries just as soft as it was the first day.  Will continue to buy these in future.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and very soft</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been using bare minerals products for over 7 years now and am extremely brand loyal. However, this brush sheds an insane amount of tiny &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; during each use and I am very disappointed. I don&#x27;t remember having this problem with any of my previous brushes, maybe I&#x27;m unlucky and just got a bad one?</li>
    <li> I had one before, lost it, and tried several others, but have not found one as good as this. It&#x27;s bristles are dense and really soft, when I&#x27;m applying loose powder they don&#x27;t irritate my face as others do.  The gentleness allows me to really distribute the powder evenly, other brushes I don&#x27;t want to rub on my face as they hurt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bare Minerals brushes for a few years and I really like them. Very durable, made well, and my powder goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> The bristles have fallen out on me. It does give good coverage, though! Worth the $12.00 compared to $20 something...</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I have never really found a foundation powder brush that I thought was worth splurging on, but this brush is everything and more. It holds the powder and it keeps everything even on my face.</li>
    <li> Great for my Bare Minerals  powders.Holds just enough powder, is very soft, and it hasn&#x27;t lost ANY bristles!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work out but Amazon was great</li>
    <li> Just like the ones you buy in the store but way better pricing. I love it! Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Fluffy, fabulous, flawless brush. I use it for Bare Minerals.Sometimes a hair or two will free itself from the brush and get into my eye, but other than that it&#x27;s perf.</li>
    <li> Great Price, real product. I went into the Bare Minerals store and the same product was priced higher. They wouldn&#x27;t price match, so I bought this one. Great deal!</li>
    <li> It arrived with the handle broken off, I decided to use it anyways cause I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning. However, almost immediately bristles from the brush started falling out. It is very soft.</li>
    <li> It sheds all over my face and people ask me every time I&#x27;ve done my makeup if I just cut my hair. It gets in my lipgloss and in my eyelashes. I don&#x27;t like this brush at all and it is not worth it at alllllllll.</li>
    <li> Arrived quick, and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Let me start by mentioning that this is definitely a genuine bareMinerals Full Flawless Face Brush. The price of this brush is the best price you will find anywhere. I use this brush to apply my loose powder foundation and I get nice, even, and smooth coverage every time. When you first start using the brush it is great!&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I have two BIG issues with the brush. The first big issue is the shedding. Man, this brush sheds SO much- it&#x27;s insane. Like I said it is not a fake, I just think that bareMinerals makes brushes that shed bristles like it&#x27;s going out of style. I have bought this brush directly from bareMinerals before and had the same ridiculous amount of shedding. When I am done applying my foundation, my shirt is literally covered in bristles. My second problem is that after a few months the bristles become extremely stiff. It actually gets so stiff that it is painful to use. It feels like applying makeup with a sea urchin. Those are both two pretty big design flaws in my opinion; however, the fact that the brush is so inexpensive allows me to have no problem buying a replacement when this happens. I am still using the brush because it is really soft and gives great coverage for the first few months. Personally, I can deal with all of the little hairs on my clothing because I change my clothes after my makeup routine regardless. Also, I cannot bring myself to spending $50 on a makeup brush so currently I just keep buying new ones every 4-5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the seller of this product 5 stars. I have bought this brush from them multiple times and every time the delivery is on time and the product is exactly what it should be.</li>
    <li> Used this as a paint brush. Excellent.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome!  My daughter ( who is a rookie with make-up) and I both love how it works.</li>
    <li> Great brush for applying loose powder but the bristles begin falling out after just a few months of using it.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft, and works great with my mineral makeup. Its very durable, and easy to clean. Love this brush</li>
    <li> I bought this Brush for myself and I love it. It is really soft. it covers very nicely I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Good price, like it a lot, better than other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should have one if you don&#x27;t already have, love it.</li>
    <li> So glad I was able to find this at a cheaper price but with the same quality</li>
    <li> Great brush at a great price!</li>
    <li> Loved it&#x27;s works really well</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted and half the price of buying in store.  would recommend to anyone who uses bare minerals</li>
    <li> When I first purchased bareMinerals foundation, I opt to get the starter kit complimentary with three different brushes. The sales clerk boasted about how nice these brushes were and how I would save so much when buying them with the kit. I, personally, love saving money, especially on brushes that go for at least 18 a piece. Though, after a few weeks of using the brushes, they started to fall apart... It made my purchase a huge disappointment. I don&#x27;t want to walk around with little hairs on my shirt.</li>
    <li> Great brush and you can&#x27;t beat the price. As a faithful bare minerals user, this is the original tried and true brush, perfect for any mineral makeup product. It feels great against the skin. My only advice would be to keep this, or any brush, cleaned and conditioned regularly and it will easily last a year or more without sacrificing quality.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush! Most of the brushes I have seen have really short handles on them, this one is longer and the bristles are very soft and don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> I really am not sure how this could be the price it is and be legit. I will say it works 70-80% as past store bought</li>
    <li> perfectly soft and doesn&#x27;t loose many fibers</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst powder brushes I&#x27;ve ever used, hair started falling out of it the second time I used it.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush especially for a travel cosmetic bag.  I know it will last for years and years.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush because its cheaper overall to buy on Amazon than it would be to buy it out of Sephora or Ulta, even if you pay shipping. You are saving over ten dollars. This is the same exact brush I already had that had worn out tremendously.  I am giving it a 4 because this brush will last less than a year with good cleaning and starts to shed about months in. Still it is the best brush out there so I keep buying it. Just wish it didn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my brush I had.  I use Bare Minerals make-up and didn&#x27;t want to use any other brush..  Just what I wanted and needed.</li>
    <li> Authentic product. I would order this product again. The brush hairs are the same quality as if I would have purchased in the store.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is perfect for applying face color or blush. It is a great buy and I plan on ordering another one or two to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush from Amazon this time instead of Bare Escentuals.  In both cases the brushes do not really have a great life.  After a couple of months the bristles end up breaking.  Even after the brushes are cleaned it still does not help the fact that the bristles thate have broken are rough.  Love Bare Minerals.  Just wish they could figure out the brush.  Great service on delivery etc...</li>
    <li> After watching commercials, was excited to try this makeup and brush.  It&#x27;s a total let down.  I have real pale skin so purchased the fair makeup &amp; brush.  Doesn&#x27;t look like makeup.  Goes on like light powder.  Not at all what I was expecting.  Thought there would be coverage especially for my freckles and age spots.  It doesn&#x27;t cover anything &amp; just looks like you put powder on your face.  Not like the commercials advertise.  I would not recommend this to anyone wanting full coverage.  Thumbs down for me.</li>
    <li> love this brush, great price</li>
    <li> Great brushes, I will have to learn how to clean them so they last longer. If anyone can give me cleaning tips please give me a shout.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome and applies the bare minerals makeup perfectly. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Works fine. I clean the brush often with bare minerals brush conditioning shampoo.</li>
    <li> The brush arrived so fast.  The product was exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect just what I wanted. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use only Bare Minerals brushes. They as super soft, last a really long time and cleanup perfectly. Great value.</li>
    <li> This face brush is wonderful will purchase again so soft the mineral makeup just glides on to perfection with it.</li>
    <li> This brush is SO soft and they last forever. They are easy to clean, stay in great shape and give a fantastic finish</li>
