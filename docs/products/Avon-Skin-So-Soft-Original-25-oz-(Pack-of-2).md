<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just the best bath oil ever!</li>
    <li> Best ever product to repel biting parasites and best price ever.</li>
    <li> took along time to get !!! but I cannot live without my skin so soft!!! i stop using it for like a month or two after using it for like 10 years straight  and my skin took a turn for the worse i cant wait to start using it ......</li>
    <li> Use this every day to help with eczema.</li>
    <li> always a good product</li>
    <li> I love this product. I put it in cheap spray bottles and use it to repel mosquitos and biting flies. I even spray a small amount in the palm of my hand and rub it over my hair before going into the woods. Great at the pool or beach too. We put it in our dogs bath water and then rub a small amount over their coat when they are done. This stuff is great! Not only is it good for your skin but you can use it for an insect repellent without smelling like funky chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used for years. Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for well over 20 years. Great smelling, light oil and perfect for use when going places where bad bugs roam!</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. I use this on my dogs to keep fleas and ticks off. Also works great as a mosquito repellent!&lt;br /&gt;A+++</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I used it years ago and kind of got away from it for awhile.  But as I have gotten older my feet have really dried out.  I have used various other products to soften the skin on my feet, but  none of them every worked as well or as easily as Skin so Soft.  I put it in a spray bottle and put the bottle in my shower caddy.  After showering I spritz some on the entire foot.  Be careful if you&#x27;re doing this though as the shower floor is going to be really slippery with oil on the bottom of your feet.  I put down my washcloth and step on that, then get of of shower onto a bathmat.  And put on slippers before stepping onto the tile floor.  Using it after every shower keeps your feet feeling great.  Of course  you can use it all over, and I do that too, but it&#x27;s my feet that benefit the  most.</li>
    <li> Works to help keep mosquitoes off of you. Leaves your skin smooth.  I put on right after shower. I bought the big bottles and just pour some into my hands and rub into skin. Smells like baby powder. I dont mind but i wish they had scent free my boyfriend doesnt care for the smell but still uses it to keep mosquitoes off him!</li>
    <li> The most amazing mosquito repellent ever. Plus it softens your skin!!</li>
    <li> I bought it to help against the fleas on my dogs...it didn&#x27;t help... But they smell good, and this stuff is pretty amazing otherwise!</li>
    <li> I use it as a bath oil. Great for masquito repealing.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints with the product -- it&#x27;s very good and works well. I use it to make a horse safe bug spray. But the packaging was minimal. It&#x27;s amazing that it arrived intact.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used SSS in years. Purchased this. Something is missing. Citronella being one of the ingredients. Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as the older versions. I ended up using baby oil after getting out of the tub.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a mosquito repellent and was pleasantly surprised to find that it also repelled gnats which are a great bother to me here in northern Florida.</li>
    <li> Great price from the seller I got it from. Totally works on me as a skin softener in the bath and as a bug repellent. I&#x27;m usually a bug buffet, but no longer.</li>
    <li> Exellent product and the price</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, expected Avon quality.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product has been the BEST for distracting insects &amp; moisturizing skin for me since I was a child, plus is smells so much better than some of the nasty repellants. It&#x27;s also a product I feel comfortable using on my dog &amp; it moisturizes her coat at the same time.This is a true case of not recreating a wheel if it&#x27;s not broken. SOS is the BEST.</li>
    <li> perfect, great buying experience.</li>
    <li> Love it , Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep flies off my horses.  Works great and restores oil to their coats</li>
    <li> I use this for making fly/mosquito spray for my horses. Best price!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love the Original SSS &amp; now with Jojoba added it&#x27;s even more Special. I&#x27;ve used AVON SSS on my dogs since they were puppies &amp; they&#x27;ve never had dry skin or any bugs pestering them. They&#x27;re coats are Beautiful just like my Skin from All the years of using SSS. I just use a little on long hair fur so it&#x27;s not oily &amp; especially use it after my dog&#x27;s baths when they dry &amp; rub/ brush it in their skin well. It&#x27;s also good for spraying around Led outside lamps, dog houses etc to keep flies, mosquitoes, nats and other pest away:))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 2014&lt;br /&gt;I have an Update on how SSS has come to my rescue again!  Recently I&#x27;ve had a problem with these baby ants that are Relentless.  I tried everything &amp; some of u know which one of the popular store brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Well, it worked for a minute so to speak just to have the little pest show up elsewhere! Maybe it&#x27;s the drought problem making them so desperate.  I finally sprayed SSS in all cracks, corners etc \\&quot;inside &amp; outside\\&quot;  That did It, no more Crazy Ants!!!😆</li>
    <li> This is the same SSS that&#x27;s been around a long time and just what I was looking for. I put some in a spray bottle to mist on my grandson to keep our Louisiana mosquito&#x27;s from biting! I feel better using Skin So Soft on him rather than harsh chemical bug sprays.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used this stuff try it!  Use this instead of Deet mosquito spray.  I keep it in my golf bag.  Spray it on my dogs.  Wear it as a moisturizer!  And it smells divine!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times and love it during the winter as well as the summer when my skin is very dry from being out in the sun. This size will last you a long time</li>
    <li> keeps the bugs off and makes your skin soft too. We put it in a spray bottle and spray on before drying off from a shower. Then I spay cleaner in shower so, nobody slips</li>
    <li> Very effective for repelling ticks.</li>
    <li> It was delivered quickly and new as promised.  Since moving to Florida, I found this is great product for the skin because the sun can dry you out  and also helps deter mosquitoes (which are in abundance here).  I just wished they had this product in a more masculine scent but this is tolerable.</li>
    <li> I forgot how much I looooove Skin-So-Soft.  I haven&#x27;t worn it in years.  I finally ordered some for my granddaughter who always gets eaten up by mosquitoes during the summer.  The light, clean fresh scent is still the same after all these years, and I got two HUGE 24oz bottles for $23.00.  Packaging was great, there was no spillage at all.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, it smells divine and keeps the pesky bugs away.  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Hopefully on my trip to Florida I won&#x27;t need all this lotion but it&#x27;s good to know it&#x27;s there when, or if, the bugs come out!  The lotion does repel most walking (ticks &amp; chiggers) and flying (mosquitoes).</li>
    <li> Using it as a spray for bugs on my body.....best thing I have found so far!  Need to spray every inch exposed, as the spots I miss get attacked.  Really great mosquito repellent.  I bought the 4 pack of the small spray bottles, and these are the refills....haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the same product is in the 4 spray bottles....  I have used a bunch of chemical bug sprays, and had almost no luck stopping the hoards of bugs from attacking me.  This did the trick.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, large size bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used Skin So Soft for many years.  It is the best moisturizer for skin available.  At least for my skin.</li>
    <li> This came to me  timely and was a great deal.  We use this to make homemade fly spray for our horse or we put it on ourselves to repel mosquitoes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because mosquitoes were eating me alive this summer. Works like a charm. Now the mosquitoes hate me.</li>
    <li> I buy SSS because, fleas and other insects seem to love biting me, and this is what I use to stop them in there tracks.</li>
    <li> Use as an insect repellent. Have a place in the country that I love. Do not love the chiggers and ticks!!! Can use this and not be afraid of offending people!</li>
    <li> Great product at a wonderful price. I make bug spray for myself and my dogs using a recipe recommended by our vet.  This is one of the main ingredients.</li>
    <li> A little expensive but it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Used this for many years. Still as great as ever.</li>
    <li> THE BEST SKIN SOFTENER EVER!</li>
    <li> Very happy with order and delivery!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Sent packaged very well.  Thank you</li>
    <li> An old product with multiple uses.  Skin care, flea/bug repellent.  We carry it while RV ing.  It works as an ant repellent.  We also use it around our feet &amp; ankles, it keeps bugs away when hiking.  I usually spray our dog&#x27;s paws and his floppy ears.  It works for him also.</li>
    <li> Great price. I like not having to call a sales person. I can just order off Amazon</li>
    <li> No matter what science sys, this product wards off Mosquitos. I have been using it since I was a youth in Florida and an adult in California. Back in Florida for the last 10 years. I live on a island on the Gulf now and without it in the summertime I get eaten alive by them. I even get Mosquitos in my office at work but they don&#x27;t bite me if I use skin so soft as my moisterizer in the morning. Don&#x27;t forget to reapply for an evening walk.</li>
    <li> Hear this was a good thing to use on a dog.  So we did and it was very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the humans  we enjoy it in our bath it does work if you stay with it.</li>
    <li> Have used the product for quite some time now and as always very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not only smoothes the skin but helps keep away the chickungunya mosquitoes we are having an epidemic of here in the Tropics!  Win Win :-)</li>
    <li> Always great stuff.....</li>
    <li> Love this bath oil for every bath!  Helps making the tub easier to clean also :)</li>
    <li> Was on time and I got everything I expected</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff! I got this list of things it is good for and it&#x27;s amazing. My Newfoundland&#x27;s coat never looked (or smelled) better. Same goes for my bare wood floors. I could go on and on. Highly recommend this product. Excellent service from the seller too!</li>
    <li> Lot of 2 AVON Skin So Soft SSS Original Bath Oil 24 oz each - Sealed! ;  A cap full is more then enough.  Quantity, quality, and price make this a great product.  My wife love it for her baths.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful if you are taking a shower after this is used in a bath, sigh</li>
    <li> Keeps all the bugs off of me.</li>
    <li> Great at keeping insects away as well as makes skin soft and silky...</li>
    <li> The real boss says &amp;#34;I use it every day and it makes my skin feel really good&amp;#34;.  That&amp;#34;s  good enough for me. When she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
