      <li>Okay, there are plenty of testimonials about how wonderful this product is, but in these times, when plenty of questionable elements are being pumped into our bodies every day, I want to know what things are made of, things that I come into</li>
      <li>The new is even better.</li>
      <li>and I got almost three boxes for what I pay for one where I live, and it cleans my dentures better then anything else.</li>
      <li>Dentures get sparkly clean and stains are just gone after first soak.</li>
      <li>Like many of you, I heard the commercial on the radio for a free trial.  </li>
      <li>They really need to put people with good public telephone skills answering phones and dealing with customer.</li>
      <li>Made the experience hardly worth ordering.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so superior to any tablet product on the market that my dentist says my denture is cleaner than those of any of her other patients.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Much better than tablets.</li>
    <li> Does at least 10 times better job than the stuff you get in the tablets....it&#x27;s really amazing.  Dentures get sparkly clean and stains are just gone after first soak.</li>
    <li> This is far and away the best denture cleanser we have ever used.  Even our dentist remarks on the cleanliness of our dentures.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Stain Away by a friend and will never stop using it. As, it is the only denture stain remover that works.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a product that works as well as this one and I think at one time or other I have tried them all. The tablets just don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Stain-Away is by far the best denture cleanser.  And it is cost-effective, because it is a loose powder and not packaged in individually wrapped aliquots.  Stain-Away is also an excellent hummingbird-feeder cleaner.</li>
    <li> I have used many denture cleaners and I find this product the very best of the lot. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love coffe and I love red wine :but had reached the point:because of dentures:that I was not drinking either very much because of the stains.&lt;br /&gt;Then  I discovered Stain Away. I can soak my dentures in this :sometimes overnight and even when I drink very bold dark coffe:and I drink it black:ALL the stain comes out and my teeth are pearly white:I wish there was a product for my crowns,that I could brush with .&lt;br /&gt;this is the best product I have ever used</li>
    <li> Was told about it by my denturist.  He was right it works much better then any tablets I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I am both a heavy coffee drinker and a smoker and, in the past, have used Efferdent, Polident, &#x27;Wal-dent&#x27;, Fry&#x27;s-dent . . . well, you get the idea. The results have been less than sterling, using these products (event the &#x27;smoker&#x27;s variety&#x27;). Then I tried this stuff - the Stain Away. Wow! The results were fantastic and the product name fully appropriate! I&#x27;ll never go back to fizzy tablets.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10 years. At one point, I couldn&#x27;t find any, and had to resort to (gasp) tablets. Now I always keep a stock on hand..</li>
    <li> This is the best stain remover for dentures and it works fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years, it is very good</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite a while.  I originally tried Stain Away because other cleaners did not clean well.  This one does a wonderful job and my mouth always feels fresh.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I found this product on Amazon!! Best cleaner I have ever used!! Thanks Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;Diana</li>
    <li> You can stop wasting money on any other brand of denture cleaner.  Even you dentist can&#x27;t do a better job.  This product will remove the stains of tea, coffee, red wine, you name it.  Used daily, dentures look brand new, year after year.</li>
    <li> when I called the were rude, did not listen and were not literate in the English language. Made the experience hardly worth ordering. The product is fine. They really need to put people with good public telephone skills answering phones and dealing with customer.</li>
    <li> Became aware of this \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; product while perusing videos re denture care at [...] It does what the label informs in 5-10 minutes. This product is used once a week.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this products cleaning ability, best I have used to date, however, would like a little better whiting power.</li>
    <li> Qi can honestly say I have tried all makes of denture cleaner this is so good I would recommend this product over all others .very highly recommended I will order again thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he says it does work but not noticeable better than regular cleaners for false teeth.</li>
    <li> CLEAN BETTER THEN OTHER PRODUCTS I HAVE EVER USED. I TRY TO DEAL WITH ONLY Canadian aMAZON WEBSIDE BECAUSE THE DUTIES AND ALL THAT JUNK ARE TO EXPENSIVE, AND THEY TRY TO TELL ME THAT WE HAVE TRADE LAWS IN PLACE. BIG LAUGH :) LOL</li>
    <li> This beats anything out there on the market today!  It&#x27;s fast and easy and was recommended by my dentist, I will never go back to the other brands after using this. It does a much better job of cleaning and contains no bleach that will damage your dentures or partials.</li>
    <li> DOES EXCELLENT JOB OF REMOVING STAINS.&lt;br /&gt;VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR A SMOKER SUBJECT TO NICOTINE STAINS.&lt;br /&gt;NOT USUALLY AVAILABLE IN STORES.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff for cleaning dentures. It is the best I have ever used and works fast and complete. I would recommend this for all denture, or partial users.</li>
    <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve used. My dentures feel like they&#x27;re brand new every morning.  I highly endorse this product.</li>
    <li> Stain Away removes stains from dentures like no other product on the market and it only takes a few minutes.  I would not be with Stain Away!  I keep my denture cup and Stain Away near the tub and by the time I take my shower my dentures are sparkling.</li>
    <li> Great product. Cleaqns false teeth better than any other similar product. Also you use less so you save more!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom.  She prefers it to other products and has had to special order it prior to my finding it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It came when expected, and is the same product she&#x27;s been happy with.</li>
    <li> This product does an excellent job of cleaning dentures in a short amount of time. Have been using it for years and am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I can not live wthout this fabulous product.It makes your dentures/partials look and feel like new. I eat fresh fruit daily and I noticed the film that seemed to build up on my partial so I started using this product 2-3x a week and it is unbelievable. Now I have my mom using it too.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried calling Regent Labs Inc. yet, (I&#x27;ll probably add another review after I do call them!)but I have e-mailed them twice asking what Stain Away Plus is made of and never received any response. I have also searched the internet for any such information and found nothing. Okay, there are plenty of testimonials about how wonderful this product is, but in these times, when plenty of questionable elements are being pumped into our bodies every day, I want to know what things are made of, things that I come into that close a contact with daily.</li>
    <li> This is some really good stuff!! I had some black spots close to the gums of my dentures. I soaked them &amp; the spots disappeared. Stain Away Plus Denture Cleanser got my dentures cleaner than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used. It is all I will ever use from now on!! Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is really tops.  I used it on my mom&#x27;s old dentures that were packed away for years, since she lost her newer ones at a rehab center.  The dentures were an almost brown color instead of pink like our gums, and the teeth took on a black tint in the area where the teeth met the pink/brown gum area.  When I used this cleanser it brought them back to the look of newly made dentures.  I soaked them several times focusing on the blackened area of the teeth and it worked beautifully.  I purchased the three pack for mom but I use it as well since it helps remove the plaque from your dentures.  I will be buying more when these run out.</li>
    <li> the very best  denture I ever used. Im a long time user, my teeth sparkle from stain away. many compliments on my beautiful teeth.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Delivery was very speedy, great packaging and exactly as described.  It works very easy and very good!</li>
    <li> Good product could not find in stores</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service. Recommended to all who use tablets for denture cleaning. Superior to tablets and about the same price per unit.</li>
    <li> I have been using Stain Away for several years because of its excellent performance and felt lost for a time when I couldn&#x27;t find it in nearby stores, until I was fortunate to find it in Amazon.</li>
    <li> Is even better than I thought it would be, enjoy playing this game!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than a year and wouldn&#x27;t use any other. it&#x27;s so superior to any tablet product on the market that my dentist says my denture is cleaner than those of any of her other patients.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this working as well as the Sparkle I used to use. My teeth feel dirty in my mouth by late afternoon.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean dentures. Good Grief! This stuff works SO much better than....ANYthing! Removed stains completely that regular cleaners wouldn&#x27;t touch! I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is so effective and so versatile.  Because sit is designed for dentures it is safe to remove calcium deposits around bathroom and kitchen faucets.</li>
    <li> the Stain Away denture cleanser is very hard to find where I live and I got almost three boxes for what I pay for one where I live, and it cleans my dentures better then anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every denture cleanser.  Stain Away works the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, it also cleans my stainless steel thermos.</li>
    <li> I had noticed a buildup of stains on my dentures after using a name brand denture tablet which happened so slowly I didn&#x27;t notice right away.  So I tried Stain Away thinking I had nothing to loose and was I surprised!  I used Stain Away for the first time this morning and as I removed them from the &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; I could see the difference. They  felt and looked much cleaner than they had in a long time.  I highly recommend this product and will continue to buy it.  I hope Amazon.com will continue to sell Stain Away and that Stain Away doesn&#x27;t change their formula as it REALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, it cleans really really well, and I&#x27;m a smoker.</li>
    <li> This is the best denture cleaner that I have used.  It removes coffee stains. I would recommend this product to all denture users.</li>
    <li> AFTER READING OTHER REVIEWS ON THIS I BOUGHT IT TO TRY, FIRST USE MY TEETH LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE BRAND NEW. WORKS FAST AND I WILL NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE AS LOMG AS I CAN GET THIS.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Does an excellent job on dentures. Gets the stains out by just soaking . Cheaper to buy three pack</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and find that it works extremely well.  It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> This is a great product it works very well and I will keep ordering it. I hope you dont stop selling it.&lt;br /&gt;Steve Lane</li>
    <li> I have been using Stain Away for many years. My dentures look professionally cleaned every single day. I am a heavy smoker and heavy coffee and tea drinker. If it came down to it, I would pay double for this fantastic denture cleaner. It has become hard to find of late so \\&quot;thank goodness for Amazon!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product does clean better than most denture cleansers and is convenient to use. I would recommend it. It costs about the same as other products but lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Company keeps charging your card even if you didn&#x27;t authorize it.  Like many of you, I heard the commercial on the radio for a free trial.  I called the 800 number and agreed to pay for shipping.  They gave me options for automatic renewal and I declined.  So I gave them the $9 and change for shipping on my card and specifically said to not renew and the lady on the phone agreed.  Less than a month later, I&#x27;ve got a $29.95 charge on my card and am told they are sending me more.  Very dubious and unprofessional.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years and think it is just the best of any I have used. The new is even better. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time and liked it, but it is hard to find. I desided to try the net. Was happy to find it there.</li>
    <li> excellent product as always. prompt delivery, but the price is getting a bit high. I might have to check other sources but I like this vendor so ultimately it will depend on how close I get to running out of the product and how much time I have to search for other sources.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; good seller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Stain Away for about 3-4 years. It more than met my expectations with the first use. I recently went on vacation and forgot to take it and resorted to using one of the most popular brands of cleanser which never fully removed the coffee and tea stains.  I can only reiterate it&#x27;s &amp;#34;simply the best, better than all the rest&amp;#34; and that is why I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> So much better than other brands.</li>
    <li> The label is VERY misleading, in fact it&#x27;s just plain false, about how many cleanings to a bottle. I liked Stain Away. I got a bottle of it on sale and liked the reduced packaging etc. When I tried it it did a nice job of cleaning my dentures.  BUT.. and this is a big BUT to me, when assessing its cost effectiveness I compared it based on the  number of cleanings estimated on the label, which said in bold numbers, 80.  I used it fairly sparingly--a little less than the lower recommended (1/2 capful) amount, and it lasted less than 50 days. That&#x27;s a pretty big discrepancy and a substantial per-day cost difference.  I&#x27;m on a limited income and am returning to the store-brand tabs I&#x27;d been using for way less than half the cost. I could likely afford to continue using it but am not about to reward a company for blatantly lying to its customers.</li>
