    <li> Just LOVE all their products</li>
    <li> I have slightly oily/combination skin. This does not irritate it at all. I notice it helps my nose look less oily, without stripping away the essential oils of my face.

    <li> This is another Swiss Botany &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; product. The cleansing gel exfoliates and does other wonderful things to your face...like diminishing dark areas and wrinkles. I am a fan of this company and every product I have used has been fantastic. Mandelic acid is a new alpha hydroxy acid that is derived from bitter almonds.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing gel. It smells great and it is perfect for this oily, combination and acne prone skin of mine. It helps with clearing my breakouts and removing these oil and dirt from my face. I am using this cleanser along with Swiss Botany&#x27;s exfoliator and toner and I am very impressed with the results I have seen so far. It is safe to use for my skin and it works without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;*item purchased while it was on promotion in return for my 100% honest feedback.</li>
    <li> A natural and anti-aging face wash that lathers on beautifully and leaves my skin baby soft...what more can you ask for? I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ptoduct for about a week now and I haven&#x27;t felt or seen any difference in my skin yet.</li>
    <li> Got this product as the previous product from Swiss botany was good, this is a mild cleanser,  no irritation on skin, smell is mild, does remove the make up perfectly, didn&#x27;t cause skin to dry. Need to use it more longer to give better review. Happy to see products without harsh chemicals. Delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! My skin feels extremely clean and soft right after using it. I have already noticed that the blackheads on my nose chin are starting to shrink. I have pretty sensitive skin and was expecting some irritation from this but it didn&#x27;t irritate it at all. I am in love with this stuff and will continue to keep using it!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this cleansing gel. It has a light scent and it cleans my skin so well. I use it with my Olay ProX facial cleansing brush and my skin gets thoroughly cleaned. My breakouts have stopped and my skin has cleared up so much that I hardly even wear any makeup and I have received compliments about my skin. I am so pleased with this cleansing gel and Swiss Botany that I&#x27;m a loyal customer!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly mild cleansing gel.  It cleans face well but not making the face dry.  I have oil t-zone with dry cheeks and this gel does wonderful job.</li>
    <li> Very Mild. Gentle cleansing. Would buy again!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having troubles with hormonal breakouts and was using some very costly high end products that weren&#x27;t doing anything for my skin. I happened to see someone online mention mandelic acid and how great it was for their skin so I looked into it. This was one of a few mandelic acid cleansers I could find (and also the most reasonably priced). I have to say I&#x27;m glad I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is more even toned after just one use. I haven&#x27;t had any further acne breakouts, oil seems to be reduced as well.. The only downside is a little dryness around my mouth and jaw area but I suspect that will get better as my skin adjusts or maybe I&#x27;ll reduce to once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously love this cleanser though, the smell is nice, the texture and lather is good.. A little goes a long way. This product is a steal at this price especially compared to what I was paying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne and hyperpigmentation, definitely give this a try. Mandelic acid is one of the more gentler acids and is also great for darker skin tones.</li>
    <li> I love this Cleansing Gel!  I am 41 years old with oily and blemish prone skin and this cleanser works perfectly for my skin type.  Not only does it gently exfoliate my skin but it also leaves it feeling clean, soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser also works great at healing old blemishes and preventing new ones from forming.  I highly recommend using in combination with the Swiss Botany Exfoliator and Toner for optimal results!&lt;br /&gt;As a beauty blogger I test out a lot of products and I am super impressed with Swiss Botany products and the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product complimentary or at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
    <li> So background on me, I have acne even at 39 yrs old. If I do not use a toner and cleanser with salycyllic acid I will end up with breakouts. Before this cleanser, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Pink Grapefruit scrubbing cleanser. Since trying this cleanser, I have gone back to it because I broke out with some of the worst pimples I have had in a long time. Unfortunately, I just couldn&#x27;t get passed the breakouts. Might work for others, but at $20/bottle, I cannot have constant breakouts.</li>
    <li> I absolutely enjoy using this cleanser , the only way I can describe the texture of my skin after using this cleanser. Would be like the soft belly of a puppy thus the tittle for the review. My skin feels so supple and smooth. Honestly for the first 3 days I couldn&#x27;t stop petting my own face. I&#x27;ve also noticed a lightening in my completion. I would definitely recommend this product with issues with acne I say this becuase I still get acne break outs from time to time. I really wish this product was around when I was a teenager. It would have have saved me lots of frurstrations looking for something that actually helped my skin and is non-irritating. This products does what it says it does and I&#x27;m sure that the more I use it the better my results. Aslong as Swiss Botany keeps making products this effective that actually work and are of quality they will have my business.  Two thumbs up if I had more thumbs it be more. Great Job Swiss Botany!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and I have noticed a HUGE difference. Not only does my skin feel softer, it is now bright as well. Also, I have acne prone skin, but since using this product, not one pimple has grown on my face! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This comes in a huge bottle and smells good. Cleans my face but doesn&#x27;t leave it too dried out. I use it daily. It is gentle and effective. My face feels less oily during the day after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and am very happy with the early results.  My face feels fresh and clean after using this product.</li>
    <li> This cleanser made my skin so smooth and soft.  I don&#x27;t want to mention the cleanser that I used before but it didn&#x27;t do what this one does.  I don&#x27;t think that I have been paying enough attention to my cleansers because this one is considerably better then th done that i was using.  The on eI used cleaned my skin but this seems to do more then just clean it.  AND its cruelty free!</li>
    <li> Honest review. I have very oily skin. I haven&#x27;t found anything to help. Got a coupon to order this along with the Facial Toner.  After using them I didn&#x27;t have to blot my face free from oil at all, even with makeup on. It also preps my face before applying makeup. It is very gentle. I use it at night and in the morning. Love love love!</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  It does a nice job removing my make-up compared to similar products.  It is very concentrated, so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This gel cleanser is great for dry skin and feels so smooth while cleaning and the smell is great for me! Love it.</li>
