      <li>Great price from this vendor.</li>
      <li>This lotion is great if you can find it in a salon or have your salon order it</li>

      <li>Love it, everyone complimented my tan and the scent !</li>
      <li>and I have been satisfied since!</li>
      <li>I have not had to worrying about smelling like burnt skin coming out of the tanning booth before going to school or work, I have used it outdoors and works amazingly</li>
      <li>It smells really nice without being overpowering</li>
      <li>BY FAR THE BEST LOTION</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>My tanning salon RAVED about this lotion, said it was their favorite.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>love that it promotes vitamin D absorption.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent, I love the texture &amp; I</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>Love the color I got.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>When I use a dermadark lotion, this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite lotions.</li>
      <li>I demanded they order more</li>
      <li>The smell is okay</li>
      <li>I was more inclined to purchase it.</li>
      <li>A GREAT smell (light tropical/not too much but just enough to have a great b4 &amp; after tan smell)   C. CAN&#x27;T BEAT AMAZONS PRICE!!</li>
      <li>It came very quickly and was wrapped very secure.</li>
      <li>This one will make you feel soft and beautiful</li>
      <li>and I get the same great results.</li>
      <li>thought they were great and was never a fan of Australian Gold.  </li>
      <li>You get a great deal with this and its usually half the price here on amazon :)</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and freckles and tan better with other lotions.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be coming back for more :)</li>
      <li>The difference was very noticeable after the very first use.</li>
      <li>IT WAS IN A ZIP LOCK BAG FIRST OF ALL, AND IN A CARDBOARD BOX FROM THE UPS</li>
      <li>i love this lotion and would buy it a third time with no hesitation.</li>
      <li>The product was fine though, so I will definitely order again.</li>
      <li>The scent is really relaxing and not over-powering (smells like coconut)so</li>
      <li>who wants to pay 80$ at the salon?    </li>
      <li>I am very pick about my lotions too.</li>
      <li>It fades quickly and leaves a strong after-tan smell (not bad, not good).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I used it a few times anyway because, well, I spent a good deal of money on it.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much, I will definitely be ordering from this company again!</li>
      <li>definitely do not buy at the salon though because they charge twice as much!</li>
      <li>It makes my skin really soft.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty good base tan, but I felt I needed a little something more so the salon I go to suggested I try Satin D Sol.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to get dark fast yet natural looking.</li>
      <li>This lotion is definitely one of my new favorites!</li>
      <li>After purchasing a new bottle of the same lotion from the salon, I was back to my usual 15 minutes and felt fine afterwards.</li>
      <li>Also the vitamin D makes my skin feel really soft, (I have psoriasis and has actually helped it heal by a lot)</li>
      <li>It came faster than expected, and was the same product that was in the tanning salon, and a much cheaper price.</li>
      <li>I like this product it tans you very subtly and without the yucky order that so many stronger self tanners have.  </li>
      <li>I keep coming back to this lotion simply because no other indoor tanning lotion gives me...  A.</li>

<li> I keep coming back to this lotion simply because no other indoor tanning lotion gives me...  A.</li>
<li> I have ordered this lotion and a few of my other favorites on Amazon and they look and smell exactly the same</li>
<li> stuff runs a little expensive but the price is good on Amazon compared to other stores.</li>
<li> and I wish the fake diamonds around the cap didn&#x27;t fall off so easily.</li>
<li> It actually smells a little like coconut.  </li>
<li> The lotion came sealed, and was carefully packaged in bubble wrap and a bubble wrap mailer.</li>
<li> I was a bit suspicious when the last time I ordered this lotion the gold mesh thing was missing, all the other times it was on it.</li>
<li> I immediately got an even brown color that looked natural and wasn&#x27;t streaky at all, which is very hard to achieve when you have dry skin.</li>
<li> I was a little hesitant to try a lotion with a bronzer because I was afraid of streaking, but this lotion is great and hasn&#x27;t left me with the crazy tan I feared.  </li>
<li> and I didn&#x27;t see the same results as others I&#x27;m just not thrilled.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m naturally very pale and it takes a long time for me to just get a peachy glow.  </li>
<li> I used to buy it at a salon for $75 until I discovered I could get it here for less than half the price.</li>
<li> The lotion feels silicone-ish like DS Black but isn&#x27;t overkill and the smell is tropical with little noticeable ATO.</li>
<li> IT WAS MISSING THE MESH NETTING</li>
<li> Bottle appeared to have been used and no secure seal on package.</li>
<li> I usually tan for about 15 minutes in a Level 3 bed and found that after 5 or 6 minutes, using the same lotion I usually used but from this seller on Amazon, my skin was stinging and in serious pain on all three occasions.</li>
<li> (beautiful even brown glow with not even a hint of nasty fake orange!!)   </li>
<li> If you tell the salon people you are buying it online they will try to convince you it&#x27;s either a phoney product or that it&#x27;s outdated and won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
<li> It does not leave a fake orange tint to the skin and it smells sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I realize they want to sell me their products, but I refuse to pay their prices because the markups are outrageous.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible after tan smell either.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When I use a dermadark lotion, this is my favorite.  It also seems to have a bronzer in the lotion, so it seems to stay longer.  It makes my skin really soft.</li>
    <li> BY FAR THE BEST LOTION I HAVE EVER USED!! I keep coming back to this lotion simply because no other indoor tanning lotion gives me...  A. The color I want (beautiful even brown glow with not even a hint of nasty fake orange!!)   B. A GREAT smell (light tropical/not too much but just enough to have a great b4 &amp; after tan smell)   C. CAN&#x27;T BEAT AMAZONS PRICE!! who wants to pay 80$ at the salon?    I&#x27;ll be coming back for more :)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!! this is my second time purchasing it, and I have not found another one like this. The scent is really relaxing and not over-powering (smells like coconut)so I have not had to worrying about smelling like burnt skin coming out of the tanning booth before going to school or work, I have used it outdoors and works amazingly (i have extremely fair skin and do not tan outdoors) I recommend this to anyone who wants to get dark fast yet natural looking. Also the vitamin D makes my skin feel really soft, (I have psoriasis and has actually helped it heal by a lot) i love this lotion and would buy it a third time with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> My tanning salon RAVED about this lotion, said it was their favorite. I think it&#x27;s OK. I wouldn&#x27;t pay 70$ for it again. It fades quickly and leaves a strong after-tan smell (not bad, not good). Maybe because they hyped up this lotion and I didn&#x27;t see the same results as others I&#x27;m just not thrilled. I have fair skin and freckles and tan better with other lotions.</li>
    <li> The lotion came sealed, and was carefully packaged in bubble wrap and a bubble wrap mailer. It came faster than expected, and was the same product that was in the tanning salon, and a much cheaper price. Thank you very much, I will definitely be ordering from this company again!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. I used to buy it at a salon for $75 until I discovered I could get it here for less than half the price. If you tell the salon people you are buying it online they will try to convince you it&#x27;s either a phoney product or that it&#x27;s outdated and won&#x27;t work as well. Knowing they work on commission I realize they want to sell me their products, but I refuse to pay their prices because the markups are outrageous. I have ordered this lotion and a few of my other favorites on Amazon and they look and smell exactly the same and I get the same great results. I was a bit suspicious when the last time I ordered this lotion the gold mesh thing was missing, all the other times it was on it. The product was fine though, so I will definitely order again. The next time I order lotion I plan on trying Sol Search, also by Australian Gold. The ingredients are similar to Satin D Sol and it smells a lot like it too. That one is $65 in my salon and only $28.90 here. Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of designer skin and swedish beauty products over the years. thought they were great and was never a fan of Australian Gold.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  I&#x27;m naturally very pale and it takes a long time for me to just get a peachy glow.  This product is wonderful.  I immediately got an even brown color that looked natural and wasn&#x27;t streaky at all, which is very hard to achieve when you have dry skin. It also didn&#x27;t suffer shower fade. The lotion feels silicone-ish like DS Black but isn&#x27;t overkill and the smell is tropical with little noticeable ATO.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my fiancé to use at the gym and while at the beach. The difference was very noticeable after the very first use. It does not leave a fake orange tint to the skin and it smells sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff runs a little expensive but the price is good on Amazon compared to other stores. Also, because it ships through Amazon prime I was more inclined to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for the tanning bed! I highly recommend it.  I am very pick about my lotions too.</li>
    <li> I had a tanning solan suggest this lotion and i couldn&#x27;t get enough of it. As soon as I ran out I demanded they order more and they had changed their direction or just wouldn&#x27;t order it. I found it on here and I have been satisfied since! Smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it is so expensive at my tanning salon. When I saw this I was so happy! It came very quickly and was wrapped very secure.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, I love the texture &amp; I love that it promotes vitamin D absorption.  Great price from this vendor. I did not want to spend $70 at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty good base tan, but I felt I needed a little something more so the salon I go to suggested I try Satin D Sol.  I was a little hesitant to try a lotion with a bronzer because I was afraid of streaking, but this lotion is great and hasn&#x27;t left me with the crazy tan I feared.  It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible after tan smell either.  It actually smells a little like coconut.  This lotion is definitely one of my new favorites!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great if you can find it in a salon or have your salon order it but BEWARE if you buy it from Amazon. I purchased mine here and when it was delivered, the lotion bottle was cracked in some places and was not sealed. I used it a few times anyway because, well, I spent a good deal of money on it. I usually tan for about 15 minutes in a Level 3 bed and found that after 5 or 6 minutes, using the same lotion I usually used but from this seller on Amazon, my skin was stinging and in serious pain on all three occasions. After purchasing a new bottle of the same lotion from the salon, I was back to my usual 15 minutes and felt fine afterwards. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS LOTION FROM AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I ENDED UP SELLING IT BECAUSE TO ME I DID NOT WANT TO HASSLE WITH RETURNING IT. IT WAS IN A ZIP LOCK BAG FIRST OF ALL, AND IN A CARDBOARD BOX FROM THE UPS SO PEOPLE COULD SEE WHAT YOU ORDERED INSIDE THE PACKAGE. IT WAS MISSING THE MESH NETTING AND THE DIAMONDS WERE RUINED ON THE CAP. THEY WERE ALL COMING OFF. I WOULD NOT TRUST THIS AS IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS TAMPERED WITH. WON&#x27;T BE BUYING FROM THEM AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I like this product it tans you very subtly and without the yucky order that so many stronger self tanners have.  This one will make you feel soft and beautiful</li>
    <li> This is the only tanning lotion I use and I love it. It smells really nice without being overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t stay on you all day. definitely do not buy at the salon though because they charge twice as much!</li>
    <li> Love the color I got. The smell is okay and I wish the fake diamonds around the cap didn&#x27;t fall off so easily. Never happened to the same bottle purchased in my tanning salon. I can get over that for a cheaper price though.</li>
    <li> Not same product as purchased in the store. Did not inhance my indoor tanning or increase the quality of the tan. Greasy. Bottle appeared to have been used and no secure seal on package.</li>
    <li> Love it, everyone complimented my tan and the scent ! I&#x27;ll be repurchasing soon to use this winter. You get a great deal with this and its usually half the price here on amazon :)</li>
