      <li>product is an awesome deal, but even if it cost more in the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; range, I would continue to purchase it over the other premium bronzer products!</li>
      <li>the color is perfect for me, it gives bronzing without going to dark or too orange.</li>
      <li>I have medium skin (bordering on light in the winter) and have found with the medium-dark that I can easily adjust how &amp;</li>
      <li>and that is a BOLD statement!</li>
      <li>case is very pretty and sturdy, and the brush that comes with it is better than using another makeup brush.</li>
      <li>And my skin tone is light to medium.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s cheap but not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>You can layer on to go darker or lightly sweep to give a glow.</li>
      <li>Didnt think i would love this product as much, but once you start using it more</li>
      <li>I highlighted my cheeks very well and since I am not pale but of neutral shade, the bronzer looks great on my skin.  </li>
      <li>The product however is a nice subtle matte bronzer, great for every day use.</li>
      <li>I LOVED it and now will never go back!</li>
      <li>i also feel that it is not bad for my skin.</li>
      <li>Even ordered an extra one for my sister, who loves it, too.&lt;br /&gt;Prices were fair, shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good everyday bronzer and am so glad I found this</li>
      <li>Even better than some of my high end bronzers.</li>
      <li>It is a great matte contour bronzer and I like that it does not break me out or clog my pores as much as some more expensive products do.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and natural color and blends</li>
      <li>I have worn bronzer&#x27;s by Physician&#x27;s Formula for years, but I believe that this particular bronzer is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>I wear a good amount of makeup but try to make it look as natural as possible.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the original same color I bought a few years ago.  </li>
      <li>Like this better than pink blush.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really contour with it</li>
      <li>#34;tan&amp;#34; I want to look by how much powder I use.</li>
      <li>Anyway I highly recommend this bronzer!</li>
      <li>Inexpensive but much better than other products in its price range.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple and clean look gives me an outdoor glow and allows for my freckles to be seen.</li>
      <li>I just wish it had more product in it, as 0.3 ounces isn&#x27;t good enough for an expensive drugstore product.</li>
      <li>I love the bits of gold that run through this, but medium to dark is misleading.</li>
      <li>However, I use my own small Kabuki brush, not the included brush this comes with.</li>
      <li>This bronzer says its medium to dark, but comes out pretty light on me.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty much the same product</li>
      <li>This bronzer gives you a nice, subtle glow.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The powder goes on smoothly and it comes out as dark as you make it.</li>
      <li>so worth the price as some bronzers are way more expensive and cant compare to this one.</li>
      <li>i have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I did however, repurchase this directly from the drugstore</li>
      <li>I use this bronzer every day and it looks totally natural.</li>
      <li>Looks natural</li>
      <li>It is as light as pictured and hardly makes an impression.</li>
      <li>I have pretty fair-medium skin with yellow undertones and the Medium to Dark</li>

<li> you look at the compact but not enough to look super fake on your skin.</li>
<li> The only drawback is the flat, little brush that comes with it.</li>
<li> Lighter than expected</li>
<li> ; brush they provide is much too small and is very difficult to achieve a consistent color across your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Really like this product even though I ordered the wrong one.  </li>
<li> but for less than half the cost.</li>
<li> It does have a little shimmer but anyone can pull it off.</li>
<li> I use this everyday.</li>
<li> When I&#x27;m darker in the summer it goes just as well as when its winter and I&#x27;m pale.</li>
<li> I usually buy it at CVS but</li>
<li> A little hard to judge because I can hardly make it out.</li>
<li> it has very subtle sparkles</li>
<li> No orange, nothing fake.</li>
<li> This bronzer helps me fake that tan.</li>
<li> the expensive ones I&#x27;ve gotten at specialty</li>
<li> Sorry if I miss spelled that word!</li>
<li> The one that comes with it is worthless.</li>
<li> Therefore I hate a lot of sparkle and glimmer.</li>

    <li> If you like Too Faced Milk Chocolate Soleil Bronzer, you will like this. I used to use Too Faced and gave this a shot and it&#x27;s pretty much the same product but for less than half the cost. I think you might be able to find it cheaper on Amazon than in drug stores (unless you have a coupon).  I usually buy it at CVS but next time I&#x27;ll shop Amazon to see if I can beat the price.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I don&#x27;t like the bulky packaging, it seems so wasteful. The product however is a nice subtle matte bronzer, great for every day use. I have a medium (NC35 / Medium beige / W4) skintone and use the &amp;#34;Light to Medium shade. Any darker you should try &amp;#34;Medium to Dark&amp;#34;.

    <li> It did nothing but cake on the bronzer... it would wipe off if you put your hand on your face.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original same color I bought a few years ago.  This one is lighter.  But still a gooc value for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Doesn&#x27;t make me orange or sparkly!  I feel like it evens out my skin tone.  I have a copper/olive complexion.</li>
    <li> This bronzer says its medium to dark, but comes out pretty light on me. And my skin tone is light to medium. I have to pack on a lot to get a good glow, but it blends very nicely.</li>
    <li> Gives you a nice bronze color without looking to orange or brown!  It is better than any department store bronzer!! My favorite bronzer!</li>
    <li> First off, I purchased this from Amazon but was not able to use it because it came shattered all over the box. I did however, repurchase this directly from the drugstore and I loved it. It&#x27;s one of my favorite bronzers period. Even better than some of my high end bronzers. I have fair skin in the winter and medium skin in the summer. I don&#x27;t like tanning because I try to avoid skin damage from the sun. This bronzer helps me fake that tan.</li>
    <li> I have medium olive skin and use this as contouring and blush..You can layer on to go darker or lightly sweep to give a glow. Mine has lasted for over 5 months with use 3-5 times per week. Dual compartment compact comes with mini fan brush which is perfect to contour cheekbones. Not shimmery and won&#x27;t break skin out.</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer.  I highlighted my cheeks very well and since I am not pale but of neutral shade, the bronzer looks great on my skin.  I received it in time too.  This bronzer last a while as well.</li>
    <li> Great product! Lighter than expected so I can&#x27;t really contour with it but it is my go to overall bronzer.</li>
    <li> I had never tried this product before, and I love it! Even ordered an extra one for my sister, who loves it, too.&lt;br /&gt;Prices were fair, shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> I first tried this years ago when my normal (expensive) bronzer ran out and I was in a crunch. I LOVED it and now will never go back! I use this bronzer every day and it looks totally natural. I have medium skin (bordering on light in the winter) and have found with the medium-dark that I can easily adjust how &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; I want to look by how much powder I use. However, I use my own small Kabuki brush, not the included brush this comes with. The &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; brush they provide is much too small and is very difficult to achieve a consistent color across your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is an awesome deal, but even if it cost more in the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; range, I would continue to purchase it over the other premium bronzer products!</li>
    <li> My favorite bronzed ever! Inexpensive but much better than other products in its price range. I wear a good amount of makeup but try to make it look as natural as possible. Therefore I hate a lot of sparkle and glimmer. I like matte and just the color. It must have some glimmer to it because you can see it she you look at the compact but not enough to look super fake on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I love the brand Physicians Formula!  The bronzer is great.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> great product for a great price.. works great and easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product and company</li>
    <li> This bronzer gives you a nice, subtle glow. No orange, nothing fake. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;The case is very pretty and sturdy, and the brush that comes with it is better than using another makeup brush. It has a mirror inside too. Would recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is the best bronzing foundation that my friends and I have ever found. It&#x27;s great quality and matching for all skin colors.</li>
    <li> I have worn bronzer&#x27;s by Physician&#x27;s Formula for years, but I believe that this particular bronzer is my new favorite. Gives a believable tan glow, not too shimmery, sparkly, or orange. The only drawback is the flat, little brush that comes with it. I advise pitching it, and applying the bronzer with a kabuki brush.</li>
    <li> This is just like Clinique bronzer except a better price... Love it because there is no sparkle to it like a lot of cheap bronzers</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She seems to think it is the best bronzer out there! She continues to purchase this product so I guess it&#x27;s working for her!</li>
    <li> Nice. Like this better than pink blush. Looks natural</li>
    <li> This baby is the real deal and the price is the best part about it. I like it more than my Nars Laguna bronzer and that is a BOLD statement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good everyday bronzer and am so glad I found this, it&#x27;s cheap but not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. It also works better then the expensive ones I&#x27;ve gotten at specialty stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder goes on smoothly and it comes out as dark as you make it. When I&#x27;m darker in the summer it goes just as well as when its winter and I&#x27;m pale. It all depends on the application. It&#x27;s never orangey or blotchy. The only downside is the brush. The one that comes with it is worthless.</li>
    <li> this is my most favorite bronzer. i use it every day especially in winter time to add a glow. it has very subtle sparkles but im a male and nobody notices the sparkle. i also feel that it is not bad for my skin. i have sensitive skin and it never makes me break out. i do not use the included brush but instead a kabuki brush. so worth the price as some bronzers are way more expensive and cant compare to this one.</li>
    <li> Really like this product even though I ordered the wrong one.  Blends my color so well! Will order it again.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. It&#x27;s simple and clean look gives me an outdoor glow and allows for my freckles to be seen. This product can be used alone with no help.</li>
    <li> the color is perfect for me, it gives bronzing without going to dark or too orange.It does have a little shimmer but anyone can pull it off.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bronzer! I&#x27;ve already purchased this item twice, and I love it! It works great! I use it to contour my cheeks and it works perfect and makes definition very natural! I love it! Sorry if I miss spelled that word! Anyway I highly recommend this bronzer!</li>
    <li> Didnt think i would love this product as much, but once you start using it more you notice your face looks more flushed, in a good way of course. I have pretty fair-medium skin with yellow undertones and the Medium to Dark is perfect. I wouldn&#x27;t believe the other one to show up on my face as the darkest shade isn&#x27;t really that dark. I don&#x27;t even think i&#x27;ll need to add a blush with this. I just wish it had more product in it, as 0.3 ounces isn&#x27;t good enough for an expensive drugstore product.</li>
    <li> I love the bits of gold that run through this, but medium to dark is misleading. It is as light as pictured and hardly makes an impression. A little hard to judge because I can hardly make it out.</li>
    <li> It is a great matte contour bronzer and I like that it does not break me out or clog my pores as much as some more expensive products do.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and natural color and blends great.&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase.</li>
