      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It is so much better than anything else I have found that I have even given it as a gift.</li>
      <li>I received a sample-size of this from my dentist and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>Every time I went to the periodontist after that my reports got better and better.  </li>
      <li>Love this Toothpaste...</li>
      <li>I love this products.  </li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s a very good Tooth paste with mint, your teeth will be white &amp; healthy</li>
      <li>It has a strong minty flavor that is supposed to help freshen breath, too.  </li>
      <li>This product was recommended by a holistic dentist, and I&#x27;ll have to say, it works fantastic.</li>
      <li>Healthy herbs actually feel it doing your mouth good.</li>
      <li>It has a very herby, clove flavor, which I love, but know that it is strong.</li>
      <li>great paste though flavor is a bit strange &amp; it stained our toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>It gets me a just dentist clean feeling every time I use it.  </li>
      <li>Periodontist even said how pink the gums were and how great they look.  </li>
      <li>Her last checkup was good, so we think it has helped her condition since using it.</li>
      <li>This Toothpaste has a gentle flavor rather than the overbearing flavors in most toothpastes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It tastes very organic, pretty sure it&#x27;s SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) free.</li>
      <li>It makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I was used to the taste because the tonic was even stronger but both products leave your mouth feeling and smelling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>After using for a year in December I actually ranged between 1 and 3 with very healthy gums.  </li>
      <li>Our favorite natural toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>It is all natural and I love that fact.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to purchase this product because of the price but decided to buy it because of my success with the tonic.  </li>
      <li>I first learned of this product from my dentist.  </li>
      <li>My children have been using this product since they first started brushing their teeth</li>
      <li>First of all this toothpaste lasts you for a couple of months.  </li>
      <li>Your first week using it</li>
      <li>I love that it turns into a mouthwash after you brush just by adding water into the tiny foam you&#x27;ve already created in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Decided to take better care of my gums last new years.</li>
      <li>Only complaint it doesn&#x27;t taste very good.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also hard to follow the directions at first, not spitting out the paste after brushing, but adding a bit of water and swishing it around like a mouthwash, but it&#x27;s amazing stuff, and even kills garlic breath.  </li>
      <li>The tooth paste seems to clean my teeth more thoroughly than another natural toothpaste I started using within the past year.  </li>
      <li>I truly believe these tonic products saved my teeth and gums and would highly recommend, the toothpaste, mouth wash and gum irrigant, which goes deep in the periodontal pockets to clean and release bacteria from them.  </li>
      <li>It is pretty natural and my holistic dentist recommended it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The toothpaste is worth getting used to using, especially since I&#x27;m allergic to sodium laurel sulfate.</li>
      <li>I have had gum troubles most of my life and the Tonic has worked well on trouble areas in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>... may be the best unsweetened herbal toothpaste available--if a little strong and expensive by generic comparisons.</li>
      <li>I had no trouble with this order!</li>
      <li>Used with a Rotadent and lasts a long time, much longer than normal toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m grateful that this product is sold on Amazon since Prime can deliver it directly to my door.</li>
      <li>Our 3 year old doesn&#x27;t use toothpaste yet, but this will be the one we will have her use.</li>
      <li>I tried to use another toothpaste &amp; my teeth started feeling sensitive like I was developing a cavity...</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t order them from Natural Gumption, they ripped me off.  </li>
      <li>I really really hope they change the tubing back to what they were using before!</li>
      <li>I was pleasently surprised that Amazon carried this paste.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use as much as the regular toothpaste.</li>
      <li>and this has been the only thing to help, with the added benefits of improving my gums and overall tooth health and keeping my breath fresh, too.  </li>
      <li>It tastes very different than regular toothpastes, obviously very herbal, but you get used to it.  </li>
      <li>When I stopped the major brand toothpaste, the cracks healed up.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t been using this toothpaste long enough to assess the long-term success.</li>
      <li>People waste money on lots of stuff, many times on something really useless but are (like the reviewers with negative comments) too cheap to buy a natural product (that it&#x27;s worth every penny!)</li>
      <li>Now, in 2015, the molar has to be pulled, but the Paste abates any problems I have with the tooth while I decide my overall plan of action.  </li>
      <li>- that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to look, and a little goes a very long way, making it very economical</li>
      <li>Taste is not bad, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Recently I started also using a major brand toothpaste in the morning and Dental Herb Company toothpaste in the evening.  </li>
      <li>She really likes it but said it took a little while to get used to the brownish tint to the paste.</li>

<li> I just went in for a follow up and general cleaning and the hygienist said my gums are healing extremely well.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using only fluoride-free toothpaste for the last several years, and have had significantly less tarter buildup.</li>
<li> A pea size amount will do the trick, so a tube lasts a long time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I use.  I recently missed a couple of cleanings at the dentist, not something I would recommend to anyone, but caring for others just kept getting in the way.  After 18 months, finally got my self taken care of, and the dentist couldn&#x27;t believe the state of my gums after a year and a half. Nothing but 1s, 2s, and a few 3s all around.  It tastes very different than regular toothpastes, obviously very herbal, but you get used to it.  You only need a very small amount, about the size of a pea.  It&#x27;s also hard to follow the directions at first, not spitting out the paste after brushing, but adding a bit of water and swishing it around like a mouthwash, but it&#x27;s amazing stuff, and even kills garlic breath.  I used to buy the mouthwash and put it in my water pick, but it has gotten very expensive.  That mouthwash also is good.  The toothpaste is worth getting used to using, especially since I&#x27;m allergic to sodium laurel sulfate. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Using the same brand mouthwash which was recommended by dentist  tried paste..next dental appt. will be the test in September.</li>
    <li> Nothing makes my teeth feel cleaner. It has a very herby, clove flavor, which I love, but know that it is strong. Also, a little goes a very long way. A pea size amount will do the trick, so a tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this products.  I was pleasently surprised that Amazon carried this paste.</li>
    <li> My Dental Hygienist recommended Dental Herb Company Tooth &amp; Gums Paste to me @ nine years ago due to some problems I was having with a molar (I had the &amp;#34;luck&amp;#34; of having a Dentist when I was a teenager in Houston, Texas that was scamming Insurance Cos. by doing unnecessary procedures to the barest minimum - his license was, eventually, permanently removed by the State, but the damage had been done, and it&#x27;s also permanent); I can only describe the pain as deep root and this has been the only thing to help, with the added benefits of improving my gums and overall tooth health and keeping my breath fresh, too.  Now, in 2015, the molar has to be pulled, but the Paste abates any problems I have with the tooth while I decide my overall plan of action.  To those who have never used a natural toothpaste, give it time and alternate toothpastes - that&#x27;s what I did, and still do because I want some of the other benefits of other (natural) toothpastes, and don&#x27;t let the dark color put you off - that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to look, and a little goes a very long way, making it very economical (I purchase at a Dentist&#x27;s Office for @ $10).</li>
    <li> ... may be the best unsweetened herbal toothpaste available--if a little strong and expensive by generic comparisons.</li>
    <li> This Toothpaste has a gentle flavor rather than the overbearing flavors in most toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does this matter? Because I find that I can taste things better when I don&#x27;t saturate my body with overbearing &#x27;incentivizing&#x27; flavors!</li>
    <li> Love it, leaves minty fresh coat. :D</li>
    <li> I love this product line.</li>
    <li> A dentist recommended it to me because of reoccurring cold sores. I haven&#x27;t had one since and I don&#x27;t wake up with fuzzy teeth in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Linda D.</li>
    <li> great paste though flavor is a bit strange &amp; it stained our toothbrushes. not sure it is doing any whitening.</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste I have ever used.  Used with a Rotadent and lasts a long time, much longer than normal toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I first learned of this product from my dentist.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years. A little bit goes a long way.  It has a strong minty flavor that is supposed to help freshen breath, too.  Recently I started also using a major brand toothpaste in the morning and Dental Herb Company toothpaste in the evening.  Before long, I had little cracks in the sides of my mouth.  I suspected it might be due to the commercial toothpaste, but got advice to increase my Vitamin C (didn&#x27;t work) or to use a cortisone cream at night (also didn&#x27;t work).  When I stopped the major brand toothpaste, the cracks healed up.  I&#x27;m sticking with the Dental Herb Company product from here on out!</li>
    <li> THIS SAME 4OZ PASTE COST NO MORE THEN $12.-$14. DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU SHOP.&lt;br /&gt;The product is great thou, but not for this price.</li>
    <li> Toms of Maine is now Colgate junk. Taste takes adjusting. BUT it does not have the mouth numbing clove oil overload of Vita-Myr .</li>
    <li> Our family stopped using fluoride years ago when we began to have severe allergic reactions.  Trying to find an alternative was difficult until we found Dental Herb Company Tooth and Gum Toothpaste.  It is amazing.  Our dentist is the one who suggested it along with charcoal toothbrushes.  It felt like we had just came from a cleaning.  One trick our dentist told us was to spit out the extra toothpaste after brushing but not to rinse your mouth with water and do not drink for 20 minutes afterward.  When you allow the residue to stay in your mouth, you give the herbs a chance to work their magic and promote wellness in your mouth.  We have used it for well over 2 years now and love it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  All natural ingredients, no chemicals, no fluoride (which is so bad for your health!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe that the other reviewers mentioned the price.  First of all this toothpaste lasts you for a couple of months.  You only have to use a dap of a toothpaste.  People waste money on lots of stuff, many times on something really useless but are (like the reviewers with negative comments) too cheap to buy a natural product (that it&#x27;s worth every penny!) that will prevent them to have rotten teeth.</li>
    <li> Learn about this stuff from my dentist. A little more expensive it at his office. Suggest buying it with amazon. Great taste, leaves your breath smelling and teeth clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using only fluoride-free toothpaste for the last several years, and have had significantly less tarter buildup. This product was recommended by a holistic dentist, and I&#x27;ll have to say, it works fantastic. My teeth feel cleaner than ever. I&#x27;m going to keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems expensive, but only a small amount is needed. It doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; texture of store brands, but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Received as promised. Good product, but would probably be better without the glycerine.</li>
    <li> Best! it is not sugary like Crest and other commercial toothpaste!! I think it works better then TOMS and the like.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for more than 10 years. It is so much better than anything else I have found that I have even given it as a gift. Love the toothpaste - hated FedEx snailmail.</li>
    <li> This stuff is made with clay and I don&#x27;t like that part of it.</li>
    <li> Had a lot of periodontal issues.  Decided to take better care of my gums last new years. My results improved in March of 2014 after using product for 2 months.  Only complaint it doesn&#x27;t taste very good.  Every time I went to the periodontist after that my reports got better and better.  If anyone knows about periodontal here, my teeth were between 3 and 6.  6 not good.  After using for a year in December I actually ranged between 1 and 3 with very healthy gums.  Periodontist even said how pink the gums were and how great they look.  I truly believe these tonic products saved my teeth and gums and would highly recommend, the toothpaste, mouth wash and gum irrigant, which goes deep in the periodontal pockets to clean and release bacteria from them.  These products truly are amazing.  Just don&#x27;t order them from Natural Gumption, they ripped me off.  I ordered irrigant from them in July for $31.00 they deducted it from my credit card immediately.  Sent a letter apologizing saying they didn&#x27;t have it in stock, and would send it to me as soon as they got it.  Guess What?  It&#x27;s now January, never got the product or a refund.  Made several phone calls that weren&#x27;t returned.  Order from Teeth N Things or Impressive Smiles.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 3 years and I like it a lot. It is pretty natural and my holistic dentist recommended it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample-size of this from my dentist and fell in love with it. You only need to use a small pea-sized dab on your toothbrush each time you brush. One tube is enough for about a year! I also recommend the mouthwash (though it&#x27;s somewhat expensive)</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for recessed gums as my dentist said it would be.  But it is VERY expensive.  What would it take to make it more affordable?</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! The only toothpaste that my husband and I will use. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great product, clean feeling without being &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this Toothpaste... I tried to use another toothpaste &amp; my teeth started feeling sensitive like I was developing a cavity...once I started using this toothpaste again... No pain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My naturopathic DDS recommended this product &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for years...</li>
    <li> The size if perfect for traveling via air.  I wish it was not so expensive compared to the larger packaging.  You gotta try this paste to believe it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over 10 years now. Every toothpaste I use still leaves a little sediment on my teeth. Oh and a little bit goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need to use as much as the regular toothpaste. Don&#x27;t know what it is. This stuff gets rid of everything. Your first week using it you will absolutely hate the taste. My wife couldn&#x27;t stand it. Now she keeps stealing mine. Get your own, foul temptress!</li>
    <li> Our favorite natural toothpaste.  Removes stains when others don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Giving it 5 stars because I gave this to a co-worker who has inflammation issues. She really likes it but said it took a little while to get used to the brownish tint to the paste. Her last checkup was good, so we think it has helped her condition since using it.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste !! I have been using this for years. With periodontal disease I have regular cleanings and after using this for a couple of months my periodontist wondered what I had done differently to improve me teeth and gums!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great clean feel and flavor. Healthy herbs actually feel it doing your mouth good. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this price on Amazon. My dentist charges $10+ more!</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about two years now.  My dentist recommended it to me.  It makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.  It gets me a just dentist clean feeling every time I use it.  I just order it off Amazon now for the convenience.  It is a great product without all the additives included.  It is all natural and I love that fact.</li>
    <li> It tastes very organic, pretty sure it&#x27;s SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) free.</li>
    <li> One of my wellness doctors introduced me to this toothpaste.  After a few times of using it, I can hardly stand to use any other toothpaste. Compared to tooth and gum paste, the other toothpastes taste like chemicals in my mouth. Even though it is pricey, you only need a very small amount to brush your teeth, so one tube will last a long time. Dental Herb also makes other products, including a tooth and gum rinse.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. My dentist has been recommending this brand for over ten years. I&#x27;m grateful that this product is sold on Amazon since Prime can deliver it directly to my door. If you have periodontal issues combine this toothpaste with the mouthwash in this brand. The taste is totally different from commercial toothpaste and will take an adjustment period initially. This product contains no sweetener nor foaming agent so it&#x27;s definitely different from commercial toothpaste. It also only takes a small pea sized amount of the toothpaste so a tube will last for several months.  Once you get acclimated to this brand you will never go back to commercial toothpaste again.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s a very good Tooth paste with mint, your teeth will be white &amp; healthy ,obesely I buy this Item for my friend and he is very happy he cannot live with out this tooth paste.</li>
    <li> My wife &amp; I have been using this toothpaste for over 7 years and have a hard time using any other products if we run out.  We buy it at our dentist&#x27;s for $14.  After using it for a short time you will be amazed at your negative reaction to the big name tooth pastes and even some of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones.  This one seems to be in a class by itself, although I have not tested every toothpaste on the market.  This is one of those products that you will not do without after food, water, clothing, shelter, and eternal security are assured.  One tube lasts me about 3 months.  My teeth are white, my gums have stopped receding and are coming back, and overall oral health is improving.  Our 3 year old doesn&#x27;t use toothpaste yet, but this will be the one we will have her use.</li>
    <li> I had no trouble with this order!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommends and sells this toothpaste.  It feels great on my teeth, makes them super clean and shiny in a non-artificial way and tastes great too!  I love that it turns into a mouthwash after you brush just by adding water into the tiny foam you&#x27;ve already created in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I use this toothpaste and I started oil pulling with unrefined sesame oil everyday and my mouth, gums, and teeth feel excellent!  I used to have tons of sensitivity due to gum recession from grinding and so far no sensitivity.  Hooray!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t been using this toothpaste long enough to assess the long-term success.</li>
    <li> Ever since Tom&#x27;s of Maine got gobbled up, I&#x27;ve been looking a a replacement. Now, I&#x27;ve found one.</li>
    <li> I love love this product! My children have been using this product since they first started brushing their teeth and they have never had a cavity. I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using it too. My only issue today is that they recently changed the tubing which now the product is not testing on to all four polarities. I really really hope they change the tubing back to what they were using before! Because I can&#x27;t find anything comparable....</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this toothpaste.  Taste is not bad, and a little goes a long way.  Mouth feels great afterwards.</li>
    <li> The family love the toothpaste it great came in just in time thanks</li>
    <li> Great healthy toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste. My holistic dentist recommended this to me 6 months ago and have been using it ever since. I just went in for a follow up and general cleaning and the hygienist said my gums are healing extremely well. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste after using the Tooth and Gum Tonic which was recommended by my dentist.  I have had gum troubles most of my life and the Tonic has worked well on trouble areas in my mouth.  The tooth paste seems to clean my teeth more thoroughly than another natural toothpaste I started using within the past year.  I was hesitant to purchase this product because of the price but decided to buy it because of my success with the tonic.  I was used to the taste because the tonic was even stronger but both products leave your mouth feeling and smelling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Too pricey otherwise five stars</li>
