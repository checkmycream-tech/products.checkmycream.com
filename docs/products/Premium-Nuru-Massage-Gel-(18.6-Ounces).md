      <li>I recommend it for many things :) .</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this, because it wasn&#x27;t the massage gel</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It works best if you use it after you get out of the shower and your skin is still wet</li>
      <li>I love the feel of this gel, glides on smoothly.</li>
      <li>but it really does work good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor</li>
      <li>Being 9 months pregnant, I did not use it the way it says to, as i am accident prone already and didn&#x27;t want to injure myself or my boyfriend (not to mention it doesn&#x27;t state if it is safe for pregnancy or not).</li>
      <li>This was a interesting product but also was fun</li>
      <li>and I would recommend it to others I would also suggest you get a vinyl bed cover even a cheap one would work as it say it does not stain the sheets</li>
      <li>My partner and I have tried many different products and this Nuru massage gel from Nuru Gel is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I saw massage gel and got excited.</li>
      <li>This oil is very good, is thick , it works fine and comes easily after a bath or .</li>
      <li>Very nice massage gel thick and nice consistency.</li>
      <li>so i have been looking for something that would help my family give me a good deep muscle rub.</li>
      <li>It feels very silky which I love.</li>
      <li>in all, we had a good time with it, keeping in mind the things above.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the only way to give a partner an Erotic massage.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price</li>
      <li>I also love that the product is made from natural seaweed, which gives the massage experience a far more authentic feel.</li>
      <li>It is very slippery but works great for regular body massages, not just body to body massages.</li>
      <li>Very nice oil, will dry out quickly if you have a fan on, but has a very nice slick feel.</li>
      <li>but it can be a little messes but make for a great massage gel</li>
      <li>husband really liked getting the massage and did not dry up really fast</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to engage in the Japanese art of nuru massage, choosing the right massage gel is very important.</li>
      <li>Far too easy to spill all over the place.</li>
      <li>you dont have to use very much at all</li>
      <li>Seems to go a lot further and work a lot better that way.</li>
      <li>Just be cautious, as it is very slippery!</li>
      <li>I liked the product, but it was a little sticky afterwards.</li>
      <li>Very slippery.  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t need reapplied as much as others we have used.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend putting it in a bowl of warm/hot water and applying it that way.  </li>
      <li>Before I found out I had a rare back condition, my dream job was to become a massage therapist.</li>
      <li>it was a new experience for me</li>
      <li>I know the purpose of this gel is to be extremely slippery for full contact massages, but be prepared as this stuff is seemingly &amp;#34;take away your touch sensation&amp;#34; slippery.  </li>
      <li>The gel is very slippery and easy to apply since it is not too thick or watery.</li>
      <li>top of that, no pun intended, you absolutely need a raft of sorts or the very least some vinyl sheets to go underneath you.  </li>
      <li>we just used an old blanket</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>It is just the right consistency so as to attain the perfect nuru experience, and it is thick enough to avoid excessive mess.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use as much as they say, obviously, but used a small amount and it allowed my hands to easily glide over my boyfriends back, but he could still feel me rubbing it.</li>
      <li>As in, so slippery you can&#x27;t really even feel the other person underneath.  </li>

<li> , i would also recommend using old sheets and putting a towel down on the bed to prevent getting your bed wet.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d recommend a raft because with the sheets you are going to push this stuff all over the floor, and the last thing you want is to step on this stuff on some hard wood</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands and I must say this brand sucks.</li>

    <li> This massage gel is great if you use it right. It works best if you use it after you get out of the shower and your skin is still wet, i would also recommend using old sheets and putting a towel down on the bed to prevent getting your bed wet. It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, it&#x27;s great to use with your partner for a sensual massage. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands and I must say this brand sucks. The nuru gel is not as slippery and wipes off very easily. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brand, I would definitely go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> works great. husband really liked getting the massage and did not dry up really fast</li>
    <li> This was a interesting product but also was fun it was a new experience for me and I would recommend it to others I would also suggest you get a vinyl bed cover even a cheap one would work as it say it does not stain the sheets but it can be a little messes but make for a great massage gel</li>
    <li> very good for your skin,makes you skin look young again.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product at a discount for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;I have many muscle problems so i have been looking for something that would help my family give me a good deep muscle rub.We tried this and it does work good you dont have to use very much at all but i definatly would recommend putting something under you as this will not come out of fabric we just used an old blanket but it really does work good.</li>
    <li> SliqGel is an awesome brand for Nuru Massaging.  We have tried many different brands but SliqGel, in our opinion works the best.  The gel is very slippery and easy to apply since it is not too thick or watery.</li>
    <li> Nuru means &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; in Japanese language. This stuff is absolutely great if your looking for slicky stuff. It made from seaweed extracts. So it has no smell &amp; taste so good for people with allergies. It leaves skin hydrated after application. I love it.</li>
    <li> This oil is very good, is thick , it works fine and comes easily after a bath or . I recommend it for many things :) . thx.</li>
    <li> This is a great massage gel! It isn&#x27;t too thick or sticky. It feels very silky which I love. It also doesn&#x27;t need reapplied as much as others we have used. It leaves your skin feeling soft. Great Gel!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Very slippery.  Very long lasting.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to engage in the Japanese art of nuru massage, choosing the right massage gel is very important. My partner and I have tried many different products and this Nuru massage gel from Nuru Gel is by far the best. It is just the right consistency so as to attain the perfect nuru experience, and it is thick enough to avoid excessive mess. I also love that the product is made from natural seaweed, which gives the massage experience a far more authentic feel. Great for anyone just starting out with the nuru massage practice, as well as those who are experienced.</li>
    <li> Its nice gel but gets sticky after some time. You have to put towel underneath as it gets everywhere. I took shower after getting message.</li>
    <li> I got these product at a discount, to review them and give my honest opinion. The discount does not reflect my decision and opinions about this product. I love the feel of this gel, glides on smoothly. Works well. I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, if you watched any videos online it&#x27;s the only way to give a partner an Erotic massage. That&#x27;s I wish to share. lol</li>
    <li> I know the purpose of this gel is to be extremely slippery for full contact massages, but be prepared as this stuff is seemingly &amp;#34;take away your touch sensation&amp;#34; slippery.  As in, so slippery you can&#x27;t really even feel the other person underneath.  I realise the purpose is for a close and intimate massage, but it is so slippery that it is difficult to even keep control or do anything fun with it.  If you try and use less, it turns into a powdery semi sticky substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, no pun intended, you absolutely need a raft of sorts or the very least some vinyl sheets to go underneath you.  I&#x27;d recommend a raft because with the sheets you are going to push this stuff all over the floor, and the last thing you want is to step on this stuff on some hard wood floors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, we had a good time with it, keeping in mind the things above.  Would highly recommend putting it in a bowl of warm/hot water and applying it that way.  Seems to go a lot further and work a lot better that way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT!!!!!!! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil, will dry out quickly if you have a fan on, but has a very nice slick feel. Really enjoyed it!</li>
    <li> I am someone who has always enjoyed giving massages and even receiving them. Before I found out I had a rare back condition, my dream job was to become a massage therapist. Unfortunately, that dream was shot down by said back condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A massage therapist or anyone who enjoys giving and receiving them needs a good oil/gel to work with. This is definitely that in my opinion. It&#x27;s not too thick and it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my review. All opinions are my own. That being said, I didn&#x27;t realize what I was signing up for. I saw massage gel and got excited. I decided to google Nuru massage after seeing reviews here and was shocked! I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this, because it wasn&#x27;t the massage gel I was expecting. I decided to try it out anyway. Being 9 months pregnant, I did not use it the way it says to, as i am accident prone already and didn&#x27;t want to injure myself or my boyfriend (not to mention it doesn&#x27;t state if it is safe for pregnancy or not). It is very slippery but works great for regular body massages, not just body to body massages. I didn&#x27;t use as much as they say, obviously, but used a small amount and it allowed my hands to easily glide over my boyfriends back, but he could still feel me rubbing it. This seems like a massage gel that can have many purposes! Just be cautious, as it is very slippery!</li>
    <li> Very nice massage gel thick and nice consistency. It helps to massage efficiently.</li>
    <li> It has a light fragrance, feels good going on, not oily feeling, soaks into my skin well, and the ingredients are acceptable to meet my needs.The gel is amazing for deeper tissue work and also works great for the lighter massages as well</li>
    <li> Described as luxuriously thick and a gel but has the consistency of water, not at all what I expected. Far too easy to spill all over the place.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, but it was a little sticky afterwards. I had to take another shower bc I just felt nasty after using this product.. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have tried other oils and lotions in the past. I must say none of them worked as well as this one. I will definitely keep this on hand.</li>
