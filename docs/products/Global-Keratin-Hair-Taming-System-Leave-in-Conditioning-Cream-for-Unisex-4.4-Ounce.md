      <li>you will love it......</li>

      <li>and I think this is better than many keratin products I have tried.  </li>
      <li>Light and effective product working well on fine hair.  </li>
      <li>That being said, I honestly didn&#x27;t find this product to give me adequate moisture.  </li>
      <li>My boss thought it was perfume and asked me to never wear it again around him as it was too strong and cause an allergic reaction (I don&#x27;t wear perfume) and my boyfriend hates the smell of it and says it makes him feel queasy.    </li>
      <li>My salon told me that all of the GK line was wheat, sulfate and paraben free.  </li>
      <li>Light but not sticky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for an additional leave-in conditioner for my hair to give it additional moisture, especially in the winter time, and this is a great option</li>
      <li>so well I rarely use the GK serum any more and it doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy look.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>I put it on after i wash my hair and my hair is soft and it also smells really good .</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful- works great and you only need a small amount.</li>
      <li>Originally it was a gift</li>
      <li>I live in a warm climate and my hair tends to get frizzy, but this product eliminates the friz everytime.</li>
      <li>this product leaves my hair full of moisture.</li>
      <li>Nice texture, not heavy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also Experienced less breakage.</li>
      <li>My hair looks healthy and feels so soft.</li>
      <li>I have tried a million smoothing products and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>and they say this right on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping ..</li>
      <li>Light weight, not stiff or sticky.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to really work!</li>
      <li>I can skip flat iron most of the time.  </li>
      <li>My hair is dry and curly, and it makes it look very healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>However, all three products seem to work very well together.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer my</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>Works well on my daughter&#x27;s hair which has a very curly texture.  </li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>Priced reasonably.</li>
      <li>You do not have to use much of it all all</li>
      <li>I have very curly/dry hair</li>
      <li>Love this - does what the products states and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down,</li>
      <li>I put a little bit in my hair when it&#x27;s freshly washed and after blow-drying it, it comes out sleek and smooth with no fly-a-ways.</li>
      <li>Works very well and made my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate and just a bit of this cream makes my hair easy to style - no fly-away ends.</li>
      <li>Used other brands but better results with this product,highly recommended for that natural look.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, I use just about a quarter size because I have sooo much thick hair.</li>
      <li>My single favorite slightly above this product is Do brand Cooling Serum, a spray in styling potion.</li>
      <li>Compliments the shampoo and regular conditioner nicely without being too heavy.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>I used this product while vacationing in sunny southwest Florida several times a day to keep my hilighted hair from becoming dry and brittle.</li>
      <li>Once hair dries leaves ends every soft and moisturized!</li>
      <li>Okay, for some background - I have high lift platinum bleach blonde hair taken up from my natural dark brown.  </li>
      <li>Hair looks natural and soft, not stiff or sticky.</li>
      <li>I wear my hair in a natural style and use this as a finishing cream, it leaves my hair soft, curly and is not heavy or oily.</li>
      <li>Even when my keratin treatment is nearing its end and starting to wear out, this product keeps my hair feeling silky and straight.</li>
      <li>for a natural feel.  </li>
      <li>So you can gather there&#x27;s some considerable dryness and damage there.  </li>
      <li>- they leave my hair soft and healthy feeling whereas this just adds a level of sticky to the original state of rough, weak strands.  </li>
      <li>Would definately recommend this product if you want soft shiny manageable hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft shiny and manageable.</li>
      <li>Your hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>and when i used the product my hair felt soft.</li>
      <li>this is professional products make sure to read all instructions, my hair is thick and shoulder lenght</li>
      <li>myself already do the color myself, This product is better than the salon had,My once coarse bleached blonde hair is silky shinny locks in the style I disagree with using a 500 degree flat iron on a hi lift blonde.</li>

    <li> Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping .. The product is great , the price is excellent and you r the best seller ever 😊</li>
    <li> Okay, for some background - I have high lift platinum bleach blonde hair taken up from my natural dark brown.  So you can gather there&#x27;s some considerable dryness and damage there.  I bought this product because it was recommended to me by the salon I got a Global Keratin treatment at.  I used it some post keratin treatment as well as later on after the keratin had worn off. That being said, I honestly didn&#x27;t find this product to give me adequate moisture.  I much prefer my It&#x27;s a 10 with Keratin leave in spray and my Redken Extreme Anti-Snap leave in - they leave my hair soft and healthy feeling whereas this just adds a level of sticky to the original state of rough, weak strands.  Plus, I don&#x27;t personally mind the smell of it, but I&#x27;ve gotten comments from both my boyfriend and my boss about it.  My boss thought it was perfume and asked me to never wear it again around him as it was too strong and cause an allergic reaction (I don&#x27;t wear perfume) and my boyfriend hates the smell of it and says it makes him feel queasy.    Would not buy again and probably won&#x27;t even finish the bottle I have.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best hair products out there. I live in a very dry climate and just a bit of this cream makes my hair easy to style - no fly-away ends. Hair looks natural and soft, not stiff or sticky. It is a bit expensive but you don&#x27;t need much so it goes a long way. Originally it was a gift but I will order it again myself.</li>
    <li> Works very well and made my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> Great product ..love it and will order it again</li>
    <li> Good delivery, works good, would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have very curly/dry hair and when i used the product my hair felt soft.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product through my salon, and the color and texture was completely different.  Also, the salon&#x27;s product bottle was sealed.  Please be careful buying this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for an additional leave-in conditioner for my hair to give it additional moisture, especially in the winter time, and this is a great option</li>
    <li> I had the deep GK protein treatment at the salon, and have used GK shampoo, conditioner since.  Then I added this leave-in conditioner for styling, blow dry.  It works well enough I can skip flat iron most of the time.  Smell is very pleasant.  Nice texture, not heavy or greasy.  My single favorite slightly above this product is Do brand Cooling Serum, a spray in styling potion.</li>
    <li> I have tried a million smoothing products and this is by far my favorite. I put a little bit in my hair when it&#x27;s freshly washed and after blow-drying it, it comes out sleek and smooth with no fly-a-ways. I gave some to my co-worker to try and she also loves it.</li>
    <li> Product packaging was broken and contents leaking. Product consistency feels watered down? Almost appears to be a used container that was refilled. Very unsatisfied. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> My salon told me that all of the GK line was wheat, sulfate and paraben free.  I&#x27;ve used the shampoo and regular conditioner and they say this right on the bottle.  But the salon was sold out so I ordered this off of the internet.  When it arrived I discovered that it has wheat, sulfate and paraben! I&#x27;m severely disappointed that GK would make a chemical and allergen filled product and market it under a label that salons are recommending for its allergen and harsh chemical free status.</li>
    <li> Just a little bit is all it takes.  Your hair is soft and manageable.  It leaves your hair with no frizz, even on the most humid days.</li>
    <li> Lovely product! My hair is dry and curly, and it makes it look very healthy and soft. Make sure your hair is not dry when you use it to get the best results.</li>
    <li> This is a great light weight greasless leave in conditioner that helps with styling. I love thi product! Great seller!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I put it on after i wash my hair and my hair is soft and it also smells really good . You do not have to use much of it all all</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I have very curly hair and I think this is better than many keratin products I have tried.  If you are someone who is always trying to tame your curly or frizzy hair - this product is for you!</li>
    <li> The lavazza coffee is awful I wish I could return it very disappointed worst. Has no taste of coffee. Please pick it up.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again...</li>
    <li> I used this product while vacationing in sunny southwest Florida several times a day to keep my hilighted hair from becoming dry and brittle. My hair is soft shiny and manageable. I still use it daily now that I&#x27;m back home in Ohio.</li>
    <li> I am a retired colorist, I was moving to another state so I lost my stylist,I was going for Kerratin treatment I am a hi lift platinum with coarse hair,So decided to do my keratin treatments myself already do the color myself, This product is better than the salon had,My once coarse bleached blonde hair is silky shinny locks in the style I disagree with using a 500 degree flat iron on a hi lift blonde. I set it for 430Degrees,my flat iron is one side titanium and one side enamel so. I just turn it over on second pass,Good luck this is professional products make sure to read all instructions, my hair is thick and shoulder lenght I got 10-11 treatments out of the 10.0 oz bottle a little bit goes a long way</li>
    <li> This is the best product!  I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, in fact the only time I can tell a difference is when I DON&#x27;T use it, and that would be an accident.</li>
    <li> Light weight, not stiff or sticky.  Eliminates a lot of frizz and can be used alone without other gels, etc. for a natural feel.  I&#x27;ve been using this as my main &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; for about 9 months and rarely use anything else except a little finishing serum for shine.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, I use just about a quarter size because I have sooo much thick hair. Once hair dries leaves ends every soft and moisturized!</li>
    <li> I begrudingly use the GK shampoo and conditioner to extend the life of my keratin tratments, but this stuff is fantastic!! I smooth it on damp hair and my brush glides through!! No tangles!! It keeps my frizz at bay so well I rarely use the GK serum any more and it doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy look.  I love this leave in conditioner product!</li>
    <li> Love the ease of a &amp;#34;leave in conditioner&amp;#34; and the results it yields.  My hairdresser uses this product with all her customers.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great &amp; you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market.  Seller was excellent.  Try it....you will love it......works wonders for curly hair takes away all the frizz</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It leaves my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my products</li>
    <li> Works well on my daughter&#x27;s hair which has a very curly texture.  Helps to soften the hair so that it is easier to comb through after I wash and condition w/ GK.  I also apply to her hair before we go to the pool to protect it against the chemicals in the water.  I ordered the leave- in conditioning cream from an amazon seller but received Leave-in Cream instead.  These are two different products.  I compared the ingredient list and they are totally different.  I would recommend you check the product upon receipt to make sure you have the one you intended to order.</li>
    <li> I love the GK line of hair products.  I received the product on time, and I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the product and I use with every time I wash my hair before I do any style. it is not greasy and goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Really great hair product!  Even when my keratin treatment is nearing its end and starting to wear out, this product keeps my hair feeling silky and straight.</li>
    <li> I love this cream because it helps when I style my hair. I live in a warm climate and my hair tends to get frizzy, but this product eliminates the friz everytime. It smells good too, which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes the hair feel. Would definately recommend this product if you want soft shiny manageable hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair manageable and feeling great.  One of those products I don&#x27;t want to be without.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd order and I&#x27;ll continue to order it. My hair has become more manageable since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I&#x27;ve also Experienced less breakage. Great product</li>
    <li> Love this - does what the products states and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down,</li>
    <li> The only product I&#x27;ve used on my hair for three years now ! Love!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to really work! My hair is no straighter than it would be with just a blow dryer</li>
    <li> It works but not as good as pantene restorative.  The worst complaint is -it smells bad.  Too bad but it can still be used on occasion.</li>
    <li> Light but not sticky. I purchased this before I had the GK treatment done. My hair is color treated, dry and brittle. This stuff is great! Of course the keratin treatment has done wonders for my hair but i did also use this before the keratin treatment. A little of this goes a long way. My hair looks healthy and feels so soft.</li>
    <li> Quality product for hair care. Used other brands but better results with this product,highly recommended for that natural look. Priced reasonably.</li>
    <li> Light and effective product working well on fine hair.  Compliments the shampoo and regular conditioner nicely without being too heavy.</li>
    <li> This is a really good conditioner!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful- works great and you only need a small amount. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after my regular conditioner</li>
    <li> this product leaves my hair full of moisture. functional keratin is the best for hair</li>
    <li> I use this with the Global Keratin Moisturizing Duo Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  Using all three gives my hair a wonderful straightening and smoothing effect and takes out all the frizz after blow-drying.  It lasts for days.  One thing to note thought.  While the packaging looks the same, this product is actually made by another manufacture and is not from the same company.  However, all three products seem to work very well together.  Also, as some other reviewers have noted, the pump doesn&#x27;t work all that well, so after a few uses, you just have to unscrew the pump and pop some of it into your hand.  You need very little however.  A little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I was advised by my hair care person to use this product and it is great. I wear my hair in a natural style and use this as a finishing cream, it leaves my hair soft, curly and is not heavy or oily.</li>
