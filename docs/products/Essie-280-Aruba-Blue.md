      <li>and it still looks good.  </li>
      <li>I really love this color and could not find it in stores anywhere!</li>
      <li>but I still love it!</li>
      <li>I think its a perfect year around color, however, I am rating 4 stars because it does take 3 coats to really show the color.</li>
      <li>Absolutely one of the best colors I have ever bought.</li>

      <li>I get so many compliments on it too.</li>
      <li>My boss loved the shade so much, that I had to order a bottle for her as well.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite color!</li>
      <li>It stays on well and is a great shade of blue!</li>
      <li>Some of the formulas are thicker than others and that might affect the chipping factor but this polish is best with at least 2 coats and a top coat.</li>
      <li>I recommend this blue to anyone that loves bright bold colors!</li>
      <li>This is by far my most favorite color.</li>
      <li>I got this, its going to be rocking all summer, definitely going to be looking good on the toes in the sand this summer.</li>
      <li>I love this color so much</li>
      <li>It goes on so smooth and easy that you can really see the quality of the nail polish.</li>
      <li>This color is so bold and upbeat however it does take a couple of coats and a top coat to show up really well.</li>
      <li>It also seemed to chip rather quickly.</li>
      <li>And without more than one coat or at least one coat without a top coat it starts chipping easily.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of a awesome blue metal flake paint job that we had on a old Ford Galaxy, it&#x27;s deep and intense.</li>
      <li>Aruba Blue is a very pretty color and Essie is a good brand overall.</li>
      <li>I love this blue!</li>

      <li>It matches everything I wear and is very flattering with my skin tone.</li>
      <li>It is shiny and vibrant as a color in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and normally they chip</li>
      <li>The reason that&#x27;s a problem is because this does not dry fast at all!</li>
      <li>Essie&#x27;s Aruba Blue only requires two coats for full opacity, and has pretty decent long-term wear compared to other brands.</li>
      <li>its a very metallic blue, that i have gotten HUNDREDS of compliments on! .</li>
