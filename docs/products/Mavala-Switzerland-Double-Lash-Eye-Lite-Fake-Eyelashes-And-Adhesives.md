      <li>HIGHLY recommend!!!!!!</li>
      <li>its amazing</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s kind of pricey.</li>
      <li>I rarely wear mascara, but want my lashes to look full and awesome.</li>
      <li>Careprost is much better alternative.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with my purchase</li>
      <li>Hoping with continued use, there will be more thickening and length.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I just wanted more thickness and more length.  </li>
      <li>how but for sure 2-3 weeks you should notice a change.</li>
      <li>I like the stuff from the doctor better.</li>
      <li>This is good for my eyebrows also, keeps them from falling out so much.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t originally purchase as a &#x27;growth serum&#x27; but after having tried many supposed lash growth and thickening products that always irritated my eyes &amp; lids and made my lashes look &#x27;bedraggled&#x27;</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>My eyelashes have gotten very skimpy with age, plus I am a face-smushed-in-the-pillow kind of sleeper</li>
      <li>Weeks now, &amp; although it doesn&#x27;t seem to darken the lashes, I&#x27;ve noticed longer light lashes.  </li>
      <li>The tips of my lashes are light colored</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I started using this about a month ago, and already have awesome new growth in the bare spots of my lashes.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully this one will work just as good as the last one although it looks like the ingredients have changeed a bit.</li>
      <li>I had one spot on one eye where all my eyelashes had fallen out for some unknown reason, after using this THEY are all growing back thicker and more beautiful than before!</li>
      <li>will be ordering more very soon.  </li>
      <li>I pretty much love this product as a cheaper, more effective alternative to other non-prescription lash products.</li>
      <li>I would have even been happy with half the results I get from the nail formula.</li>
      <li>and I was absolutely amazed!!.  </li>
      <li>because I experienced zero growth in the few months that I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
      <li>I receive compliments about them often, and am very pleased that Double Lash does exactly what it states it does.</li>
      <li>This stuff is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Now, I have fairly nice lashes, not short nor stubby.  </li>
      <li>I was excited when my package came very promptly after my purchase.</li>
      <li>, I always come back to Mavalash which conditions and protects lashes giving you a full, healthy set to work with.</li>
      <li>I have very short top and bottom eyelashes.</li>
      <li>but when I put on mascara the lashes really pop!</li>
      <li>it is different with everyone you have to make sure if you have rush</li>
      <li>You have to be consistent with the use for it to work.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was an allergic reaction</li>
      <li>The trick is to be CONSISTENT in using this product.</li>
      <li>I read positive reviews about this product</li>
      <li>My lashes look long and look even better when I wear mascara.</li>
      <li>Not sure about this product haven&#x27;t seen any good results yet ..  </li>
      <li>You live and you learn, right?</li>
      <li>Hasn&#x27;t done much for my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Again expect eye itching not but not irritating itching.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes really got longer, I couldn&#x27;t believe it</li>
      <li>still hoping as I really wanted this to work as well as the Mavala nails</li>
      <li>Very faithful to treatment.. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my lashes</li>
      <li>I never write reviews but this product really works.</li>
      <li>In 6 weeks my eyelashes grew so much that I had to cut them.</li>
      <li>This really works been using it for years.</li>
      <li>When I do wear mascara, I have to be careful because I go from a light coat to whoa!</li>
      <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much growth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not much change with my eyebrows yet.</li>
      <li>Try it out, really works.</li>
      <li>but they are much fuller.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference with this product.</li>
      <li>It is very convenient.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other items that claimed to regrow lashes and none worked.  </li>
      <li>most lash conditioning/growth products, it takes a few weeks of consistent use to show results.</li>
      <li>I started using RapidLash serum on my lash-line at night, and generously coating the full of my lashes with the Double Lash serum.  </li>
      <li>it irritated my eyes when I applied too much and some got into them, and it doesn&#x27;t discriminate where it encourages new growth.</li>
      <li>(though 1960s/70s era mascaras might just have been less healthy, I&#x27;m not sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>the older I get</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re long, lush and strong again even though i have to wear glasses all day.  </li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t have the same risk of darkening the iris as the chemicals in the other popular products.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed longer lashes and a little more volume.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try something with a little more strength and got a bottle of Royal Lashes.</li>
      <li>It was kind of hard to find</li>
      <li>It does seem to make them thicker (I&#x27;ve noticed new growth)</li>
      <li>Mostly new growth.</li>
      <li>wow!  </li>
      <li>When I first started using it my lashes were barely above my eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Ive tried other products, even the more expensive kind</li>
      <li>I went in with high hopes as I use the Mavala for nails which is absolutely fantastic and expected the same results from the eyelash serum.......</li>
      <li>My lashes are now long (hit my glasses) and much thicker (does not darken your lashes), and with mascara WOW!!</li>
      <li>they are not as lush as in my youth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This worked wonderfully. The strength of the eyelashes became clear, less fell out, and so the entire eye looked like it had thick dense lashes. I began receiving compliments from friends about the length. I do not think this product actually did anything for length, I just think the nutrition system kept lashes from falling out and thus the denseness was the compliment contributor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had very little irritation, and no problem in the am after leaving it in.</li>
    <li> Nope doesn&#x27;t do anything for anything..waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as I  expected .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over two years. I use this every other night and my lashes are nice, long and thick. I stopped using mascara and eye make up just a couple months ago and I noticed my lashes had gotten stronger and healthier. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> I have been using it for at least a month now... I didn&#x27;t see much growth. I decided to try something with a little more strength and got a bottle of Royal Lashes. I was really amazed to see results in less than 2 weeks! It was kind of hard to find but I got mine from royalcosmetics.net</li>
    <li> helps lashes stay strong and look beautiful</li>
    <li> they were getting thinned by my glasses.  bought this and problem solved!  they&#x27;re long, lush and strong again even though i have to wear glasses all day.  great product.  will be ordering more very soon.  one bottle lasts a long time.  good price, great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as directed for a few. Weeks now, &amp; although it doesn&#x27;t seem to darken the lashes, I&#x27;ve noticed longer light lashes.  I also haven noticed them thickening..,.at least. Not yet!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would work but am impressed after 1 month of use. Definitely a lot longer lashes. Will continue to use to make them fuller. Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I started to use it and have 0 result compere to my previous experience with other product.&lt;br /&gt;First and last time.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes really got longer, I couldn&#x27;t believe it, Yes, it works, for such a small amount of money its worth trying.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well and quick for your lashes, seen results in 12 days (as long as you apply morning and night).&lt;br /&gt;Not so much for my eyebrows, I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few weeks, mine are &amp;#34;over tweezed&amp;#34;  and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fill out my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;It just makes my eyebrows that I already have grow longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall recommendable product.&lt;br /&gt;For your Lashes.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I am a fan of foreign beauty products.</li>
    <li> Used to grow hair on eyebrows and make eye lashes longer.  Working.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for one week my lashes fall every day :\ every morning i wake up and found lashes around my eyes</li>
    <li> So far so good. Eye brows seem to be responding.</li>
    <li> Well... amazon does great job shipping, customer service is great, product looked good, price is ok... but after 4 weeks of using it - I honestly do not see any difference in my thin short eyelashes... I tried everything... rubbing them with castor oil, coconut oil...oy... everything...even exorcism... my eyelashes just do not want to grow... I read positive reviews about this product so I thought I&#x27;ll try but so far nothing... nada, null.... I&#x27;ll keep on applying this product - I have nothing to lose ( besides my eyelashes) :/</li>
    <li> Definitely  works to grow and thicken lashes. You see results within a few uses of application. Try it out, really works.</li>
    <li> I have been using for 6 weeks now and am very sad to say I am not seeing any results. I went in with high hopes as I use the Mavala for nails which is absolutely fantastic and expected the same results from the eyelash serum.......I would have even been happy with half the results I get from the nail formula. I will continue to use until the bottle is empty just in case my eyelashes are lazy and slow to respond........still hoping as I really wanted this to work as well as the Mavala nails</li>
    <li> This product works so well that both my eyelashes and eyebrows are now full and thick.  I receive compliments about them often, and am very pleased that Double Lash does exactly what it states it does.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of days so, I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!! It does take a little time but its worth it. I used to get this product from a magazine called time for me but they stopped selling it. I was so very happy to find this on amazon, my go to place! This goes on like mascara and I would use it at night before bed but would also put some on in the morning. If you do it everyday you will notice a difference within 3 weeks. Ive tried other products, even the more expensive kind and none of them worked liked this! I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I am buying this. Hopefully this one will work just as good as the last one although it looks like the ingredients have changeed a bit.</li>
    <li> it is different with everyone you have to make sure if you have rush you have to stop</li>
    <li> There is a noticeable difference in the length of my lashes after using this! My son even asked me if I was wearing false lashes one day! I am pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen difference.. Very faithful to treatment.. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my lashes just haven&#x27;t seen length or thickness...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve moved on with different product...</li>
    <li> Good product.  It takes a while to start working but I&#x27;ve noticed longer lashes and a little more volume.  Hoping with continued use, there will be more thickening and length.  Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> For my entire life, I&#x27;ve had short, sparse, stick-straight lashes (which I credit to my partial Thai heritage).  In the last two months, my lashes have tripled in volume, length and sheer number.  I started using RapidLash serum on my lash-line at night, and generously coating the full of my lashes with the Double Lash serum.  I was skeptical about any product truly being able to help me achieve the lashes of my dreams, but the combination of these two products has done that!</li>
    <li> This product is great. It does what it says.  It is very convenient. It&#x27;s a great product but I think it&#x27;s kind of pricey. Overall I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I lost a portion of my eyelashes after having my last child almost two years ago.  I&#x27;ve tried many other items that claimed to regrow lashes and none worked.  I&#x27;ve tried different vitamins including Biotin and that didn&#x27;t help either.  I started using this about a month ago, and already have awesome new growth in the bare spots of my lashes.  This stuff is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I first found this product several years ago, but just recently started using it again regularly as part of my morning routine. I rarely wear mascara, but want my lashes to look full and awesome. I have noticed an increase in both density and length. Mostly new growth. When I do wear mascara, I have to be careful because I go from a light coat to whoa! on coat number two. This is a great product for maintenance.</li>
    <li> See no difference what a waste of money</li>
    <li> Excellent for the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Mine are always soft &amp; long when I use this&lt;br /&gt;Apply every night at bed</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. At all.</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for over two years.  It does work, my lashes are not only longer but they are much fuller.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes have gotten very skimpy with age, plus I am a face-smushed-in-the-pillow kind of sleeper so my left eyelashes really looked a mess.  I tried this product a few months ago and I was absolutely amazed!!.  My lashes are now long (hit my glasses) and much thicker (does not darken your lashes), and with mascara WOW!! and without well,  I have my lashes of my youth back (I am 64).  Great product</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, and my lashes started to fell off. Now they are less than before, same size. Not what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I have tried Loreals sticky product and I prefer Double Lash. I can start seeiing a difference after 2 weeks of use. My eyelashes will never be longer than they are, but Double Lash keeps them from falling out &amp; having bare spaces. This is good for my eyebrows also, keeps them from falling out so much. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I feel it strengthens your lashes.</li>
    <li> For a non-invasive lash and brow conditioner/lengthener, you cannot beat the price. I don&#x27;t know what makes this product work but it doesn&#x27;t have the same risk of darkening the iris as the chemicals in the other popular products. I use it night and morning, under my mascara, have been doing so for two years on and off. You have to be consistent with the use for it to work. The times when I was running low or it just fell out of my routine, my lashes went back to normal. I have average lashes, not too short but the older I get they are not as lush as in my youth. It is gentle, many eye creams give me bad reactions but not this product. It lengthens the lashes but you need mascara to see it. The tips of my lashes are light colored but when I put on mascara the lashes really pop! And not in a creepy spidery way like those other products that make lashes wayyyy toooo long for mother nature! I was out to dinner with my husband and he asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes. Nope! Works on eyebrows too... sometimes too well that you have to pluck where the brush accidentally put the formula. A bonus is it works as an eyebrow gel to hold them in place. No need for the spendy cosmetic eyebrow gels anymore.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any difference in lash length or volume</li>
    <li> I have very short top and bottom eyelashes. I&#x27;ve been using Mavala for about a month. When I first started using it my lashes were barely above my eyeliner. I have permanent eyeliner and it is about 1/8th inch thick. No my lashes are about twice that long! With mascara they are gorgeous!! I&#x27;ve never had lashes this long before. I love Mavala and will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I like the stuff from the doctor better.</li>
    <li> Been using seems to work no toxic smell. No irritation.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this product haven&#x27;t seen any good results yet ..  Telling u the truth don&#x27;t know how long I have to wait..</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but my lashes seem thicker and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;Not much change with my eyebrows yet.</li>
    <li> Careprost is much better alternative. The results are undeniable. Your friends will notice the increase in length in just 3 weeks after use. I bought mine on maximumlashes.com. Try it out..its amazing</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of this product for over two years and don&#x27;t plan on stopping.  My lashes look long and look even better when I wear mascara. The bottle lasts about 4-6 months.</li>
    <li> I was excited when my package came very promptly after my purchase. When I opened up the package, I saw that the product was competely shattered and the product was entirely dried up. I would NOT purchase this product if I were you....</li>
    <li> I pretty much love this product as a cheaper, more effective alternative to other non-prescription lash products. I&#x27;ve tried Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Lashes to Die For, and GrandLash MD&#x27;s conditioner as well. I liked both, but they seemed to take much longer to show results and were also extremely expensive ($125 and $75 respectively when I last purchased). This product is slightly different (a brush application like mascara rather than a thin dabbing brush for the lash line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most lash conditioning/growth products, it takes a few weeks of consistent use to show results. I used it twice a day for about two months before I saw an obvious difference in my lashes. It does seem to make them thicker (I&#x27;ve noticed new growth), they grow longer, and I see far less lash loss on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to note, however: I already have fairly long lashes, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with sparseness. I also don&#x27;t use eye makeup or mascara- I&#x27;m not sure if this is still true of modern products, but my mother always used to claim that mascara use ruined her lashes when she was younger (though 1960s/70s era mascaras might just have been less healthy, I&#x27;m not sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might want to watch as you use it though- it irritated my eyes when I applied too much and some got into them, and it doesn&#x27;t discriminate where it encourages new growth. I didn&#x27;t have the same experience as another reviewer mentioned (basically growing a lash out a tearduct....aaaak) but it does occasionally make them grow closer to the inside of the eyelid if you don&#x27;t watch how you apply it. I haven&#x27;t had any problems though, and it makes them look like I&#x27;m wearing toned down false lashes (nothing crazy like &amp;#34;Kim Kardashian&amp;#34; levels of eyelashes, but definitely much longer and thicker than would be naturally possible).</li>
    <li> I used this product twice daily for at least one month without seeing a single change.I was very disappointed and would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure this works. I&#x27;ve used Latisse in the past and that works. This Double Lash I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks and nothing. They&#x27;ve darkened but no growth. Maybe it takes longer. But in the same amount of time I noticed that the Latisse did lengthen my lashes. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Have used for a few years.  Didn&#x27;t originally purchase as a &#x27;growth serum&#x27; but after having tried many supposed lash growth and thickening products that always irritated my eyes &amp; lids and made my lashes look &#x27;bedraggled&#x27;, I always come back to Mavalash which conditions and protects lashes giving you a full, healthy set to work with.</li>
    <li> This is like a lash conditioner. I think it has helped the health of my lashes, so that they stay around longer.</li>
    <li> This really works been using it for years. Keep you from looking any lashes, makes your lashes thicker, you have to use it every day.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this product really works. I used to wear eyelash extensions and for almost a year. I damaged my lashes so bad to the point i hardly had any. I am using mavala double lash for 4 months now everyday and now my lashes are super thick and getting longer and longer as am using it. Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> wow!  i&#x27;ve been using this product for only four days . and alway i&#x27;ve seen the differnce in my eyelashes. thank you for introducing my to this wonderful product. i applied fake eyelashes for my recent wedding to enhance my appearence. so once my wedding day was beautiful and so was the bride. i immediately removed the fake eyeslashes the permenant ones came off as well. i looked like e/t. scarey. lol/ in short. this product regrew my lashes was long and thick. once again thank you. i will continue this product on the bottle is empty, i just want to see how long they will grow. hat off! to this product.</li>
    <li> I lime this product. My lashes are thicker and it is affordable.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! Works just as described!! I had one spot on one eye where all my eyelashes had fallen out for some unknown reason, after using this THEY are all growing back thicker and more beautiful than before! HIGHLY recommend!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use mascara almost every day and curl my eyelashes so they&#x27;re pretty delicate. Within a week I noticed a difference in the thickness and length of my eyelashes. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, ZERO STARS for me!  Too bad ONE is the lowest option.  I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want to be $50-$100 for more commonly heard of brands.  I thought maybe this would work since it was from &amp;#34;Switzerland&amp;#34;, plus I saw a review someone posted of unbelievable growth!  Had to be complete BS because I experienced zero growth in the few months that I&#x27;ve been using.  Now, I have fairly nice lashes, not short nor stubby.  I just wanted more thickness and more length.  Well, this product is not the one.  I would not recommend to anyone and I wish I could get my $10 back.  Oh well.  You live and you learn, right?</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Hasn&#x27;t done much for my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This product works but be prepared for itchy eyes because your lashes are growing. At first I thought it was an allergic reaction then I realize that&#x27;s the product working. Yes, the itching has subsided. If for any reason the itching lingers than I would stop; you maybe allergic to this product. Give the product at least 2-3 weeks to notice a difference. Those reviews who saw a change in one week I don&#x27;t know how but for sure 2-3 weeks you should notice a change. Again expect eye itching not but not irritating itching. If your eyes are irritated stop using immediately and go to your doctor.</li>
    <li> Truly thickens and lengthens my eye lashes. The trick is to be CONSISTENT in using this product. I used twice a day. Wash my face in morning at night. Apply the double lash after washing face morning and at bedtime. Wear mascara over double lash ( once it dries). In 6 weeks my eyelashes grew so much that I had to cut them. And they thickened too. Now that I&#x27;ve used this product for 4 months, I only use it at bedtime now. If you stop using it, your eye lashes will go back to what they were before you started using them. And it won&#x27;t work if you are NOT consistent. I also combine it with Grande-lash Md</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference with this product. Switched to Latisse - actually a generic form of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked... cheaper than Latisse, and with fewere drawbacks.  This has become part of my low-maintenance ritual.  It took a couple of weeks to start seeing any changes, but once I did, I noticed longer, fuller lashes.  The lashes don&#x27;t get darker, so I still need mascara, but I&#x27;d be scared to use something that permanently darkens lashes.</li>
