      <li>This is overall a good product most things I receive</li>
      <li>so my clients are VERY pleased with my new machine as well.</li>
      <li>It is SO very worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>The control of speed is very nice, &amp; so quiet while it is on.  </li>
      <li>Love this drill so far!!</li>
      <li>I recently purchased the Salon Edge PRO Drill, and even though I am not a prof. nail tech, I do my own acrylic nails, and I did not even have to use this drill on Med speed to get the results I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I used this on the absolute lowest setting and it was powerful!</li>
      <li>so I contacted Salon Supply Store right away</li>
      <li>This all happend right around Christmas time</li>
      <li>and it appears to be made cheap or doesn&#x27;t live up to the expectations.</li>
      <li>This exceeded my expectations and appears to be very sturdy!</li>
      <li>It shipped really facet received in under a week!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot in your hand.</li>
      <li>but it does not get hot.</li>
      <li>It was still too fast to do the acrylic nail.</li>
      <li>she is just getting started and this really helps her</li>
      <li>Everything I expected and more just need to get used to using it</li>
      <li>I have had this drill for a couple of months and really like it.  </li>
      <li>I really love my new drill too,the only 2 downfalls are that I dont like the drill-bits that come with it, but I think they are pretty much standard size, If you needed to buy ones to your liking.</li>
      <li>I have bought many of these over the years that were more expensive.  </li>
      <li>but they were able to get my corrected order out to me immeditaley and shipment arrived earlier then expected.</li>
      <li>It is a great drill with lots of power and it is very quite and a lot less vibration then the last few I have owned.</li>
      <li>It preforms better then any of the other drills I have had and as long as it lasts</li>
      <li>If your serious about doing nails right, or long term, this is a investment that pays for itself in the professional results that can be achieved with this smooth running device!</li>
      <li>Not for professional used</li>
      <li>and it was faster than my old one.</li>
      <li>You get more on the really high speeds, but I doubt ill ever need to use that fast of a speed.</li>
      <li>Nice drill, hand piece is just a little heavy</li>
      <li>I got my new drill 2 days earlier than expected.</li>
      <li>Everyone makes mistakes, it is how you handle them that makes it good or bad.</li>

    <li> I recently purchased the Salon Edge PRO Drill, and even though I am not a prof. nail tech, I do my own acrylic nails, and I did not even have to use this drill on Med speed to get the results I was looking for. So I would definetly recommend this 30,000 RPM Drill to Any one, including professionals, which my Mom is, and has been for about 20 years, I Know she would love it, even doing gel nails! I really love my new drill too,the only 2 downfalls are that I dont like the drill-bits that come with it, but I think they are pretty much standard size, If you needed to buy ones to your liking. Also, when I placed my order, I ordered it in Black, and recieved the black box, with a blue drill.(?) Amazon is a Great place to order from, with fast delivery, and Most the time, No mess-ups! This Drill IS A Great investment!!!</li>
    <li> Love this drill so far!!</li>
    <li> This product is a lemon. It failed right out of the box. Drill bits didn&#x27;t fit into drill making product useless and unworkable.</li>
    <li> I just received this today. It shipped really facet received in under a week! I used this on the absolute lowest setting and it was powerful! Imagine how good this is going to be when I get better at using it! This is overall a good product most things I receive and it appears to be made cheap or doesn&#x27;t live up to the expectations. NOT THIS ONE! This exceeded my expectations and appears to be very sturdy!</li>
    <li> outstanding product, thank you Salon Supply Store for an amazing complete nail set for my wife and children!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anjelica</li>
    <li> I did not like the minimum speed. It was still too fast to do the acrylic nail. It can cut the customer&#x27;s cuticle and hurt them. It is useless for a nail professional.</li>
    <li> Nice drill, hand piece is just a little heavy but it does not get hot. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Great drill for the price however I have had to replace a few mechanical parts in the hand piece. Works well though</li>
    <li> It was given as a gift and the person was thrilled with it. she is just getting started and this really helps her</li>
    <li> love it, greatly satisfied.</li>
    <li> The drill is not really good .</li>
    <li> Just ok. Not for professional used</li>
    <li> So glad that I splurged on this item. It is SO very worth every penny.  The quality is amazing.  The control of speed is very nice, &amp; so quiet while it is on.  I cannot stress enough what a great deal this buy is on this manicure kit.  Love, love, love it.  If your serious about doing nails right, or long term, this is a investment that pays for itself in the professional results that can be achieved with this smooth running device!</li>
    <li> I have had this drill for a couple of months and really like it.  Its lightweight yet durable.  I have bought many of these over the years that were more expensive.  A year later it would break and I would need to replace it again.</li>
    <li> I got my new drill 2 days earlier than expected. I absolutely love it. I got it to replace my Vogue 6000 that I wore out. I like this one much better. You&#x27;re always going to have some vibration but the vibration with this is minimal! You get more on the really high speeds, but I doubt ill ever need to use that fast of a speed. I used it on just under half speed and it was faster than my old one. It&#x27;s a great machine. Quiet, fast and little vibration! I would recommend this model to my friends. (I have recommended it). For the price you are really getting the better deal!</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more just need to get used to using it</li>
    <li> Great drill I have no complaints the drillbits are not very useful but I will find some way to use them but I give it five stars I just graduated from nail tech school</li>
    <li> It is well made and works perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t get hot in your hand. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. The drill bits do not fit. It doesn&#x27;t have directions and is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am VERY pleased!  Absolutely love it!  WHAT A DEAL!</li>
    <li> I had an issue with the wrong item being deliverd so I contacted Salon Supply Store right away and they responded promptly and resolved it immediatley at no additional cost and threw in an extra for my troubles! This all happend right around Christmas time but they were able to get my corrected order out to me immeditaley and shipment arrived earlier then expected. That is why I give Salon Supply Store a 5 star rating. They went above and beyond my expectations and that is what makes a good company. Everyone makes mistakes, it is how you handle them that makes it good or bad. This drill kit that I ordered also gets 5 stars in my book! It is a great drill with lots of power and it is very quite and a lot less vibration then the last few I have owned.Vibration can make it very uncomfortable to get your nalis done so my clients are VERY pleased with my new machine as well. It preforms better then any of the other drills I have had and as long as it lasts I will continue to give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I love it and I received it in a timelymanner</li>
