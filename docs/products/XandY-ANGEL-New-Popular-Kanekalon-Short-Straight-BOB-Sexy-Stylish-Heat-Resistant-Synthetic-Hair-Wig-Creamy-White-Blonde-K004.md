      <li>The product also fit and looked decent so I am impressed considering the cheap price.</li>
      <li>I use it for roxy and rose lalonde and honestly I am not disappointed</li>
      <li>I am relatively new to the whole &amp;#34;wig thing,&amp;#34; but this wig has been AWESOME ever since I&#x27;ve owned it...</li>
      <li>This came from China, but arrived very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Fine coverage, but sub-par fibers and thickness.</li>
      <li>It did the job just fine for the costume.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is it sheds a bit but for the price it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to brush, light, comfy, and doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
      <li>but those things could be overlooked if it fit.</li>
      <li>But, it is nice and full ,and the exact length ,it shows on the picture, too..</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fun to put on for nights out on the town!</li>
      <li>It is a cute, full, short bob wig that frames the face nicely.</li>
      <li>Great wig for a Rose lalonde cosplay, however it is a bit thin.</li>
      <li>Great silky texture and decent amount of hair for proper coverage (</li>
      <li>The wigs hair is literally all over my restroom fun for a day but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
      <li>In my experience, I have found that the X&amp;Y Angel wigs are good, medium to higher quality wigs that mimic real hair with the color, feel, and sheen for a fairly low price.</li>
      <li>you can see right through it.</li>
      <li>wig is so soft and nice, pretty realistic</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s more blonde</li>
      <li>I do love the shape/style of the wig, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle to work with it.</li>
      <li>Looks like my real hair!</li>
      <li>Overall an ok wig for costumes.</li>
      <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s longer in the front than in the back, which is a cute style.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>exactly as pictured, except not as white, it&#x27;s more of a light blonde.</li>
      <li>Absolutely horrendous.</li>
      <li>just take care it and don&#x27;t style it too much)</li>
      <li>With careful, judicious styling, I was able to get it to be like I wanted.</li>
      <li>The bangs do go straight across</li>
      <li>I might even consider wearing it out, it really is that high of quality.</li>
      <li>I have long hair, and it barely fit after putting my hair up.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as pictured, and feels so soft and silky..</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would be more white, and not yellow..</li>
      <li>Definitely fake but great for plays or costume parties.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never worn a wig or u want to wear it for more then a few hours, then this wig is the way to go.</li>
      <li>Came with a wig cap which is always useful and definitely recommended to use with any wig</li>
      <li>It does have a little light yellow , but is mostly a creamy white..</li>
      <li>I have six different wigs all different lengths and such, and this one is my all time favorite.</li>
      <li>The wig arrived and the color of it was a darker shade than the picture, more of a gold or yellow than pale</li>
      <li>The bangs are a little long, but as long as you push the wig back and use the hooks on the inside to fit your head it should be fine.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear wigs every day, but this is the ONLY wig I have owned that hasn&#x27;t gotten really tangled and has fully maintained its luster after several weeks.  </li>

<li> is just a little shiny , but more matte, I did put some baby powder thru it, to take down a little shine..</li>
<li> The hair was falling out, it was very long, and was extremely flat.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a bit long</li>
<li> The only reason this did not get five stars is that it came with one side curled in towards the face like the photo, and the other side was curled OUT.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also very yellow/unnatural looking, and so thin that my hair net shows.</li>

<li> On the plus side the wig arrived a month before the promised due date and included a wig cap.</li>
<li> Other than that, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
<li> And,It fits well, and has little straps ,inside, to adjust it..</li>
<li> I detected few shedding already but for this price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
<li> It was for a costume but it sheds excessively</li>
<li> The hair is pretty thin and you can see the wig base through the hair.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s basically unwearable because it&#x27;s so small.</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> poor quality</li>
<li> A bit thin</li>
<li> Not a good wig, it sheds like crazy and its very poorly made.</li>
<li> I plan on wearing on my bad hair days.</li>
<li> This is for a costume, however it is not that awful costume type of wig.</li>

    <li> On the plus side the wig arrived a month before the promised due date and included a wig cap. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s basically unwearable because it&#x27;s so small. I have an average sized head and extremely short hair and you could see my hairline in the front and the back. It&#x27;s also a bit thinner than I would like and sheds but those things could be overlooked if it fit.</li>
    <li> Wig is nice, easy to style, but it could use more hair on it and some of it falls out easily while brushing, still good for events tho.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! I got it to cosplay Rose Lalonde from Homestuck.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically exactly as pictured, except not as white, it&#x27;s more of a light blonde. The bangs do go straight across but they&#x27;re just long enough that I can slightly push them to the side.&lt;br /&gt;This wig is so soft and nice, pretty realistic too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s longer in the front than in the back, which is a cute style.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this wig!</li>
    <li> The only reason this did not get five stars is that it came with one side curled in towards the face like the photo, and the other side was curled OUT. With careful, judicious styling, I was able to get it to be like I wanted. Remember to use low heat settings. It is a cute, full, short bob wig that frames the face nicely. In my experience, I have found that the X&amp;Y Angel wigs are good, medium to higher quality wigs that mimic real hair with the color, feel, and sheen for a fairly low price.</li>
    <li> My wig is a little different from the photo. Mine is longer, shoulder length, with layers. There&#x27;s no rhyme or rhythem to how the bangs are parted/styled, so they get tangled and messed up very easily. It&#x27;s also very yellow/unnatural looking, and so thin that my hair net shows. I do love the shape/style of the wig, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle to work with it.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t an X&amp;Y Angel product. It&#x27;s counterfeit. Mine came from SuperWigy and its not the same wig as X&amp;Y Angel&#x27;s. I returned immediately.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I love wearing this wig!  Will buy more</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Fine coverage, but sub-par fibers and thickness.</li>
    <li> I used this for my Rose Lalonde cosplay. It looks pretty good (for Rose it&#x27;s a bit long but it works). The only problem is it sheds a bit but for the price it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Cute. Definitely fake but great for plays or costume parties.</li>
    <li> Amazing Rose Lalonde wig!!</li>
    <li> A bit thin but it&#x27;s fun to put on for nights out on the town! (it sheds a lot so just take care it and don&#x27;t style it too much)</li>
    <li> It looks so much different than is described. Poor quality. After one use lost tons of hair. I will never purchase a wig from this company. It&#x27;s basically trash.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig, really like it.</li>
    <li> please don&#x27;t buy this if you have any sort of color to your scalp. you can see right through it.</li>
    <li> Great wig for a Rose lalonde cosplay, however it is a bit thin. Other than that, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> For the money you just can&#x27;t beat it.  Perfect for my Taffyta Muttonfudge costume!!</li>
    <li> My gf thought it was good for the price and she got a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> I am relatively new to the whole &amp;#34;wig thing,&amp;#34; but this wig has been AWESOME ever since I&#x27;ve owned it...I don&#x27;t wear wigs every day, but this is the ONLY wig I have owned that hasn&#x27;t gotten really tangled and has fully maintained its luster after several weeks.  So I would give it an 100% recommendation...</li>
    <li> Hair looks very nice, perfect for my daughter&#x27;s cosplay and a great price!</li>
    <li> Very cute, quality seems good, doesn&#x27;t shed too much, great for the price, the only thing is I don&#x27;t know how to secure it on. Oh and I had to cut the bangs. I&#x27;m def ordering another.</li>
    <li> I got this wig to look like Sia. So far, so good. It&#x27;s a bit short, but it is the silkiest prettiest wig for the money. I thought I was going to look ratchet, but I look regal like queen Sia herself!</li>
    <li> Love looking like a s&amp;#34;&amp;#34;t  it give me look I want I get all my mini dress form all</li>
    <li> This is a great wig for the price!! Great silky texture and decent amount of hair for proper coverage (no netting sticking through, and I have a ton of hair to hide up there!!) Came with a wig cap which is always useful and definitely recommended to use with any wig**** The bangs are a little long, but as long as you push the wig back and use the hooks on the inside to fit your head it should be fine. (Use hooks, really, they are there so the wig doesn&#x27;t slip off!!!!!) Worked well for my Howl Pendragon cosplay for Anime Expo</li>
    <li> Not a good wig, it sheds like crazy and its very poorly made. It was for a costume but it sheds excessively so i couldnt use it.</li>
    <li> This came from China, but arrived very quickly.  It is pretty small.  I have long hair, and it barely fit after putting my hair up.  The hair is pretty thin and you can see the wig base through the hair.  Overall an ok wig for costumes.</li>
    <li> I really do love this wig! It&#x27;s exactly as pictured, and feels so soft and silky.. is just a little shiny , but more matte, I did put some baby powder thru it, to take down a little shine.. But, it is nice and full ,and the exact length ,it shows on the picture, too.. I was hoping it would be more white, and not yellow.. and it is! It does have a little light yellow , but is mostly a creamy white.. Looks like my real hair! And,It fits well, and has little straps ,inside, to adjust it.. I didn&#x27;t even have to wear a wig cap ,under it.. and you couldn&#x27;t see any tracks, or anything.. I would definitely recommend getting this wig.. You&#x27;ll love it!! My husband does, too!! ;)</li>
    <li> I have six different wigs all different lengths and such, and this one is my all time favorite. It&#x27;s easy to brush, light, comfy, and doesn&#x27;t get in the way. U just have to trim the bangs like most bangs. If you&#x27;ve never worn a wig or u want to wear it for more then a few hours, then this wig is the way to go. So nice i love it.</li>
    <li> It did the job just fine for the costume.  No problems there, not sure I would use it for daily hair though.</li>
    <li> The wigs hair is literally all over my restroom fun for a day but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again poor quality it&#x27;s really nice and platinum blonde I just wish the hair wouldn&#x27;t fall out but I will definitely wear it for pictures or a costume party</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrendous. The wig was nothing like the picture how it was described. The hair was falling out, it was very long, and was extremely flat.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s very worth it. Yes, its a bit more yellower than the photo. So it&#x27;s more blonde but still it looks nice. I detected few shedding already but for this price, I can&#x27;t complain. I plan on wearing on my bad hair days.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig.</li>
    <li> I use it for roxy and rose lalonde and honestly I am not disappointed</li>
