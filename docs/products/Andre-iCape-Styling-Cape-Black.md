<li> iCape 2.0 is now available for purchase and is available in black and red.</li>
<li> iCape 1.0 has completely sold out.</li>
<li> I do wish it had been a bit cheaper, but hopefully it will last as long as I need it to since I won&#x27;t be using it a ton.</li>
<li> The back is not full length, but it goes down far enough since I always have them seated.</li>
<li> Definitely recommend, just plain and simple.</li>
<li> I have trouble getting him to look down when I want to cut the back because he&#x27;s usually watching tv.</li>
<li> The material isn&#x27;t very thick or plastic so it won&#x27;t make my kids sweat underneath (it also probably isn&#x27;t waterproof but that wasn&#x27;t a factor for me).</li>
<li> When cutting children&#x27;s hair, the kids sit still and play their little games.</li>
<li> My boyfriend uses this when cutting hair.</li>

    <li> Cool concept but in a barbershop with lots of lady barbers this is perfect to keep those creeps being a meat beater in the chair! It happens people?</li>
    <li> I just need a cape for family haircuts at home, and this fits the bill. The material isn&#x27;t very thick or plastic so it won&#x27;t make my kids sweat underneath (it also probably isn&#x27;t waterproof but that wasn&#x27;t a factor for me). The back is not full length, but it goes down far enough since I always have them seated. I am thrilled that it has the window (it&#x27;s actually a pocket on the inside with a window on the front) so my son can be entertained with the ipad while I cut his hair. I have trouble getting him to look down when I want to cut the back because he&#x27;s usually watching tv. There&#x27;s also a tiny pocket with a hold next to the window that I assume is for cords to come through in case you need to plug something in(?) Doubt I&#x27;ll be using that. I do wish it had been a bit cheaper, but hopefully it will last as long as I need it to since I won&#x27;t be using it a ton.</li>
    <li> I love it, &amp; my clients love it!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in more colors</li>
    <li> I love this. The design is very nice and the material isn&#x27;t too hot. Definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend, just plain and simple.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for someone.  They were very pleased and it arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Cool cape for the customers but threads are starting to tear around the window</li>
    <li> Works well! When cutting children&#x27;s hair, the kids sit still and play their little games. I recommend this for those who cut clients that are always on their phone/tablet. My clients love it!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this when cutting hair. His customers love it.</li>
    <li> BOught it for my husband that&#x27;s a barber &amp; his customers love it. Fast on time shipping. Definitely buying another one soon!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. My clients enjoy using this cape</li>
    <li> My husband is a barber and all the guys in the shop are jealous because his clients LOVE this!!! Very good quality</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. Many clients enjoy it. It could be a bit longer because when you put your ipad or device closer to your face it does pull the entire cape up your legs. But it was a good purchase and has been useful.</li>
    <li> Brilliant Idea my customers love it</li>
