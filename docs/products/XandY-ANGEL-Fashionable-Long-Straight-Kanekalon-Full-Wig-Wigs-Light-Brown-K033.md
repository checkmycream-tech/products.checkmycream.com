      <li>Absolutely love this wig!</li>
      <li>This wig was amazing</li>
      <li>This wig is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>its kind of a reddish brown</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS WIG</li>
      <li>because everything is great on it!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast too!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lovely wig.</li>
      <li>Love this wig.</li>
      <li>I love the wig</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cute wig.</li>
      <li>My daughter loves it. :-)</li>
      <li>It was made very cheaply, almost as cheap as a Halloween wig.</li>
      <li>But it for great came with a wig cap and looks so natural.</li>
      <li>However, ,i thought it was supposed to be Light brown, but it&#x27;s more of a Darker brown..</li>
      <li>and i loved it so much unfortunately it was a really light brown like a honey but very beautiful</li>
      <li>The wig barely fit.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m going to get it styled by a professional, but the wig itself is comfortable and a nice texture and color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is really beautiful, it&#x27;s long, and very pretty!&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
      <li>But, It is very nice , smooth , soft , and really long ..</li>
      <li>Mostly matte, with just enough of a healthy shine to make it look like real hair.</li>
      <li>It is super soft, but is easy to get tangled.</li>
      <li>We just took it right out of the bag with no managing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as full as the picture, but I&#x27;m sure with some teasing that it is possible.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t know if I can use hot rollers or a curling iron</li>
      <li>I tried Remington Hot rollers on it  </li>
      <li>though, I was pretty dissapointed about that.</li>
      <li>and they got here much quicker than this one!</li>
      <li>this is my first one.  </li>
      <li>wig was the first one we took out of the box and played with.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t really frame my face quite right</li>
      <li>It pretty much looks exactly like the photo.</li>
      <li>:DD everyone thinks its real and the color is so pretty.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure it has the tag before wearing and is the correct wig, and if it is not, you can return it as long as it has not been worn.</li>
      <li>I love the look and feel and how long!</li>
      <li>but I just want to know certain questions that bother me.  </li>
      <li>This wig is alright, It looks pretty fake but is nice for the price :)</li>
      <li>Everyone that sees me In it thinks it&#x27;s real hair, (my hair)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about wigs</li>
      <li>I was told ,it looks like its my real hair...</li>
      <li>My normal hair would never take hot rollers and curling irons for me would never stay</li>
      <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t want to give it up.  </li>
      <li>As soon as I pulled it out of the bag I noticed that it was already tangled and the hair wasn&#x27;t straight.</li>
      <li>It doesnt seem to tangle much, And hasnt shed at all..</li>
      <li>so I was hoping with this wig I could  because my hair was so sensitive it hurt and tangled using hot rollers.</li>
      <li>soo soft and such fast delivery!!!</li>
      <li>I used to have normal hair .  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look natural at all</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty but really long</li>
      <li>story short, I will DEFINITELY be ordering from this seller again very soon!</li>
      <li>As it says in the description, it is better to buy directly from their site other than amazon because it is not reputable.</li>
      <li>It brushes a lot easier than another long wig I bought, so at first I was hesitant to get a long one</li>
      <li>and it just confused me more no website or instructions people telling me it can&#x27;t take heat at all.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s obviously made for people with alien heads because there was an empty space at the top of the wig (it was like... cone shaped?).</li>

    <li> I odered this wig and when it came i was very disapointed its thin the hair falls out of it and its not as long as i thought it would be all in all i was not happy at all and wont be oderin from X&amp;Y again..</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this wig!</li>
    <li> This wig is alright, It looks pretty fake but is nice for the price :)</li>
    <li> This was so terrible!!!!!!!! As soon as I pulled it out of the bag I noticed that it was already tangled and the hair wasn&#x27;t straight. It doesn&#x27;t look natural at all and I would never want to be seen wearing this wig. It&#x27;s obviously made for people with alien heads because there was an empty space at the top of the wig (it was like... cone shaped?). This isn&#x27;t an X&amp;Y angel wig!!!!!!!! Don&#x27;t be fooled. Save your money and buy a wig that you won&#x27;t be embarrassed to be seen in.</li>
    <li> Love this wig. Everyone that sees me In it thinks it&#x27;s real hair, (my hair) it&#x27;s beautiful. I did have to cut it because I was expecting it to be a tad shorter and the bangs were a bit too long. But it for great came with a wig cap and looks so natural. I LOVE THIS WIG</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute wig. Deffinately not an X&amp;Y Angel though, I was pretty dissapointed about that. It is super soft, but is easy to get tangled. Will need to trim the bangs, and when looking at the pictures I thought that there was more length behind her, but all the hair in in front of her ahoulders, so its pretty thin. It will work for what I need it for though.</li>
    <li> When I got it...it looked completely different.....but I still love it!! :DD everyone thinks its real and the color is so pretty. its kind of a reddish brown (: but it  looks beautiful, and it is heat resistant!!! I curled it!! (:</li>
    <li> I wear this from time to time. No one who doesn&#x27;t know I am bald knows this is a wig. Its great. I can put it in a braid and style it often</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. :-)</li>
    <li> Hi everyone!&lt;br /&gt;This is really beautiful, it&#x27;s long, and very pretty!&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars because everything is great on it!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast too!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for everything!</li>
    <li> It pretty much looks exactly like the photo. It&#x27;s really pretty but really long so it&#x27;s hard to wear it around if you&#x27;re active. It also doesn&#x27;t really frame my face quite right so I&#x27;m going to get it styled by a professional, but the wig itself is comfortable and a nice texture and color. It brushes a lot easier than another long wig I bought, so at first I was hesitant to get a long one but this one is definitely manageable. I plan to wear it a lot~!</li>
    <li> I waited SO long for this to come.. and finally after waiting for 27 days, it finally came.. They said it was bc of the snow storms.. but I got wigs from other companies, in China and they got here much quicker than this one! But, It is very nice , smooth , soft , and really long .. However, ,i thought it was supposed to be Light brown, but it&#x27;s more of a Darker brown.. Kinda disappointed in that, but i still love it! It doesnt seem to tangle much, And hasnt shed at all.. I was told ,it looks like its my real hair... So, I really am happy about that... I just wish X and Y Angel would change their shipping info.. I have gotten 4 wigs, from them , now., and they all took longer than 19 days to get here.(in Pennsylvania)... They are very nice , though .. I  just wish ,they would stop raising their prices, too...</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted. I have bought an X&amp;Y Angel wig before, and what I received was DEFINITELY not an X&amp;Y Angel wig. It was made very cheaply, almost as cheap as a Halloween wig. It did not have the tag for X&amp;Y Angel. The wig barely fit. As it says in the description, it is better to buy directly from their site other than amazon because it is not reputable. Listen to it and use caution when buying. Also, make sure it has the tag before wearing and is the correct wig, and if it is not, you can return it as long as it has not been worn.</li>
    <li> Lovely wig. The color and length is perfect.</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price only thing is that you can see the weave a lil bit</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about wigs this is my first one.  With no instructions.  I tried Remington Hot rollers on it  it just tangled it up a bit it is made out of rubber and spiral curls for people who don&#x27;t know that. I just don&#x27;t know if I can use hot rollers or a curling iron I want to know that.  I don&#x27;t know what to shampoo it with I am thinking about Johnsons baby shampoo.  I don&#x27;t know whether or not I can use mousse or hairspray. I also don&#x27;t know if I can use Frizz- ease Leave in conditioner spray I used to have normal hair .  So all of this is mind boggling. I looked up things online and it just confused me more no website or instructions people telling me it can&#x27;t take heat at all.  I love the wig but I just want to know certain questions that bother me.  It is so beautiful I really wouldn&#x27;t want to give it up.  My normal hair would never take hot rollers and curling irons for me would never stay so I was hoping with this wig I could  because my hair was so sensitive it hurt and tangled using hot rollers. I love the look and feel and how long!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this wig with four others. Two of them (including this one) were for my friend, and the other three were for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig was the first one we took out of the box and played with. We both gasped. This wig is AMAZING. Mostly matte, with just enough of a healthy shine to make it look like real hair. The fibers are soft and extremely manageable. It isn&#x27;t as full as the picture, but I&#x27;m sure with some teasing that it is possible. We just took it right out of the bag with no managing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I will DEFINITELY be ordering from this seller again very soon!</li>
    <li> This wig was amazing and i loved it so much unfortunately it was a really light brown like a honey but very beautiful</li>
    <li> soo soft and such fast delivery!!!</li>
    <li> Is horrible Piece a chit</li>
