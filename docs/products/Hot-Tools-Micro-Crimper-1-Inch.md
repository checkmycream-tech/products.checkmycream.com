      <li>Very satisfied with this and love what it does to my hair.</li>
      <li>It is very easy and safe.</li>
      <li>and I totally love it.</li>
      <li>That would&#x27;ve been most helpful.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and holds heat.</li>
      <li>It heats up quick and it was able to crimp my hair quickly on just 320 degrees!</li>
      <li>Gives me such great volume and healthier than ratting my hair.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>

      <li>Overall, good for the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even need to know how the more expensive one performs because this one is perfect.</li>
      <li>gets hot quickly and does the job it supposed to!</li>
      <li>Takes a while to heat up but worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Looks spectacular on long, textured hair.</li>
      <li>For other hairstyles and uses beyond my extremely limited need, this would be awesome.  </li>
      <li>Works fast and gets super hot.</li>
      <li>And the crimp wasn&#x27;t always consistent.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and FAST delivery!</li>
      <li>Hot tools has always been a reliable brand for me and this product held up to my expectations.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>However, after the first use the gold plating came off when I used a hot tools cleaner.</li>
      <li>I crimped a few under layers and teased it, it gave good volume.</li>
      <li>I love the temp control and that is has a long cord.</li>
      <li>The crimper works well and gets heat fast after first time.</li>
      <li>This is amazing for creating texture in fine hair, fluffing it up so that you can create hairstyles with extra volume such as big chunky braids.</li>
      <li>Fast start up, works heart.</li>
      <li>Fantastic for adding volume to your roots, volume for big braids, and texturizing your hair.</li>
      <li>I tried it on my friend and she was amazed and now she wants one too.</li>
      <li>This works very well, has an adjustable heat setting</li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted to use it to add more volume to the braided hair styles I did, I&#x27;ve seen a similar crimper that many hair bloggers use for $160 and so far this MUCH less expensive version has been great and giving me the results I wanted.</li>
      <li>As with any other hair tool or product, it&#x27;s important to have realistic expectations.</li>
      <li>I crimp a few pieces through my hair and it adds such interesting texture!</li>
      <li>She likes it, easy to use because it&#x27;s smaller than other crimpers.</li>
      <li>Gave this to my 11 year old granddaughter for X-Mas.</li>
      <li>Totally works just as well and much much cheaper.</li>
      <li>It has adjustable hear to accommodate different hair tips and a fast heat up time.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you only crimp the layers underneath, I made the mistake of crimping a few top pieces and got a lot of confused comments on my 80&#x27;s throwback hair.</li>
      <li>Maybe I should have spent a little more on finer crimp for what I wanted.</li>

<li> For my limited need, a smaller tool that can really get in tight on underlayers, I am now trying the Bed Head version  </li>
<li> Highly recommended, you will not be disappointed :)</li>
<li> I needed something to crimp just the underlayers of my hair up near the crown in order to give hidden volume ( a trick I just learned from my hair guru).  </li>
<li> It gave my thin hair sooo much volume!!</li>
<li> Delivery one day earlier than expected, well packaged.</li>
<li> My only complaint (and its not the product&#x27;s fault) is that this is too big for what I want it for.  </li>
<li> so when the tool is at rest, it stays upright and doesn&#x27;t fall over like some of my other hair styling tools.  </li>
<li> I have not used it for other styles.</li>
<li> Everything I expected!</li>
<li> Really tight crimping...</li>
<li> I wanted a heat tool that would allow me to use little or no hair products.</li>
<li> I use it to either add volume at my roots or to help hold a messy bun in place.</li>
<li> (Someone said I had &amp;#34;horse hair&amp;#34; the other day because it looked so thick.)</li>
<li> No more teasing for me just a few crimps placed correctly</li>
<li> Makes very tight crimps.</li>
<li> Truly, I need to crimp about 5 small sections and that is it</li>
<li> Too small...</li>
<li> Not happy with the crimper because it&#x27;s very small crimps.</li>
<li> I bought this to see if it would match up to the infamous $150 micro crimper being sold elsewhere.</li>
<li> this is a fake &amp;#34;Hot Tools&amp;#34; item too.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Gave this to my 11 year old granddaughter for X-Mas. She likes it, easy to use because it&#x27;s smaller than other crimpers.</li>
    <li> I need to practice using it more, but love love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great crimper! Works fast and gets super hot. Makes very tight crimps.</li>
    <li> Too small... I returned it....</li>
    <li> Holy volume! I bought this to see if it would match up to the infamous $150 micro crimper being sold elsewhere. Totally works just as well and much much cheaper. Very satisfied with this and love what it does to my hair. (Someone said I had &amp;#34;horse hair&amp;#34; the other day because it looked so thick.) Just make sure you only crimp the layers underneath, I made the mistake of crimping a few top pieces and got a lot of confused comments on my 80&#x27;s throwback hair.</li>
    <li> Crimps great! However, after the first use the gold plating came off when I used a hot tools cleaner.</li>
    <li> My hair designer recommended this product to me, I got the item a couple months ago and I totally love it. It is very easy and safe. My mom came to see me and tried this out and she loved it immediately so I bought another one for her. Great tool!!!</li>
    <li> Really tight crimping...smaller than I thought. It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Should have had pictures of what the crimp looks like when doing your hair. That would&#x27;ve been most helpful. Not happy with the crimper because it&#x27;s very small crimps. But it works well so thank you.</li>
    <li> Works great. I know it&#x27;s a trustworthy brand for hair products so this is an excellent price! Overall, It works well to make volume for hair without teasing the hair. I have not used it for other styles.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful tool! Takes a while to heat up but worth the wait. I always get compliments on my hair when I use this.</li>
    <li> As with any other hair tool or product, it&#x27;s important to have realistic expectations. This isn&#x27;t a miracle product but does what it&#x27;s supposed to, well. It has adjustable hear to accommodate different hair tips and a fast heat up time. I crimped a few under layers and teased it, it gave good volume. I wanted a heat tool that would allow me to use little or no hair products. Overall, good for the price. Hot tools has always been a reliable brand for me and this product held up to my expectations.</li>

    <li> This tool is great for root crimping. As a hairdresser I find it to be one of the best Crimpers out there and a value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Roberts of course</li>
    <li> I needed something to crimp just the underlayers of my hair up near the crown in order to give hidden volume ( a trick I just learned from my hair guru).  This works very well, has an adjustable heat setting and I like the swivel cord so when the tool is at rest, it stays upright and doesn&#x27;t fall over like some of my other hair styling tools.  My only complaint (and its not the product&#x27;s fault) is that this is too big for what I want it for.  Truly, I need to crimp about 5 small sections and that is it and I want to get as close to my crown/scalp  as possible.  For other hairstyles and uses beyond my extremely limited need, this would be awesome.  For my limited need, a smaller tool that can really get in tight on underlayers, I am now trying the Bed Head version  (Bed Head BH309 Groupie 1&amp;#34; Mini Travel Crimper)....so far so good.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected! Works amazingly, and I am a hairstylist that appreciates volume!</li>
    <li> This is amazing for creating texture in fine hair, fluffing it up so that you can create hairstyles with extra volume such as big chunky braids.</li>
    <li> Gives me such great volume and healthier than ratting my hair. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Works awesome, heats up fast. Perfect for volume so you don&#x27;t have to eat your roots I also use it every now and then on my toddlers hair for awesome volume.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I use it to either add volume at my roots or to help hold a messy bun in place. Great for texturizing.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Easy to use and holds heat.</li>
    <li> This is amazing at giving me the root boost I am looking for!  No more teasing for me just a few crimps placed correctly and my hair is good to go!  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Delivery one day earlier than expected, well packaged. The crimper works well and gets heat fast after first time.</li>
    <li> Still deciding how I feel about this one. I guess it depends what you are trying to achieve. It leaves cut micro crimps and could probably create some cool avant garde looks. Not that good as a texturized. I have a feeling this is a fake &amp;#34;Hot Tools&amp;#34; item too. And the crimp wasn&#x27;t always consistent. Maybe I should have spent a little more on finer crimp for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Looks spectacular on long, textured hair. I crimp a few pieces through my hair and it adds such interesting texture! Great product. Easy to use and very effective.</li>
    <li> I was trying to decide between buying this one or the more expensive brand name for over around $120. I only had a $50 gift card so I decided to go with this one. BEST DECISION EVER! I don&#x27;t even need to know how the more expensive one performs because this one is perfect. It heats up quick and it was able to crimp my hair quickly on just 320 degrees! It gave my thin hair sooo much volume!! I tried it on my friend and she was amazed and now she wants one too. Fantastic for adding volume to your roots, volume for big braids, and texturizing your hair. Highly recommended, you will not be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> Fast start up, works heart. Awesome for volume and braiding. Picture is of me using it for volume example.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and gives great volume!!! I love the temp control and that is has a long cord.</li>
    <li> Item works beautifully and leaves hair with lots of body and texture.</li>
    <li> this works wonderful! gets hot quickly and does the job it supposed to! definitely a great deal.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and FAST delivery!</li>
