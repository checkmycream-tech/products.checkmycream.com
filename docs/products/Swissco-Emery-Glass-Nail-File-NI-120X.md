      <li>Yes, it is pricey, but it&#x27;s not a coarse file, which is great for me.  </li>
      <li>I would honestly recommend this file, because it does work really well.  </li>
      <li>I have a mini for my handbag and this full size for home.</li>
      <li>These are very pretty, but do not file well.</li>
      <li>These files, by themselves, get the job done right</li>
      <li>I would never use a metal file on my nails; I used to use one of the synthetic ones, but it would last 1-2 filings at most, and I&#x27;d have to use sandpaper to finish.</li>
      <li>I got my first nail fungus ever.  </li>
      <li>Wet filing is a great way to file away excess nail quickly, before you use the dry file to finish.</li>

      <li>I keep my nails pretty short (relative to most classical guitarists), but it&#x27;s important that I get the shape exactly right</li>
      <li>Cheap and fragile-feeling and only abrasive on one side.</li>
      <li>This is the only nail file, emery boards included, that leaves my nails smooth.</li>
      <li>The Swissco nail file really works.  </li>
      <li>and that the finish is smooth and well-rounded, otherwise (as any classical guitarist will tell you), it affects my playing and tone quite significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had this for very long, so don&#x27;t know how well it will hold up, but so far I love it.</li>
      <li>They are a decent product for the price.</li>
      <li>Decent file for the price.  </li>
      <li>This file, though nice and made of glass as expected, only has one side that functions.</li>
      <li>Gentle and efficient action.</li>
      <li>She likes them for the size, shape, and because they cut well and do not dull with use.</li>
      <li>: I file the nails on my right hand because I play fingerstyle (classical) guitar.</li>
      <li>I am 60 years old!</li>
      <li>A little too light weight for my taste.  </li>
      <li>The file works fine, however, only one side of the glass has a rough surface.</li>
      <li>The picture makes it seem as though you&#x27;re getting 5 files and the description doesn&#x27;t make it clear that that&#x27;s NOT the case, so</li>
      <li>She drops one from time to time and they are so hard they break easily; they are glass.</li>
      <li>I picked my Swissco nail file up at a local Sally Beauty Supply store after searching for a while for a glass file (I had heard good things about glass files but had been unable to find one).  </li>
      <li>Bonus is that you can wash this with soapy water, let it dry, and it&#x27;s like new!</li>
      <li>I was unhappily surprised when only 1 file came in the mail.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually getting ready to replace mine this weekend because I stepped on my purse (the nail file was the only breakable item in the purse) after I got home from a weekend trip about a month ago, and I found my file broke in two when I changed back into my every day purse from my travel purse.  </li>
      <li>I normally catch such things, but was ordering several items at once and had a time limit to get it done.  </li>
      <li>really like the file a little bit expensive for just one overall good product would buy another one.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t read the small print, so I wasn&#x27;t pleased that there was only one file for the price, but the thing I was most unhappy about is that it is only an emery board on one side!</li>
      <li>The other side of the glass is smooth and not available to use for filing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Disappointed. I love the crystal nail files. These are very pretty, but do not file well.</li>
    <li> Cheap and fragile-feeling and only abrasive on one side.</li>
    <li> These files are great and you can take them in your hand luggage on a plane.  I have bought them for my family for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is false/misleading advertising. It appears as though you will receive a pack of 5 files for $6.00 but I only received 1. I don&#x27;t mind the actual file although i didn&#x27;t even get a colored one, I could have got a pack of 5 for $3.75 from somewhere else. really disappointing !!!!!</li>
    <li> This file, though nice and made of glass as expected, only has one side that functions. I would not buy another from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> FYI, you will not receive what is pictured in this item description, you only receive 1 file, not five as pictured. Sally beauty supply sells these for 5 dollars, save your money</li>
    <li> The glass nail file is not the same as previously purchased.  The nail file has almost no grit to file a nail.  Could be used as a finishing file but not robust to file nails.</li>
    <li> really like the file a little bit expensive for just one overall good product would buy another one. I received a green one, tried it straight out of the package and have recommend it to my mother and grandmother.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these files. She drops one from time to time and they are so hard they break easily; they are glass. She likes them for the size, shape, and because they cut well and do not dull with use. They are a decent product for the price.</li>
    <li> very satisfied. would buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this nail file for my Jamberry  Nails. I have found that they are perfect to use in order to keep my jams from lifting off my fingernails and also to make the tips super smooth and prevent them from catching on anything.  Bonus is that you can wash this with soapy water, let it dry, and it&#x27;s like new!</li>
    <li> It worked as I expected</li>
    <li> Decent file for the price.  I like it.</li>
    <li> The Swissco nail file really works.  I have purchased glass nail files by other manufacturers&lt;br /&gt;that did not perform the task of filing my nails.</li>
    <li> Misleading photo. I received one file in yellow. I thought I was buying six files. Only one side of this file is useable.</li>
    <li> It broke at second use.</li>
    <li> These the best nail files we&#x27;ve found. They do a really good job overall and last pretty much forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background: I file the nails on my right hand because I play fingerstyle (classical) guitar. I keep my nails pretty short (relative to most classical guitarists), but it&#x27;s important that I get the shape exactly right and that the finish is smooth and well-rounded, otherwise (as any classical guitarist will tell you), it affects my playing and tone quite significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These files are very good. I would never use a metal file on my nails; I used to use one of the synthetic ones, but it would last 1-2 filings at most, and I&#x27;d have to use sandpaper to finish. These files, by themselves, get the job done right and I don&#x27;t need to polish with sandpaper (just use this with less pressure). I have never had to replace one of these files (but I have broken a couple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip: Wet filing is a great way to file away excess nail quickly, before you use the dry file to finish.</li>
    <li> Comes with 1 file, as stated, but I didn&#x27;t pay attention, and assumed that the picture was representative of the number of files. The file works fine, however, only one side of the glass has a rough surface. The other side of the glass is smooth and not available to use for filing.</li>
    <li> A little too light weight for my taste.  Also, I was disappointed that the file was only on one side.</li>
    <li> There is only one reason I didn&#x27;t give this nail file a five star rating, and that is because it is breakable.  I have fine, thin nails that break, chip, peel, and do everything else that weak fingernails do, and this file is gentle enough for the weak ones, but strong enough for my ring finger and pinky nails that have always been stronger.  I picked my Swissco nail file up at a local Sally Beauty Supply store after searching for a while for a glass file (I had heard good things about glass files but had been unable to find one).  Yes, it is pricey, but it&#x27;s not a coarse file, which is great for me.  I&#x27;m actually getting ready to replace mine this weekend because I stepped on my purse (the nail file was the only breakable item in the purse) after I got home from a weekend trip about a month ago, and I found my file broke in two when I changed back into my every day purse from my travel purse.  I would honestly recommend this file, because it does work really well.  Just be careful with it, because it is glass, and it is breakable.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the small print, so I wasn&#x27;t pleased that there was only one file for the price, but the thing I was most unhappy about is that it is only an emery board on one side! So, not that happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> i was given a swissco emery glass as a gift and it broke in half while filing my nails i don&#x27;t feel that this brand is a very good brand and my mother has one and the file wore off again not the greatest brand of glass files there are better ones out there</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s GREAT!  This is the only nail file, emery boards included, that leaves my nails smooth.</li>
    <li> Thought there was going to be more than one per description; however, it will make a great stocking stuffer for my mom.</li>
    <li> If you are serious about nail care, buy one of these files.  You can afford this!  I&#x27;ll never go back to any other file. The file leaves no ragged edges.  Gentle and efficient action. Don&#x27;t break it--it is glass--but the file is not fragile.  Comes with a protective case.  Beautiful manicures start with healthy, basic nail care.</li>
    <li> I want to emphasize that I&#x27;m not disappointed with the file itself, but was a bit confused to only receive 1 file. The picture makes it seem as though you&#x27;re getting 5 files and the description doesn&#x27;t make it clear that that&#x27;s NOT the case, so I was unhappily surprised when only 1 file came in the mail. The file itself is nice and I like the color I received (purple); plus I like the protective case in which it was delivered. I just wish I had received the 5 files I expected. That&#x27;s what I get for not reading every review though, I suppose. Maybe I should&#x27;ve gotten this or one of the several other sets instead...oh, well!

Premium Manicure Crystal Glass Nail File By Cheeky-Rainbow Set of 5 Quality Nail Files: Groovy Orange, Summer Grapes, Nature, Pink Panther, Ocean Breeze.]]</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for very long, so don&#x27;t know how well it will hold up, but so far I love it.</li>
    <li> Packaged nicely and works as glass nail files do. My complaint is the photo shows multiple files ... I overlooked the fact that the order comes with only ONE file.  I normally catch such things, but was ordering several items at once and had a time limit to get it done.  I wonder if the sellers count on this??  Unsure.  Questionable value.</li>
    <li> they are only one sided, both sides do not shape your nails-</li>
    <li> These nail files are the best.  They are perfect for natural nails.</li>
    <li> I got my first nail fungus ever.  I am 60 years old!</li>
    <li> Good file. I unfortunately dropped my on my ceramic floor and it chipped.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than an emery board or metal file.  It&#x27;s a nice fine grit that makes the nails very smooth.</li>
    <li> It gets in between the narrowest of areas and I can&#x27;t rave enough about it. The grit on this file definitely gets the job done. I have a mini for my handbag and this full size for home.</li>
    <li> Loved my Swissco file and bought this one for a gift.</li>
    <li> I have had one for over 10 years and I love it. I wanted to give some to my friends so they could enjoy the files too. A glass nail file is great for air travel.</li>
    <li> I like the glass nail file, but was disappointed it only works on one side. I was expecting both sides to work.</li>
    <li> The best nail file ever.</li>
