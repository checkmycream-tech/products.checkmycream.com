      <li>, looks great on her (;</li>
      <li>Great pigmentation.</li>
      <li>It looks beautiful on and matches my skin tone (fair).</li>
      <li>I ended up liking the color for myself and the lipstick is good, so I kept it and got her some lipstick somewhere else.</li>
      <li>and she loved it</li>
      <li>and it was good</li>
      <li>Very lovely on pale/cool skin tones.  </li>
      <li>And the color, OMG, stunning!</li>
      <li>Nice smoothness and wear</li>
      <li>(Dubonnet is darker), but it&#x27;s a beautiful color in it&#x27;s own right</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color when first applied.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for the perfect red shade and this is it!  </li>
      <li>It is really creamy and has great pigmentation.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect shade of red.  </li>
      <li>I love the color, the best red lipstick I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>Words cannot describe how much I love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>, it just doesn&#x27;t look so great on my fair skin red hair.</li>
      <li>NYX is always an affordable favorite.  </li>
      <li>I always have minimum two tubes just in case :)</li>
      <li>I use NYX Hestia, and that seems to keep its color better, perhaps because it has more brown in it.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t care I love it.</li>
      <li>I think the color looks so much better on than what it looks like on this picture.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty light brown Latina complexion, and this lipstick was the first that I&#x27;ve ever been happy with how it looks on me!</li>
      <li>This is a true red lipstick and it&#x27;s name perfectly describes it.</li>
      <li>The package arrived early, the service was great.</li>
      <li>and this really is just as good.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and dark hair</li>
      <li>I love how deep red this lipstick is - very beautiful.  </li>
      <li>It seems fairly long-lasting in that the red pigment stays on your lips most of the day, though it doesn&#x27;t always look freshly applied and may need some touch-up.  </li>
      <li>All in all a nice red, good texture, decent staying power-I will purchase this again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been completely satisfied with the red color lipsticks I buy, they always end up looking too bright for me in normal lighting.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased with it -- not too orange, just a beautiful deep red.  </li>
      <li>I have recently been searching for a perfect red lipstick after giving up years ago.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already tried a bright red, which looks good, but I wanted to try something a little darker.</li>
      <li>(For what it&#x27;s worth, some color does transfer to mugs/straws/</li>
      <li>Bought this one to have a second tube since I loved the first so much</li>
      <li>Beautiful deep red lipstick.</li>
      <li>The formula is creamy and very pigmented!</li>
      <li>It love the color and the quality especially for the price.</li>
      <li>and I love the contrast of the red color on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>PERFECT BLUE TONE DEEP RED!!!!!</li>
      <li>The color doesn&#x27;t match exactly</li>
      <li>to show you that if you are unfamiliar with a product line, most likely should look it up via the manufacturer before purchasing.</li>
      <li>And well, this was definitely a lot darker than I thought it&#x27;d be, so I just dab it on to give me a hint of color, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I found it easy to apply (over bare lips)</li>
      <li>I ordered the Snow White, which is a bright red color, for my daughter.</li>
      <li>Goes on very smooth but isn&#x27;t very long wearing if you don&#x27;t use a lip liner.</li>
      <li>I would classify this as having a slight warm undertone.  </li>
      <li>This is just a beautiful red color (you can never have enough red lipsticks).  </li>
      <li>although I did not think it feathered/migrated too much.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect a whole lot, plus</li>
      <li>The texture is literally extra smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a rich, matte blood red.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dark, very red and looks good on my skin tone.</li>
      <li>It has decent staying power and isn&#x27;t too drying.</li>
      <li>I apply color, blot, add some shimmer gloss and my big Italian lips look stunning.</li>
      <li>Snow White is such a gorgeous deep blood red shade.  </li>
      <li>It was really pretty when I applied a shiny bright(orange tone) red over it...</li>
      <li>I bought a Dior lipstick that is actually not as pretty a color, but it stays true red on me, and at a much higher price.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smear too much and it last for quite awhile.</li>
      <li>Its a pretty color , it&#x27;s not very creamy</li>
      <li>(On the other hand, this might work pretty well in conjunction with a gloss or balm.)  </li>
      <li>I bought it for a special occasion color , I have not worn it yet , and honestly am not sure I ever will</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not pink</li>
      <li>lipstick is highly pigmented and has a lot of blue in it, making it a deep, almost brick-toned red on my lips.</li>
      <li>Lots of people rave about this shade and about Nyx in general, and I can definitely see why.</li>
      <li>The finish is satin, so just a little sheen but not too much.</li>
      <li>First off, I have black hair and very very pale skin, so certain colors make me look like I&#x27;m trying to be a vampire xD</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is really creamy and has great pigmentation. It looks just like the color on Snow White&#x27;s lips in the movies. It love the color and the quality especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dark, very red and looks good on my skin tone. I&#x27;m pale with yellow undertones.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a dupe to MAC&#x27;s Dubonnet. The color doesn&#x27;t match exactly (Dubonnet is darker), but it&#x27;s a beautiful color in it&#x27;s own right and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I&#x27;ll be buying it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is just a beautiful red color (you can never have enough red lipsticks).  It seems fairly long-lasting in that the red pigment stays on your lips most of the day, though it doesn&#x27;t always look freshly applied and may need some touch-up.  I found it easy to apply (over bare lips) although I did not think it feathered/migrated too much.  (For what it&#x27;s worth, some color does transfer to mugs/straws/etc., although it&#x27;s not too bad in that regard.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish is matte.  Unfortunately, the formula is really quite drying.  (On the other hand, this might work pretty well in conjunction with a gloss or balm.)  I would classify this as having a slight warm undertone.  I have really pale skin and I love the contrast of the red color on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this isn&#x27;t terribly expensive so I didn&#x27;t expect a whole lot, plus I can totally make it work with products I already have in my stash.  3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> PERFECT BLUE TONE DEEP RED!!!!! NOT ORANGEY OR YELLOW!</li>
    <li> NYX Cosmetics has another winner with Snow White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick is highly pigmented and has a lot of blue in it, making it a deep, almost brick-toned red on my lips. The finish is satin, so just a little sheen but not too much.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the perfect red shade and this is it!  Every time I bought a red lipstick it always ended up looking too pinkish.  I hated that!  This is the perfect shade of red.  I will be buying this color for years to come!  NEVER STOP MAKING THIS NYX!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it, it&#x27;s a deep red and she said she only had to put it twice and it was good, looks great on her (;</li>
    <li> I ordered the Snow White, which is a bright red color, for my daughter. Got something TOTALLY different. I ended up liking the color for myself and the lipstick is good, so I kept it and got her some lipstick somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I love the color, the best red lipstick I have ever tried. I have very pale skin / dark eyes and it does indeed give a &#x27;Snow White&#x27; affect to my appearance. The texture is quite creamy, however I don&#x27;t have a problem with slippage / transfer with this product as I have had with other red lipsticks in the past. I cannot vouch for moisturizing effects as I do not believe this lipstick offers them, however I can say that the product was not drying in the least. All in all a nice red, good texture, decent staying power-I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> When the headline includes Snow White, do not miss-understand that the color is Snow White but rather that snow white is a play on the character snow white whom would have ruby deep red lips. Bummer. I was hoping that Snow White meant the color was a creamy white since this is an extra creamy lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes to show you that if you are unfamiliar with a product line, most likely should look it up via the manufacturer before purchasing. Hope this helps future buyers.</li>
    <li> I have recently been searching for a perfect red lipstick after giving up years ago. I finally found it and it stands out the way I wanted it to on my lips. I have dark brown hair and dark eyes and olive skin and this was perfect. I was tired of always wearing the red orangey lipstick. This is a true red lipstick and it&#x27;s name perfectly describes it. Snow whites lip color!</li>
    <li> Beautiful deep red lipstick. Definitely a shade or two darker than the thumbnail suggests, but I looked up swatches before buying and knew I wanted this color. Goes on very smooth but isn&#x27;t very long wearing if you don&#x27;t use a lip liner.</li>
    <li> Bought this one to have a second tube since I loved the first so much</li>
    <li> What can I say.  NYX is always an affordable favorite.  Snow White is such a gorgeous deep blood red shade.  It&#x27;s a creamy formula, not matte, not shiny, I would call it a satin.  Very lovely on pale/cool skin tones.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a dark red shade for years. Everything I found was too black, not red enough .Girls, you know the struggle. On a whim, I decided to order Snow White. This is now my go to red. It looks beautiful on and matches my skin tone (fair). If you need a red lipstick, I definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color when first applied.  I was so pleased with it -- not too orange, just a beautiful deep red.  Unfortunately, within an hour it turned into a pink on me.  Well, I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the price.  I bought a Dior lipstick that is actually not as pretty a color, but it stays true red on me, and at a much higher price.  I use NYX Hestia, and that seems to keep its color better, perhaps because it has more brown in it.</li>
    <li> Darker than I thought, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I love how deep red this lipstick is - very beautiful.  Like another review said, don&#x27;t bother applying without lip liner though.  It does bleed and stain, so you have to be careful.  I&#x27;m very happy with this color and how it looks after being applied.</li>
    <li> Beautiful red/blue tones.  I have very fair skin and dark hair and it looks great!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is awesome. The texture is literally extra smooth. The deep pigment comes through on the slightest swipe. It doesn&#x27;t smear too much and it last for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. The color and moisture are great. I have the MAC dubonnett and this really is just as good. It isn&#x27;t as creamy but it still goes on beautifully.</li>
    <li> Words cannot describe how much I love this lipstick. It&#x27;s not coral it&#x27;s not pink it&#x27;s red. If you&#x27;re going for the goth, blood, vampire look.. or just hott.. this color is ideal. I always have minimum two tubes just in case :) I apply color, blot, add some shimmer gloss and my big Italian lips look stunning. Except my bf hates makeup. But I don&#x27;t care I love it. Go figure lol</li>
    <li> Excellent product and shipping speed</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift but the price is great! Shipping was incredibly fast. And the color, OMG, stunning! A bit darker than you&#x27;d expect from the picture but I&#x27;m definitely ordering myself one after the holidays!</li>
    <li> First off, I have black hair and very very pale skin, so certain colors make me look like I&#x27;m trying to be a vampire xD I&#x27;ve already tried a bright red, which looks good, but I wanted to try something a little darker. And well, this was definitely a lot darker than I thought it&#x27;d be, so I just dab it on to give me a hint of color, and I love it.  The package arrived early, the service was great. I&#x27;m a very happy customer c:</li>
    <li> This definitely is not a true red but has a darker (blue) undertone. It was really pretty when I applied a shiny bright(orange tone) red over it...Then I got the snow white red I was hoping for. Nice smoothness and wear</li>
    <li> I give this purchase a 5 star rating because of the great customer service.  The lipstick came instantly.  I was looking for a white lipstick and did not realize that this is like the picture a red lipstick.  Since I searched for white and it was called snow white I was expecting a white lipstick..After the fact I realized that the lipstick was named after Snow White&#x27;s lipstick and had nothing to d with the color white.  When I explained all this to customer service  I received a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been completely satisfied with the red color lipsticks I buy, they always end up looking too bright for me in normal lighting. I have a pretty light brown Latina complexion, and this lipstick was the first that I&#x27;ve ever been happy with how it looks on me! The formula is creamy and very pigmented! I think the color looks so much better on than what it looks like on this picture.  It&#x27;s a rich, matte blood red. I definitely recommend it for anyone!</li>
    <li> Its a pretty color , it&#x27;s not very creamy and I find it to be a little messy .. I bought it for a special occasion color , I have not worn it yet , and honestly am not sure I ever will , it just doesn&#x27;t look so great on my fair skin red hair.</li>
    <li> Color not as expected.</li>
    <li> Lots of people rave about this shade and about Nyx in general, and I can definitely see why. This seems to be a universally flattering red. It has decent staying power and isn&#x27;t too drying. Great pigmentation. If you&#x27;re worried about the color bleeding I recommend setting it with a tiny bit of translucent powder applied with a small lip or concealer brush. It lasts hours longer that way!</li>
