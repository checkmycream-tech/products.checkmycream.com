      <li>Very clean and fresh on him.  </li>
      <li>It makes me feel clean without drying and the spearmint smell is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>People remark on how wonderful I smell!&lt;br /&gt;Gentle enough to use on sensitive skin, but strong enough to get skin very clean (cleaner than most oil-based soaps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large bar for the price.</li>
      <li>I was searching for a soap with tea tree oil in it to keep my skin clear, and this does an amazing job.</li>
      <li>The ingredients do not list if the glycerin was taken out of the product or left in it (some hand made soap leaves the glycerin in it which I feel is a good idea).</li>
      <li>It melts off my makeup and oil, and leaves my skin super clean.</li>
      <li>He wants to order more.</li>
      <li>Really, who thought it was a good idea to start doing this, when did we go from perfectly natural to toxic and full of chemicals?)</li>

      <li>It has a mild scent to me but there is a noticeable minty / tea scent.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t leave it in the water as it dissolves really quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this soap leaves such a clean feel to my skin.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more.</li>
      <li>I feel so clean and so soft.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother my super sensitive skin at all.</li>
      <li>I had a dry patch on my face that the most exspensive lotions would not get rid of but after Fiji it&#x27;s almost gone</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this twice and liked it, but the price is about $16.00 for less than a pound of soap.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking at soap in this price range you probably already know that it&#x27;s far superior to typical drug store stuff.</li>
      <li>Would recommend very highly.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my husband because he has very itchy skin.  </li>
      <li>Been using it for a while, it does go fast and the smell reminds me of Certs Mints.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband and I use this as a face soap and love it. He has extreme combination and acne prone skin and loves it, which is rare. This is the first product that we can agree on entirely.  It melts off my makeup and oil, and leaves my skin super clean. He has less breakouts and his skin is generally less oily. We will continue buying this for our facial soap.</li>
    <li> I like this soap.  It makes me feel clean without drying and the spearmint smell is fantastic.  I have only used it on my body so I don&#x27;t know if it would be good for the face.  I will probably buy it again even though it is a bit spendy.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. Healthy, clean,-&#x27;d really does the best for my skin of any soap I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t get dried out or feel soap residue on my skin. It even helps keep my face extra clear due to the tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft! I&#x27;d you are allergic to chemicals this soap is for you! Light refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> Great Anti-fungal Soap</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! I have been using this on my face and it looks great. No breakouts! Clearer, prettier skin and doesnt feel tight after washing. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great multi purpose soap.</li>
    <li> expensive and didn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> great soap and great smell.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;1. Unlike a few others have stated in reviews, I did not notice a strong scent. It has a mild scent to me but there is a noticeable minty / tea scent. I could not really detect any coconut smell. I also got a little bit of the soap in my mouth on purpose by scraping my tooth on the bar, and it tastes very soapy (I actually didn&#x27;t expect this) and minty. I thought it would taste like the coconut oil I use in the kitchen lol.&lt;br /&gt;2. It makes a lot of lather which is nice. it feels like it goes farther and cleans more than other homemade soap I have bought.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has a neutral feel and scent which would be suitable for a man or a woman. In other words, this soap doesn&#x27;t have a perfume type fragrance nor does it have a musky scent.&lt;br /&gt;4. This is a big bar of soap. It looks like it would barely fit into most soap dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;1. There is not really any coconut taste (yes I tried it on purpose) or smell. This is probably due to the saponification. My understand is that a a alkali must be used in the saponification. This product does not state what alkali it uses to saponifiy the coconut oil. This bothers me because I want to know what kind was used. maybe sodium hydroxide? There was a strong soapy taste when I put a bit in my mouth (I don&#x27;t think I will do that again lol).&lt;br /&gt;2. The ingredients do not list if the glycerin was taken out of the product or left in it (some hand made soap leaves the glycerin in it which I feel is a good idea).</li>
    <li> Awesome, smooth and soapy.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing I get skin sores that I have a hard time healing when the weather is warm and I had tried many strong soaps that didn&#x27;t do much but dry my oily skin out horribly that made a bad situation worse. None of doctors perscrition creams helped. I read that coconut oil was good for skin sores and conditioned your skin, I was leary because all I needed was to add oil to oily skin I thought I would end up tripling my sores but I didn&#x27;t have any other ideas...What a wonderful natural product after a few months my sores are gone and I have soft skin it seems to balance the oils in my skin. The spearment gives a refreshing feeling and a nice smell. This is a quality product, a hint though the bar does melt away fast with use when it gets wet, I cut the bars in thirds and use one third at a time so the rest stays dry(in a zip lock bag) til I need it and that makes it last longer. PS The sores I get are similar to athletes(especially wrestlers) this would really help atheletes too. Not sure men would like smell but could mix it with your current soap if it bothers you. Hope this helps other sufferers with skin sores.</li>
    <li> This soap keeps my skin from itching - something I never had to deal with when younger but now...&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use anything else- though I might try a different scent!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this soap, this amazing wonder bar. I can&#x27;t even believe how much I love this bar of awesomeness. I use it on my face and all over my body and OMGoodness I feel so clean and so soft. I don&#x27;t even need to apply lotion or oil after my shower after using this awesome bar. I&#x27;m so happy I found Fiji I love their products and Amazon prices for their stuff can&#x27;t be beat. I will definitly keep using Organic Fiji. I had a dry patch on my face that the most exspensive lotions would not get rid of but after Fiji it&#x27;s almost gone and my face looks so smooth and feels so soft. Love love love this Fiji bar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little torn.  I purchased this soap but I didn&#x27;t notice it was spearmint.  I did know about the tea tree oil though, it was part of why I wanted to but it.  I bought it for my brother who has some irritation when shaving and I thought the coconut oil and tea tree would be helpful for his skin.  When it arrived the spearmint scent was strong..plus I hate the smell of spearmint!  Not sure why but I like peppermint, I like wintergreen, but hate spearmint.  My brother likes the scent and LOVES the soap. He ended up using it as a body bar not just for face.  It is pretty big. Thankfully for me when he used the soap, he does not smell like the bar.  It smells great. Very clean and fresh on him.  He wants to order more.</li>
    <li> Love the sents, love the feel and lather</li>
    <li> Was a gift. Recipient loved the scent and remarked that the packaging was secure and damage-free. Recommended</li>
    <li> My son is vegan and into organic and healthy stuff so we bought this for him for Christmas and he loved it. The smell is really nice also</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking at soap in this price range you probably already know that it&#x27;s far superior to typical drug store stuff. This review is just to confirm that. It&#x27;s not a waste of money - milled soap lasts longer because there is less air in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is that Tea Tree Oil isn&#x27;t the most pleasant smelling substance, so if you hate it you might not like this, but it&#x27;s not a dominant odor in the soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this because in the past year or two I have geared myself to be a health conscious person. Limiting intake of artificial foods, inorganic meals, chemicals, etc. I try to eat and use all natural and organic products. Being that a lot of body washes, shampoos, etc have lots of unnecessary chemicals (Really, who thought it was a good idea to start doing this, when did we go from perfectly natural to toxic and full of chemicals?) I decided to try out this soap as it was &amp;#34;All Organic&amp;#34;. Fair enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Fedex delivering my package to my neighbors and me waiting 4 days to receive it (That&#x27;s a whole other story) I finally opened it up only to be repulsed by the smell. I&#x27;d like to believe I have an open mind but this stuff just doesn&#x27;t smell very good. I&#x27;m almost hesitant to even use it. I might just throw it out rather than send it back as it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this soap. The smell and feel is very soothing. Definitely would buy again. It has lasted quite awhile as well.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was quick too!</li>
    <li> Tea Oil Scent was a little over powering, but it faded a little now and I like the smell.  The soap is of high quality and a large bar.  I really like it and would order this again.  UPDATE - I&#x27;ve bought this twice and liked it, but the price is about $16.00 for less than a pound of soap.  That is extremely high.  I&#x27;ve researched other coconut oil soaps and found another one that is just as good and much less.  Check them out for yourself and save  some money.</li>
    <li> This is a great bargain plus an excellent product.  I am always looking for good soap and am definitely glad about this purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap.. I wish there was a way I could buy it in bulk..</li>
    <li> Oh, so lovely - a nice tingly scrub, followed by silky smoothness and moisture.  Don&#x27;t leave it in the water as it dissolves really quickly.  Also leaves a bit of excess residue, but it is an Oil Soap, so perfectly expected.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful minty tea-tree smell and lingers. People remark on how wonderful I smell!&lt;br /&gt;Gentle enough to use on sensitive skin, but strong enough to get skin very clean (cleaner than most oil-based soaps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large bar for the price. However, read the cons...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melts away faster than other soaps I&#x27;ve used. Using it about once a week in the shower with a scrub-brush went through this in about four months. A bar I used just as often is still going and it&#x27;s been going on seven months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems a bit expensive for how fast it melts away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The Whole Foods Lavender Soap seems to last for ages. I&#x27;ve been using the same bar for months!</li>
    <li> Works great, smells good and wakes you up in the morning. Definitely recommend over any store bought soap. I was surprised  how long it lasted, just over a few months with one person using everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, the fragrance is not overwhelming and the spearmint is just at the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy and I have been using it for my face and body.</li>
    <li> This soap makes my skin feel so smooth and moist. It doesn&#x27;t bother my super sensitive skin at all. I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
    <li> Soap smells great and leaves me feeling clean.  Love that it has two ingredients and that I know I am putting good quality products on my skin.  Been using it for a while, it does go fast and the smell reminds me of Certs Mints.  I also notice a burning sensation when it touches any mucus membrane.  Not going to buy again, but love the way it leaves my skin.</li>
    <li> This soap is very healthy for you! It&#x27;s easy to wash with and makes you feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;Look at the ingredients of soap these days it&#x27;s loaded with more chemicals than the Exterminator can.&lt;br /&gt;Not this soap it is FREE of any preservatives, fillers, and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Sure it may be pricey but you can&#x27;t put a price on your health.&lt;br /&gt;Get this bar today! Oh and did I mention it smells pleasant?&lt;br /&gt;Way better smelling than that other Pine Tar Natural soaps.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband because he has very itchy skin.  He uses it daily and likes that it does not dry out the skin at all. Very effective for the purpose of relieving itchyness.</li>
    <li> Helps your skin not to dry out.  Love this soap.  My skin is more moist with this soap which I have never experienced with soap before.  Planning on trying coconut oil for a moisturizer.  I heard it works great and economical as well.</li>
    <li> I love the way this soap leaves such a clean feel to my skin. I will warn you, it does have a strong tea tree oil smell, but I like that clean smell.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers up wonderfully. I also liked how the soap didn&#x27;t get all goopy in the soap dish. I am however only giving it three stars because it hurts and burned my skin when I used it. I have eczema and it really was painful to use near those areas.</li>
    <li> The best bar soap I have ever used to date! Lathers up great, smells wonderful and is a large bar which will last a long time! Only two ingredients used to make this soap!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it for my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a soap with tea tree oil in it to keep my skin clear, and this does an amazing job. Since getting this soap, I have had very few breakouts, and my skin is looking great. I am currently on my 2nd bar of this soap, and it will remain in my skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> Love this soap bar! I have Lupus which has caused my skin to become very sensitive. I have found that tea tree oil soaps work well for me, but the company of the bar I was using previously changed their recipe and started using Palm oil which I ended up being very allergic to. I have been looking everywhere for a tea tree oil soap bar for over a year that did NOT contain any form of Palm oil. Finally, I found this bar and have been very happy with it. I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed. The soap burns if it gets into places it shouldn&#x27;t...lol.</li>
    <li> very satisfied...product has a coconut minty smell..pretty great combo..also doesn&#x27;t leave skin oiley where you slide in shower..also use it for shampoo..very little and lathers up..nice product</li>
    <li> I was hoping this soap would smell good, but it really doesnt.  You dont get that fresh clean feeling from it.</li>
    <li> My daughters favorite acne soap. Good price, good product, doesn&#x27;t dry her skin. She&#x27;s used it for almost 2 years to fight acne.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Love this soap ! Don&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I wash my face and the smell it&#x27;s great also.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the soap and threw it out after trying it a couple times.</li>
    <li> Have this soap on subscribe and save. Really enjoy fragrance and mildness. Would recommend very highly. Not sure what else to say, so just using filler!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the scent of this soap, and it lathers up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the spearmint is too lively in this blend, and I don&#x27;t recommend it for any sensitive skin.  This includes face and any areas of the body that tend toward sensitivity.  I was disappointed that I could &amp;#34;feel the burn&amp;#34; from the mint.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!! Great and natural smell. I would definitely buy this again and I suggest you do to! I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more.</li>
