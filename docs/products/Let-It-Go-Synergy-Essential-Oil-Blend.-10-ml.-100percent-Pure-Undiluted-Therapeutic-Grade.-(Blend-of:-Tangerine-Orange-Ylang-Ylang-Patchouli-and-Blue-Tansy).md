      <li>I still love it though!  </li>
      <li>It also smells nice.</li>
      <li>That smells good and is much more soothing for sleeping.</li>
      <li>Plant Therapy are by far the best!!!!</li>
      <li>I was searching for an alternative to Peace &amp; Calming by Young Living &amp; this is perfect!</li>
      <li>This is the blend that has helped the most with my anxiety.</li>
      <li>They are a great company with fast shipping</li>
      <li>I have panic disorder and anxiety and this oil is lovely.</li>
      <li>And it smells more like medicine or cleaner than anything.</li>
      <li>I love to diffuse it in the evening after work.  </li>
      <li>Smells lovely</li>
      <li>I Also diffuse it in the oil diffuser for an amazing smell and &#x27;calm&#x27; atmosphere in the room.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping and great product</li>
      <li>Yesterday I contacted their aromatherapist by email and received a reply very quickly.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this oil a try and skip buying the &#x27;stress free</li>
      <li>This oil does the same magic that &#x27;stress free&#x27; oil by young living does, and it smells very pleasantly too!</li>
      <li>In fact I liked them so much</li>
      <li>&#x27; young living one this time, the price of plant therapy&#x27;s oil  was very attractive and people&#x27;s reviews actually convinced me to give this oil a try.</li>
      <li>It was a very thorough response with an additional link to learn more about my question.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with Plant Therapy and recommend you at least give them an opportunity to help you.</li>
      <li>I will also try diluting with carrier oil and applying to my skin before a much dreaded oncology visit today!!</li>
      <li>&amp; i think it helped to calm me--my new favorite</li>
      <li>And their costumer service and free and fast shipping is unbeatable</li>
      <li>Worth a try.</li>
      <li>but I have ordered several more items that I am excited about trying.  </li>
      <li>I am an essential oil novice and have many questions.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this mixed with the vetiver...</li>
      <li>This is the first item I have tried from Plant Therapy</li>
      <li>Pretty offensive.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it feels just like you are letting go of things that may be hindering the inner spirit of your person.</li>
      <li>very calming...</li>
      <li>Even better than I had expected!  </li>
      <li>I ordered other blends from Plant Therapy that I like even more than the others I used before.</li>
      <li>Tangerine, Ylang Ylang, Patchouli, Sweet Orange, Blue Tansy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included a dilution chart, I use this in a rollerball with a carrier oil and dilute it to 2%, I also use it in an inhaler.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this blend for anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately wasn&#x27;t a fan of this particular blend, but Plant Therapy&#x27;s oils are fantastic - my favorite is their energy blend, I use it almost daily in my diffuser.</li>
      <li>The same rich combination of aromas that none of the other brands come close to in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I have spoke so highly of this blend in the essential oil groups that I thought I would write up a review on amazon.</li>

    <li> One of the best.  My husband has been dealing with his elder mother being ill and the passing of a younger brother.  Needless to say it&#x27;s been hard on him.  He has been using &amp;#34;Let it Go&amp;#34; and has helped him deal with things a little easier.  Plant Therapy are by far the best!!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favs!!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> I love Plant therapy , not the biggest fan of this scent but the point of it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have spoke so highly of this blend in the essential oil groups that I thought I would write up a review on amazon. I purchased this from plant therapy website not amazon. This is the blend that has helped the most with my anxiety. I have actually taken my pulse to watch it come down with this oil. I have panic disorder and anxiety and this oil is lovely. It also smells nice. I highly recommend this blend for anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let It Go: Tangerine, Ylang Ylang, Patchouli, Sweet Orange, Blue Tansy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included a dilution chart, I use this in a rollerball with a carrier oil and dilute it to 2%, I also use it in an inhaler.</li>
    <li> This has the same ingredients as YL&#x27;s Peace and Calming, but this one smells slightly heavier on the earthy side.  I still love it though!  Quality oil, great price!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it feels just like you are letting go of things that may be hindering the inner spirit of your person.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! I diffused it in my car and loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this oil! I used Peace and Calming before but I couldn&#x27;t justify the price anymore. I gave this a try and they smell the same, feel the same and work the same. In fact I liked them so much I ordered other blends from Plant Therapy that I like even more than the others I used before. And their costumer service and free and fast shipping is unbeatable</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and I do feel less anxious when using in diffuser.  I will also try diluting with carrier oil and applying to my skin before a much dreaded oncology visit today!!

    <li> Unfortunately wasn&#x27;t a fan of this particular blend, but Plant Therapy&#x27;s oils are fantastic - my favorite is their energy blend, I use it almost daily in my diffuser.</li>
    <li> smells terrible. It might be relaxing, but I can&#x27;t get past the odor. I like the &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; that came in the Plant therapy 14 Essential oil set. That smells good and is much more soothing for sleeping. I put just a drop or 2 on my shirt for work and people came in commenting &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that SMELL???&amp;#34; Pretty offensive. Kinda like a strange body odor.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a month- I put it in a diffuser and let it burn all day- the smell is wonderful</li>
    <li> use in the necklace, smells good &amp; i think it helped to calm me--my new favorite</li>
    <li> Even better than I had expected!  Co-workers are inquiring about it.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this oil a try and skip buying the &#x27;stress free&#x27; young living one this time, the price of plant therapy&#x27;s oil  was very attractive and people&#x27;s reviews actually convinced me to give this oil a try. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this oil! I use it on my kids in the evening to calm them down and help them wind down for the night. This oil does the same magic that &#x27;stress free&#x27; oil by young living does, and it smells very pleasantly too! I Also diffuse it in the oil diffuser for an amazing smell and &#x27;calm&#x27; atmosphere in the room.</li>
    <li> Worth a try. Helped my anxiety levels.</li>
    <li> I was searching for an alternative to Peace &amp; Calming by Young Living &amp; this is perfect! The same rich combination of aromas that none of the other brands come close to in my opinion. I use this before bed to relax &amp; put my mind at ease. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells like the best thing I have ever smelled in my life just to be honest!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this mixed with the vetiver...very calming...relaxing!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this oil. Very pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I have several Plant Therapy Synergies that I cannot do without, and this is one of them.  I love to diffuse it in the evening after work.  It helps me relax after a stressful day.  My other two favorites are Tranquil, which I use at bedtime, and Calming the Child, which I use for the kids.  You can&#x27;t beat Plant Therapy&#x27;s prices either!  They are a great company with fast shipping and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with packaging.</li>
    <li> I will use this up, as I don&#x27;t hate it, but was not happy with the scent or the inky blue liquid. It it very thin, not like an oil at all. And it smells more like medicine or cleaner than anything. Will definitely not order again!</li>
