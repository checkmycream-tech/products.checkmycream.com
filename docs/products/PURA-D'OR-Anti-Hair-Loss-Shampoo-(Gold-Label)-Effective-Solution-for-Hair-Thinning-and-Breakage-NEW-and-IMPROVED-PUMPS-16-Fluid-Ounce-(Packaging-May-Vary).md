<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for two months, and I found it help me loss hair less. I absolutely believe it works. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product.  I have noticed a little fuller effect and it is definitely just as good if not better than similar products on the market.  It is also very reasonably priced and lasted me we over 4 months so it is a great value.  I will be purchasing it again and would recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I feel when I wash my hair, it falls less than before. So I think it should be working!</li>
    <li> Nice , shampoo not harsh for hairs, can&#x27;t tell the hair loss capability yet as been using for 2 months ony</li>
    <li> After my first use I noticed an immediate difference in my hair.  It was smooth and healthy feeling.  I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have already started to notice a slight difference in hair loss while I shower.  My sister recommended this product to me and has been using it for 5-6 months and swears by it.  I look forward to seeing the continued benefits of this shampoo and restoring my hair!</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo after tried several other brands, finally find one thing could save my hair. I used to lose hair after each shower, I am so afraid to lose all my hair until I finally find this saver!! The effect begins to reveal at the first bottle, obvious less hair went off after washing my hair. I will definitely continue use this one.</li>
    <li> excellent Product. I have tried so many shampoos before but this one leaves the hair soft and manageable. My hair fall has also considerably reduced than before.</li>
    <li> I starting using this product when I noticed my hair thinning.  In just a few days of using this product the amount of hair loss was dramatically reduced.  My hair no longer clogs the drain when showering or fills my sink when styling and is much fuller.  I have also received several compliments from friends and family on the shine and softness of my hair.  I also use the conditioner with this product as my hair is long and gets knotted.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to take control of their thinning hair.  I would give five stars however I did not see any new hair growth.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about six months every day, and I have new hair all over! It&#x27;s not just fine baby hairs, but thick new young hair. When I started using this, I was afraid because my hair was falling out too much and breaking off. It stopped almost immediately after I started using this Pura d&#x27;or Gold. It&#x27;s almost too good to be true. I keep thinking it&#x27;s going to stop working one day, but hopefully not! So happy I found this :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know. I read all of the wondrous claims and doubted them and after the first full bottle, I find them heard to believe. I think cutting out Gluten will do more to save ones hair. Nice shampoo, but at $30. a bottle? I&#x27;ll most likely go back to my $5 shampoo.</li>
    <li> So far I have enjoyed this shampoo.  I can tell that the bottle will last quite a long time.  More importantly, how has it helped with hair loss?  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous positive difference.  I will say that I have not noticed any additional hair loss.  Just as a shampoo, I like the smell, and I like that it uses the Argan oil.  My hair does feel nice and soft, and has a slightly fuller look to it.  I will continue to use it until the bottle is empty and evaluate it from there.  So far I will say it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for three years now.  A bottle last awhile and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp.  Hair loss is difficult to say.  My hair looks thicker with this stuff, but I can&#x27;t say that hair has grown back..maybe slowed down the loss!</li>
    <li> I have had pretty good results with this shampoo and received a lot of compliments, though I am not sure whether it was solely as a result of using this or other solutions I used together with this. I am going to try it once more and will update this in the future.</li>
    <li> Have used the blue label Pura d&#x27;or previously and liked it a lot.  Decided to try this and seems to be similar to the other.  My hair feels thicker and there is less fall out.</li>
    <li> Good so far... It lathers really well even without any chemicals. After a long search and reviews I finally decided to get this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I use the argan oil from purad&#x27;or and its just the best one. So far its working out really well, will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Good item. Great seller. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this shampoo for a month, but already see a difference in my hair. It seems healthier and thicker, as well as shiny. For an organic shampoo, it lathers well and smells nice. I plan to order again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to review item. But I notice my scalp feels normal and I don&#x27;t scratch my scalp like before. Sudden itches are signs of balding people say.  Hair feels soft and thick, it smells a little like medicine but I don&#x27;t care as long as it does its job.</li>
    <li> If I could give this negative 10 stars, I would. This is BY FAR the worst and most harsh shampoo I have ever used, and that&#x27;s saying something because one time I moved house and couldn&#x27;t find the box with my shower essentials and had to resort to washing my hair with Ajax liquid dish soap! AJAX was less harsh on my hair than this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells HORRIBLE and chemical-ish (thankfully the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to stay in the hair after it&#x27;s dry) but the worst part about it is that it&#x27;s got an ingredient or ingredientS that roughs up or swells the hair cuticle, which means my long, mid-back length, highlighted hair is IMPOSSIBLE to comb through after shampooing, even after using a handful of the companion conditioner from this product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having long hair all my life means I know how to properly shampoo it to prevent tangling. Knots and tangles are brushed/combed out pre-shampoo, then I suds up the scalp area only and gently run the suds through the length, and NEVER EVER pile the length on top of my head.  Regardless, after I am done using this shampoo, it&#x27;s like I ran my entire head of hair through a blender, the knots and tangles are so bad. I can&#x27;t imagine how this could possible prevent hair loss, as even with gentle combing post-shampoo and condition, I end up tearing out a lot of hair because of all the tangles. I will never repurchase this damaging, hair-ruining shampoo again, and only wish I could return the bottle I got. Ugh.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo daily since it arrived, about ten days.  Yesterday a friend mentioned my hair was looking more full.  It might be the shampoo, or it might be the other things I have implemented in the last month&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Using Biotin supplements&lt;br /&gt;Using Biosil drops&lt;br /&gt;Adding Rosemary essential oils to my drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints for this shampoo are the following-&lt;br /&gt;It smells, well, not great.  Not awful, but not pleasant either.&lt;br /&gt;It is very thin, and it is to be left on for a few minutes before rinsing.  It is a real task to keep it from running into my eyes, and it stings.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be giving the appearance of more hair by opening the cuticle of the hair, no amount of conditioner is getting it smooth again and I am concerned that I am damaging the hair I do have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a note included in my purchase that if I wrote a review they would send me a free bottle.  Now that I have written the review, it will await my free bottle, and update here in a months time!</li>
    <li> I purchased the product and tried this one, which is perfect for my hair!! I love the feeling and hope it will work in the following days!</li>
    <li> Bought simply to reduce chemicals hitting my head vs. anything else.  Smells great, washes great.</li>
    <li> It seems working although I have only used it for a few weeks. I did see lesser hair lost in shower. I will give it another few months before I can give it a full 5 star.</li>
    <li> Ordered this shampoo to help with my thinning hair loss. I find the product to be as advertised, smells good, seems to work, but i guess time will tell on how well it does. Overall, i would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> First time use it, not so bad. Will see how effective it&#x27;s going to be.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! I have used this shampoo for a month and I can tell its made a difference in my hairs appearance and added some thickness. Ive also tried the other Pura d&#x27; or shampoo and the found argan oil to be quite beneficial over the month. No more itching not as much hair loss also noticed. I will by again and have already referred to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great product!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It&#x27;s organic, no parabens, no harsh chemicals and it does what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves your hair fuller and looking healthy.  After battling thinning hair -- it is great to find a shampoo that makes a difference.  I would recommend it to anyone who battles hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using purador blue for over three year and switched to purador premium (gold) couple months ago. The Blue did really help slow down my hair loss and added volume to my hair. Best part No SLS,  No parabens,  No DEA and no harsh chemicals. I have been taking the DHT blocker pills (and rogaine) but when i switched to parador I quit taking the pills. The Gold is a step up from blue and I started to notice my hair follicles started to thicken. I decided to go rogaine free and see if the gold does any magic..Will come back and add more comments after a year of Purador Premium use..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past couple of days and I&#x27;ve already noticed less hair fall after I shower and less hair on my pillow in the mornings. It feels tingly and leaves your hair feeling clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this for over a week now and love it!  Due to the limited time of use, I am only able to honestly speak about the sensory pleasure of using the product.  The lather is rich and luscious.  The scent whisks us away to the eucalyptus aromatherapy spas we have visited in Germany and England.  Absolutely love it.  Additionally, I have VERY sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any adverse reaction.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product. After clogging the shower drains twice in one year, my wife first decided to buy a little plastic cover to collect my hair at the drain. I was shocked with how much hair I was losing. She then found this product and bought it for me. She is all into natural stuff and I am not, so I was a little hesitant about using it. Anyway, I have been using this product for over 4 months now. For the first 2 weeks I didnt see much progress although I was happy anyway because I was getting volume and my hair looked good. I guess it was after 3 to 4 weeks that I started noticing that it took 4 to 5 days to collect the hair I was losing in one shower. I cannot say that I can see my hair growing because that is hard to see over a short period of time. But after 4 months, it takes about 6 to 7 showers to collect the hair I was losing in one shower. That is significant!! Specially if you consider the fact you are not using any chemicals in your hair. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is the best thing ever. I had so much of hair loss, I used to use head and shoulders before. I always used to get dry scalp and frequent hair loss. Even best conditioner was not doing the magic. Two weeks of using this product made such a huge difference. I have no hair loss. Normal shedding is still there but hair loss is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every other day now and still I am getting all the benefits this product has said.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who is loosing thier hair a lot. I highly reccomend its worth the price. The aroma is so great gives such a refreshing feeling to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Once again quit spending your time and money in other products and get this product and find the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANISH</li>
    <li> so far so good. with this shampoo you really don&#x27;t need a conditioner, it leaves your hair very soft and manageable. hair just feels very healthy overall. smells great too.</li>
    <li> very mild, good for everyday use</li>
    <li> I used to have to clean the hair out of my shower drain literally every 2-3 days. I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite awhile and haven&#x27;t had to clean out the drain once. The shampoo is stopping the hair loss however I don&#x27;t think my hair is any thicker nor does it have more volume. I am glad that it is stopping the loss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two downsides to this product--1) I think the smell needs to be improved and 2) I think it needs to produce more lather. I realize the lather is not necessary to clean my hair I just need to to mentally feel like I am getting clean hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for the sheer fact that it has slowed down my hair loss!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for about a month now, and I love the clean feeling that it leaves on my scalp and hair. Follow the directions and let it seep into the scalp for a couple of minutes so that the anti-DHT ingredients will do its job. It may be too early to write about its effectiveness, but used together with igrow, my hair seems to have stopped its shedding. The only negative is the price, which is so much more than the blue label version.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. My hair loss is much less after using this product for a few months. It is very helpful.</li>
    <li> Omg starts working immediately!  75% less hair in shower drain after first use!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I am very excited to start using it.</li>
    <li> It works for me! Now I&#x27;m ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> Wondeful product, wonderful seller, promptly service.Thanks</li>
    <li> I first started using Pura d&#x27;or argan oil and I liked it so much, before using that I was facing hair loss thats the reason I changed from coconut oil to argan oil. When i was purchasing argan oil I came to know about this anti-hair loss shampoo so I wanted to try it. Now I really like it , I could see difference in my hair loss during my shower. Not only with hair loss, i can also see my hair is grown. I also liked it because its all organic and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals which is good for my hair. I love the texture of my hair after i have my shower, it makes your hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great product! Feels very natraul!</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed less hair loss and in just two weeks of use but i was using it daily. small amount do the right job for your hair and when i checked the bottle after 14 days of daily use I can&#x27;t believe i still have more than 3/4th of the bottle</li>
    <li> I ordered the product two months ago together with mynoxidrin vitamin (also for hair regrowth). After one month, I can see the positive result. My hair start re-grow again. I don&#x27;t give a five star full because I don&#x27;t know whether it is a result coming from Pura dor or it&#x27;s coming from the vitamin. But the combination of two products just are amazing. I feel secure using the shampoo and never found my fall hair anymore.</li>
    <li> Hi I am a 51 year old woman with colored treated hair. I have tried everything under the sun to improve my hairs texture etc., This is it! after two shampoos, my hair looks and feels like its 20 years old again. If you have dry brittle hair, that is unruly, you should try this shampoo, and the lavender vanilla argon oil conditioner, You wont be sorry you did!</li>
    <li> Feels good on my head and leaves it feeling smooth......</li>
    <li> Really love this shampoo.I have tried many different thing,this makes my hair feel fuller.</li>
    <li> Works great, leaves my hair feeling good and I notice that it looks thicker! I will definitely buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Left my hair really soft. and also had more body to it but i can&#x27;t say anything about it falling out less because Ive only tried it once</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of using this shampoo . This product has really worked for me. I have noticed that I am not losing hair like I used to earlier. It is gentle and has definitely helped with making my hair stronger. I like that it is made with argan oil and has no harsh chemicals, SLS and paraben . However I don&#x27;t see any tremendous increase in volume or thickness of my hair. Though it is expensive but a little goes a long way. I would continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> ok not much improvement</li>
    <li> I have very baby fine long hair. this made my hair FLAT, made it very greasy looky, which made my color extra dull looking. Not to mention it did nothing for the thikness of my hair. EXTREMLY DISSAPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Love love love this shampoo. It really supports my efforts in hair regrowth. Gentle &amp; effective, no problems with colored hair. Love the natural products &amp; it has done wonders for my itchy, sensitive &amp; reactive scalp. No more problems with painful bumps on scalp. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have several medical problems that have caused my hair to get really thin and very fragile. I have tried everything to stop it from falling out and THIS SHAMPOO has worked miracles on my hair. I used my daughters Pura d&#x27;or for a couple weeks and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair so I ordered my own. My hair now looks like normal hair. I have been using it for about a month now and I would never go back to regular shampoo again. It has calmed down all my frizzy ends and I can actually go out in public without wearing my wig. Yes that is how bad a shape my hair was in. This company has a customer for life. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair looks in 3 months. I can already see new little growths popping up on my scalp.  I also bought the conditioner and it is also amazing.</li>
    <li> My hair still falls out, althought the amount has decreased. Definitely needs a conditioner- hair is very natty without it.</li>
    <li> so far my hair hasnt grown much but i did notice my hair stopped falling which has been a pleasant surprise</li>
    <li> I really did not notice any change, but I finished it all. It smells good. l will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing and has definitely earned a permanent spot in my rotation! Smells clean and a little like black seed (sesame-ish) I follow up with the Lavender Vanilla conditioner and then just plain argan oil (from Brambleberry). Also supplement biotin to my diet and eat lots of fresh fruits, veggies, nuts and meats.</li>
    <li> It seemed like I noticed less hair in my brush and falling out after a shower for about the first few weeks. It has been a couple months now and my hair is back to speed with falling out a lot. So, it does not seem to work very well for me but the shampoo itself is nice. It has a pleasant refreshing herbal smell, lathers well, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. It does not deep clean very well so sometimes when my hair is oily I use a different (less expensive) shampoo to get the job done then use this shampoo so it can sit on my scalp. To be fair, I have hypothyroidism so I am asking a lot of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product now for over 2 months and i have seen a very positive effect i can cant speak much as to how this relates to other products but i can attest that this has defanlity made a difference at the end of the sink. Now i am not sure what the sight affects are but it seem to have not real harmful chemicals in there like many other products that why i have given this 4 out of 5 stars. good luck to you all</li>
    <li> After trying this for few months I can say this is a safe product in compare to other shampoos out there claiming several things. I&#x27;ve also like other shampoo along with this but this is just a little better and gives you a feeling of being natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only suggestion I have to make to foam little more without adding anything harmful or unnatural.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff really... Noticed less hair in my hand after just a few shampoos.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how well it does over time.</li>
    <li> It really helps for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep on use it.</li>
    <li> Loved it the from first time I used it. Left my fine, frizzy, thinng hair looking shiny, soft and bouncy. My blow out was also quick and easy after using it which is impressive considering the high humidity of the climate I live in.</li>
    <li> I am a 50 year old male and have been using this shampoo for about two years now, it seams to really work. I feel my hair has actually become thicker now then before I started using it . I would recommend this product to any who feels there hair is starting to thin.</li>
    <li> Second bottle now, hair feels light and clean.</li>
    <li> Still having hair loss. I have been using it for 4 months. I don&#x27;t know why this product has so many raving reviews</li>
    <li> I like it but it&#x27;s not stopping the shedding or hair loss. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> One of best product, It prevent hair fall and certainly healthy for your hair. Highly recommended. Great one ..</li>
    <li> This shampoo is encouraging.  My hair is brittle and it breaks off easily and shedds.  I have noticed after using this shampoo for a month or so, there&#x27;s less breakage and my hair is a little more manageable.  I have used the hair loss prevention shampoo with the blue label and it was good too.  It is expensive but you don&#x27;t have to use alot of it.  I would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> my problem is lupus,depending on shampoo my hair will fall like crazy,with pura dor it doesnt fall as much but it takes me hours to untangle my hair. i wish they made shampoo that would stop hair from falling but definitly not tangle your hair,i also have lots of fly ways....i dont care for it except its slowing my hair from falling.still have to come out with something better</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now with the conditioner and my only wish was that I had started using it sooner. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this shampoo, smells great and works great. Definitely making this part of my daily routine</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great. Not too dry nor too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Also like the smell very much.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair loss since using it for two months now.  For those looking for hair growth though, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every product known for hair loss.The combination of ingredients in this product can&#x27;t be found anywhere else. The fact that there&#x27;s a 70-80% reduction in hair in the drain after showering tells me all I need to know. Very satisfied. Per the instructions for effectiveness, leave the product on your head for 2 minutes after lathering, before rinsing off.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Using very little shampoo, it cleans the hair exceptionally well! The hair and scalp feel very fresh after shampooing and my hair has stopped falling out and has gotten thicker. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this shampoo for me and I just got it one week ago and have used only 4 times so far.  I do so far since this is still early that my curl has been holding up.  I have very very fine and thin hair and have not used any styling products with this shampoo and am very pleased.  I am hopeful that after 3 months of use I will see new hair growth.  The product came very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product! After initial uses, made my hair fuller and thicker. I&#x27;m looking forward to using the product long-term.</li>
    <li> It is not a miracle cure that is going to grow you a full thick head of hair if you have thin hair but it definitely works. At 23 I was having hair all over my hands and tons in my comb when I washed and combed my hair. This has definitely slowed it and my wife thinks my hair is actually thicker. I am sure I will end up bald in a few years anyway but this has for sure slowed the process and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. I like that the ingredients are natural and not overpowering. The scent is not bad at all and my scalp feels nice and clean after. I cannot say that it is extremely effective for thinning hair yet but so far it seems to be very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as the ingredients stay consistent, natural, and of great quality I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I have been using for 4 months now and I believe it has stopped some shedding, I have also been using nizoral shampoo every 3 days and this on the off days.  I have been using nizoral for 8 months and this product for 4.  I believe that this has further reduced the shedding and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I was skeptic about this product at first, but after trying multiple products and nothing has worked I thought hey why not????  This product is amazing after using this within the first month there has been a huge difference in the thickness of my hair.  I will definitely be purchasing another bottle.</li>
    <li> it is the only one that makes my hair feel manageable and gives it some body.</li>
    <li> I am using Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label) and found that it is working. I had dead hairs on my scalp which were not growing but after using this shampoo  for about 15 days I noticed that these hairs are growing. I am very excited to use this shampoo and after a long time, finally I am hopeful that I can get my hair back.</li>
    <li> GOOD ONE BUT DID NOT SEE IMPROVEMENT</li>
    <li> Bought the blue bottle, liked it, then I purchased the gold label. There is not a lot difference between the gold and the blue label. The shampoo works okay. Hair does feel refreshing after first use. Have been using for 3+ month, would definitely recommend this product due to the ingredients of the shampoo</li>
    <li> I have tried Nioxin and several other brands, So far this is my favorite. I have thick curly and unmanageable hair. I use this 2 times a week and I think this has certainly helped make a difference. I dont see a hair loss benefit but that has not been a major issue for me. I do feel that my hair is less dry and easier to comb. I hope this helps in the long run since I see people posting great reviews and I do like the way my hair feels with this</li>
    <li> I am a older male and this is probably the best shampoo I have tried in many many years. No junk in it. It leaves my hair fluffy soft. It helps your hair grow quicker and I have new hair now growing on top where it has thinned out over the years. I also like the pump dispenser. One pump is all I need. Never get to much shampoo. Love it.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat purchaser of this product. I have very little hair loss when I am using this shampoo.  This one bottle goes a long way!!  I would recommend this shampoo for anyone who is having problems with hair loss!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few months now and really like it.  I have moderate hair loss and was trying to find a shampoo to help save what I have left.  Here in Minnesota during the winter the very dry air causes my scalp to be really itchy.  So far using this shampoo, not itchy at all (even though its -15F outside as I write this!)  I have tried a number of other shampoo&#x27;s but honestly have to say this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is using it and i think that his hair is actually thicker.  He loves it so that is all that matters:)</li>
    <li> I do not think my hair has become thicker after using this product. However, I can assure that this product help losing less hair. When I brush my hair or wake up in the morning, I can see I have lost less hair than I used to. If you are having hair-loss problem, why don&#x27;t you try this out?</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this product.  Overall I am pleased with its performance.  I can&#x27;t say that it helps to stop hair loss; but it does leave our hair soft and helps reduce split ends!  I took before and after photos: the first picture on 8/14 and the second on 12/11.  You can judge for yourself.  I will say I don&#x27;t think I have lost any more hair during that time and that my hair feels healthier.</li>
    <li> Feedback from my wife:&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product. I have been using over a month every other day. I had thick lustrous hair which started to thin and fall. once I started using this product, post shower hair fall has been very less and while brushing hair there is significantly less loss of hair. I agree its an expensive product but worth every penny. Now I am confident that with good care and using this shampoo , I will get my healthy hair back.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any new hair growth however I seem to be loosing less hair than before.  My scalp tingles slightly when I shampoo it.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery, but I must use 2-3 pumps to get a good head of suds, not just one.  Using up shampoo quickly.  Using for only 4 Weeks and hair loss seems to be slowing.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or lathers ridiculously well for an all natural shampoo. I am impressed so far! I will update my review after a full 90 days to comment on the hair regrowth/thickening properties of this product.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell whether or not this product is effective for hair loss.  My initial response after using it three times now is that it leaves my hair feeling coarse and stringy.  I also feel as if I have to use more shampoo because the texture is different and it doesn&#x27;t lather.  After rinsing I use a conditioner because I want my hair to feel soft.  Had I known it should be used with the accompanying Conditioner I would have purchased both and saved $ on shipping.  I will rate this again in 2 months.</li>
    <li> delivered on time. It Smells good. Even though I do not see it effective, I will try it again. It leaves hair fresh.</li>
    <li> I am not a paid reviewer for this product.  This is my second purchase and I think it does help to make my hair in much better condition, but they don’t stop my hair from thinning since I did not notice much difference in the thickness of my hair.  Yet, I still love it because as compared to other hair loss shampoos, I have to agreed that it is a great shampoo in general and it is very gentle and easy to use.  Will continue using it for the time being.</li>
    <li> Overall, I have been pleased with this product.  I have been struggling with hairloss on and off for years and wanted to find an organic product free of the harsh chemicals that are in many anti-hair loss shampoos.  I started using this shampoo 7 weeks ago and have noticed a decrease in hair fall, though am still experiencing more than the normal 50-100 hairs per day. I am giving this four rather than five stars as I had hoped to see an even greater decrease in hair loss.  I have not yet noticed new growth, however it has only been seven weeks and the information I read said new hair growth should be noticed after about three months of use.  I had some concerns after reading other reviews about this shampoo drying out my hair. It is somewhat drying, however with a high quality, highly moisturizing conditioner, I have not had any problems with dryness.</li>
    <li> It works! A bit expensive though...</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this shampoo and was willing to pay $34 if it would help prevent my hair from falling out so much. But it made my hair feel like grass and I had to use A LOT of conditioner to detangel my hair. I used it only once. What a waste of money. I should have read the 1-star reviews before purchase warning that it&#x27;s a scam.</li>
    <li> I am a 51 year old male with thinning hair.  Before trying the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; non-natural treatments I decided to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks my hair feels and looks much better.  I don&#x27;t know how fast it is supposed to work, but I have much less loss in my hands during the washing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 4 stars as it does seem a bit pricy....imo.  I will purchase again if it continues to improve my hair,</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 months and it works great for me. My hairs become more vigorous and I feel that I look having more hair than before. I used Ultrax Labs shampoo previously, but I think this product is works better for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at about 1/2 way through the bottle and have to say that I feel like my hair is freer of things that weigh it down, but I don&#x27;t feel like there is a obvious change in hair growth which is why I bought it.  I have short hair so I don&#x27;t use more than a couple of pumps, so I will be at the very least another month of shampoos before the bottle is finished.  If I feel there is enough change to write about, I will check in and provide feedback.</li>
    <li> this is a very good shampoo for dry or brittle hair.  it would work better for people whose hair is not as fine as mine is, i think.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for hair loss prevention. I&#x27;m sure lot of people are leaving reviews to receive another free bottle but i would say it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks, I feel that I saw less hair loss when I am washing my hair or dying my hair,  I will continue to use it to see the result is real or not.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Not heavy, rinses easy. Good for daily use.</li>
    <li> I been using for few months now and i like it the organic ingredients are good for my hair, my hair is progressing in recovery  and I like the plesent smell of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> It leaves my boyfriend&#x27;s hair noticeably thicker. We haven&#x27;t noticed an increase in growth, though. It does leaves his scalp less irritated than previous shampoos. He will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Lov lov lov it.. I received this a few days ago and have used it everywhere on my face,body,hair and my feet. My skin is as soft as butter. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but after using this shampoo for over a month I started to notice that my hair was thicker and I was losing less hair.  The chemicals don&#x27;t strip your hair like other shampoo&#x27;s eliminating the need to use conditioner every day.</li>
    <li> Well to start, I&#x27;ll go over some of the benefits. The 16 ounce bottle lasted 2 months with 2 people shampooing daily which is good. And I did notice less hair loss which is awesome!!! It is still too early to tell if I&#x27;ve seen any major hair growth but I feel better using a product with natural ingredients. The company did offer a free 2nd bottle for writing a review but I lost the offer so I am going to pay for a second bottle. The shampoo does not lather well and does not leave your hair feeling smooth and it smells a little like coffee. But I use another brand&#x27;s conditioner so it does the smoothing and detangling and takes away the light coffee sent that this shampoo gives off ( Nioxin #2 conditioner.) Bottom line, I&#x27;ll try it for a about 4 more months and then make a final determination. If more hair grows back it will be worthwhile but as a shampoo I would not buy it if it did not. Also, if you do buy this shampoo be sure to shake the bottle because the ingredients tend to separate.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff right here! I was clearly needing a quality shampoo and now I found it!</li>
    <li> December 3 2014:  I have been using this shampoo for about 3 months now.  I can&#x27;t speak for the hair loss portion as I need to give it at least 6 months before I declare a verdict.  The shampoo makes my scalp feel great.  I had issues with pimples on my scalp and they are gone.  The shampoo leaves my hair feeling a little dry if I do not use conditioner.  However, I usually do use conditioner so the issue is mute.  My hair loss has been slow and steady and so far that&#x27;s pretty much how it remains.  I will update in march.</li>
    <li> The product is nice and effective but the packaging was coming apart when I got it and seemed to be leaking when I received it.</li>
    <li> 1 Star for deceptive advertising.  Product is not organic, definitely not certified organic (no indication on label), rather instead has 1 ingredient marked as organic (argan oil) out of dozens of ingredients.  It does have a herb-like smell which I find pleasant and which doesn&#x27;t retain after rinsing.</li>
    <li> My hair feels more like it did twenty years ago.  It has more body, is more manageable, and feels fuller. I&#x27;m going to continue to use counting on its ability to keep my hair and scalp healthy resulting in less hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks.  It has helped in this short time with much reduced hair loss.  I&#x27;ve found a supplement that has helped with growth; however, I was still losing as much as I was growing if not more.  I&#x27;m quite happy with the results in such a short time and would definitely recommend it if you want to stop the loss.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo a little over four months ago in conjunction with the conditioner and the HairMax Laser Comb. The combination has worked very well for me -- beyond my wildest expectations, in fact. I have always had thin, fine hair and I was experiencing age-related thinning. And, at the time I began this regimen, I was in the midst of a serious shed -- I was losing copious amounts of hair every day, it was clogging my shower drain, it was all over my bathroom floor, and it was causing me serious distress. The Laser Comb takes time to work and I wanted to do as much as I could to keep what hair I still had in the meantime. Another customer had mentioned using Pura d&#x27;or in combination with the Laser Comb, so I thought I would give it a try. It worked right away to reduce shedding -- within a week I was shedding so much less than before. And now, over four months later, I&#x27;m experiencing more regrowth than I ever imagined possible. I can&#x27;t say if it is one product or the other, or the combination of the two, but I&#x27;ll continue using both. The shampoo also leaves my hair so soft and it smells nice, but not overpowering. It seems a little expensive, but it lasts a long time -- four months later, I&#x27;m still on my first bottle, and with the results I experienced, it&#x27;s totally worth it. I&#x27;ll keep buying this product as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. :))</li>
    <li> This product really works... within weeks I went to my hairdresser and she was amazed at how healthy and full my hair looked. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals for your hair. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been experiencing thinning hair for several months now and tried everything from Minoxidil to even Hair Maxx pills. Nothing worked except when I started using this shampoo. I don&#x27;t see strands of hair in the shower strainer anymore!!! And when I blow dry, I only see a couple of strands left on my brush. Unlike before, I would have to pull around 57 to 65 strands. And plus, the ingredients are safe!</li>
    <li> I just tried it once today and my hair looks fuller and feels soft.  I have high hopes for this.  Nioxin was what I had been using but its no longer made with any DHT blockers.  This may become my new favorite.  I will update after the 3 month recommended usage.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have used ever. I had serious hair loss problem. At least this product stopped my hair loss. My hair feels really good after using it.</li>
    <li> This is the shampoo I was actually looking for that adds volume to my thinning hair. I use minoxidil along with Pura dor shampoo and my hair looks more healthy now.</li>
    <li> I started to see changes my hair with age and poor diet is thinning so it&#x27;s not only I need good shampoo to prevent but also need to use some chemical fee stuff. This shampoo is great only if I had started in earlier time. My hair feels clean and shining for sure but not sure if can help me  stop hair loss completely for long time of use. ( Hopefully)I&#x27;ll give another month and half more to see. By the way recent bought conditioner too to see the full result. Will post after a month.</li>
    <li> This product is great, no SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate). Leaves hair clean, shiny, conditioned, and healthy. Also less hair in shower drain, which is definitely a positive experience!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing in every way.  It smells great.  It is refreshing.  The texture of my hair has improved.  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been  using this product for only 2 months now and my wife have noticed some results.&lt;br /&gt;She said my hair got a little bit darker, which means thicker. It might be still too early to judge  but I will continue to use this product for at least 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this product is organic, which makes me feel good about using it.</li>
    <li> I just starting using this because I have oily greasy hair and it has definitely reduced the oil and made my scalp less itchy. My hair was slightly thinning, however the shampoo seems to make it more fuller. I am not sure about regrowth of hair since I have not been using this long.Hope this product could protect my loss hair.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this product would work after trying so many on the market for my androgen alopecia. I tried it for one week, and it didn&#x27;t seem to help. My scalp was still dry, itchy, and sore. I tried it again three weeks later and used consistently.  I noticed excellent results after the second week of consistent use.  My hair stopped falling, and scalp less dry and sore. I use as a paste on scalp, leave on for 10 minutes and rinse.  My scalp feels wonderful.  I use this product daily and Iove it.  Would recommend to anyone with scalp problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product for a couple of months. It&#x27;s taken a little while, but I&#x27;ve noticed less hair falling out and slightly more hair growing in a few places.</li>
    <li> Bought this item after looking through several products. Its pretty good so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Really Works!</li>
    <li> After just over 3 months of use there has been definitive improvement. I&#x27;m 20 years old and my hair began to thin just over a year ago and I was fed up. The hair thinning/loss happened more toward the front of my head where regrowth, I believe, is less likely than the back so I don&#x27;t expect to have the hair back that I lost but the feel and look of my hair improved. It is definitely thicker and I am not losing any hair beyond what is normal.</li>
    <li> After about three weeks I noticed much less hair loss and some new growth starting!!! Will keep using this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I recently got the bottle and have applied both to my hair and my face. I noticed immediately that my face is very soft and feels highly hydrated! I am waiting for my hair&#x27;s results since I&#x27;ve applied only couple times. But if my face is any indication, I am expecting great result :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the direction was a bit more specific. For example, when applying on hair, do I apply on dried hair, towel dried when it&#x27;s still wet... etc.  Same goes for face - Do I apply it before I apply moisturizer, do I rinse it off after massaging it for one minute, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I am loving it.</li>
    <li> As I entered my thirties, my hair has been thinning. After much research I decided to give this shampoo a try.  So glad I did!  It is extremely clarifying and my hair feels stronger and fuller after each use.  Although pricey, it is worth the money and only requires a small amount so the bottle lasts a long time.  I purchased it for my sisters as well.</li>
    <li> What first attracted me to buying this product was that it is organic and SLS-free, most shampoos are not SLS-free. Especially the ones sold in retail stores. When using my old shampoo/conditioner regiment, Matrix Fiber Strong Bamboo, I noticed that a lot of hair came out and I desperately wanted a change. Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic shampoo and conditioner helped me and my family prevent hair loss! I love how it&#x27;s 99% vegetable product and the SLS-free really helps with the strength and quality of my hair. I would highly recommend this product (along with the conditioner) and am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> For starters, this isn&#x27;t a fake review. I&#x27;m a 45 year old women with wavy fine thin hair. I bought this to help slow down some of the shedding I&#x27;ve been experiencing. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week and I already love the way my hair feels. I honestly think it&#x27;s to soon to tell if there is less shedding but I will update this in a few months.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a great natural shampoo.  I feel that my hair is healthier and gets cleans without all the chemicals that regular shampoos contain.  I&#x27;m definitely sticking with this and will also try the other products they offer.</li>
    <li> Found this shampoo to give a great lather and prevent the loss/thinning of my hair.  The product feels better and lathers much better than other hair loss shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m about a month into using it and have already noticed a lot of its preventative capabilities.  I believe there is a still some time before seeing actual hair growth (if any), but I would recommend this over the other hair loss shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The shampoo makes my hair feel very smooth and i feel that my hair is falling out less by using it.</li>
    <li> It works fine, but isn&#x27;t sealed well. When it arrives it leaks one fourth of the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> The scent is somewhat off for me, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger after rinsing.  The end result is nice, my hair looks fuller, color brighter and shiny.  I don&#x27;t know about the anti-hair loss because it is too soon to tell.  But I like the product for the immediate results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 and balding. The hair line has been slowly disappearing for a few years now. This shampoo hasn&#x27;t regrown any hair, but my hair loss has stopped! I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now and will continue to use it! My wife has used it a couple time and loved it as well.  Definitely worth the money. I&#x27;ve tried other products and this has worked the best for me.</li>
    <li> Starting to help after two months</li>
    <li> Smells good, and leaves my hair feeling clean.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and not much has changed.  I am going to continue to use it for now, in hopes that I will see results after more time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife whose hair was very thin. Her friend recommended it to us, but I was skeptical. Now we are glad to have it. It’s a really good shampoo. We’ll recommend it to our friends.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product at an outstanding price.  This organic product supports a women&#x27;s cooperative in Morocco which has become a successful model for other cooperatives.  I am happy to support them while getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Ive only used this once and it seems to work good its a clear gel and has a nice light smell , I will have to use it more befor I can tell you if it helped me with my hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;I will do a update after I use it for a few months</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife, we see great results. We&#x27;ll buy more. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister who is 38 years old and has very thin hair three months ago.  When we were together for Thanksgiving, her hair  has a lot more fuller feeling. She was very happy about it. I am buying it again for her as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. I have been suffering from hair lost since i was 22. I have been using this shampoo for over a year now. My hair is way softer and manageable. I almost never see any hair on my pillow or when i shower. Now only if you could regrow the hair that i have lost, I would be so happy but hey one day at a time people.</li>
    <li> This stuff SHOULD be sold in stores everywhere.  I am 35, I am embarrassed by my widow&#x27;s peak/receding hairline.  I am self conscious and the past few years I refuse to go out in public without a hat.  I have tried many things on the market, from Rogaine (which states on the bottle, does not work for widow&#x27;s peak or receding hairlines.  Whoops.)  DHT blocking pills, biotin, leave in serums, you name it.  Now I am one to read reviews and go for the top of the line product.  I saw this shampoo was basically rated the best DHT blocker within reason.  And yes that is the key to stopping hair loss, blocking DHT.  The ingredients in this shampoo, I did a lot of research on.  This organic blend of vitamins and nutrients are exactly what your hair and scalp needs to stop hair loss in its tracks.  I have been using this for about 2 months now, with a biotin supplement and the results are pretty amazing.  Just in 2 months I feel my hair growing back more and more each week.  And this stuff lathers up nicely for an organic shampoo.  One pump covers my whole head, so the bottle should last me a good 6 months easily.  The bottle says leave it in for 2 minutes but no, I leave it in at least 5 minutes.  I feel it tingling and really working and it rinses clean.  I would honestly have to say, if you are serious about stopping hair loss, whether it be receding hairline, a bald spot, patches here and there, whatever... I couldn&#x27;t possibly recommend this shampoo more.</li>
    <li> No chemicals is the way to go</li>
    <li> Using in conjunction with the Pura d&#x27;or Conditioner and the results have been great!  1 pump of product is all it takes on my short hair - a little goes a long way.  Will continue using for sure!</li>
    <li> been using this shampoo for 3 weeks, I like it because it makes my hair shinny, manageable and easy to maintain, hopefully I will have less hair in the sink. It smells awesome.</li>
    <li> This works, fantastic I am an AA male, hairline slowly receding on sides, think Jude Law but not nearly as bad (started when I was 22 and now its starting to look  unattractive),  so I looked at my options. I have been using this for about 1.5 months and this made a VERY noticeable difference. My barber asked me what i have been doing to my hair, it hasn&#x27;t looked this great in years. It starts very subtle, then when I got a closer look my hair has regrown in several areas. I don&#x27;t have crown baldness, just slowly from the sides, this filled in the thinning hair a lot and it looks GREAT. I usually use 1 pump per day (move it around to both sides of my hair where it is thinning) and BAM 1.5 months my hair looks like where it was 4 years ago. I am going to continue to use this for another 1.5 and see how thick it can really get. BUY THIS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has been more than 6 months, it definitely filled in my hair and made it much fuller around the receding parts. It has made my hairline very defined and again the results are very noticeable, all the areas where the hair was thinning out are pretty much full. The bad news is where the hair was completely gone or almost thin, only tiny hairs grow back. So story is when it starts to thin/recede, use this right away to halt the process (the younger you are the better). I have a feeling if I would&#x27;ve used this 8 years ago I would have the same hairline I did when I was a teen. I still only use one bump a day pretty much every day but sometimes I forget. A-</li>
    <li> I started using this a few weeks ago.. I already like it.. I use this at night and then Ultrax labs in the morning..  That stuff is great too! Hopefully I&#x27;ll see some improvements.. I have a good feeling the stuff will help</li>
    <li> makes scalp extremely dry and no noticeable benefits</li>
    <li> the nozzle of the bottle is solid, so the shampoo can&#x27;t get out of the bottle. Maybe the way I use the bottle is wrong, but i was just afraid of break the bottle, so i can only choose to return this thing. The dilivery is good and the shampoo looks good~~</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I was suffering from Hair loss since last 6 months. Tried everything suggested but nothing worked. Then researched more for genuine products &amp; ordered this shampoo after reading great reviews. But was not sure if it will work. It has been a month since I am using it. It shows great results. Except for the hair I lose while shampooing, I do not see any hair loss afterwards. I was afraid to comb my hair earlier for the fear of loss. But now I feel great. I feel the strength in my hair &amp; look forward to shampoo them. Very happy. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few weeks now. It&#x27;s low sudsing; it seems very natural. After having my second baby I noticed my hair was coming out a little bit after the shower. Since using this shampoo it&#x27;s helped and decreased the clumps. My hair stopes coming out as much. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it so much is the smell. (Reminds me of magnesium citrate used in colonoscopy prep). So far so good though will keep reordering and I would recommend to any family or friends.</li>
    <li> I finally found the product that really works for problem - hair loss.</li>
    <li> Not very sure if this thing have an effect</li>
    <li> Feel really good ,light no grease and smell good love it</li>
    <li> It takes only two weeks to see the result on my hair. My hair is getting stronger and shiny looking.</li>
    <li> My wife and been using this product and its wonderful and helps and maintain the thickness of our hair, some part  of my thin hair is now getting some good improvement .  We highly recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> Although the shampoo arrived late I used it and am pleased with the full body and shine it has produced. Of course I&#x27;ll need to continue using this shampoo to see if I stop shedding so much hair when I shampoo. Will update my review in 90 days.</li>
    <li> My friends told me this product, and I brought it last month, I found it&#x27;s really good for hair growth.</li>
    <li> I personally have not experienced any noticeable positive results from using this for about two months 3 times a week. I use it in conjunction with Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo. I will put that on first and then finish up with this one. But both of these shampoos have been disappointing for me. I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because it seems a lot of other people do have results. I personally do not plan to continue spending $35 for this product. I will downgrade to the other Pura d&#x27;Or shampoo that&#x27;s around $10 less.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for 3-4 weeks and have noticed a my hair has been thicker and not looked thin. This is defiantly the first product for hair loss that I think really works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, after just a week I noticed a big difference. After my showers I did not have a ball of hair to pick up. It really works. I have already had my husband order another bottle.</li>
    <li> Seriously so amazed with this product! It works wonders on dyed hair! The combination of the shampoo and conditioner drastically improved the damage that I had from going blonde! I would recommend this product to any and everyone! I&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo again! Thanks for a great product :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for about two months and so far my hair has gotten a bit thicker and definitely has stopped falling out. There&#x27;s a bit of doubt in me that it will make my hair grow out to what it used to be, but so far I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> pooor , not sure why it has great rating !!! it must be fake review !!</li>
    <li> What people should really know about the gold version is that it has  Ketoconazole 0.9% in it!  The blue version does not. It is the one difference that screams out loud when comparing gold to blue.  This is the only chemical used in lots of expensive hair loss products and it&#x27;s been proven in studies to help. I do believe the herbs have also been proven and many of them used to be part of the old &amp;#34;Nioxin complex&amp;#34; before proctor and gamble bought and destroyed that product line (I used it prior to Pura for 13 years) only leaving nettles in the shampoo.  I have basically been adding  Ketoconazole  to my mix with the blue version of Pura D&#x27; Or for the last two years.  You can buy the blue for $24 and just a bottle of Nizoral 1% at target for $14 and put Nizoral into the mix twice a week as I do or just buy this gold version at $34 and have it already in there and not need Nizoral at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They must have been reading my posts!!  Haha.  This seems like a really nice addition to an already very awesome product.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is good and I&#x27;ve noticed lesser hair falling if continued use is maintained. Hoping that it will stop more hair strands with continued use overtime.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  It leaves your hair feeling clean with no residue.  Recommend highly!</li>
    <li> May hair loss do decrease dramatically during the shower that I can notice on the sink. I am buying the 2nd bottle to observe longer term and will report back if it can get my 5 star.</li>
    <li> I have been using this about 4 times a week for about 4 months now and, while I am not growing hair back, I have noticed a slow in my hair loss. I am only 25, my hair loss is genetic, but I have noticed this is helping some.  Will report back when I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to write a very short review for people who hate long reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it says. I am a male with naturally fine hair. Noticed hairline receding and bought this. Only used this everyday for 2 weeks noticed that it leaves hair thicker, shinier, fuller, healthier and more voluminous. Make sure it&#x27;s a rich lather and leave in for 2 minutes then wash. Will leave hair dry so I highly recommend using a conditioner. My personal conditioner recommendation is L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al EverStrong Sulfate-Free Fortify System Reconstruct Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will leave a polished review once I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> Its been about almost two months and the havn&#x27;t really seen a huge difference. Hair takes awhile to grow so I would guess you would get real results in few months or so.</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts forever and is very good shampoo. You only need a drop. I had itchy scalp and using this once per day works. I did notice my hair is thicker too.</li>
    <li> Love It !!!  Noticed a difference in the feel of my hair and scalp right away.  After washing, my hair felt squeaky clean and was fluffier and had more shine. And the best part is there&#x27;s less hair in my drain......Will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> I have not seen the results that the description of product guaranteed.  Still trying it</li>
    <li> I recommend it!!&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry hair and face  but when I start to use this oil with other face cream the moisture  last whole day  also this Argan oil has not&lt;br /&gt;smell like other product. My hair itchiness is gone if I massagel regulaly. love this one,</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 4 months now twice a week and have followed the instructions exactly. I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair thickness. It does make my hair and scalp dry so I use a very good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s now been 9 months and still no difference in my hair thickness. I have stopped using it. My hair is in worse condition than when I started. I have split ends everywhere and very damanged looking hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. I noticed that there is no more hair in the bath tub after I take a shower from the 3rd use and my hear feels much stronger. The only down side is that my hair is getting used to it, so I have to switch to another product for a while. Maybe it is only my hair type but I wish that I can just continue using it without the need of switching to another product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for only a short while.  I notice an improvement in how my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;Several friends have commented on how nice it looks.&lt;br /&gt;I also notice that there are fewer hair stands in the shower after shampooing with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to a friend that is experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> Used item everyday. Its a good shampoo. I dont know if you will see results instantly but its best to give it a try especially when considering that it works well for some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a few months now, and love it. I was suprised it lasted as long as it did, even with showering everyday. My hair is soft and healthy like I wanted it.</li>
    <li> It is  great addition for hair wash. Good substitute for commercial shampoo. Helps reduce hair loss.especially if you follow diet and exercise regularly. Good shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s natural and SLS-Free. I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and maybe have a slight difference in thickness, but nothing too crazy, it&#x27;s not like I look like sportscaster Brian Kenny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only recommendation is to not use too much of it each time because like most shampoos it can leave buildup on the scalp.</li>
    <li> The pump would not work.  No matter how much I worked with it, it would not go down.  Therefore I had to find something to use as a cap on the bottle.  It may be a good product, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again because of that reason.  Who knows how many of these have a pump that doesn&#x27;t work?  If you have an extra pump that fits the top of this bottle, you may want to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Great product//Love it</li>
    <li> This is great mixed with juniper berry essential oil for my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> Significant reduction in hair loss noticed in the first 2 weeks. Will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Finally an anit-hair loss product that works!  I used this product the same day it was delivered.  I immediately noticed very little hair loss while shampooing.  Also, I purchased the Pura D&#x27;or organic argan oil conditioner and it left my hair shiny with lots of volume.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchases.</li>
    <li> very nice natural shampoo has the same smell of my 7 generation all natural laudry detergent and the same smell of a fancy all natural italian body wash my ex got my from italy ... i hope i get good results from it i used to used Regepure was great for itchy scalp but i keept losing hair i hope this work!!!</li>
    <li> Happy with being an organic product with no parabens. Seems to work well to slow hair loss. Have not noted thicker hair yet. Scent is faint but nice.</li>
    <li> Hi I got this shampoo several months ago.  Like last year 2014.  It decreased the shedding and last a very long time.  It does not have an odor and it lathers on your head.  A small amount goes a long way.  I have not found it to thicken hair.  But what you have continues to grow and shedding decrease significantly with regular use.  You can see the difference when you stop using to try other shampoo.  Then you will wind up going back to Pura d&#x27;or</li>
    <li> I have to agree that this oil is liquid gold. I have an illness that makes my skin extremely dry. I use this oil, it absorbs in and my skin instantly feels better because I&#x27;m not so dry anymore. Pura d&#x27;or is 1st on my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to be working. There is quite a bit less hair in my comb after shampooing. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> i think is a really good product my sister recommended to me i just purchused one i love it...</li>
    <li> STARED USING THIS SHMPOO, AND MY HAIR BEGAN TO FALL A LOT MORE THAN BEFORE. STOP USING IT</li>
    <li> Great quality product. Pricey, but great quality, hair feels a lot better and seems steady.</li>
    <li> First, the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Shampoo leaves your hair feeling nice and fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Makes you hair look shiny and healthy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s organic and is very safe to use on virtually any type of hair, and you can use it multiple times a day if you are OCD (haha!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t think this actually stops hair loss, maybe it can help slow it down a little. I am still losing hair, although there is noticeably less on my pillow when I wake up in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The price</li>
    <li> stuff actually works. Good foamy lather and hair is fuller and healthier than ever!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this oil, it is not greasy on your skin, and it can be used for your nails and cuticles that are dry. It never makes your skin break out because it is so pure and good for your skin, I would  use this product again to keep my skin looking its best.</li>
    <li> I love this product fast shiping</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from my cousin. I am trying to minimize the use of artificial shampoos, conditioner. Argan oil is the best choice for that. After reading multiple reviews purador seemed to be the perfect brand for that. I love the smell and the feel of my hair. Love the packaging too. Definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Wow this really is helping! I can really tell my hair is getting stronger and healthier, I will be ordering this again as soon as I start running out!</li>
    <li> Used once.  Seems to be ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed over the years that my hair just kept getting thinner &amp; thinner.  I attributed it to having kids but after doing some research, I discovered it could be all the chemicals / sulfates in standard shampoos.  I switched over to this (and it&#x27;s pricey, but OMG! so worth it) and my hair has come alive.  It feels so much healthier.  I can&#x27;t swear to growing thicker / longer hair yet as I&#x27;ve only used it a month, but the way my hair FEELS is worth the cost.  It will lather some but not like the standard, detergent shampoos.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to all my gal pals!</li>
    <li> i have been using it for almost 2 months and i am witnessing my hair become longer faster . but stilll no new hair growth</li>
    <li> Seems to have helped hair loss.  Don&#x27;t see hair in shower when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m losing less hair. I love that all the ingredient is organic. The smell is great!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know about helping with hair loss yet.... but i like the texture and feeling of using this product... I hope it contains all the goodies it states it does...</li>
    <li> I have tried it ... Really works... My hair looks very healthy i have had issues with hair loss but no more with this awesome product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hair loss products and this is the first one that I&#x27;ve used in which I&#x27;ve actually noticed a difference. I started noticing somewhat less hair fall after two weeks, but after a month or so, the results were unbelievable! I have markedly less hair fall and have even noticed new growth. After trying so many anti-hair loss products without success, I was very skeptical about this one actually working, but I am so glad that I tried it because it actually does work!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything it says it is.  I am very please with the outcome of my hair.</li>
    <li> I started using this product along with the organic conditioner so I will make this review all inclusive. I swim 4 to 5 days a week and I have been looking for several years for something that would keep my hair from getting brittle from the chemicals and chlorine. Some things seemed to help some but I wanted something that would make a noticeable difference. I think I have finally hit upon a combination that really works. So far, I am very pleased with the result. Softer, shinier hair with no brittleness. For a guy in his 70&#x27;s that may not seem like a big deal. Well, it is to my wife. And if she&#x27;s happy my life runs smoother.</li>
    <li> Decent product - increased volume is noticeable, but can&#x27;t tell yet if hair loss is being prevented.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is just perfect! It leaves the hair silky smooth, and together with the conditioner your hair will be just amazing! Will recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> It really worked. Now my hair loss is slower and some of the previously hiar-loss areas seem to have hair growing back slowly too. Definitely going to keep using it. One quick note: You need to let the shampoo stay on your hair and scalp for at least 2-3 minutes to let it work its magic. After couple of times you might start feeling itchy when using this shampoo in the shower and then you know something is working. :-)</li>
    <li> I have an autoimmune disease and my hair was falling out and freaking me out! This works! I back to just losing the normal amount. A life saver for me!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo only for a few weeks, but the result, in my case, is immediate. The amount of fallen hair during a wash and drying is greatly reduced. I tried several other options, but did not have similar outcome.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and I like the shampoo. I noticed my hair loss has significantly reduced. I plan to continue to use it and see. But the initial results are promising.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo. I use it for anti-hair loss and because it&#x27;s just a good shampoo. Smells great, leave hair full and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for maybe 6 months now.  I can&#x27;t tell if my hair is growing in thicker, but I&#x27;m not growing any new hair. I gave it 3 stars because, though I&#x27;m not growing new hair, it does block the DHT. I used to be able to run my nails through my hair and collect little DHT crystals, but this stuff has put an end to that. It has a very mild fairly pleasant smell.  Like others have said, it does last a long time.  I plan on getting more.  I got sick of Nioxin, which I&#x27;d used for years.  I use this and then put Rogain drops on my head when I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I was shown this product by a good friend who was visiting me over Christmas. I just love it . I wake up feeling great . My face used to feel tight and very dry. I use it ,after scrubbing my face and neck. Morning and night. My husband noticed the difference. My wrinkles diminished&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and Patty for showing me this prize oil.</li>
    <li> My husband and I started using this oil several weeks ago and are loving the results.  Fine lines and dry skin have been greatly reduced! My husband has never used any product for his face.  He now uses this morning and night and his skin looks younger and more radiant.  It has helped my frizzy hair and dry skin this winter .  I highly recommend this Argan oil if you have dry skin, fine lines, or dry damaged hair - and the best part is that it is all in one bottle!!</li>
    <li> I like the blue label hair loss shampoo much much better.  This one seems thin and runny and strips my hair.  My hair is oily.  This shampoo, and the blue lable, are like cleaning an oil with an oil.  It make take a couple of washes at first, but my hair is squeaky clean.  As with all hairless shampoos, you may have additional hair fall because it is cleaning the sebum from your scalp.  I added a water filter to our shower because of the heavy chlorination.  Made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product.....It has made a drastic change in the shedding of my hair.  it has also softened the texture of my hair, will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost three months.  I can&#x27;t say that I have lost any less hair so far but I am optimistic about the hair regrowth.  Want to continue using for a while to see if it helps.</li>
    <li> FAST shipping! Great item. Love how it makes my hair. The scent is nice too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a week with the conditioner and have noticed a difference in my thickness. It doesn&#x27;t smell super great or lather a lot which isn&#x27;t that important but worth mentioning if your super concerned about either of those. I like the packaging of the product it shipped well and quickly.</li>
    <li> REALLY like this stuff.  I have baby fine hair and as I aged, I noticed it began to fill my brush more and more.  When I was diagnosed with RA, I was put on methotrexate which made made my hair loss problem even worse.  I did not expect to see results immediately but that is just what happened.  I just purchased my 3rd bottle.  (Bought one for my mother and she loves it too.)  Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Seems work pretty good for me.</li>
    <li> I am noticing less hair loss when styling and combing.  My scalp feels very clean and the strands of my hair are fuller.  My only wish is that the smell was a little more appealing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Shampoo for anti-hair loss. I have been using this shampoo from last three months. It controlled hair loss and dandruff for me. It works, just need to give some time to see the results. I like the smell and freshness of the hair after washing with this shampoo. I will continue using this shampoo to keep my hair healthy and see how it works on regrowth of lost hair. So far I am impressed with this product. I would recommend this product to my friends and family. Thank you for creating great shampoo. Best in the market.</li>
    <li> Using this for almost a month now. I find it cleans very nicely, rinses easily. So far, I have less hair shed since using this product. I like that it does not weigh the hair down or leave a residue. My hair, which is waist length and straight, seems to feel thicker and with more bounce. I will get this product again and again!</li>
    <li> After trying many different shampoos for hair loss and red and itchy scalps because of the harsh chemicals inside, I searched for something that was organic based. And what a treasure I have found!&lt;br /&gt;After the first use I already noticed a difference in my scalp and hair. No more red irritated skin and no more dry frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it when I go trough my hands with my hair and it feels so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Also the shredding has slowed down, waaaay less hairs in the shower! I&#x27;m losing my hair at the temples and I know it&#x27;s difficult to regrow hair there.&lt;br /&gt;I really have only positive things to say about this product! I love it!</li>
    <li> Just started the product and am looking forward to positive results!</li>
    <li> I have been trying different types of shampoo and I found the one. It&#x27;s little expensive but, if you look at it form the long run you actually save money by maintaining your hair.</li>
    <li> Thoroughly cleans my long hair. I like the scent, which isn&#x27;t overpowering for me. And a bonus is that it keeps my eczema on my scalp at bay, score!</li>
    <li> I really see the results my hair is growing less fall out. A lot more volume</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. Hair feels healthier. I noticed it feeling fuller, stronger, and with more shine. seems better than other shampoos.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It should be everywhere! Smaller bottles would be helpful. My mom like this too, so maybe I can split one with her.</li>
    <li> After losing a lot of hair combined with the loss of my husband and stress, I have tried so many hair loss treatments. After using this product along with the cayenne pepper, I have finally seen growth in my hair. I will come back and give another review after 6 months to hopefully give 5 stars.  This product HAS worked so far! Keep it up!</li>
    <li> I bought the Organic (Gold Label) version in October (4 months ago).  Before it, I used the Blue Label for over a year. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079R6BD2/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;In general, this is how things happened:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time I bought the blue label-&lt;br /&gt;-I was 29.&lt;br /&gt;-My hairline was receding steadily if not at an accelerated pace.&lt;br /&gt;-I was using Head &amp; Shoulders, sometime Neutrogena&#x27;s T-gel, and Bed Head Wax.&lt;br /&gt;-I would always only pat my wet hair with a towel after taking a shower (that helps).&lt;br /&gt;-I used a blow dryer regularly, but for short amounts of time, and mainly for styling.&lt;br /&gt;-Anytime i would run my hand through my hair, I would be left with a lot of strands in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that the results of using the shampoo wouldn&#x27;t be visible immediately, but in my experience-&lt;br /&gt;-After the very first use, my hair felt like it wasn&#x27;t coated with shampoo residue anymore.  (Could be that I was imagining it, but that&#x27;s what it felt like in my hands)&lt;br /&gt;-After it dried, i kept running my hand through my hair (gently), and there were close to no strands picked up by the palm of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;-The receding of the hairline did slow down, but I believe I started to visibly notice after about 4 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;-The rest of my hair styling practices remained the same, except that I pretty much stopped using wax, and switched Beach Babe Sea Salt Spray.  (It&#x27;s salty, but I like the matte finish).&lt;br /&gt;-I still blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t use Head &amp; shoulders, but when my scalp gets dry i split my shower time between a Neutrogena dandruff shampoo (forgot which one this time) and Pura d&#x27;Or.&lt;br /&gt;-I usually only use 1 pump of Pura d&#x27;or.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the blue label bottle was near empty, my hair started falling again. And it seemed like it was doing so with vengeance. I hadn&#x27;t changed any of my habits.  The only thing i can think of was that the last of the shampoo was somehow water down from the shower??  I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy the Gold Label this time around, and toss the last of the blue one.&lt;br /&gt;After about 1-2 weeks of use, the hair fall stopped or slowed again.&lt;br /&gt;My habits remain the same, except that I am now also using a tiny bit of wax (just for the tips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My hairline is definitely still receding, but at a much much slower pace than before I used the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;-There are plenty of days when I am close taking a razor to my head and make it silky smooth. But then I shower and style it, and I&#x27;m satisfied with it again, so I change my mind.&lt;br /&gt;-I cut my own hair, so it gives me the freedom to experiment with hairstyles that work better (or not) with the hair I have.&lt;br /&gt;-I think the thing I like the most about this shampoo is damn ease of using it.  Simply put, it has a noticeably positive effect on my hair, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be loaded with chemicals (i think), and I don&#x27;t have to do anything differently in my day.  I just take a regular shower.ower??

    <li> I love to talk about something that really works. Due to starting a phase called post-menopause my hair has been thinning out.  My daughter Rebecca recommended your shampoo.  She had read about it on Amazon and she thought it would work for my hair. It is wonderful! I have used it for about a month and have seen a great improvement and the texture of my hair.  Also the most important part is that I am not losing it!  My hair has officially stopped falling. It does not leave it dry or limp like other products I had tried. It is a great shampoo and it actually works in controlling thinning hair!</li>
    <li> I used one bottle.. so far so good. Need to order one more.</li>
    <li> The shampoo seem to be effective as claimed. I really like the fact that it has no SLS or other harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that I have been using for just about a year now. My hair has become fuller and thicker. My barber is amazed as well and is using it himself.</li>
    <li> This is VERY drying shampoo. It cleaned my hair but dried it to an extreme. It was necessary use another brand of organic conditioner and get a intense conditioning treatment under a hairdryer to bring my hair back to a moisture level where breakage was not a concern. It did make my itchy scalp feel better but I&#x27;m not sure which was worse, the itchy scalp or the breaking hair. Sorry, I won&#x27;t use this again. In fact I tried to return it but the time period to return the product had passed by one day.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! I have noticed a bit of regrowth and I have only been using it for a couple weeks along with the matching Pura conditioner. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00FH692PQ Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label), 16 Fluid Ounce]]There is no doubt that this shampoo is the best of the best. I started losing hair few months before I used this product and my hair was so thin. Believe me or not after few days of using this product, I stopped losing hair and my hair look a lot thicker. I never expected the result to be so fabulous. I tried a lot of kind of shampoos but nothing was working except this product. just a few weeks after I used it, I went to my barbershop and he was so surprised about my hair and asked me if I am on hair treatment. When I told him I am using a special shampoo, he did not believe me until he bought a bottle and he was so pleased with the results. The surprise for me was seeing new babe hairs. That is incredible. I will always use Pura d&#x27;or Premium shampoo. As I recommended to my sister, I will defiantly recommend it all people who are reading my review. Just try it and i AM very positive that you will always use it. I also love the smell of it. It is an includible shampoo and I give it a full rate because it is the BEST of the BEST!!!</li>
    <li> Dried out my hair.  Didn&#x27;t see that it helped with loss or regrowth.  A tablespoon or two of evening primrose oil taken internally, every day, along with fresh, organic healthy food, multi-vitamins, lots of exercise and visualization is what worked best for me.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have to say it is no use to me. I am still seeing a lot of hair loss everytime when I take a shower.... It did reduce my hair dandruff, but no effect on loss of hair after using it for more than 3 months. (plus I am taking biotin also) Not recommending to anybody else given its price.</li>
    <li> So far so good with this shampoo.  I purchased for the Biotin content in hopes of regrowing hair.  After one shampoo, I feel this product might work for me.  It&#x27;s not overly perfumed and felt good on my head.  If it helps regrow my hair I will be over the moon pleased!!!</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with my order. I received it earlier than expected, like 2 days which was awesome. I have even used this product and I absolutely love it. I have thin hair and had been having hair fall because I had  chemically straightened my hair before. After using this product my hair fall was extremely less and that is just from the first wash. I cant wait to try this product further and hopefully get hair growth.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I got this product for my wife. and i can see the difference after couple of weeks. although her hairloss is not recovered completely but her hair definitely looks more healthy. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not too sure yet.. I&#x27;ve used regenepure Dr for years and worked well..I made the switch just to switch it up a little and this was organic so why not. i kind of freaked out when I first starting using this product because I lost a lot of hair in the shower something that never happened with regenepure. Within a week though I went to barely losing any hair at all so I guess it&#x27;s working now.. My hair does feel thicker and is keeping my hair from thinning any further in the temples. I do switch between this and blue label though I use blue in the morning and gold at night. Yes I do shower twice a day idk why I just do :)</li>
    <li> Over-rated. Smelled odd. Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this shampoo. My hair over the last six months has lost some of it&#x27;s volume, and I heard from a friend to give this a try. So far so good, I hope I continue to see the same results with continued use. I&#x27;m not sure about the &amp;#34;anti-hair loss&amp;#34;, but it has without a doubt made my hair feel much healthier, and has given my hair more volume.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo.  Noticing the difference after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is also drying feeling on my hair. It take a good deal to get it to lather and I have VERY soft, natural water herein the mountains.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see reduced hair loss or even more air, my main reasons for trying it. At the cost I am very disappointed but willing to hang in a while longer to see ifit all changes.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. My hair looks fuller and shinier and hair loss has been minimized!</li>
    <li> Much too drying for my hair.  And the dried hair lasted through nearly two weeks of intensive conditioning.</li>
    <li> I have very find hair, and this shampoo works great for my thin hair giving it volume all over. It doesn&#x27;t really lather, but I feel works pretty well in providing volume. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have a number of health issues that have mandated that I find organic products to replace all of my traditional household and health and beauty items. My hair was thinning due to absorption issues of nutrients, so while my doctor worked on the medical issues I worked on my skin and hair. This shampoo has become a huge part of my wellness and beauty regime and I won&#x27;t be giving it up even as my health is returning. It&#x27;s worth every penny, and my hair is healthier now than before. My hair is fuller with more volume, soft to touch and now that I am healthy again, new hair growth is returning. It&#x27;s shiny again. I still have a ways to go to have a full head of hair back compared to where I was, but finding this product line when I did leaves me no doubt that it helped slow down the hair loss and slowly helped restore my hair.(At one point my hair had become so dry that it would crinkle when touched). I&#x27;ve been using for two months now. I also use the conditioner and oil. ~Sherry Bettis~</li>
    <li> just been a month i started using this, what i noticed is before using this shampoo while drying hair with towel i used to see hairs sticking in towel but this has been reduced, felt like there is no hair breakage. lets wait for next 2 months and see for complete 3 months result.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I have noticed significantly less hair loss since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Made my scalp itchy as heck and my hair feel thinner :( would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this in Feb &amp; it&#x27;s been the only shampoo I&#x27;ve used since then. It smells very good (eucalyptus fresh), gently tingles my scalp and it cleanses my hair. However, I do not see any change with my hair growth or the fullness or thickness of my hair. It simply does not work &amp; is not organic. It&#x27;s a fraud.</li>
    <li> I see what all of the buzz is about.  It feels great on my head and makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product from 3 months no big results, i don&#x27;t experienced regrowth but stopped falling hair.</li>
    <li> Makes hair extremely dry. Stay away if you have dry hair.</li>
    <li> I used an entire bottle before I wrote this.  I&#x27;m on bottle 2 and this is what I have to say about it. It is a great shampoo! Makes my hair feel healthier, it looks less balding. I can&#x27;t say if my hair is regrowing, but it looks like it is.</li>
    <li> Works really well!  Will buy it again when needed.  So glad I found it!</li>
    <li> is a ver good product fulfills its function recommended for family and friends</li>
    <li> I bought this argan oil based on its high reviews on Amazon. I had been using Moroccan Oil till then, not knowing there were so many other chemicals in the product.  I decided to give Pura d&#x27;or a chance.  I am so happy I did.  The smell is very faint as in nature, which makes me believe in its purity.  I use it mostly for my fine hair which I a trying to grow out. A small amount goes a long way and the bottle lasts a long time. I hade tried it on my hands and feet and even face and I have had no adverse reaction although my skin is sensitive. I love it and will buy again.  Thank you for a good quality product. Please do not change the formula.</li>
    <li> Expensive but makes my hair feel soft and full at the same time. Will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works, I highly recommend!!!! My hair loss has diminished dramatically since the first time I used the product. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that helps you with hair thinning this is the way to go!!!!!!</li>
    <li> One of my friend told me about this shampoo, so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve used two bottles already. I feel fresh everytime I used it, and the same time I hope it&#x27;s working for my hair loss. I&#x27;ve seen some improvements on my bold spots when I had my hair cut few days ago, so I&#x27;m here to give it a good review.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is one of the best I have had in a very long time. My hair got stronger and falls in its natural form again, it looks fuller and shinier. Every day I use the shampoo i am very happy with my hair all day long. Also I dont have to wash it as often, than I used to.</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely feels like it is working when you use it. I also like that using it is as easy as shampooing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo it did great, and felt quite nice. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t say I noticed much improvement in hair loss after just one bottle, but I may just be in the case of people who are not affected :/</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo &amp; I think my hair is not coming out as much as it was.</li>
    <li> My hair looks beautiful and thicker. Product works very well for a senior in her upper 70s.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo that makes your hair shiny and strong.  It is especially great for thin, brittle hair.  I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing, after trying so many different shampoo, all soft of &amp;#34;...logy&amp;#34;, etc. this is the only one we have been using now and recommend to all our friends.</li>
    <li> I have tried several methods for stopping my considerable and ongoing thinning and hair loss and found nothing that worked for the long haul until I read about and tried Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic argon oil shampoo.  I have been using it for six months, along with daily applications of Women&#x27;s Rogaine to my scalp, and experienced a rapid reduction in the amount of hair that had been falling out in the shower or when brushing, combing and styling my hair.  It is either this product or a combination of the shampoo with the Rogaine that markedly reduced my hair loss.  It is not the Rogaine alone that worked for me, because I had been using that product by itself a few years ago, and found that it effected very little reduction in my hair loss.  So, needless to say, the results I have had using Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and Rogaine together have produced thicker, healthy and shiny hair with what I would call normal daily loss of a few hairs.  I am thrilled with the results I see when I look in the mirror!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a African American 24 and of course our hair texture is different but it&#x27;s a overall good shampoo my hair does look thicker. I know you can&#x27;t leave it in your hair to long cause it can take out more of your hair. It&#x27;s alot scams out there and I hope this aint one.So far so good!!</li>
    <li> Used for over 6 months.  Did nothing to regrow any hair; in fact, it may have made shedding worse.  I do know for sure that it made my scalp so dry and itchy that I finally couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and quit using it.  It does clean your hair, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> So far, no difference in hair loss, but it may be too soon to tell.  The smell isn&#x27;t great, but if you use their conditioner, it is awesome and smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for three months, along with Biotin oral supplement.  I noticed the hair loss after my shower is decreased to at least half of what it used to be.  Look forward to even better result down the road.</li>
    <li> very sudsy. not sure if it got it all rinsed out. only used a few times.</li>
    <li> Good product. Smell is pretty good. Leaves hair feeling refreshed and vitalized.</li>
    <li> Wow! What a great shampoo this is! To be honest I did use so many different brands of shampoo before but this shampoo is such an extra ordinary! The purad&#x27;or did such an amazing job to make this amazing shampoo. After first use of this shampoo my hair become so smooth and looks more shine and beautiful. And it has no any harm chemicals so you can use it daily basis with confidence. I am glad to purchase this product and I will definitely buy this again because I fall in love with it! And of course I recommend this product to everyone who wants to make their hair beautiful! I love it. You will too go for it. It&#x27;s worth it. Thanks purad&#x27;or.  :)</li>
    <li> great for when youre going bald!</li>
    <li> My hair has been breaking and falling out for about 2 months so I decided to try this shampoo because it had the best reviews but its been a month and I have not noticed any change what&#x27;s so ever</li>
    <li> so far hasn&#x27;t helped with hair loss but feels good  to use natural</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this necessarily helps for hair loss (I&#x27;ve only been using it about two months and haven&#x27;t noticed a change), but it definitely helped my hair become softer!  My husband even started using it and noticed a huge difference in how soft his hair is.  I will continue to use this as my primary shampoo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for about a month and my thinning hair looks and feels significantly fuller. I&#x27;m not completely certain but it seems like some new hair is growing. Pura d&#x27;or is the best shampoo i&#x27;ve used i&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Started working from day 1 to stop the crazy amount of hair loss I was experiencing from having a hysterectomy. I combined this shampoo with hair vitamins ... a few month later and my hair looks / feels more thick.</li>
    <li> great product.Smells really good.hair feels clean  and fresh. Really liked the conditioner too!! First time buyer. will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This did not help me reduce/slow down my hair loss/fall. Now, I&#x27;m not bald in any way. I just shed a lot of hair and depending on the season, it things out significantly. Plus it made my dandruff flare up. Now, the make an anti dandruff version, but since it was not the top of the line I fugured I start with the best product first. That was a waste for me. It did help my mother - not for hair loss, but it makes her scalp less oily.</li>
    <li> Not liking this product. Does not live up to its promises. Hair is sticky, does not feel clean and I am shedding more than ever.</li>
    <li> Just started to use it. No problems so far. Can&#x27;t wait to get me fuller head of hair!!! Smells good!</li>
    <li> Tried with no results at all. Dermatologist told me that such miracle products never work and to seek professional medical advice in the future which is what I&#x27;ve now done with my dr.</li>
    <li> This is probably the only natural hair care shampoo that has ever actually worked for me. It is completely different from other so-called hair care products. It had started working on hair and scalp from my first use. I had less hair as I suffered from typhoid for a long time, but now I have lots of hair in my head. It was only possible for this product. It is an organic anti-hair loss shampoo. I’m a great fan of it now. This product has changed my look and life as well. Many thanks to Pura d&#x27;or organic anti-hair loss shampoo!</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged from using a bad coloring product. It was falling out &amp; breaking off. Since using Pura d&#x27;or shampoo, my hair has greatly improved. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Reduced hair falling off. Mmm hair is still thinning out. Smells good and other than that its not so brilliant as others say. But most probaly I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo for my boyfriend who is thinning upfront. Pleasantly surprised that this natural product at minimum has slowed the thinning/hair loss process. I ALWAYS prefer to use an organic product vs. the chemical laden alternatives on the market. I will have him continue the use of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with this product.  I do feel that it does dry out my hair so I am very gentle when washing my hair. Then I use a good cream rinse.  My hair is looking much better.</li>
    <li> I have started to see some restoration to my hair. In addition, when I run my hands through my hair, less hair seems to fall out.</li>
    <li> It delivers, it helps my hair a lot.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was thinning and incredibly weak and using this shampoo made a huge impact almost immediately . Although you can&#x27;t expect a shampoo do it all, such miracles do NOT exist, I also added iron and biotin supplements to my diet, all that, together with this shampoo gave me great results, such as more hair on my head than lost in a comb or on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing my hair being shiny and more manageable AND stronger from the get go of using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, you really don&#x27;t want it to mistakenly end up in your eyes, because it HURTS, and not like a  regular shampoo that could do that, much much more. Other than that, it&#x27;s an amazing product, a bit pricey but keep in mind, it doesn&#x27;t take much per use and it lasts quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and again, and I have recommended it to a few friends already.&lt;br /&gt;It brought back thick and shiny hair, and their color looks amazing too!&lt;br /&gt;I dye my hair and using this product , only made my hair dye last longer and look better.</li>
    <li> Wow, what shine and control. I have used the product three times so I have not seen any change in the loss of my hair or increase in volume.  Being an organic product, I was surprised at the long list of ingredients even though they are natural.  Hope to see increase in volume with continued use.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Works as advertised</li>
    <li> I know the first thing everyone wants to know is, does it work?  Well, let me give you a little background before I answer that.  I&#x27;m a 32 year old guy with a slight bit of recession in my hairline.  Overall things could be much worse, but I was looking more for a way to keep the hair that I have.  Any new ones that popped up would just be a bonus.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months now, and I can say that my hair looks and feels great.  While I do feel like I&#x27;ve seen a few new hairs here and there, it&#x27;s not too noticeable.  But healthy hair looks fuller, and for that I am a big fan of this product.  It&#x27;s nice knowing I don&#x27;t have any unnecessary chemicals in my hair.  I&#x27;ve also become a fan of the smell as well.  I will definitely continue to use this.</li>
    <li> hair don&#x27;t look good after using this shampoo, they look like unwashed, no shine and smooth. Tried to use it with different hair conditioner-same thing, not helping.</li>
    <li> I was SUPER skeptical about trying this expensive shampoo but I have to say, after using it for 3 months, I&#x27;m definitely losing less hair in the shower so I&#x27;m ordering another bottle.  My hair feels fuller with more body as well. I try to shampoo every other day.  My hair shafts are thin and the texture is slightly frizzy.  I&#x27;m 49 and color my hair about every 7 weeks.  I blow dry, use a flat iron and a curling iron after each washing.</li>
    <li> This product seems to actually work.  I have been using it for the past couple months and I have noticed my hair loss to have slowed dramatically.  My only complaint would be the smell of the shampoo.  It is a little weird.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly a month. I did notice my scalp becoming itchy. I also noticed that it seemed like less hair was falling out. It&#x27;s hard to say what could be helping (or hindering) when you&#x27;re using multiple products. I don&#x27;t have a problem with my scalp being a little itchy if this product is saving my hair. I think I just need to try it for a few months to be conclusive. I have already started to alternate by using this every other day or ever two days to help curb the itching. I do like that it doesn&#x27;t have the same old chemicals (sulfates, parabens, alcohols, etc.) found in most shampoos!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s an allergic reaction, but after using this shampoo just once, my scalp started to itch and flake like crazy the next day.  I had to stop using it after 2 days.  Several weeks later, I did give it another chance, and once again, severe itching along with flaking.  Along with the itching and flaking, it caused MORE hair than usual to fall out.  I&#x27;ve since stopped using it.  Such a waste of money for me considering how much a bottle costs.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve been using this product every  day  for about a month.  My sister said my hair looked thicker after only 2 weeks. I have noticed that  the thinning spots on my scalp seem to be less obvious. I have had some itchy spots-perhaps that is new hair starting to grow-I hope so. I&#x60;m looking forward to the results  after using  pura dor  for a few months. I&#x60;ll be recommending this to my friends and siblings with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> very gentle, and the smell is nice too!! Have noticed i loose less hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> like it- works great- i see the improvement. must buy</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about eight months.  I like it a lot.  It works, I have less fall out since using this.  Plus is is made from good ingredients and not full of chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a month now and do not like it. I wanted to give it some time but I&#x27;m going to stop using it -- hasn&#x27;t decreased or stopped my hair loss and leaves my hair feeling dry. Definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This&#x27;s the 2 bottles I used(previous 2 are the blue label). While it&#x27;s rated on the top of Amazon rank it&#x27;s hard to not be attractive by it. Its texture is smooth you almost can feel your hairs thicken and stronger when you use it in the right time(from time to time feeling varied), so I&#x27;m sure in some degree it(or Argan oil) has a good level of hair protection ability. However, hair loss prevention is too complex, requiring more than just a shampooing process, I believe you will feel better if taking care of your overall body mechanism at the same time. And only speaking of the product it&#x27;s not a bad hair protection product if you can afford the price. That&#x27;s my opinion.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but do not like the smell</li>
    <li> I feel the shampoo does make my hair look thicker with more volume. It also feels clean after using the shampoo. It is also very easy to clean the hair after using the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo on line by accident as I was searching for answers to help my crazy hair.  I will be 51 in 13 days and in the last year and a half, my hair has gone from fine and straight to fine and curly like a lamb!  Even my bangs were not blowing out straight, but flipping up like a pigs tail.  I will be going to an Internist soon to check my hormonal levels, but I have been so depressed with all the changes of post menopause.  This morning I did lose a lot more hair than usual when I washed my hair, but I blow dried the crown and bangs and my hair is smoother, shinier, fuller and lays flat and smooth like it used to be!!  I am soooo happy!  I bought the conditioner with Lavender and Vanilla which smells so good and actually left my hair soft.  My shower has so many conditioners and masks that I have bought over the last months in desperation to find a cure, and nothing has worked as good as your product.  I feel so good today because my hair is behaving like it used to behave.  Thank you for an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I bought it just to try according to the reviews, but wow It does work. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Good product, but the customer service policy is bad.</li>
    <li> If you could just try it, you will see the results!  I was skeptical at first also. But seeing thousands of good review, and the USDA certified organic ingredients (don&#x27;t be fooled by products that claim to be organic unless there is a USDA certified logo on them!), how could it be bad, right?  Spending this much for a shampoo was a hard decision to make but I tried it. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and I started seeing lots of sprouts everywhere. Even the area that was completely hairless for more than 2 years!</li>
    <li> I have only issued a four-star review because no real results can be seen yet.  Yes, it does clean hair very well, which is great-- but most other reveiws claim that six-months are needed before results can be seen.... stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 2015-- four months into this now-- I really do not see much happening-- and my barber agrees that the progress is slow so far.  I&#x27;ll keep going, but my hopes are dwindling.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems to be working for me.  Started using it about 3 weeks ago and  I&#x27;m losing fewer hairs each day.  Do not get it in your eyes!  It is expensive, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot .  If it does what it claims to do I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is without a doubt the best anti-hair loss shampoo I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;m 47 and have been loosing my hair slowly but regularly for years now and within a month of using this shampoo I can without a doubt say it has slowed and even stopped my hair from falling out. It also leaves your hair full and remarkably soft and conditioned, you don&#x27;t  need a separate conditioner. One final plus my wife also loves the shampoo so we don&#x27;t need a different shampoo anymore.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED, WORKS GREAT, GOOD PRICE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in rotation with some other popular brands for a couple of month now. Although, I don&#x27;t see any growth from any of the shampoos that I&#x27;m using, I do prefer this one over the others. My hair and scalp turn out looking the best compared with the others. I&#x27;m not blown away by it but I&#x27;ll stick with it for the time being until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. Good results so far. I have noticed decrease hair loss after 1 month use. Will recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I waited for after using 1 month to write the review. The first 2 or 3 weeks I see more hair shedding on the countertop. But I think maybe because this is the first time I use organic shampoo, the hair needs time to adjust. After about 3 weeks, the shedding stopped. Although I don&#x27;t see any regrowth hair, but very obviously, the hair on the floor and countertops are a lot lesser. Before I use this shampoo, I always need to vacuum the floor after I wash my hair, but now I can vacuum once a week. A  big progress! I give it 4 stars because It  lathers not very good, I need 3 or 4 pumps to shampoo my hair, as you know, I have  short and thinning hair and I installed the whole house water softner . I hope I can see the hair- regrowth after I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> Strongly suggest when you have hair loss problem . Anyway it makes hair healthy and prevent thinner</li>
    <li> Normally, I worry about using shampoo frequently, as it dries my hair out, causes split ends, and creates dandruff. Even more, I was becoming concerned with the fact that my sensitive hair could become permanently damaged as a result of sticking to more conventional shampoos. This shampoo did a good job of thickening my hair, as well as boosting volume slightly. I wouldn&#x27;t say there is a need to use it everyday, but if you have sensitive/thin hair, this might help a little with boosting the feel and fullness of your hair.</li>
    <li> So far so good! The first time I used it it made my hair feel unclean and weird, but the second time was much better and now it is consistanty clean feeling -but I do suggest using a conditioner after, even if you only leave it on for a few seconds. I used whatever conditioner I had on hand because I could not afford both the shampoo and conditioner of this brand. As per the instructions, I washed my hair (almost) every day. Normally, because my hair is so dry naturally, I only washed once or twice a week, so it&#x27;s a big adjustment for me to wash it so frequently. My hair does seem more voluminous, but only time will tell.</li>
    <li> It is weird what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first two weeks I thought I had hit the jackpot with this product... my hair was thicker, looked healthy and had more body. I noticed new hair growing and less hair loss... it only lasted TWO WEEKS. After two weeks I continued to use it and realized the thickness and the body were gone, my hair is dry, static and the hair loss has increased. I have lost so much hair to give this product a try and now I am worst than I was before... if anyone wants to share their experience and maybe have experienced the same please e-mail me too @ Rainbow99_923@hotmail.com because I am so disappointed and if you have any tips to help me getting some of my hair back please help me. I am desperate.</li>
    <li> Received it really quick, have been using it for 4 days now and I already notice a significant amount of less hair loss. Haven&#x27;t seen much regrow though.</li>
    <li> Good product,  been using it 4 days and already noticed less hairloss.</li>
    <li> Its good and keep my hair where its at I don&#x27;t loose anymore.</li>
    <li> great shampoo fight hair loss really must have</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend and it seems to be working (at least giving more volume) in just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer. I can assure you that this product works. I not only stopped losing hair, I&#x27;m growing new hair. My hair also looks fuller. The product was recommended to me by my wife who is a cosmetologist. Just a small amount of the product is need to obtain excellent results, so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I tried so many products... I&#x27;m not bold but I&#x27;m trying to Mantein my hair awesome... This shampoo is a regular one...! I tried 3 bottles in the row... Nothing special and nothing change so far... 2 stars no more than that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo almost every day (using Nizoral on the off days) and I must say it&#x27;s helped with the texture of my hair. I don&#x27;t have pics to post but that&#x27;s cause I&#x27;m lazy. It keeps my hair shiny and makes it feel soft to touch. I still have to style with gel though because my hair is naturally unruly but using this regularly makes it less so. I&#x27;ll be grabbing another bottle for sure once I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I liked the volume this gave my hair. I can&#x27;t say it helped with hair loss, but it made my hair feel amazing.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical in buying this product since I don&#x27;t believe in shampoos that help with hair growth! But I gave it a shot and 2 months later I can honestly say that this shampoo worked! I have noticeably thicker hair with lots of baby hair in my temple area! It was a great buy and will be buying this product in the near future!</li>
    <li> Works great!!! No complaints here.</li>
    <li> This product seems to do as it says for the most part, although I have yet to see any new hairline growth.</li>
    <li> Initial review: I&#x27;ve only used this a few days but I really like it so far. My hair is thin and gets oily quickly and becomes flat/looks thin as the day progresses. This shampoo does a good job maintaining volume and quality of style. I can&#x27;t comment much on the anti-hair loss yet, but I have had less hairs falling out when I run my hands through my hair. Will update my review down the road for a better assessment of anti-hair loss properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (12.28.2015): For me, this shampoo was snake oil. I am on my third bottle and can confidently say my rate of hair loss is unchanged. The product does not lather well and requires a couple washings to fully clense my hair. Since this is expensive, doubling the consumption rate is not ideal. In general I&#x27;m not too happy with how my hair feels after using the shampoo. Gets oily and flat very quickly. Can&#x27;t really say much for the smell of the shampoo either. I hate it. This will be my last bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for a month and my hair has stopped falling and I can see new hair growing. I know that not everybody gets the same results but I have used many other products and so far this is the one that is workimg for me!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I noticed that there was less hair in my brush. You only need a very small amount to get a full head of lather and I have hair almost to my waist. I&#x27;ve not had it for very long but so far excellent product!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great ingredients. Best hairloss shampoo on the market.</li>
    <li> I have noticed my hair loss slowing a bit, I will keep using this product!</li>
    <li> I would recommend it for someone losing hair occasionally.  This has helped a friend who was shedding frequently along with me purchasing Jamaican Black Castor oil and virgin coconut oil.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really a good product and the bottle is big I didn&#x27;t know that , and the shippping is pretty fast ! Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> I have already used one bottle of shampoo, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance because I didn&#x27;t lose so much hair as before. So this time I ordered  both the shampoo and the conditioner. My fiance and I have already used the shampoo combined with the conditioner for two days. After use it, it not only helps stopping lose hair, but also make the hair smells fresh and feels good, we both love it!</li>
    <li> Had bad hair loss due to stress after being in hospital ICU.  After using shampoo and conditioner within a week could tell a significant improvement in the amount of hair loss.  I would recommend both products because they worked for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  This is my second bottle and I am seeing great results.</li>
    <li> This is a valid, and hope that it will soon hold.</li>
    <li> Not that great I am not a fan</li>
    <li> I purchased the product after having a heavy hair loss .....I&#x27;m delighted to can see a good result after 3 weeks of using this product I&#x27;ll keep using it and I would recommend it for anyone has hair loss problem ...</li>
    <li> Good,makes my scalp stop itching,a little strong though,I am African american,my hair is usually very dry,leaving shampoo on my scalp causes an irritation and possibly shedding,I will wash my hair with purador,wash 7th again with another shampoo and condition it,that works better. I am glad that this producth on the market,I will continue to purchase it,thanks. Dayna like finnan:)</li>
    <li> I am an African male almost turning forty and half way through this shampoo. I must be honest; I was very hesitant to write a review until I was certain that I had really noticed hair growth improvement on my scalp. Two years ago I was diagnosed with Androgenetic Alopecia and I have been on Minoxidil, Ketokonazole 2%, 1mg Finpecia tablets, a hair follicle stimulating shampoo and hair growth vitamins. Within the two years my hair loss had lessened and I have noticed hair growth that has slowly been converging onto the center of my scalp where the severe balding is. Three months ago I came across this shampoo on amazon and decided to have a go at it while sidelining my other prescribed hair growth shampoo I had been using prior. To my delight, I have noticed healthier and more regrowth plus less hair loss after just having gone through half the bottle. I am now planning to purchase more and stick to this shampoo. I am very sure that this product has worked for me but I am not guaranteeing that the same results would be obtained by another individual as we all have different responses and metabolisms plus varied hair growth periods. I have not attained the full head I anticipate but the best advice I can give is that only with patience and perseverance will one fulfill hair growth goals. Hair regrowth does not happen like magic. I hope all that want to give this product a try will experience the same positive results I have experienced or even better.</li>
    <li> Great Product!! I have been using this for the past few months and am extremely happy with the results. I have seen my hair come back to the way it was years ago. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Definitely felt a difference in hair stability.  Took a few months but noticed the difference.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;ve been loosing my hair for many years. My hair falls all day long and comes out in clumps. Since using this product I have almost no hair that comes out.... nothing compared to before. I have also been taking vitamins and using the pura d&#x27;or conditioner and argon oil.  I am about 1 month in and already ordered another bottle of each for when I run out. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> To be fair I do not &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; this product I simply do not believe it did anything to help with my thinning hair.  I have used almost the entire bottle and have not seen positive results from it.  I would lather it specifically on my scalp and then leave it their for a minimum of five or more minutes (usually more).  But again to be fair I did not use it on a daily basis as the label instructs for &amp;#34;noticeable results&amp;#34; - this is simply due to the fact that I have long hair and do not wash it daily.  What I have noticed helps with thinning hair is iron supplements.  Bottom line for me, it&#x27;s a nice shampoo but not one that I will continue to buy for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Amazon for many years but this is my first review.  After reading reviews on many shampoo products, I decided to try this. My hair felt so good when I started using it and it was full covering all the bald spots while reducing the hair loss. However, I should say my hair looks dry lately. Not sure if it&#x27;s because of the shampoo or weather but I don&#x27;t feel the same I felt when I started using it. Will keep on using for some more months and see how it goes</li>
    <li> The results that come from using this shampoo are truly remarkable. I bought this as a gift for my mom because her scalp is overly sensitive. Every other brand of shampoo would irritate her scalp and cause hair loss. Before this, she was using Nioxin which was working for a while but then the hair loss came back and I decided to give this shampoo a shot. By the end of the first 2 weeks, her hair was more voluminous and softer and guess what? The hair loss stopped! Now all she does is use this shampoo with a little Coconut oil treatment every now and then and BAM! Her curly hair is perked up and full of life. The only complaint she and I had was the scent which is fine because this version of Pura d&#x27;or is organic so I assume that&#x27;s why it smells a bit more raw. Other than that, I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> This Anti-Hair less shampoo will reduce the drain clogs by about half.  For the first three months the reduction is slow.  Between months three through six the most noticeable change will happen. For those three months there is significantly less and less hair in the drain of the tub.  Once you get to the six month mark the reduction will plateau.  Between months six and twelve the shampoo does a good job of maintaining the loss but it will not get any better than Half of the amount.  Hair loss due to stress is also evident and the shampoo will not help that cause so try to keep a positive mentality.  Your hair will get fuller and healthier with visible differences but realize that after six months of use that it will look this good.  This has been our experience and I hope that it helps with your decision.  Dan</li>
    <li> Yes, this product is expensive, but for what you get its definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve had thinning and receding hair for the past five or so years, and I&#x27;ve tried a number of products. Most of them had harsh chemicals that made my hair look dry and dead. Pura d&#x27;Or made my hair look healthy while following through on the promised results. I&#x27;m only not giving it five stars because it is quite expensive, but like I said, worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a week now. It smells herbal. It definitely doesn&#x27;t create very much lather, which I&#x27;m not used to, and I dislike. Given how expensive this is, I&#x27;m only putting it on my scalp. I&#x27;m using my regular shampoo for the rest of my locks. I will say, it cleans my hair and scalp (build-up too), extremely well. I&#x27;m very happy about that! I will add to this review, the more I use it. I hope it works the way it promises to.</li>
    <li> This is my honest opinion. I wasn&#x27;t one of the people who received free product in return for their review. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 1 1/2 months. The first week using this product I was happy because my hair looked really nice and felt thicker. After the first couple of weeks my hair started to dry out and about 5 weeks into using the product my hair became even thinner in the area that I was hoping would grow hair (right in the front)..which was pretty devastating. Now, maybe it&#x27;s possible that as more time passes that there will be new hair growth but who wants to have hair loss before there&#x27;s new hair growth...that&#x27;s just like getting back to where I started from, and that&#x27;s ridiculous! I didn&#x27;t want to use it anymore, fearing it would just get worse...never better. Hopefully, my hair will go back to the way it was. So, I wish I had read more of the 1 star reviews before buying this shampoo....I might have thought twice and not proceeded with the purchase. Anyways, in my opinion it will only make the situation worse....save your money.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo. I have been using this for over a month now and my dandruff and itchy scalp has gone away completely. I also use the conditioner which smells great and leaves my hair smooth and thick</li>
    <li> It does not lather very well but I think it cleans ok.</li>
    <li> I did not see much of hair strand on the bath tub since started using this product. It seems it is working.</li>
    <li> After one year use of this product, we find that we like this shampoo better than others we have tried over the years. Both me and my wife feel our hair is healthier, less hair loss, and overall in better condition. We will recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great one,it gives a lot of volume to hair and fresh tingling feeling</li>
    <li> Its amazing my hair was soo thin and when i used this one it doesnt fall anymore and its become longer than ever</li>
    <li> Revised my review after trying out other shampoos that help with hair growth and hair loss. This shampoo is OKAY at best (for me anyway, so 3 stars) it does it&#x27;s job but I&#x27;m questioning the cost effectiveness, compared to Nizoral.  Nizoral did a better job for hair loss/growth for me, and @ a lower price--21-28oz of Nizoral is the same price as this.  Nizoral probably works differently for everyone, but Nizoral vs this shampoo is night and day for me. in the morning and when I wash my hair; this shampoo helped with hair loss, but Nizoral did a better job.&lt;br /&gt;The big plus of this shampoo is its mainly organic/natural. Nizoral is mainly man-made chemicals..but hey whatever helps grow/maintain my hair lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on hair loss forums I read, the big 3 to stop hair loss and for hair growth (google search!) is Rogaine, Nizoral, and that drug that causes impotence lol. I only use 2 of the 3..because you know..I don&#x27;t want to be that 1-2% that lose the ability to &amp;#34;perform&amp;#34;.  If you decide to try Nizoral..do some research for side effects and how to apply it effectively for hair loss. I only decided to try out other hair loss shampoos due to the price of Pura--haha. However based on other reviews, this shampoo might do a better job for other people..so this review is only my opinion &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I have used both the blue and gold label of this shampoo and both seems to work well. Hair thinning has began to stop, and the need to not worry about harsh chemicals is definitely a bonus. I have been using this for months now and it has proven to be very helpful so far.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that this actually did its job. I have been using this now for roughly three months and just purchased my second bottle. I shave in the shower, so I usually lather this up and leave it in while I shave. When I dry off my hair with the towel, I notice less and less hair coming off. I also can honestly tell that my hair is thicker when my barber gives me the dreaded &amp;#34;how does the back look&amp;#34; double-mirror routine. I will continue using this down the line.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo just need the pump to be updated e get stuck on the bottom</li>
    <li> Impressed with the ingredients list. Nice foam. Too early to tell if it is helping with the hair loss.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a high quality shampoo and gives me more body.  I like it and would buy again.</li>
    <li> My hair is starting to grow back near my temples. I have PCOS, and one of the symptoms is male-pattern baldness. I have had these bald spots for years thinking there is nothing I can do. It&#x27;s been about a month, and I am starting to see some growth. I&#x27;ll post some before and after pics in a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I only wash my roots with this shampoo, then follow up with my regular shampoo, as this shampoo makes my long hair quite tangly. No complaints, I just use this shampoo as a scalp treatment.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first that I would be able to get a product that could help with my hair loss.  I am duly very impressed with this product. My hair loss was very bad.  It was getting very thin on the sides at the temples, as well as the top of my head. I am amazed when I wash and comb my hair loss it down over 80%  I will be making another purchase when I start to get low. I also went ahead and ordered the conditioner , to be delivered next week. I am excited to see how it works with the shampoo. I will be getting rid of the other shampoos I have tried. I was expecting a free bottle after my first purchase and gave my feedback, which I did not receive. SAYING THAT. I DO LIKE THE PRODUCT IT HAS HELPED, AND I PURCHASED ANOTHER EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NOT COMPLETED THE FIRST BOTTLE.</li>
    <li> I bought Pura d&#x27;or 100% Organic Argan Oil as a replacement for another brand.  My decision to buy this brand was due to the price, The USDA guarantee, and the reviews that I read before I purchase any new brand.  I use this product in my hair, on my skin, and am starting to use it for cuticle treatments today.  I am very satisfied with my purchase, and will buy Pura d&#x27;or again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. While I haven&#x27;t regrown hair, the hair loss stopped almost immediately and the texture and volume are amazingly improved.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has helped with my hair loss when nothing else would. It leaves my fine, blonde hair with amazing volume and shine. I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This shampoo did more harm than good. Dried my hair left it full of static, and my hair fell out more than ever!  Sent it back for a full refund.</li>
    <li> I have had the Argan Oil for 1 week now and am so happy with it.  Have tried it on my &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; hair and am very happy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of the natural ingredients.  It was much larger bottle than I expected and it lasted longer than I thought.  I used it in the AM and PM and I really enjoyed the fragrance of this product.  I feel it definitely curbed my hair loss but, and I will need to fine a product that stimulates hair growth to use in tandem with this one.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the purest most fresh Argan oil on the market. 1-2 drops in hair after washing- or on skin- immediate absorption. Love it! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of pura d&#x27;or.  I love it! I&#x27;ve used it on cuts and scrapes and I swear it speeds the healing, leaving no scar.  I use it in my hair and it does not leave it oily at all. I use it on my face before bed and on my hands and really all body parts.  I live in Arizona so I the dry air really takes its toll but pura d&#x27;or is a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt so silky. It&#x27;s too early to tell about helping with the hair loss, but others swear by it. Top shelf ingredients as well.</li>
    <li> I am an international student who has been in the US for about 3 years. Before using this product, I tried hundreds of ways to save myself from falling hair. Beside changing my lifestyle, I also tried at least 10 kinds of different shampoos, includes a very popular product that I brought from China, but none of them could really help with my hair. However when I tried this, it DOES HELP A LOT. From the first time I used it, the amount of falling hair has been greatly decreased. I kept using this product for a semester and it really help me to stop the loss. I also recommend it to my family and I bet they&#x27;ll love it :D</li>
    <li> Has only been a month. The conditioner is a great product so I have high hopes with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for two weeks and I do notice that my hair become thicker and fuller. In addition, this shampoo smells nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for 3 months. My hair loss is much less now</li>
    <li> Great Product, smells good, feels great and it does make your hair feel fuller.</li>
    <li> My hair(which was thinning) has shown a remarkable response since I started using Pura D&#x27;or shampoo!</li>
    <li> Pura d’or Hair Loss Prevention organic shampoo is a product that I came across and with all the best and heart touching reviews I made a step of owning one it really stopped my hair loss I love it :)</li>
    <li> For the past three years my hair has been falling out excessively.  My hair brushes, shower drains and bed pillows were evidence every day...very depressing.  I stumbled on the DHT factor through internet research which led me to Pura d&#x27;or.  I have been using it for about three months now and very very happy with the results.  I can&#x27;t say my hair is growing back yet but it has almost completely quit shedding.  Only wish I had discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband (instead of Nioxin) --- he wasn&#x27;t impressed, nor was I.</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome stuff. My hair is feeling and looking much thicker. I&#x27;ve been super anxious about my receding hairline, this definitely helps.</li>
    <li> I am overall pleased with the shampoo. At first, I wasn&#x27;t too sure as my hair felt dry as a bone when I washed it with this. But don&#x27;t give up...after a week or so your hair will adjust and will feel so much softer. Be sure to use their brand conditioner with it too...it helps a lot with the dryness. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of how dry it felt at first (like I said that goes away) and the smell is not really my thing, but those are worth how your hair will look and feel. I am also starting to see some of my hair that was damaged from bleaching grow back!!</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a difference.  Product works precisely as advertised, in my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Used for 6weeks alternate day.Reduced hairfall to half. Also had Biotin daily.&lt;br /&gt;Found some changes in hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached pic before and after.</li>
    <li> I am a late 20s female, and I had very little faith in this when I bought it. But I was working long hours at a physically intensive job, as well as dealing with some hormonal health issues and noticed my hair was breaking off at the ponytail line and my ponytail was becoming ridiculously small. I had a handful of hair in the drain every time I showered, and it was making me look scraggly and unhealthy. I eventually had to cut my hair because my hair loss had become so noticeable with my long locks. So I was getting desperate. My hubby was concerned about his hair loss as well, so we tried this. For the first bit I didn&#x27;t read the directions and didn&#x27;t notice much. But after a bit I realized that I was supposed to leave it in my hair for a few minutes (like a heavy conditioner) before rinsing. Let me tell you, this stuff was no joke! Especially after I became pregnant, I wanted something that was safe for the baby without any of those dangerous substances in them like parabens, BPA, etc. There was absolutely zero hair in our drain for a year-mine or hubby&#x27;s. Once I had the baby, i decided to get the cheap stuff to save money. Lots of Hair in drain again. Switched back to this shampoo and within a few weeks the results are noticeable again. This time I&#x27;m using the complimentary conditioner as well and it feels pretty nice! Just remember to leave both the shampoo and conditioner in your hair for at least 3 minutes before rinsing! My cheapo hubby actually requested this shampoo again- and held to that request when I told him the price was 60$ per shampoo/conditioner pair! Previously he complained about my $3.50 herbal essence shampoo because he thought it was an excessive waste just for shampoo. That&#x27;s a pretty impressive recommendation there!</li>
    <li> Super product, after using it just one time, I felt and noticed the high quality!  I&#x27;m now addicted...</li>
    <li> Have to apply a lot to generate bubbles, and it smells like something herbal. It is the second time to use it, and seems I lose less hair than I used to do. But I hope it would prevent more hair loss in the future.</li>
    <li> Have only been using the product for a week but can definitely feel more volume in my hair. I will be giving it a few months to see if I notice further improvements.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any improvement using this product.</li>
    <li> As a fan of Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s argan oil, I was anxious to try this shampoo. Having used it for a couple of weeks, it&#x27;s much too early to tell how well it retards hair loss, but as a shampoo it does a very fine job of providing volume and body to my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I feel like my hair loss did decrease a bit. It&#x27;s nice to use interchangably with other shampoos. Works well when hair is drying out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year now and on my second bottle. I&#x27;m very concerned about hair loss and I figure I&#x27;d give this shampoo a try. I&#x27;ve used another preventative hair loss shampoo that I felt gave my hair more volume and better manageability but with this one compared to the aforementioned shampoo exceedingly better. I gave an uncle of mine who too has concerned about hair loss a sample and asked if I can get him a bottle so I did. He noticed a significant difference in his hair volume and manageability as well! I like that it&#x27;s organic and earth friendly so I would definitely be using this shampoo in the future or until I find some other shampoo that exceeds it&#x27;s effectiveness. I would have gave it 5 stars but the reason I knocked off one is because I know it may never truly prevent hair loss as I become an old geezer..I hope it may prevent hair loss through my mid 30&#x27;s-40&#x27;s. If I still have a full head of thick illustrious hair in my 50&#x27;s-60&#x27;s it may because of Pura d&#x27; or! ...AND my laser comb!</li>
    <li> Im loving this shampoo. Over the past few months, I have noticed a huge change in my hair. It air dries with better curls, it rarely gets greasy, always smells good, thickened back out, and just all over amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year and I love it. I color my hair with an organic product and I use this product to help keep my hair as healthy as posible. I have used other products that did not do the job and after finding this product I do not have to search any further. I am very happy with this product because it keeps my hair healthy, it supports my scalp, it helps to regenerate healthy and thick hair and at my age I need all the help I can get.</li>
    <li> works well; but we get white head without fail.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband due to hair thinning and dry scalp. No more dry itchy scalp and it actually stopped hairloss.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about three month ago after I started noticing significant hair loss especially after taking a shower. I had a lot of hair just stuck to my fingers after shampooing it and rinsing it out. I started noticing improvements in the amount of hair loss after about one month. Now, three month into using this product I have almost no hair loss after washing my hair. The shampoo smells good and my hair has never looked better. I do not blow dry it and just let it air dry. I am very happy with this shampoo. One bottle lasts about one month. I actually spent less on this shampoo versus what I spend in a month with other products.</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve started using this product, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any more hair loss. So, as far as I can tell the product is working well. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a change in the texture of my hair . It seems to be thickening up a bit. All in all it seems like a great product.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I can tell a difference already.</li>
    <li> When I bought this, it was marketed as good for all hair types, including color-treated hair.  That was deception.  I was unable to use this after about 2 weeks or so.  It DESTROYED my hair.  It stripped it so badly it felt absolutely dead.  I could not get a comb through it even with conditioner, only generous moisturizing would help, and that was still difficult.  In the end, I had to get rid of both shampoo and hair, via a very short haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo did not lather well, yet stripped it so much it SEEMED thicker.  Due to the hair damage, I was unable to to use this after about 2-1/2 weeks.  In this time, I don&#x27;t know that it reduced hair loss, but it definitely increased breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a scam.  I doubt I could get a refund after disposing of it, but I wish Amazon would take another look at the one-star reviews and stop allowing this snake-oil company to continue ripping people off.  I think it costs a lot not because it works well, but because they want to get as much of your money as they can before buyers wise up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a year now and have had a drastic reduction in hair fall. This shampoo alone does a great job</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> I tried Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo for the first time six months ago and have had pretty good results. I noticed that my hair seems thicker and fuller, and there are less spots where I can “see through” my hair to my scalp. It is a good product, no doubt. I stumbled upon Skingenixx Hair Regrowth Shampoo [[ASIN:B00VSC1C6A Skingenixx Professional Strength Hair Regrowth and Thickening Shampoo]] recently and decided to give it a try as a friend of mine told me that they prefer it over the Pura d’or. I have been using the Skingenixx shampoo for two months now and I have had even better results – it is loaded with hair regrowth and thickening ingredients and my hair has never looked better! Both excellent products, but I give the edge to the Skingenixx shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smelled like a dog shampoo I&#x27;ve used for my pets. It dried out my hair and after using two bottles, I&#x27;m giving up on its promise to prevent thinning hair, after it fell short there as well.</li>
    <li> Used once and made my hair feel like straw. Even the Pura conditioner didn&#x27;t help. Hard to comb through, breaking my hair. What&#x27;s the point? Sent it back.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a short time so it is still a little too early to tell if this product is successful or not.  I like the shampoo and the way it makes my hair feel and I like that it comes in s decent sized pump bottle since you need about 6 pumps for shoulder length hair or longer.  It would be great if this did last at least a month but that has yet to be seen.  I purchased this product in hopes of stopping the increased thinning hair and loss.  I have noticed a decrease in the loss but unsure if this is attributed to the use of the shampoo or other things such as change in environment, supplements etc...I DO like that it is 100% Natural Preservative Anti-Hair Loss Formula with Broad-Spectrum DHT Blockers, No Parabens and No Chemical Preservatives.  THIS is why I bought this product in the first place.  It has great reviews and I support the reviews so far.  This is a good buy and definitely the better way to go in comparison to other chemical based types on the market right now!</li>
    <li> At first I was a little bit apprehensive to use this product since I have tried many things and nothing really works. After 3 weeks of using it, I see a total difference in my hair it makes it thicker and feels fuller already. The only bad thing I have to say is that you NEEd to use it with conditioner because without it, your hair gets frizzy and brittle. But with conditioner it&#x27;s an amazing product!!! I love it, it has made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> 6 months ago, I started to see 4-5 hairs on my hand whenever I scratch/hand my hair. After my roommate also warned me about upcoming risk of loosing hair on my scalp, I replaced my old shampoo with this product. I am not sure if this helps growing &amp;#34;new hair&amp;#34;, but I am sure it stopped losing hair. I am experiencing hair falling hair. Also, push button design makes it very convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will not change my shampoo anymore! I definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is a little bit high compared to other products though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for &amp;#34;preventative maintenance&amp;#34; as I&#x27;m a male in my mid-30&#x27;s. I was very impressed with the amount of lather this shampoo provides as it does not contain harmful sulfates.  I&#x27;ve found that other &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past do not lather well due to the lack of sulfates, which ended up leaving my  hair feeling somewhat oily.  That is not the case here however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Researching the ingredients, I have no doubt that this may very well be the best anti-hair loss shampoo on the market.  It gives me piece of mind knowing that I&#x27;m at least being pro-active in my effort towards maintaining my youthful locks well into middle-age and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, since making the switch to this shampoo, my hair now looks and feels healthier.  As an added bonus, it also smells great.</li>
    <li> yes this shampoo is amazing am using it since a while, i used to suffer from hair loss but after using this shampoo my hair loss decreased and the shampoo it self is so gentle on my hair and the smell is so nice and light.  totally recommend buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bout the anti dandruff one as well and am using both.</li>
    <li> Still no benefits  from it .</li>
    <li> I honestly feel like this stuff makes hair fall out faster and it leaves a weird smell. Hair feels so thin after use.</li>
    <li> Best hair shampoo i have ever used.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: FEBRUARY 12, 2017- My Two Year PURA D&#x27;OR Anniversary. Don&#x27;t think I have ever stayed with one product for so long. It still is working for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;QUICK REVIEW: This shampoo helped regrow my postmenopausal (plus recent hysterectomy) thinning hair. It has no silicones (silicones clog pores) but you might need a no silicone conditoner for detangling afterwards. Use it faithfully for at least 3 months. Take before and after pictures to see how your hair is progressing. Read my full story when you have time. It will tell you how the first year went. Also, I have just purchased and left a review for Pura D&#x27;OR Deep Moisturizing Conditioner, which pairs nicely with the shampoo especially of you have dry, curly, or hard to comb out hair. It also is my pick if you are used to regular shampoo and conditoner because it will gives hair more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; but does not weigh it down. If you have hair that goes flat in one day (fine and oily) then go with the regular &amp;#34;blue label&amp;#34; conditioner. I am very impressed with all of these products. Please email me if you have questions and please like my review if it helped you. I PAID FULL PRICE AND WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW. I have no interest or affiliation with the manufacturer or seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY STORY: I was skeptical when I purchased this shampoo 3 months ago. So skeptical that I took a before and after picture to see if it was working. I had pretty full hair until I became of a certain age. Slowly I could see my hair thinning, especially in the front. I went to a dermatologist who told me there was not much I could do. I wanted to tell myself that it wasn&#x27;t true but I would not only find hair all over the shower but everywhere else, too. As far as me, I shampoo daily and have for many years. This shampoo has a pleasant smell (reminds me of incense) but not overpowering or lingering. You will probably need a conditioner afterwards as it appears to be very cleansing. I have colored hair and it did not strip the color. My hair now has body, much more shine and is noticeably thicker. I think you can see that by my before and after pictures. I hope you will give it a try before you give up on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIX MONTH UPDATE: After six months my hair has stayed thicker with no hair loss. I do continue to use Pura D&#x27;or Premium at least three days a weeks. I do switch off with low poo shampoo or apple cider vinegar a few times a week also. Like many women, my hair feels dryer or oiler as the seasons and weather changes. Also, even with great products sometimes switching it up is good! By the way, it pays to stick with this shampoo exclusively for at least three months. It takes time for hair to grow and to see a difference. Hope the update can help someone who is agonizing over thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture: I am adding two pictures (3&amp;4)  taken today 7/3/2015. I am 6 months out from first using this shampoo and about 5 months out of using the Pura D&#x27;or conditioner, which I left a review for today. Finally. As you may notice I need a touch up and also I am holding my hair back tightly like the before picture. The last one is how I normally wear my hair today. No more shortie bangs to TRY to cover the bald spot&lt;br /&gt;(never works!)  Any questions please ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE YEAR UPDATE: I placed my first order of Pura d&#x27;or Gold Label on 1/7/2015. So, I am pretty close to using it for one year. I took a few pictures today. I don&#x27;t know if I really have any improvement over the last 6 months, maybe a little. Certainly, I have much improvement over my very first picture. My hair was broken off and very sparse at least an inch or two in. My scalp looked red and a bit angry. My fine front hair is definately a little longer at this point and you can&#x27;t see my scalp anymore.  My hair dresser said my hair was overall a bit thicker in December.  This is the first time she has said that and I ask her EVERY time!! I have gotten used to using this shampoo which has no silicones and makes your hair a bit tangled before conditioning. I was so used to the slickness of silicones that I figured that this shampoo was drying out my hair. It was not. I have learned that the silicones can build up and also lead to hairloss. So it is a reason to keep using this shampoo and conditioner or at least one that is silicone free. I do recommend trying the Pura d&#x27;or Conditioner. It is very light, untangles my hair and a good match with this shampoo. I have left a review for it, if you are interested in looking at it.

    <li> I LOVE this shampoo!  It is clean, does not leave a residue and I am seeing some new hair growth for the first time in a long time.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just bought this shampoo  1 week back ..does not work for me .my hair fell even more than before totally a very bad product please don&#x27;t waste money...</li>
    <li> Recently started using this so I don&#x27;t know if it will work but so far it has made my hair healthier. The smell is interesting it smells like spices. I&#x27;m glad it contains no harsh chemicals</li>
    <li> Good product, works great!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 56 YO man with thinning hair. I have been seeking a shampoo that at the very least thickens what I have. I have tried several products on the market with very little or no results. I then found Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Shampoo and was skeptical when I ordered, but other reviews were positive. I have been using this product for about two months now and I&#x27;m extremely impressed and satisfied. The first week I noticed my hair was a lot healthier and fuller feeling. It also seems that my hair is darker and less grey in the areas along my temples. About a month into use I started to see baby hairs popping out and now my hair line is filling in. I want to also say that I&#x27;m using the Pura d&#x27;or: Premium Organic Argan oil Conditioner as it adds softness and eliminated the course feeling. I still have about half a bottle left and decided to order a second bottle to have one in reserve as this is now my go-to shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this hair product.  I love the smell and I love the way my hair feels afterwards.  I was loosing a lot of hair and wanted a product that would help with that.  This product has really slowed down the heavy hair falling out and I hope eventually it stops it completely.  Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Nice daily shampoo. Has a bit of inoffensive smell. Not sure as yet of other claims.</li>
    <li> not sure how good the product is, but the pump did not work.  Oh well, I said, I will just open it up and pour it into my hand in the shower.  Nope, it&#x27;s too thick to pour out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So cannot comment on the product as I cannot use it.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this itemabd it is amazing! It&#x27;s not greasy at all and I use it all over. Worked wonders on my hair and face.</li>
    <li> Recieved &amp; used right away, hair had more body than usual, &amp; felt better. I honestly refer this prouduct for anyone looking for a new shampoo. I give this product 5 huge stars.</li>
    <li> It was a good product  but it made my hairs so dry I couldn&#x27;t use everyday</li>
    <li> Pura D&#x27;or is the best shampoo ever!!! Im so happy with the results, my hair is so much thicker.</li>
    <li> Works great. I had appreciable thinning of my hair until I started using this.</li>
    <li> It workes for my dandruff! No more dandruff, it&#x27;s fantstic!</li>
    <li> I used this about 5 times and had to stop. Smells chemically, like Pinesol. It dried my hair so much that it looked and felt like straw. Possibly the worst thing I ever put on my hair.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. I use it once in a day. This seems very good and no harsh chemicals. Feels like it is working great. But have to wait for one or 2 months to comment on it.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months, subsequent to using the blue/brown Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. I didn&#x27;t notice much change with that bottle, so I decided to try this &amp;#34;step-up&amp;#34; product instead. Firstly, I LOVE the fact that this product is mostly, if not all, ORGANIC. Also, free of sulfates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 7 months ago, I noticed my hair was starting to thin (slowly I could see the scalp more than I used to). I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was losing or thinning, but I think it was the latter. I noticed some hair were thicker than a lot of the newer ones. So, I&#x27;ve been using the Pura d&#x27;or line. After having not very encouraging results from the blue/brown bottle, I contacted the seller and got no where with them. Gave up and decided to try this shampoo. I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; as much and as quickly as I&#x27;d like, but there looks like a slight improvement is happening. Keep in mind that I&#x27;ve also added Biotin supplements to my regime, as well as washing my hair every other day instead of everyday. I LOVE the reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and I respect and appreciate what many people have to offer in terms of the products on a real-world basis (not from what the seller site claims).  So, I&#x27;m adding my take on this bottle. I know it&#x27;s worked miracles for some people, for me, so far, it looks as if it&#x27;s as if halting the rapid thinning I was noticing. I will, of course, keep this post updated if I can; and should I see any marked improvement in the future, I definitely will let the readers know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But so far, I&#x27;d have to say this is worth the money! After reading the ingredients from this line, and now being aware of what goes on my scalp and hair, I bawk at regular shampoos that I used to think were fine! I sometimes use remainder of those just to get the excess dirt/oil out of my hair, then I follow up with the pura d&#x27;or and leave in for about 2 minutes before rinsing out! My hair definitely feels cleaner and I feel better knowing that organic, natural substances were on my scalp rather than all the -oxides and -fites and -terophyls that seem to be in other normal shampoos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!nowing that organic, natural substances were on my scalp rather than all the -oxides and -fites and -terophyls that seem to be in other normal shampoos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> I have used it for 2 months now, I do not see any improvement on stop hair loss at all.....&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how you guys see hair loss. Do I need more time? I sued it at least once a day sometimes more than once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 3 months of usage, I have more hair loss than before I used this product!&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT good at all.......&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, feels good, but it make you lose more hair!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use it.....</li>
    <li> I have noticed new growth on my areas of thinning hair. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I only used this product twice and found that it dried and dulled my hair.  I researched the manufacturer&#x27;s into, then phoned the manufacturer to ask for a refund  (label said it was 100% guaranteed).  The manufacturer told me to contact Amazon to begin the return process.  Amazon told me they would send me a return label, but it&#x27;s been weeks now and I haven&#x27;t received the return label.  My dissatisfaction with Amazon is now greater than my dissatisfaction with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> SIMPLY AMAZING !&lt;br /&gt;-My hair feels softer after the very first use!&lt;br /&gt;-Less and Less Thinning hairs fallen off after 2 weeks of use!&lt;br /&gt;-My hair feels tougher and strong after 3 months of usage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips (Obvious/Common Sense)&lt;br /&gt;-Wash your hair every 2 or 3 days for the correct results!&lt;br /&gt;-DO NOT Shampoo your hair everyday as it dries your head (hair and scalp).&lt;br /&gt;*Yes there is such thing as OVER usage !!!</li>
    <li> i have been using the product for about 3 months. It definitely leaves your scalp clean..I&#x27;m going to continue using.. My hair texture seems to have improved!</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for a year and find it to be very satisfactory and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the anti-hair loss properties as I could only stand to use this shampoo for a couple of months before my hair felt so gross, straw-like, and rough that I gave up on it. I was using this in combination with the organic argan oil conditioner also by Pura d&#x27;or. I have very fine, usually quite soft, hair. After a couple of months my hair was nearly unrecognizable as my own.</li>
    <li> Shampoo so good I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore!  Not sure that it has regrown my hair or anything, but it defintely seems to help make my hair appear less thin.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 5 months. I can see less hair dropped on the floor when I clean the house.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a slowing of hair loss yet, but I&#x27;m going through a shedding phase.  It does add body and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look and feel great!</li>
    <li> Alright, so I&#x27;ve used this product (PuraD&#x27;Or shampoo) for about 7 months so far, and here&#x27;s my simple on concise take it on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Leaves my hair looking and feeling really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Completely guilt free use, due to the fantastic ingredients that marinate on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this has been a great addition to add to my shower regimen.</li>
    <li> I have read all positive comments and thought to give a try. I got my first bottle in Nov 14. Used regularly after using i realized my hair gets more hard , fizzy and no hair fall stop. Still i used this shampoo continuously i thought may be it will get better but nope. After using 1 and 1\2 bottle I quit. This does not suit my hair.really disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worked pretty well so far, but it&#x27;s too early to tell honestly. I like the fact that I can wash my hair knowing that there&#x27;s organic stuff going into it.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo!!! I use twice a day, and am happy with outcome.&lt;br /&gt;Fr. Jude, S.J.P.</li>
    <li> Used 2 day prime shipping and received it on the exact day they said it would arrive 2 days later. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since I have been using it. Already feel a difference in the volume and thickness of the hair improve. However, it may be much to early to see significant difference in hair growth however, I do notice less hair fall out in the shower. Overall very content with the product. I will do an update on the review at the 2 month mark which is when they say, we would see a difference. I don&#x27;t notice too much of smell when applying the shampoo. Only annoyance is when some of the shampoo slowly trickles down the side of the forehead into the eyes in any amount, it tends to burn and it is hard to prevent streams from forming unless you keep your head back when applying and rinsing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo for about two weeks and have gotten amazing results so far.  I am a 67 year old man whose hair is thinning on the top and what is left was recently starting to fall out like crazy.  I have tried other anti-hair loss shampoos only to be disappointed that they didn&#x27;t work for me.  But since I was getting desperate I decided to try one more after I visualized myself going completely bald on top and didn&#x27;t like what I was seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I started using Pura d&#x27;or my hair stopped falling out almost immediately.  Whew, what a tremendous relief that was for me!  I also noticed that each strand of my hair would feel squeaky clean and feel thicker with more volume right after I would rinse the Para d&#x27;or shampoo off in the shower.  After I blow dry my hair and work in a top name brand volumizing gel my hair now looks full and shiny rather than thin and limp as it did before I used Pura d&#x27;or.  Thank goodness for that and thank you Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> The best hair product that I have ever used, and I have used a lot. It&#x27;s good for you hair, has nice smell, and really helpful with solving the problem of hair lost. I recommend it to anyone has a hair lost problem. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Absolutely best hair oil and hair loss has reduced significantly</li>
    <li> This is actually my first time leaving a comment on a product but to my surprise, this product actually worked for me! I was losing hair like you wouldnt believe and I had no idea why. Showering, brushing my hair, straightening or curling it would always end with me standing in a pool of my hair on the floor. It was incredibly depressing but now I can easily say I dont worry about how hard I brush my hair or how fast I curl or straighten because I know my hair is stronger and healthier. I use the shampoo and conditioner together every single time I shower. No more drugstore products with all those terrible chemicals. If I dont leave the conditioner in long enough in the shower, my hair becomes a little harder to brush but I always always use a heat protectant oil which does a great job at softening before I brush. Good luck to all of you with the same issue I had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a loyal user of the blue line, but gave the gold line a try. So far highly impressed! A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way and I love the the ingredients and smell of this product. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing! It has helped me with my problem of hair falling out due to a bad side effects of medicine. It has been 8 months since I noticed the hair falling out. It took about 5 months to start noticing the changes.  My hair is healthier than ever before. I will never use another shampoo!</li>
    <li> Received this product today in a timely manner, right before my day started. Used it immediately and seem to already notice a nice shine and feel to my hair. I must admit it has a odd smell to it, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s natural. I look forward to updating my findings on this product but so far I am impressed and see myself as a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> may husband been using this shampoo more than month, it really amazing. we can see a difference it seems healthier and thicker. i plan to order again.</li>
    <li> love love love it. less hair lost</li>
    <li> I am using this product for more than three months and noticed that i am loosing few hairs. Will continue to use for best result. I recommend this product and you should try for at least six months.</li>
    <li> Its been about almost two months and the user hasn&#x27;t really seen a huge difference. Hair takes awhile to grow so I would guess you would get REAL results in 6 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tends to make the hair very oily and doesn&#x27;t really give your hair that &amp;#34;clean feel&amp;#34; nor does it smell THAT great. Though I understand this is an organic product so I can&#x27;t expect it to smell like some artificial flowers and gumdrops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty big and , using everyday I can see it lasting for almost  2 -3 months , so it is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The user can&#x27;t really say for sure how they feel about this product yet , but I thought I&#x27;d give a review on the 2 months process.</li>
    <li> Great product. Didn&#x27;t grow hair back but realized it stop further hair loss.</li>
    <li> Its not magical, I thought using it overtime will help and eventually I will stop loosing hair but it made my hair rough and eventually I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, soothing, I am hooked and just ordered the conditioner!</li>
    <li> It works as a great complement to other dht blockers and has slowed the thinning of my hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about 2 weeks.. I will let you know after 2 months!</li>
    <li> The difference is not noticeable at first, but a week in and you&#x27;ll see how the hair loss completely stops. My hair felt thicker and stronger after 7 days. It does dry up the hair quite a bit so use a light conditioner. Will continue to use!!</li>
    <li> There will be a final review after I&#x27;ve used this for a while. I have long hair that is thinning due to some health issues over the winter. The first time I used this shampoo a HUGE amount of hair was in the brush, and the second time I used it (three days later) almost as much came out. My hair was VERY knotted after using this shampoo and even with a lot of MorroccanOil conditioner I still couldn&#x27;t loosen the knots. Going to speak with my hairdresser and also mix it with some regular shampoo next time. If this keeps up, I won&#x27;t have any hair left!</li>
    <li> As much as I wanted this to work, it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. What was in the bottle felt and smelled like something diluted down. Worse still, I started feeling itchy afterwards because my hair became very dry. Sorry, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s placebo effect, but I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I already see results, an area in my head that used to be so thin is starting to fill up!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell or how it weighed my hair down. So, I did not stick with it long enough to know if it actually works.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning so I got this shampoo to see whether it would thicken my hair. I haven&#x27;t seen much result yet (I&#x27;m told it takes at least 90 days and it hasn&#x27;t been that long yet), but i found a delightful side effect that it cleanses my scalp really well. I had found that my oily scalp wouldn&#x27;t clean well with any shampoo other than Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo, but that shampoo contains some chemical that, according to the State of California, can cause cancer (some foaming agent in it, I read), but I was using it anyway because I hadn&#x27;t found any other shampoo that would cleanse my scalp as well. I&#x27;m glad I found this shampoo and plan to use it even if it doesn&#x27;t work to regrow my hair for its cleansing properties.</li>
    <li> Great quality! Very excited about this bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!! great for you hair, skin, and nails!!</li>
    <li> this is a great product im glad i chose because it was organic and all natural. i still wasnt one hundred percent sold until i used it. then i found out the stuff actually works and wasnt one of the slick products making money off of false promises i would defintely get this if i were you</li>
    <li> okay so my hair was really thick when i was younger and i completely took it for granted so in my struggle to find a hair care product that would actually help with hair loss and the overall restoration of my hair i tried all the tricks: foams, creams even a few home remedies and they all seemed like duds if any thing they caused more damage with the crazy chemicals any ways i heard about this product from a friend of mine and had my doubts about the ingredients until i did a little research and found out it was mostly herbal mixtures and the fact that it is sulfate free was a total win! all i can say is try it and you can see the difference it makes for yourself.</li>
    <li> So pleased with this shampoo! I have tried dozens of alternatives but only this one truly seems to being making any difference. Not only has it made a monumental effect on hindering my hair loss but also has a splendid aroma. On top of all of this it&#x27;s an organic product which is simply so wonderful knowing what youre putting on your body. Highly recommend this product to anyone considering! Great product simply incredible</li>
    <li> I started using this product from last one week and i can see the change. It&#x27;s a great product. One star less for the high price</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo. Use this and the blue label one in the past and can honestly say it works. Dont notice a ton of difference between the two though.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great!!! My hair was thinning and breaking off like crazy.. I was getting scared I was losing all my hair.  After finding this shampoo on Amazon, I ordered it.... I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and finally my hair has started to get thicker and I do not get handfuls of hair falling out during every shower! I will definitely order it again and again!!! I will also recommend everyone try it! This shampoo is the best. Now I need to try the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I usually read all ingredients before buying a product so the fault is totally with me.  That said, I feel the labeling is extremely deceptive. The fourth and fifth words are &amp;#34;PREMIUM ORGANIC.&amp;#34;  Then &amp;#34;100% Natural...&amp;#34; jumps out.  I stopped reading, unfortunately.  Now I&#x27;m reading &amp;#34;USDA Certified Biobased Ingredients 90%+&amp;#34; (wondering what the heck those are) and &amp;#34;No HARSH Chemicals.&amp;#34;  I have been shedding for several years and refuse to use drugs to try to stop it (I am female by the way). So when my son told me about this shampoo I jumped on it.  UNFORTUNATELY it contains Ketoconazole (now I know why the print on the bottle is so small).  This is a drug.  It has side affects.  So not only did I purchase a product I probably will not use, I paid way more than I have ever paid for any organic shampoo.  Being a woman, and losing hair, I was really hoping this might be my answer.  Also, note warning (small print of course): &amp;#34;IF IRRITATIONS OCCUR, STOP USE AND SEEK A DOCTOR&#x27;S OPINION.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am a young man who has been suffering from hair fall problem since the age of 22. I tried a lot of different shampoos; prescriptions from doctors, creams, pills, etc. No treatment was working for me. I was afraid that after a few days, I won’t have any hair in my head. Then, I found this wonderful product. Within just four months or so, I noticed a complete difference. It started to protect my hair fall at the beginning and after some days, I noticed that some new hair in my head. It is unbelievable, but it’s true. My head fills up with black hair and I felt so younger and refreshed! Thank you Pura d’or organic anti-hair loss shampoo!</li>
    <li> This product works well. I have noticed a positive difference since using it.</li>
    <li> This trash ! Made hair worse and pumps do not work. I have been trying to return this since 8/7/15 with no luck from their side. I&#x27;ve called &amp; got empty promises. All they do is say one thing and do not do it. DO NOT BUY ! Bad stuff and bad company. They do not honor their promise.</li>
    <li> So far is the best shampoo I ever tried. I will re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Great complement to the shampoo great for moisturizing and less hair loss.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Definitely works as advertised. Especially like the fact that it contains no harsh chemicals and is 100% natural.</li>
    <li> My mom started to worry about loss of hair at her 65, but no more:) Pura shampoo makes her hair much stronger and thicker she said. She takes supplements along with this shampoo, and those make her worry gone. I am so happy that I found Pura shampoo.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 2 months, the result is obviously positive. The effect of prevention is instant. Recommendation: if you really want to sustain the improvement , you&#x27;d better keep it constantly.</li>
    <li> Works great for men. Just wish the smell was a little nicer. Makes your hair feel more full...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both the blue and gold label Pura D&#x27;or products now, and they are so far the best products I&#x27;ve used for my hair.  I don&#x27;t have bald spots yet, but my hair is getting noticeably (feel and touch) thinner, so I&#x27;m trying to slow or reverse the process as well as I can.  The Pura D&#x27;or products leave my hair feel stronger and thicker, which is what I am looking for right now.  In fact, when I use this product I find my hair is so much healthier feeling that I have no need for conditioner.  I will continue to use this product going forward, though I wish the price was lower (hence the 4 stars).  Though for those with short hair, you only need one pump to fully lather your scalp.</li>
    <li> Product isn&#x27;t as good as I thought,dried my hair out real bad and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for use if you honestly care about your hair</li>
    <li> It is really difficult to say how helpful this product is given its prince. Hard to tell if this is as good as propecia I admit this is not a medicine it is a shampoo but some review and product information says that the result of this shampoo is very good. Those good results usually comes from propecia (for men)  according to my knowledge. in fact if the result this shampoo is very good then it can easily replace propecia but who am I to know, i need to spend more money and wait some more months maybe my hair will get as good as David Beckham or maybe Bruce Willis  . Although I should say once your hair started thinning and losing the best remedy is to get used to and  live with it.  no work around it you are still beautiful or handsome</li>
    <li> I have used for the first time and the result is awesome.I am again planning to purchase this shampoo.It stops my hair falling and it makes my hair smooth .I would like to recommend this shampoo to everyone as it really works.Previous I have used many brand but this is the first time i got result what i expected.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month and my hair does feel a little thicker. I think this is because it splits the ends and dries it out so much that it seems expanded. It takes a lot to make a lather and I have found myself buying every kind of hair mask to try to revive my very dry and unhealthy hair that this shampoo has caused. I think people will try anything to get their hair back, but this is not the answer.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a shampoo that has made my hair feel this dry, not even Prell. I would not take a free bottle if offered. I am thinking of adding some to my regular shampoo just in case it really does have some kind of advantage.</li>
    <li> After showering whenever I dried my hair I would see a lot of hair on my tail towel. After receiving this product a month ago the problem has stopped. I know feel more confident and happy.  The shampoo also smells great  and I&#x27;m definitely buying there product again.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo.  Doesn&#x27;t seem much different than the blue label, except for price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to decide to buy something on the higher price that you can&#x27;t at least touch, smell and feel.  I read all the reviews and took the chance.  At first I felt it left my hair a little rough feeling, but by the second and third time using I felt a difference.  My hair reduced in falling about 80-90% and got healthier looking and feeling the more I used it.  I even get mentioned often how my baby hairs are growing and hair looks great.  The smell is not either great or bad, it smells pleasant enough and doesn&#x27;t really stay with any smell once your done washing so I am great with it.  I used it with the blue conditioner.  Remember, this is organic and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that regular shampoos have that make the smell/aroma and silky (which I do miss)  but I wouldn&#x27;t change back.  If your hair is falling out, this shampoo drasitcly reduced the amount of hair falling out.</li>
    <li> several months ago ,I bought this product after reading the wave of positive reviews,I have been using since then ,and almost 1 bottle used, it is sad to say that it does&#x27;t work on me !I have a receding M-shaped hairline.I feel like my hairline receding faster after this product. Maybe it is just my mental illusion.Honestly,I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable improvement on by receding hairline problem.Wonder all those amazing good reviews,are they true???</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo for a month and it makes my hair very dry after use, I losing more hair than before. Not happy with this product.Sorry</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have issued other brands that cost more. Got the quality and price with this argan oil.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money as far as we can tell.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair.  This shampoo is amazing.  I have tried several others.  Adds volume and stability to my hair.</li>
    <li> This is as pure as it can get. Good price.  I was paying alot more from another seller for the same thing. I highly recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! I use a hair pomade everyday and this shampoo always removes and residue that you used to be left behind. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I love it.  I even got my husband to use it.  His hair has been thinning and now is looking much better.  My hair has become thicker and softer.  I have long curly hair.  I find I don&#x27;t loose as much on a daily basis.  I highly recommend this product.  I no longer need to use a conditioner, so that helps with the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male in my late 20&#x27;s, been dealing with male pattern baldness for about 7 years now and have been somewhat keeping it under control. Along with hairline recession and thinning in the back of my head, I&#x27;ve also had intense itching/dandruff especially in the areas of thinning. I use this product once a day for over a month and I must say that this has been the first shampoo to successfully stop the itch and dandruff, which alone is helping with slowing the effects of MPB. As far as my hair shedding in the shower goes, this product has definitely slowed it down a bit so far. Hasn&#x27;t stopped completely by any means, but I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to. No matter what I&#x27;ve tried over the years I have always had some (more than normal) shedding, as a reminder that mother nature is still winning. I also take saw palmetto extract, beta-sitosterol, and grape seed oil extract as DTH blockers to hopefully slow my hair-loss as well. I am will continue to use this product unless i see something better on the market that looks more promising.</li>
    <li> i have to use two pump and it is a little dry after use</li>
    <li> I live in Brazil, where you can&#x27;t get pure argan oil such as Pura d&#x27;or. This is the fourth bottle I buy. It works wonder on my skin. I add it to mine and my daughter&#x27;s hand lotion and also hair treatment product. I use it plain on my hands when I get an allergic reaction to soap and it heals better than any medicated cream or treatment. I am sold out on this product!</li>
    <li> Baldness is a problem that comes from my family heritage. My head was getting bald dramatically. This sudden hair loss increased the level of my anxiety and temper. I was frustrated and searching for a solution that could actually reduce my hair fall problem with immediate effect. My skin doctor suggested me to use Pura d&#x27;or premium anti-hair loss shampoo. I was not really sure whether it would work or not. Therefore, in a trial basis, I started applying Pura d&#x27;or premium anti-hair loss shampoo. Just after using it for a month, this magical ingredient enhanced my hair growth. It reduces my hair fall and gives my natural hair back within a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a month so far and I&#x27;m liking the way it makes your hair feel, clean and doesn&#x27;t seem to strip your hair of its natural oils. It also seems to add volume to your hair even after the first few initials uses. This shampoo also lathers up very well, which is surprising for any shampoo products which are all natural and paraben free. I&#x27;ve tried other all natural shampoos in the past and most of them wouldn&#x27;t lather up very well and you would have to use a lot more of the product to get a lather going (you only need about a pump and a half or two pumps with this). My head would feel dirty and itchy after a few hours with other &amp;#34;natural shampoo&#x27;s&amp;#34;. So if you&#x27;re looking for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of its natural oils then I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> it is an awesome product as described...on my first application and showed very promising result!&lt;br /&gt;shipped and delivered prompytly</li>
    <li> I like this product very much</li>
    <li> I see all these positive reviews and for some reason I got no help! I have been dealing with hair loss due to dry scalp and psoriasis and for some reason it seemed to be dryer and worse when I used it. I thought that I could finally find something to help with the embarrassment but it didnt..if you have a severe concern don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> 2 months usage and zero hair regrowth. im using this in addition to biotin and STILL NO RESULTS. wouldn&#x27;t recommend :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this amazing shampoo for two months now and there are no words of how happy I am. I absolutely think it works and pics don&#x27;t lie. Hair started growing everywhere. My hair feels fuller, healthier i can style it easier. My hairline was thinning, scalp thinning and this product turned it all around. Used stupid crapy shampoos so long freaken damaged my scalp to almost beyond repair. I&#x27;m not sure if it will work for everyone. Perhaps if your hair folecules are damaged so bad it won&#x27;t hep but doesn&#x27;t hurt to try. 35 bucks is a steal especially that I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for two months. Will order again in the next few week. Love it... Love it!!</li>
    <li> Just wow, this stuff is amazing. Hair is less frizzy because it&#x27;s not being chemically stripped and I now have volume as a norm!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about six months. The first bottle was given to me in a gift basket and I liked it so much I purchased it off of Amazon. It gives my hair incredible shine, and the smell is very strong and pleasant while washing. It works up a really good lather, contrary to what I thought before using it. I would recommend this shampoo. I haven&#x27;t noticed any regrowth of hair using this product but have less sensation and tingling in area&#x27;s that were thinning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks now and my hair is honestly feeling stronger,softer,and healthier. I would recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I had started to notice every time I took a shower or combed my hair it seems like half the hair on my head was falling out.  I became very concerned and decided to try Pura d&#x27;or: Premium Organic Argan oil shampoo and conditioner.  I have to say I am amazed.  Within a week I noticed less hair falling out and within two weeks it seem almost no hair was showing up in my drain or on my brush.  I highly recommend this shampoo, try it with the Pura d&#x27;or: Premium Organic Argan oil conditioner.  I have had amazing results and hopefully you will too.</li>
    <li> Good organic shampoo. Seems to do the trick.</li>

    <li> This is the best product for the hair&lt;br /&gt;simply it is excellent product for the hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months and it appears to have reduced my hair loss.  In addition, it leaves my hair softer and less frizzy than other shampoos.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it along with biotin for about 6 months and have slowly started to regrow my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a while now and I have noticed that the volume of my hair has steadily increased. Definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I honestly believe this product has effectively halted my hair loss. I had been noticing my hair was getting gradually thinner and my hair line was receding for the last couple of years, so decided I needed to do something about it. I will also say I increased my workout routine and started taking daily multi vitamins right around the same time I started using this shampoo, so it is possible these factors contributed to my results.</li>
    <li> Nice everyday shampoo at a reasonable price, and like everything I get shipped with Amazon prime very fast arrival time. It has a bit of an odd smell but it dosnt linger so no big deal, love that its all natural.</li>
    <li> I felt the shampoo was very soothing to the point of a healing sensation to my scalp and helped stop my loss of hair, made my damaged hair repaired.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo.  My hair is falling less and fill fuller.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband because his hair is starting to shed quite often. A few days after using this product he said his hair felt great and he felt 20 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I haven&#x27;t seen much hair around the house (hehe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product. I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s starting to lose hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 so I wouldn&#x27;t expect my hair to be thinning as fast as it is. But the fact is that its happening and I&#x27;m hoping I can possibly slow down/reverse this cycle. I&#x27;ve tried this product for a day and like the ingredients and scent so far. I&#x27;ll edit this review in the near future.</li>
    <li> after trying this product my hair loss became minimal and my thinning head of hair is starting to look alot fuller. I love D&#x27;ors products and their whole group from conditioner&#x27;s to shampoo&#x27;s are great.</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Really works well, and has one of the best ingredient profiles I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> GOT EM!!!! I dont really write negative reviews because I research why I buy first. THANK YOU AMAZON! but dam they got me !!  My hair is falling out left and right! Literally ! This has to be a scam. I know its verified purchases but I think they buy the product them selves and re sell it. That way they can put RAVING reviews and make it the most bought item in hair loss. I was looking for an anti-thinning shampoo and I bought this product. I was not loosing hair. My hair did see an improvement before it started falling out. By the end of the bottle I was loosing some hair but I thought maybe it was part of the renewal process. WHAT A DUMMY! I bought a second bottle and oh man. F U !!!!!! YOU GOT ME! but I WANT WAR!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY POINT IS DONT BUY! there are THOUSAND OF ALTERNATIVES IF NOT MY MILLIONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAN SOMEONE HELP ME GO IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAN SOMEONE HELP ME GO IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAN SOMEONE HELP ME GO IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe its just me. But ILL LIVE just throwing my 2 cents in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You guys have a blessed day !</li>
    <li> It dries hair like no other shampoo, follows by dandruff and itchy scalp. In no way this shampoo is healthy for your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Really helps with the shedding. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I have had good results with this product and have also tried the Brown and Blue label which has had wonderful results. Good overall scalp health, increased volume, regrowth, and sheen. Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this shampoo for a week now so I can&#x27;t say anything about the hair loss prevention aspect. However, this shampoo has won me over in terms of smell and feel. My hair feels healthier already and I have not been using conditioner. It also makes my hair feel very clean and doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfumed smell as some shampoos tend to have.  I&#x27;ve seen a few complaints about not lathering but I found with shampoos of this type that the first wash does not lather well, but the second does. You can also use a small drop of a regular commercial brand shampoo to wash it first, then quickly rinse and wash with Pura d&#x27;or leaving it on for 2 minutes plus (5 minutes is optimum from what I&#x27;ve read for the ketoconazole to work). Plus, I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos with this ingredient and the bottles are much smaller for the same price or more. I&#x27;ll try to update the review as more time is logged with it.</li>
    <li> While everyone&#x27;s result may vary from product to product, I found the pura d&#x27;or shampoo to be a premium choice for hair care.  I was previously using John Master&#x27;s products which were much more expensive and had a significantly lower lifespan when it comes to daily use.  Comparing this to those products, I found the pura d&#x27;or shampoo to have a more noticeable effect and be much more cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Cost effective (Long usage lifespan)&lt;br /&gt; - Noticeably thicker hair&lt;br /&gt; - Noticeably cleaner scalp (Dandruff went away)&lt;br /&gt; - Ingredients seem to be more organic than most shampoos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Honestly, none come to mind</li>
    <li> Beware!! Bought this on the weight of the reviews. After third use my hair left in my brush was alarming. I had little hair loss, but thought this shampoo would be good for my hair. Absolutely not. It scared me to see how much hair I started to lose. I will be returning for a refund!</li>
    <li> I used it 3 times so far and after each use I can see the amount of hair loss coming down. If the trend continues I will have my thick hair back. I recommended my entire family to use it as well.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Would be great if the hair regrows, but I will settle for less falling out!</li>
    <li> Great clean fresh minty scent - cleans hair well and does not leave residual  build-up as many others do. Have not used enough to tell if good for saving hair. I am not losing hair but have a receding hair line from when i did lose hair due to low iron.</li>
    <li> I heard about this shampoo from my friend who claimed it changed her life and I decided to try it on my own. At first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t make any difference to my thinning hair but it actually helped me. My hair went from getting worse to becoming thicker. I would definitely recommend this product if you have thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I finally found a shampoo that does what it clams.  I have used so many types of shampoo&#x27;s either store stocked or pricey top notch ordered and I can actually say I&#x27;m sticking with this one.  Pura d&#x27;or had me nervous, but now after have using it for not even a month yet, what a difference I&#x27;ve seen.  My fallen hair does not even cover the bottom of my shower drainer, yay, a very good sign.</li>
    <li> Great product--noticed a difference right away. Preferred product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to help my hair grow out after chemotherapy. I love it. My hair is coming in with some thin spots. But this shampoo is giving it a fullness that I can only hope will continue.I cannot tell if  my hair would be different without this product. But I feel that with all the natural and organic ingredients, I am giving my hair the best possible shot at growing back healthy and strong. I appreciate also that it is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Purchased the shampoo and Argan Oil Hair Conditioner and after a few weeks my hair felt limp and dry.</li>
    <li> I usually shy away from products promising miraculous results.  I can truly say that this product REALLY works.  Before using this product, I was losing about 20 hairs every time I combed my hair.  My father had thinning hair and I took the warning seriously.  Now I typically have from 0 to about 6 hairs come out and I have only used the product for about 6 uses.  I noticed remarkable improvement with the FIRST use. Coupled with the conditioner,  it REALLY DOES work.</li>
    <li> This product broke my scalp out. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for 5 weeks now and it is a truly high quality, great product. I&#x27;m not convinced it has stopped all shedding, but it has certainly slowed it, and I&#x27;m looking forward to the 3 month mark for full efficacy. The shampoo smells fantastic. It is definitely a bit drying, but after conditioning, it leaves the hair feeling clean and full. I&#x27;m sticking on it for the long term to see the full results...</li>
    <li> i so so wish i can see the difference but 3 months and 5 bottles later hair looks the same.... will keep using it for few more months and then have to give up...too expensive</li>
    <li> wow this stuff has really worked for me A+</li>
    <li> Great product. Can visibly see a difference. In two months my barber and I saw a difference. Truly worth the money. in my humble opinion</li>
    <li> This a great product.  My hair felt thicker and fuller after the first few uses.  Plus it has a nice smell.  In my opinion, this a great alternative to rubbing my head with foam and chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for 4 days now so I don&#x27;t know if I LOVE it yet, but it really seems to add volume.  Time will tell if it helps the shedding and actually promotes new growth.  Upon first use I thought the smell was kind of strange.  But now that I am getting used to it, I kind of like it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a perfume smell, but an organic smell.  It lathers up nice and I like that it is safe for color treated hair.  Hopefully after a month of using it I will be able to say I LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> OK, so here&#x27;s the story.. I&#x27;ve been on a hair regaining journey and this has been part of my regimen, in conjunction with emu oil.. I also use the argan oil with a bamboo hairnpomade clay, works wonders, both all natural.. I also found that this makes your skin glow exactly the same as Vaselines cocoa butter, yet argain oil is much healthier...</li>
    <li> Used it today and left it on for 5min. while gently massaging it in, after I got out of the shower and ran the fan on my hair to dry it, I instantly noticed volume and shine! My hair was thinning from usage of H&amp;S shampoo&#x27;s for my dandruff problem, this shampoo also helps my dandruff problem, noticed my scalp was moist and clean and smelling good too! I can&#x27;t just tell you the difference in writing, just buy it already, you will thank yourself and your hair later!</li>
    <li> this shampoo helper my hair look fool and tick and i love organic is the best shampoo i ever use</li>
    <li> I thought it was a little drying but my son loves it. It has seemed to stop his thinning.</li>
    <li> Yes, it really does work! I was a bit skeptical at first, but did some internet research and decided to give the natural hair regrowth method a chance before resorting to potentially harmful chemicals. It’s only been about 11 weeks, and not only has the hair loss abated, I have plenty of new growth in the typically barren areas and the individual strands appear thicker to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this rate, I’m expecting complete hair restoration by Halloween. I already look 10 years younger, and started out only shampooing every other day as was my practice when shedding was rampant. Nothing improves your appearance like a full head of healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Puma d’ or!</li>
    <li> I am usually suspicious of extremely well reviewed items..I tend to think they either bribe their customers with free products or have their own employees review it or something. But since I was desperate to minimize my post-natal hair loss, I gave in and bought this shampoo. I had managed to have a nice, healthy head of hair all throughout pregnancy, but about 3-4 months later, BYE BYE! I wasn&#x27;t just losing my hair, I felt like I was MOLTING.  Anyway, I started using this shampoo along with some Biotin (Natures Bounty brand sold via Amazon) and after about a month of use, the hair loss diminished tremendously. I can also already see some small baby hairs making an attempt at growing back...I plan to continue using these two items in conjunction and posting another review later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** 12/2/15&lt;br /&gt;It has now been 9 montys since I startes using the shampoo and im still very happy with the results. The hair loss I have is minimal, but has increased recently. However, I believe it has to do with diet changes. I am very impressed by how long this shampoo has lasted. Yes,its expensive, but I have been using it every other day since March 2015 (two pumps) and I still have some left...my guess is I&#x27;ll run out in about a month. So I think $35 isnt bad for a shampoo that lasts almost a year.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t experiencing hair loss but I wanted to try a premium organic shampoo and the difference between this your typical store bought shampoo is night and day. I&#x27;ve used it daily  for going on 3 weeks and I can feel the difference in my hair. I&#x27;m a guy with extremely thick hair curly that can be really unruly. Typically shampoo only makes this worse, like a steel wooled sheep but this shampoo has increased the curls and made it a lot less unruly. I will say however I may not be experiencing hair loss that this shampoo has made my hair feel and look a lot healthier. Ill definitely be purchasing again once my current supply runs out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo (both gold and blue labels) for several months now. In my opinion it is a great shampoo in the sense that my (oily) hair feels clean and fresh all day -- something that does not happen with other shampoos in the same price range. Having said that, I really can&#x27;t state it helps prevent hair loss. After all, who knows whether I would have lost more hair than I have if I were not using it? Hard to say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is great as a shampoo though, I will keep on using it and give it the benefit of the doubt. Worse case scenario it is just a great shampoo; best case it helps with the hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing: do follow the instructions and leave the shampoo on for 2 minutes -- it does make a difference!</li>
    <li> I felt my hair looked more volume and thicker than in the past but i had some acne on my head and my hair dry out. So i had to use argan oil after i wash my hair</li>
    <li> very good.&lt;br /&gt;my hair is not oily as much as  before.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for about 4 months.my hair loss pattern slow down.&lt;br /&gt;I can see new little hair .&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see better results after 6 months</li>
    <li> Wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> Really too early to tell if positive results.  I like the smell.  Nioxin was producing better results than this product as I now see more hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just trying to be honest for y&#x27;all-- this one may work but it may take a few months for effectiveness. But when you use it, you will have hair shedding in the first 1-2 months. Now, i am having this issue. I understand that almost every anti-hair loss product will have such a issue.  And, this one also dries your hair, very very dry! If you use it, I suggest you use some moist conditioners too.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for 1 month, and nothing significant happens so far. I will give it another 2 months!</li>
    <li> This very expensive shampoo proved to be no better than drugstore brands.  Will not re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 2 months now and have definitely seen an improvement in my hairs thithickness. When I washed my hair before using this shampoo I&#x27;d loose so many hairs. After using this wonderful product only 1 week I only loose about 5 hairs while washing. Huge improvement!  I&#x27;d recommend this product to my friends for sure. Try it and it will be the last shampoo you buy.</li>
    <li> It has helped my hair from falling out. I have tried other products and this one is the only one that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> There is really nothing WRONG with this shampoo as far as cleansing the hair and scalp.  I have seborrheic dermatitis which causes flaking or builup on my scalp and terrible itching.  I think maybe some of the buid lup has slowed down down some, but the itching is still really a problem in the areas where I have the most flaking and build up of scales on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2.5 months and I have not seen any noticeable improvements in the thickness of my hair or hair regrowth.  In fact, I have observed more hair follicles in the tub using this product.  I can&#x27;t say that the product is increasing the rate at which I&#x27;m losing my hair, since I do spend more time working the product into my scalp and such, hoping for better absorption.  It could be that action that is increasing number of hair follicles I see in the tub.  In any case, I don&#x27;t see this product working for me.  My hair is receding and thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- smells good if you like the smell of rosemary,etc.&lt;br /&gt;- does lather well compared to other similar types of shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- expensive&lt;br /&gt;- didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and their conditioner for a little over 4 months now in the hopes of having less hair fall and stronger set of hair. The first 3-4 weeks I used it, I saw some improvements in volumes, not specifically in less hair fall though. After my first month, I experienced more and more hair fall. I thought this is one of those shampoo and products that makes it worse first and then improves as time goes by. However, this wasn&#x27;t the case. My hair is so thin and flat now. I have a bunch of hair loss on daily basis that it clogs the drain of my shower, worse than when I started using this shampoo. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I paid so much for this shampoo and it just didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> Purchased six months ago on the advise of a few users. Really impressed with the product and how it washses down to the root.  If you have short hair, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to leave in your scalp for at least a few minutes before thorough rinsing in order to get the maximum benefit.  No harsh chemicals, no side effects, just make sure to not get into the eyes if they are sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product so i am not sure about any hair regrowth but i like the scent and it leaves my hair feeling very nice and soft. Hopefully it will stary helping in the future with regrowth!</li>
    <li> Great product. Had the start of a receding hairline but after 3 months it looks much fuller</li>
    <li> I had dandruff problems using the regular blue label product. The added ketoconazole in the newer revisions of this gold label seems to be helping in that regard. Not sure if I&#x27;m seeing any changes to hair loss yet but hope is worth a few dollars.</li>
    <li> I too was skeptical of this product but after using this product for a full six months, my hair is more fuller and no hair loss. Even after having a haircut it grows back really good.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical on this product but I decided to try it anyway. I could not be happier. The shampoo has made my hair feel fuller and thicker as well as silky. I did not think that it was going to do what it says but it sure did! I would recommend this to people who have the problem of thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I have become a recent fan of any hair product with Argan oil in it, and this shampoo did not disappoint. I&#x27;ve had issues with thinning hair and a friend of mine suggested this line of hair care products to me. I use Pura d&#x27;or daily, and my hair is definitely showing improvement. The DHT blocker scared me a bit at first, but I haven&#x27;t seen any negative results. So, I&#x27;ll definitely continue using this shampoo as long as I can find it in stock.</li>
    <li> Hate to tell you guys that this does not encourage hair growth. If anything it does just the opposite, especially if you don&#x27;t use conditioner you hair will continue to fill up your brush with the precious hair you were expecting to add to.Save your money and go to a professional hair growth professional</li>
    <li> I bought this Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo for my father as a little gift for his birthday only to be completely surprised at how well it worked. His thinning hair became very thick overtime and he also noticed that he was no longer losing his hair. This thing did a amazing job and I’d literally recommended it for anyone who’s having issues with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, I have very thin hair and I have been looking for the right product that does what it says and I found of it. I have found it here for a very good price. I love it, it makes my hair shiny and silky soft. I have curly and frizzy hair, it relaxes the curl and frizzy, so it manageable. It gave my hair tons of body and the thinning spots in my hair are less noticeable</li>
    <li> It is so effective on my hair. There is no doubt it is a great product. But I am confused with one thing, where is the  production date and shelf life?</li>
    <li> Do not work waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought several hair products, and this is my favorite. Is short of time to fully judge the product as I have used it for 1 month, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I drop less hair with each wash. I&#x27;m using the product every day right now, but I think it&#x27;s safe to say this shampoo is very beneficial</li>
    <li> I used it occationally, and didin&#x27;t find out if it is helpful for preveting loss of my hair</li>
    <li> I preface my comments with the fact that I used this shampoo along with another pill based product that is suppose to help hair growth and a conditioner. I am a 30 year old man with a receding hairline. I am also thinning at the apex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again since I used other products I can&#x27;t say this alone will help, but in 2 weeks this shampoo appeared to help the hair I had grow(at the apex and overall), but it is does not stop or impede the balding process at the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have just started losing hair at the apex, you might try this shampoo along with some other products and it may slow down the balding at the apex.</li>
    <li> Horrible I took this product to regrow my hair and all it did was made me shed 10x more...</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I ever used</li>
    <li> great product. Will leave video review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tyniKrNDwm4&amp;lc&#x3D;z12pxvsqwqvic1jrw04cc13aztumyfrjyos0k</li>
    <li> I have to say I was quite skeptical at first. I used this shampoo a few times already and not only does my scalp feel softer but so does my hair. It has also helped alleviate some of the dryness,itchiness and redness I tend to experience due to psoriasis flare ups on my scalp. It&#x27;s quite early to see at the moment whether this will also help with regrowth of hair however, at the present time, it has definitely demonstrated its ability to improve scalp and hair condition effectively. I&#x27;ve seen so many positive reviews for this shampoo and I&#x27;m glad I went out on a limb to test it myself. I have great expectations for continued use of this shampoo. Will post an update in 3 months.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo! Hair feels much healthier and thick after using for about 4 months.Definitely a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement. Been using it for 7 months.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I&#x27;m a 66 year old female whose hair has been thinning since her thirties.  Not anymore!  When I showed my hairdresser my new bangs the other day he said you are sprouting hairs all over your head.  I also use the laser comb but have been for years.  Maybe it&#x27;s the perfect storm.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this shampoo for a short time so I&#x27;ve yet to see any results, but the fragrance reminds me of something I could eat. It almost has a natural salty smell to it. It only takes just a little to get up a good lather - JUST A LITTLE DAB WILL DO YA. I get a little impatient having to wait the two minutes with the lather on my head, but I am pleased thus far and looking forward to the claims of new hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have been miserable because of my receding hair line and after using Pura d&#x27;or for a little over six weeks, my hair looks and feels less thin. It has stopped falling out when I wash it and shedding like crazy when I brushed it. I think I have even noticed a little bit of new baby hair. I will keep on using it. I feel like that could be the remedy to my misery!</li>
    <li> Good product really works. The only thing I wonder is the expiration date. I can&#x27;t find it on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this golden label shampoo on Nov 7 2014.I took some medicine one month cost me lost lots hair almost bold..The products is amazing! I tried the blue bottle but too dry for my scalp, but the first time I use the gold label ,feel unbelievable!! Before this,I lost  hair everyday about 50-100, some time even more, my house everywhere were my hair, I always worried I will get bold soon..after I use this products four month, my hair look much fuller, my 8yrs together boyfriend cant belive in such short time I had such huge change for my hair...he said he  never see me have so much fuller hair, feels like even air cant get in,,I am so happy , no words could describe, hope I could found this sooner ,now I dream about at the end of year all the short new hair grow longer , I will have my dream style soon...I will always order this again and again..Thank you so much , Pura dor Gold</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t continue using this shampoo. It dried out my hair so badly, it was breaking more and made my scalp so dry and itchy</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband in one week I noticed his hair was full and thick shiny..... He doesn&#x27;t even need hair gel or paste . It looks that good. Excellent product and it&#x27;s organic ! Even better. This is now being used for by all of us in our family  . A staple in our household. Thank you for a great product. Happy customer....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice and gentle shampoo, much better than the clinical or commercial brands in the market. I have 3 weeks using it and I feel very good, waiting for my hair to get thicker and new hair grow.</li>
    <li> About a month later and I feel conned. It is good stuff if you want a basic natural shampoo but I seriously doubt it will suddenly in two more months begin to help my scalp. I will NOT buy it again soon unless my sister wants more - she likes the plant fragrance but agrees it seems an overpriced shampoo with big hype. Internet reviews seem pretty dissatisfied as well....I regret not doing more research before I spent this much money. Be wary of planted reviews!</li>
    <li> It seems to be working for my hair loss. I am very happy with the results thus far after 2 months.</li>
    <li> This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve used in years that actually works for me. I have fine, thin, straight hair and this actually makes it grow faster and thicker, and leaves my hair nice and shiny. Love the ingredients, too.</li>
    <li> I used it for about a month (only use this to wash my hair), and I still lost a lot of hair each time I wash my hair. Not worth the price. I didn&#x27;t expect not to lost any, but 2-30 is quite a lot.</li>
    <li> The shampoo helped my to stop the hair loss after 2 weeks. I use it with every morning before I go to work and it helps my hair to stay clean and also I can tell it works because my hair is filling in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I feel better now about my hair loss after I use Pura 5 times. It won&#x27;t be such efficient right away I think. Let&#x27;s see what is going on with my hair loss problem with Pura Shampoo...</li>
    <li> I have been using my first bottle of Pura d&#x27;Or for about a month now, and while I can&#x27;t say I see new hair growth where my hair is thinning, I understand that it can take up to 5 or 6 months for meaningful regrowth to appear. Saw palmetto is the primary anti-DHT ingredient in this shampoo, and it has demonstrated good, if not perfect, results with hair regrowth and DHT removal. (If it were perfect, it would be a cure for pattern baldness.) I appreciate that Pura d&#x27;Or has more saw palmetto than any other anti-DHT shampoo -- makes sense, right? The more saw palmetto, the better it is at washing away DHT.&lt;br /&gt;I used Nioxin for a while, and noticed visible results with that shampoo, and it had far less saw palmetto in it than Pura d&#x27;Or. So I am anticipating good results. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars is because argan oil shampoos (another hair-healthy ingredient in this shampoo) make my hair feel oilier and need washing more often. Not a fan of that stuff. Otherwise, thi... Read more</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair a young age due to body stress from drastic weight loss (went down from 300lbs) and a nerve disease that I recovered from soundly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a tough road being in my early 20s with the hairline of a gentleman in their later 40s. I was pretty self conscious of my waning hair line and wore a hat day in and out. I tried Nioxin, and that didn&#x27;t really seem to have much of an affect. I really did not want to try Rogaine as I had heard negative things about the treatment system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Pura d&#x27;Or? Well, lets just say, I no longer wear a hat! It really only took me about 3 to 4 weeks for me to notice my hair feeling a bit fuller and my hair line staying consistent. I&#x27;d rate it five out of five! Great smell! Great feel afterwards, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to be Patrick Stewart-level bald tomorrow morning :)</li>
    <li> First off, the smell is great! After shampooing my hair the first couple times, I started to notice my hair looking a lot fuller! Argan oil, a major ingredient in Pura d&#x27;or, has always made my hair so soft and sleek. I love the feeling of my hair after using this shampoo, and with absolutely no build up, easily rinsed, a nice healthy scalp and a fuller head of hair, I will probably never change shampoos again! I recomend this shampoo to everyone!</li>
    <li> I sent this back as I have other issues making hair thin.</li>
    <li> I have used the regular version of this product for over a year and liked it and wanted to see the newer one.  Although its a little pricier, the ingredients are top notch and it does leave your hair looking thicker and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the product and will continue to use both versions.  I just would like for them to reduce the price on the gold version a bit.</li>
    <li> It took about 3 months to notice a difference but I definately have thicker hair where I was starting to thin on the back/top of my head.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever used</li>
    <li> Have only used Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo for the past month.&lt;br /&gt;I feel this is a very good product that appears to have in a short time-frame helped to improve my scalp, leaving my thin medium length-colored hair looking fuller with more volume and body.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other promising products over the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve poured lots of dollars down the drain with out seeing, feeling positive results.&lt;br /&gt;I kept looking for an organic anti-hair loss product that was color safe. And of course, I wanted to see immediate results that would actually help with the appearance of thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m HAPPY to say, ~~ I&#x27;ve found Pura!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve find it easy to use - one full pump is enough to cover my medium length hair.  Worth the price for the quick results!&lt;br /&gt;Several of my friends have commented and gave me compliments about the changes they saw in the body and the appearance of thicker more volume in my hair.  (Good to have positive feedback so quickly!)&lt;br /&gt;BEST by FAR ~ my hairdresser without knowing about my new shampoo ~ commented that she can see tiny &#x27;new&#x27; hairs on the top of my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use this good for me / my hair product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say Pura d&#x27;or Premium ~ Improves a healthy scalp, as I do have hair re-growth in a short time with more body and volume.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd review of Pura D&#x27;or Premium (Gold Label) Shampoo.  My first review was posted after two months of use, and at that time I was already experiencing positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was losing hair rapidly in the year leading up to purchasing this product, and it seemed to be accelerating.  My hair was feeling limp, and sometimes crunchy.  I took a picture of the top of my head one day, and was shocked to see almost a full 3-4&amp;#34; circle of scalp exposed on the top of my head.  Obviously, I started looking for solutions, and found this.  I&#x27;d say my hair loss dropped off substantially within months of use.  People may try to attribute this to natural shed cycles, but now with over a year of use (and just finishing my 2nd bottle!) I can say that I&#x27;ve never seen any shedding return.  I&#x27;m no longer seeing dozens of hairs on my hands while shampooing or on my pillow, just a few here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp isn&#x27;t as itchy and has no build up.  The hair itself feels healthier and somewhat thicker (I have fine hair to begin with).  I believe this product halted my hair loss, which was perhaps the most dramatic effect, and has had a minor effect in returning some coverage on top.  There is much less scalp showing, but you can still tell that it&#x27;s thin up there.  I&#x27;m good with it tho. I really believe had I started earlier with this, that I&#x27;d still have almost full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bottle really last forever too.  As stated above, I&#x27;m finishing my 2nd bottle now.  I&#x27;d say I use it 5-6 times a week, and make sure to leave on for about 5 mins while showering, making it more convenient that other hair loss products, with no side effects, and a low cost (&amp;#60;$80 for the year, and my normal Aveda shampoo was just as expensive anyways).</li>
    <li> I used one full bottle of Pura D&#x27;or gold shampoo and it did not lessen hair fallout or bring about hair regrowth. Instructions say to use it daily and leave on at least three minutes. I used it every other day and left it on for three minutes. Some users report only needing 1 pump&#x27;s worth to cover scalp area; I usually needed 2-3 unless I pre-washed with another shampoo (I am a woman with shoulder length hair).  Still, the bottle lasted a long time (I would guess with daily use of 1-2 pumps quantity that it would last 30 days at least). The shampoo has a very odd smell that I did not find pleasant but that does not linger after use. It did clean my scalp/hair satisfactorily. This product may work if you use it every day, but since it is only on your scalp briefly, I don&#x27;t see how it can. I&#x27;d like to see more information from the company about this (and maybe they should consider creating a leave-on serum?)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it really helps with the loss of hair. Cannot say enough about this product. I have been using it for at least six months</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product (almost 6 months ago), I noticed the difference in my hair thickness, quality and hair loss rate.</li>
    <li> Really worked for me. 4 month later I found a lot of new hair.</li>
    <li> feel like the product is working will continue to use and buy</li>
    <li> Leave hair feeling very clean, the conditioner leaves my hair the softest of any conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used !!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t foam as much as other ones, but definitely seems to be helping with the hair loss.  Hair still came out my first shampoo, but by the second one, none occurred.  Pleased I tried it, although not cheap.</li>
    <li> Quality organic product that makes your hair feel amazing!!! So glad I discovered it!</li>
    <li> The best organic shampoo in the market. After a month of using I have noticed my thinning areas on the scalp of my hair are filling in. I can&#x27;t wait to see results in few months. I have tried other hair loss/thin products and this one proves more improvement of my problem areas and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> could not see the results as it dried my hair a lot</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this shampoo to anyone who struggles with hair loss. I am 42 years of age and I am starting to notice that my hair is falling out, it started around a 6 months ago and have also tried several products with no success and continued hair loss. I rated this product 5 star as it does exactly what it says on the bottle. After using this shampoo every other day for 2 weeks I am seeing great results and would urge you to try it.</li>
    <li> I was using another Pure d&#x27;or product for quite some time and was really please with the results. My work is really stressfull and with the years I started losing my hair. It was a slow process, but I could feel. I was terrified, the idea of losing my precious hair was chasing me every day, every night. In the end, I decided to try a brand that I knew really well, a brand that I was happy with. Pura d&#x27;&#x27;or anti-hair loss shampoo works great in combination with the anti-dandruff shampoo. I just use any of the products every other day. 5 Stars and if you plan to miss out on this product you are doing a mistake.</li>
    <li> Bought this product last week as my friend recommended it to me and after testing it here is my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having an itchy scalp, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and the itchy scalp is much better. Also I noticed that my hair is feeling thicker too. It feels and smells good during the washing and results are quite impressive. Totally satisfied. I will definitely order more from this company..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot !</li>
    <li> Gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loves it. Not greasy, no conditioner needed. He has very fine and soft hair and this provides enough body and looks clean for days. Good product. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and can really feel a difference in the way my hair behaves.  It isn&#x27;t frizzy, fly-away or dull.  It  feels like hair, sounds silly I know, but when you have thin fine hair to say your hair feels like hair is great.  I wash my hair every day and use just a small amount of shampoo, it goes a long way.  Would I recommend this product - yes, will I buy it again - definitely yes.</li>
    <li> this is my third bottle I  bought for my son from amazon.my son tried many product to prevent hair loss,but nothing take effective.only after use this one his hair stop to loss(before find many hair in shower ) and after couple weeks,we found new hair in bald area.so we decide to pick this one as my son&#x27;s shampoo and recommend to my friend.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific shampoo with natural ingredients. Prior to my using this shampoo I would notice hair in the shower, after using this shampoo steadily I no longer have this issue. My hair is healthy.</li>
    <li> Really wanted this product to work, but sadly, it doesn&#x27;t. Complete waste of money, and I used it to the last drop. Maybe this will work work for someone who just want thicker hair, but it will not save already thinning hair. Too bad!</li>
    <li> Just arrived today and can&#x27;t wait for using it. The first sense is that it is not smell great, since this is natural, so, it will be fine. And I enjoy the process, because it is very smooth before I rinse it from my hair. And yet, The hair become dry thereafter. And I saw some review about it, I think it will be fine, one of the problem casing hair loss is oily hair. So, I will keep using it for several months, hope it will be helpful for me.</li>
    <li> I am using Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo for almost 6 months and ever since my hairs have gotten thicker and my hair loss has decreased.</li>
    <li> I love my hair very much. It is very shiny and silky. But, some days ago, I went to the India. I visited a desert and it was a different environment. After coming from there, I faced different types of problems. Hair fall was one of them. I felt very nervous because I love my hair. I went to my doctor and he suggested me to use Pura d&#x27;or premium organic anti-hair loss shampoo. He said that it is a very helpful product for hair fall. According his prescription, I started to use it and after some days, I got amazing results. I have got back my shiny and silky hair. It is definitely a wonderful product for hair fall solution.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it doesn&#x27;t what&#x27;s on the label, but better then most shampoos for sure!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if my hair has gotten fuller or stopped shedding, because there are stills shedding but not as much.</li>
    <li> I can &#x27;t  feel the difference in my hair..  Not worth what I paid for , it can buy the same product in retail for a lot less..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair and smelled like medicine</li>
    <li> the blue one worked well, then they switched the formula.  this one seems ok but its been a month and I don&#x27;t see improvements.&lt;br /&gt;it smells ok, but the pump on the bottle is completely useless.  I have had 3 blue bottles and 1 gold bottle and they were all broken when I opened the box.</li>
    <li> I have never suffered hair loss I have always had thick corse hair so when I started losing my hair after my second child  I made sure to take more vitamins but when i noticed that wasnt working I looked up in the internet top ten hair loss shampoos. I found this brand and decided to order it on amazon. After just ONEweek I noticed a difference. My hair stopped falling and began regaining its original thickness.  - Kimberly C.</li>
    <li> Hair feels so soft and clean. Like out of a salon.Hair falling out less. Will definitely purchase again. I like that it is all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Amaizing product that helped me a lot! I was driving crazy with my hair loss, I tried everything I could, I thought I had something wrong and when to all a the doctors  could, I was waiting to spend a month with this to make a review and I already have a month and a half using it, it&#x27;s amazing how my hair loss have being stopped little by little, be patient and you will see the results</li>
    <li> Amazon Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;This product is simply amazing! I have just begun my journey in using naturally made products and this hair product is setting my standards high! I am pleasantly surprised that my hair can look so smooth and silky with all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I am 43 years old and the last couple of years have watched my hair getting thinner and thinner and could actually feel hair follicles coming out on my scalp.  Then I stumbled on this Pura d or hair loss prevention product on the internet and gave it a try.  I have used it for a couple of years and am now on my 3rd bottle.  It is a great enriching product with no harsh chemicals like the cheap store bought products I was using before.  It feels great on my scalp when I am using it.  The long and the short of it is that it does work.  I have definitely stop losing my hair, and the hair I have is now much healthier and seems fuller.  I highly recommend it to anyone and it is and will be my only shampoo going forward!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 6 weeks now and the improvement is amazing. Attached are the pics of before and after 5 weeks of usage.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, my hair loss is not genetic. The past few months have been very stressful because of school, work and family but I knew that I wasn&#x27;t going bald since it doesn&#x27;t run in my family. If it was I would need a lot more than a $30 shampoo from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love it.. I bought it like a year ago and when i came across it again, i had to get more.. it was that good. Its like vitamins and stuff, it makes my hair feel super soft and tuff. Gold Label Rules! And this isn&#x27;t a bad price.. Ive seen it go for double. So 5 Stars!! Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is really great! I had been using Nioxin for over 12 years until a friend suggested I try this. I do no think it grows hair out, but i think it keeps the hair you have healthy and creates healthy hair growing environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say try it and I am sure you will love it!</li>
    <li> This is a quality product. It has only been a week that I&#x27;ve been using it and my hair feels nice, easy to style and not freezy after shower. I am saving one star for a later review, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Love the product, smells great and leaves my hair fuller and soft.  Doesn&#x27;t lather well but that is not a game changer.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband due to a lot of hair loss in his older age, used it myself once and now I use it every wash as well!! I&#x27;m not loosing my hair, but have very baby fine hair and this really gives it body, unlike anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. I have fairly short hair and it does make it tangle right after washing. I take a big toothed comb in the shower with me and use it as I&#x27;m rinsing and it solves that problem. Long hair may be a bit tougher though. My husband loves it as well and says his short hair is much easier to manage. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Good Natural Shampoo for everyday use .</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo (Gold Label) for a couple of weeks now. So far I like everything about it. From the smell, very simple/natural/clean, to the pump (give the perfect amount for me). I was contemplating getting the conditioner as well but held of because with this shampoo, I don&#x27;t even need conditioner any more. Normally my hair would be huge and out of control with out a conditioner but with this, that does not seem to be the case. I would still like to try the conditioner eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using several of the essential oils in this product along with apple cider vinegar and made a leave-in rinse that I would use after a shower and it seemed to help and have even seen \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair appear. I am very hopefully, like everyone else who is looking at/ purchased this product, that along with the added ingredients which claim to block DHT, I will continue to see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I really like this shampoo. We will see in time if that turns to love :) I will update when/if it improves the density of my hair. If not I probably not be buying again, since it&#x27;s a little pricey. Hope this situation is one of those where \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update coming Soon :)</li>
    <li> All I can say is that it works, since I have started using I have noticed no new grey hairs.  Plus, the ingredients are pure, BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> been using for about 2 weeks now so difficult to say its efficacy, but does a good job cleaning hair.  will post updates in a few months.  four stars, because the scent is not the fruity or flowery scent one expects from shampoo--perhaps smells like neutrogena t-fal shampoos.  anyways, so far so good otherwise.</li>
    <li> PURA D’OR PREMIUM ORGANIC ANTI-HAIR LOSS SHAMPOO GOLD LABEL is the real deal. Noticed significant difference through increase in hair thickness and less fallout within the first two weeks of use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this shampoo for a month, but already see a difference in my hair. It seems healthier and thicker, as well as shiny. For an organic shampoo, it lathers well and smells nice. I plan to order again!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  I am about to order my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I brought this shampoo for my sister who was complaining of hair loss.  She began using it and her hair stylist noticed that her hair was softer and thicker.  So I brought some for myself and just began to use it, but am hoping for the same results. Thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> So good. Noticed a difference in the thickness of my hair in about a month. I have tried many thickening shampoos and they just didn&#x27;t work. This one def did wonders.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the shampoo for long, so it&#x27;s too soon to determine whether it will be effective.  All I can say at this early stage is that it&#x27;s not especially pleasant to use.  I find the smell unpleasant and it is incredibly drying to both scalp and hair.  I have to use A LOT of conditioner after shampooing and even then my hair feels like straw.  Then there&#x27;s the price -- $39 for a bottle of shampoo, no matter how good it claims to be, is quite expensive.  I&#x27;ll continue using it until it&#x27;s gone, but it&#x27;s highly unlikely that I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Feel confident in it&#x27;s ability to work. Have noticed less hair loss and am looking forward to see the progress over the next few months!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work/help. Product used to its entirety, approximately 5 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for close to a year (ordered 3 times, used once daily - 2 to 3 pumps per wash) and have seen no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow instructions and let sit for 2-3 minutes every wash and I can with absolute certainty that its not make a receding hairline thicker or fuller. The unfortunate side effect of this product is that the stupidly hopeful side of me will keep ordering it because I&#x27;d rather use this than something from Walgreens or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have my business, but you don&#x27;t have my seal of efficacy.</li>
    <li> Still hoping for the best. Directions say 3 months before seeing results. Only been 5 or 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I started use the pura d&#x27;or shampoo, and feel so good,  plus it seems that&#x27;s working&lt;br /&gt;On what&#x27;s said ANTI-HAIR LOOSS. I will continue use it, and I recommend it. ;)</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo.  My hair feels invigorated.  It feels thick and is growing very well.  I am glad I bought this and not another brand.  It is all all natural and works great for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo twice and already loving it. Although while washing it makes my hair super rough , but after it dries up, it looks shiny, thick and healthy. Also using their conditioner, very effective combination. Will wait to see long term results though. I particularly love its smell, it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a couple of days.  But it lathers in a thick and luxurious fashion, and it has a very nice scent.</li>
    <li> This may be a factor of the necessary ingredients, but the smell is pretty unpleasant and it does not lather well. I cannot comment on any of its health benefits, as I have not noticed any change in the texture or fullness of my hair.</li>
    <li> I experienced a little improvement, I am caucasian with very curly dry hair so maybe thats why. But its only been about one month.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo anyone will ever need to use. Its all natural ingredients ( Even Non GMO) and great results make it an absolute no brainer to buy. If you want quality, here it is!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really very good.My hair started falling and became very rough .I have tried too many things but i was not satisfied .Then online i found this shampoo i read a lot about this i decided to try .Now i am using it from last 3 weeks i can see big difference in my hair. its stop falling and becoming very healthy and shiny .What i really love about this shampoo is this is organic.</li>
    <li> Still having the same amount of hair loss with using this shampoo no improvement seen yet.</li>
    <li> This definitely is worth the money when it comes to organic products. It&#x27;s the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever been able to use at night and wake up without my hair being greasy. And you only need one pump really because if you use too much you&#x27;ll get really tangled. But i love it and I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it and buying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a little over a month and it seems to be working. I believe it might take a little longer to really notice the effects however my hair does seem to have more balance and i&#x27;ve noticed less hair on my hands while using this product. The price seems to be going up so i would grab this product and test it out yourself before it goes up even more. I use it twice a shower just a little bit at first to prime the scalp and then one full pump after and let it lather into my hair for 2 minutes as directed. The second wash really takes effect, I don&#x27;t even need conditioner after.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest shampoo I ever had. I kept losing hair these few years.&lt;br /&gt;I felt the differnce the first time I used it:)</li>
    <li> will be buying more when I run out - my usually fine limp hair is somehow no longer fine and limp.  seriously feels fuller too.  even a six month old perm seems to have bounced back.  as far as not losing any more hair - not sure - just started using product - however I am still very pleased this product does indeed seem to deliver something very beneficial. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a very nice botanical scent. I have been using this product for almost 2 months now and I have seen improvement with the the strength in my hair. There is less shedding and I have a healthy shine. It is a little more expensive than some other products on the market but it is worth the money for a pure organic shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really really love this shampoo. after the first wash my hair felt so good. I found that it lathers up just fine for me. My husband is using it to see if it will help with receding hairline, we&#x27;ll see! even if it doesn&#x27;t work on that I would still buy it because it is just a great hair product. Got my sisters hooked on it too</li>
    <li> This is a review after my first use on this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using Matrix Biolage Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner for the past 2 months, but found that it doesn&#x27;t give my hair any volume and also causing my hair falls off more. After reading other reviews, I decided to give this Pura d&#x27;or a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair and I used 2 small pumps, 1 small pump for the upper part of my head and 1 small pump for the bottom part of my head. The natural fragrance of this shampoo is amazing, you can actually smell the natural ingredients. Some reviews stated that you don&#x27;t need to use the conditioner, but my hair tangled up a little, so if your hair was chemically treated, I would recommended Conditioner and apply it to the ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping my finger crossed to see if it helps! Will post a follow-up review in 1-2 months.</li>
    <li> I have used some weeks. This is a wonderful shampoo. I was very skeptical at first. I&#x27;m glad I caved in and bought it. I had nothing left to lose (other than more hair!).It made my hair super clean feeling, bouncy and full of life and shine. I noticed less shedding after the first few uses. I have been using it for a week now and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now. I have seen a significant reduction in hair loss so far, particularly in the hairline area.</li>
    <li> I have noticed I loose less hair and new hair has been growing.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair and scalp feel clean ,and  I&#x27;ve noticed less hair fall !</li>
    <li> I notice that just in 6 weeks my hair has more volume and feels healthier. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 3 months.</li>
    <li> After few uses, I am pleasantly surprised about the outcome of this shampoo. Thought I am not yet a long term user, however, based on my initial assessment, I will definitely recommend to whoever that is trying to preserve what is left of hair.  After the wash, my hair feels soft and removed most of oily hair. Even on the similar type of shampoo for the same function, after each wash, it does not feel the same. I will provide another update in 30 days. As far as my initial feedback, this shampoo is a keeper and a buy!</li>
    <li> I personally used so many products searching for the right one for me. Out of curiosity, I purchased this product even though it was little bit pricy to give it a chance. I used this for about 2months and getting into third month now and I really really love this shampoo more than anything! I had an itchy and red scalp with some flakes and I&#x27;ve been loosing hair since 2years ago(I am 26). Right about 2weeks, my hair stop itching and I felt that calming sensation. Now I see a BIG CHANGE that my hair does not fall off like before. I will say I shed normally now which means this product helped a lot! I never write reviews when I purchase something, but this time i wanted to share my experience. Definitely I am purchasing this product again and I also recommend it to my friends with same problems. It is a worth money to give it a chance for your scalp and hair. My only suggestion is if they have a bigger bottle :)</li>
    <li> Its been sometime after using it but I believe my hair density has increased! I think its coming back and my good looks are coming back also :0 I love you</li>
    <li> From first glance you can tell that this Pura d&#x27;or shampoo is of the highest quality, really accomplishing what it says it will do and that is stop hair loss in it&#x27;s tracks. I especially enjoyed the large size of the bottle giving me time to really enjoy the soft smelling aroma, and silky smooth texture, attributing to the best possible hair condition. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a week now and notice a big change from the blue label hair loss shampoo they offer.  I had been using that one for several years and I have less hair loss now.  My hair has always been baby fine and thin, I am not exactly losing my hair, but I find most shampoos are too heavy and leave my hair flat and greasy.  This has changed with the Pura d&#x27;or products.  I have less hair in my brush and my hair doesn&#x27;t lay flat against my head anymore.  With baby fine and thin hair, you are never going to have the volume of thick hair, but at least my hair no longer looks as flat.  The price is more then you will pay for shampoo at a drugstore, but a bottle lasts me about a year since I only need one pump to wash my hair and that is with daily washing.  I use their conditioner about once a month since their shampoos condition so well.</li>
    <li> Out of all the hair products today, this one stands out. The aroma and ease of use makes this one of the best, for the price. It is worth trying!</li>
    <li> Great product smells good and keeps hair looming fresh everyday of the year. I used the blue one for a while but this one outshines</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I&#x27;m on my second bottle so I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 months. I started using this because I&#x27;ve always had so much hair fallout when brushing or washing my hair. Wasn&#x27;t a big deal really because I don&#x27;t have thin hair but I also don&#x27;t have very thick hair either so I decided to give this shampoo a try after reading about it online. I have definitely noticed A LOT less hair going down the drain than before. My hair is fuller and much healthier and I love that it isn&#x27;t made with any harsh ingredients. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair feeling very dry when washing it; needs a good conditioner with it, otherwise can&#x27;t run a comb through it.  Howver, when it&#x27;s blown dry, my hair does look shinier and have more volume. Just wish it would feel better while shampooing.</li>
    <li> I have only started using this product for a week. I like the smell and the clean feeling after each use. Also knowing that it is organic, definitely making me feel better for using it.  I cannot wait to start seeing the result!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is terrible.  Most of these reviews must be paid for.  This shampoo does a terrible job cleaning my hair, makes my hair incredibly greasy and brittle, and doesn&#x27;t even smell that nice.  It doesn&#x27;t lather well at all.  Do not buy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the pump is terrible.  I have longer hair and I have to press the pump at least 4-5 times to get an adequate amount of shampoo to come out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love in it after my first use. Nice shampoo for daily use.</li>
    <li> It has been a month since i used this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I felt nothing until second week. I lost my hair about 40-50 a day.&lt;br /&gt;However, i guess my scalp is getting used to this shampoo and healthier than before.&lt;br /&gt;Now i lost my hair about 20-30 a day.&lt;br /&gt;It is great. I hope nothing will be lost for future with this amazing shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;THanks</li>
    <li> My hair tends to get dry from all the hair dye but this product has helped with making my hair healthier. Consistent use of it helps majorly. It&#x27;s also not sticky which is nice.</li>
    <li> My hair is getting thinner and I&#x27;ve researched all of the ingredients in this shampoo and they are quite beneficial for the hair. I&#x27;m already noticing a difference in my hair and how much better it feels. I can&#x27;t wait to further test this product. This product is also 100% natural so it&#x27;s got my approval.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo (and the follow-up conditioner) that is cheap, has a nice amount that should last you for quite awhile, and smell nice. It also goes on the hair decently too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t anything more to say about it! If the ingredients are to be trusted and is inherently healthy for your scalp, this is a nice shampoo I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s well. Hair is thicker and stronger. Not the best smelling shampoo on the market.</li>
    <li> Have used for about 1 month and seems great so far. Not sure about hair regenerative properties as will obviously need much more time, but leaves hair feeling nice with fullness and well conditioned feel. If helps at all with hair loss, would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I give this product five stars because I washed my hair with it and felt it working right away.  I could feel the itchiness of new hair growth after just one use!! I also like that is doctor recommended, the ingredients are pure and it smells like really good herbs.  I imagine the royalty in Ancient Greece smelled this way as I like to describe earthy and elegant.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Pura d&#x27;or Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo.  I noticed a difference the very first time I used this shampoo,  so much LESS hair in the sink.  In between the first and second bottle I used another shampoo several times and once again there was too much hair in the sink for my liking.  My scalp and hair feels clean and I am really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> After four(4) months of using this, it never really worked as advertised. My hair fall got even worse using this shampoo, so I had to go back to alternately using Sunsilk Shampoo and NuGroe anti-hairfall shampoo that I bought in PI. I gently used a face towel when rinsing my hair after a shampoo to minimize cuts and pulls.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Today, July 10, I received an email from the store suggesting to return this item for a refund. Good thing about buying from AMAZON.</li>
    <li> My hair is noticeably thicker, fuller looking. I like the fresh smell of it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice and I already love the way it makes my hair look and feel. It gives it body, shine and smoothes my naturally wavey/ curly hair. I appreciate the natural and organic cleansing system..plus it smells great. I am hoping it will slow my hair loss from stress. Too early to tell, but I have faith! Will report back once bottle is finished...hope for 5 stars then.</li>
    <li> At the age of 19 I started thinning and I definitely can see small hairs growing in a small bald spot right in the middle front of my temple, but my hair is thinning mainly in my temple but when I use this followed up by there conditioner it really makes the hair on my temple look thicker. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doomed to keep losing hair til it&#x27;s all gone or if this shampoo and conditioner will help me along with nature&#x27;s plus ultra hair plus tablets. Though this shampoo says it&#x27;ll help stop hair loss but I still see hairs in my hands in the shower and when I comb my hair but everyone loses hairs everyday so I hope this stuff will keep my hair thick which I&#x27;m really impressed about.I do see small hairs starting to grow where it&#x27;s thin in front so I&#x27;d give this stuff a try! But also try the conditioner, I&#x27;m supposed that also helps it look thicker as well!</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with this product. It lathers well and has a pleasant smell. My scalp also feels cleaner and healthier. It will take some time for me to see the results of increased hair density so in the meantime, I will continue to use this product. I&#x27;ve tried many hair loss products out there and this one seems to be about the best so far.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair beautiful and shiny</li>
    <li> I see some improvement on my hair after 3 weeks of using the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am Chinese and I don&#x27;t speak perfect English and I never write a review for any products, but I have to do this one because this is such a good product.  I just want to tell you guys couple things:&lt;br /&gt;1. I have been using this shampoo every day for 2 months and I will keep use it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It really helpful for hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;3. It worth for its price.</li>
    <li> highly recommend! leaves hair feeling clean and full of volume!</li>
    <li> So for the past year my hair has been falling out a lot. I don&#x27;t know what the reason was behind my hair loss but then I got this shampoo two months ago and since then my hair has stop falling out as much. My hair has also become smoother. I will definitely continue using this product even though it&#x27;s quiet expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> After looking at dozens of shampoos for hair loss, I finally settled on this one. The reviews are generally good and I chose this Gold one over the blue one because the ingredients for this one is 100% natural preservative system that is plant based. I want to review it now and then come back in 3 months with an update on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!For people who think the price is really high, I completely agree! Amazon currently has it for $39/bottle. However, When you get the bottle, there&#x27;s a promotion on the wrapper of the bottle that says if you leave an HONEST review of the product, Pura d&#x27;or will send you another bottle for free. So I took it as 2 bottles for $39, which isn&#x27;t that bad!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Initial Review:&lt;br /&gt;Got the shipment on 6/25/2014  and started using it on 7/1/2014. I have short straight black hair (maybe 1/2\\&quot;) that&#x27;s thinning on the top so unfortunately my scalp is kind of visible. Usually 1 or 1 1/2 pumps is enough for me and it does lather. Not as much as other shampoos (different ingredients) but it does lather. I can see my hair looks a little thicker after towel drying my hair. When I started, I did not wash my hair every day because I read that&#x27;s not good but my hair gets oily so it looks really thin after a day of not washing it. I started washing it every night with this shampoo and I can notice it getting thicker after the washes. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use your nails to get a good clean wash on your scalps because it can help lift any buildup on the pores! At least it worked for me. I notice hair falling out after my first few washes, but then it stopped and it looks like it&#x27;s getting thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I&#x27;m going to use this daily and come back in 3 months with an update. I also take 10,000mcg Biotin tablets as well so hopefully, I get some good results. Wish me luck!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the late update! I&#x27;m still using the product. From when I bought it till now, I&#x27;m still on my first bottle and it&#x27;s only about half empty. I still wash my hair every day so it&#x27;ll definitely last a while. Once I got the product and submitted this original review, I went to the link Pura d&#x27;or provided in the packaging and filled out the form. In less than 2 weeks, they shipped me my second bottle so I&#x27;m really happy about that! The fact that I&#x27;m still on my first bottle definitely makes me feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results, I&#x27;m still a little bit torn. As I mentioned in my initial review, my hair gets oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every day and when it does get oily, it looks extra thin. Using this shampoo didn&#x27;t change that unfortunately. I did let my hair grow out a little more (just an extra 1/2 inch or so) so after a wash with the shampoo, it does look fuller. I just have to make sure I wash it every night. I&#x27;ve also notice that when I wash it every night, less and less hair starts to falling out and after a while, there&#x27;s barely any hair (remember though, your hairs have cycles so some will eventually fall out). Now I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s due to the Biotin I&#x27;m taking for the shampoo but I continue to do both and I really recommend the same to other people in my position. Some tips: They recommend to leave it on your scalp for 2-3 minutes before rinsing so make sure you follow that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update again in a couple of months and hopefully get better results! If you have any tips or advice that worked for you, please leave it in the comments for me and others to see.about half empty. I still wash my hair every day so it&#x27;ll definitely last a while.

    <li> It helped! I was running my hands through my hair and strand of hair would come out and get tangled in my fingers multiple times a day and I started to find strands of my hair on my furniture etc... more than typical. I probably have a third less hair loss ( maybe?) and my hair is smoother after 3 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, does make your hair look thicker and feel thicker. Lost some hair due to radiation and medication and this shampoo helped get some of my hair back, not like when it was in my 20&#x27;s but good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo after going through post partum hair loss. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and it seems my hair is shedding more than it was before. My hair is also VERY dry and the texture feels off. I do not like this shampoo one bit and am mad that I wasted so much money on it. BEWARE.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is about 1/3 of the normal thickness, is fragile, and color treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Pura d&#x27;or use over the past couple of months, I think I have finally found something without a bunch of chemicals that actually works. My hair is now becoming the hair that I used to have. There is new hair growth, shine, and more volume. It feels stronger and soft, but not fly-away fine hair. My hair routine is becoming simpler. I find I do not need to use heat with the hair dryer and don&#x27;t have to completely dry it. I can also let it air dry at home before brushing it out and it turns out nice. I am also getting to the point where I do not need hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the  best way to use this shampoo is to use once a day, using enough to be able to create a good lather, massaging into the scalp, and then leaving in for 2 minutes (and no more, or the shampoo will start to dry the hair). The hair will feel &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; after a towel dry and that is normal. Use spray in conditioner for the ends mainly, and use a Wet Brush to distribute the spray in conditioner. I use Redken Blonde Idol conditioner, which does not weigh down the hair. The Wet Brush will not break your hair like combs do. I use a little Redken Guts mousse to style. My hair looks the best it has looked in a few years. I will keep you posted as to continued results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it on and off since couple years ago. Its reviews have been high so I wanted to give it another shot. To be honest I myself have not felt much different and I guess it&#x27;s because my physical condition now. But, my dad and my sister said they feel not bad about this product so I&#x27;m going to buy other ones for them and try to give it a shot again.</li>
    <li> My hair feels thicker, softer and it is more manageable. I am trying to grow out my hair and using this product it is organic and natural and does not make my hair feel heavy or weird like some other products.  I have less hair fall.  Love this product!!</li>
    <li> I think this product is very nice, i lost less hair then before.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month back. I have severe hair loss and tried different methods - Rogaine, Finasteride tablets etc,. and they seem to provide some temporary halt, but hair loss continues after a short break.&lt;br /&gt;After I started applying Pura D&#x27;Or regularly - I apply it to wet hair and keep it there for 2-3 minutes and then wash it off - it seems to have a great effect. I see less amount of hair in my shower drain and am happy with the product so far</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father who was experiencing some hair loss. He now uses this shampoo regularly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo since I noticed my hair beginning to thin about a year ago.  I can honestly tell you it works. My hair looks healthy and thicker.  My wife, who is a hair stylist, agrees that it has stopped my hair from thinning.  Just placed another order.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought it was pricey, but it has been 3 months and I still have half of the bottle remaining. It doesn&#x27;t take much (but I have short hair) and lathers well. Keeps my hair soft and clean. I used to use a dandruff shampoo, and that is no longer necessary. I don&#x27;t know if this is a coincidence or not. I have also not noticed thinning in the last three months, which is why I bought the shampoo in the first place. (I know, three months isnt much time to see a noticeable difference). I will continue to use the product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a week now and have seen a decrease in hair loss. I will have to wait and see if it helps any new hair grow.</li>
    <li> I have been stressed about hair loss of years now. I heard about the benefits of argan oil and ordered this product. I feel that the hair loss has been reduced as before. I would never buy any shampoo from the local market anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. You will see a difference in the quality and fulness of your hair. I feel my hair thinning is significantly less and the hair texture has improved. Also is great treatment for your scalp. No more dandruff on shirt. The best thing is no toxic chemicals like other hair thinning treatments. A must for anyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> A friend used Pura d&amp;#34;or and saw noticeable results so I decided to try. Right away  I love the fragrance and of course organic ingredients.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen actual growth  in 2 short weeks, but I can say my hair looks fuller and when I wake up I don&#x27;t have severe horrible bed-head.  I plan on using Pura d&#x27;Or to combat age related hair loss long term.  I like the fact that I am using something daily to naturally help my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 3 weeks now. After my shower, my hair seems to be more voluminous and frizzy, but sometimes when I wake up the next morning, my hair seems to be thin again. I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth yet, but I will continue to use it to see if it anything changes. I have been using 1 pump each time, but will try using 1.5 pumps to see if anything changes. I really hope it will work out soon! If anything changes, I will update this review.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my mother, and it is totally worth it! She said the change can be see, her hair looks much better after couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a female woman who is 29, I started this shampoo in April, my hair was very thin, at 1st my scalp had to adjust to the new shampoo, I got some acne on my head which I do not usually have, I thought that was weird but decided to stick it out for a few more weeks, by week 3 the acne had stopped and my hair was ok, I have been on the shampoo now for about 60 days and I am seeing new growth!!! I am beyond excited about this. I keep getting told by my friends and family in the last week that my hair is looking thicker and that is looks like its growing back!&lt;br /&gt;I did make a few other changes besides the shampoo, I was reading that insulin resistance plays a role in hairloss for women, I started to eat lower carb and eating cleaner, I also add a few drops of Cedarwood oil on my scalp *there is cedarwood in the ingrediance listed* but I thought it wouldnt hurt to add some more on after I get out of the shower in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;If you are suffering from hairloss I would recommend this product. Thank you, thank you, thank you for creating this great shampoo.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after hearing so much about it. My hair sometimes tends to get dry at the ends, so wanted to give this a try. I am glad I did, I used the product only twice; the first time I used it was after I colored my hair, when the hair was almost fully dry. My hair was soft to begin with, but this just made it feel even more healthier and it last for awhile before you need to reapply. I use just a small amount. That small amount goes a long way</li>
    <li> makes your hair soft but still not what I expected as far as volume and body and hair still comes out but I guess that is a normal process does not seem any thicker</li>
    <li> i been using couple weeks it is work for me I will keep using this</li>
    <li> Did not help with my hair loss at all! and left it looking more  limp and lifeless. I am guessing the fabulous positive reviews are paid reviews, it just doesn&#x27;t mean anything to read a review anymore. I Would definitely not recommend and I advise others to spend their money on something else, I am going to save for  a wig by not buying any more expensive shampoos that don&#x27;t do a thing or perhaps even make things worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle and it feels as though its working.  I haven&#x27;t really taken any before and after pictures but I feel better at least.  It smells nice too, it isn&#x27;t perfumed like ordinary shampoo but instead smells herbal.  It&#x27;s nice, just different.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 weeks now - along with the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking nutrient pills - and I&#x27;m pleased with the results so far! The shampoo makes my scalp feel much healthier, overall. I&#x27;ve noticed the shedding has SIGNIFICANTLY slowed down. Again, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or the nutrient pills, or the combination of both, but I&#x27;m liking the results from combining the two so far. I will continue to purchase this product as I&#x27;ve read it will take at least 3 months to see significant results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 67 and started losing a significant amount of hair about three years ago.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that would help stem the tide, and the Pura d&#x27;or Gold Label has helped significantly.  I have a drain sieve that catches hair before it goes down the drain.  Almost immediately after starting to use the Pura d&#x27;or, the amount of hair being caught in the sieve was reduced by half.  Although it didn&#x27;t stop hair loss completely, the product is making a huge difference in the rate of hair loss, and I&#x27;m appreciative of every strand of hair I keep.  I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out anymore. I may look 10 hairs when I wash verses 100 normally. My hair dresser has even commented on how my hair is thicker. ***I only wash my hair 2-3 times weekly, if I were to use everyday as directed, WOW I would have a head full. I will NEVER use another shampoo, even if it didn&#x27;t regrow hair, it would allow you to keep the hair you have which makes it worth every penny to me.</li>
    <li> it requires patience.. don&#x27;t stop using it and the results will show . it does your hair look fuller and less dry .</li>
    <li> This actually works, what a surprise.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about this shampoo. I browsed through many, many positive reviews here on Amazon.com and having learned that this Pura d&#x27;or Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo is an Amazon.com best seller I decided to take a leap of faith. Not to mention that I did my homework by spending countless of hours googling the web about DHT blockers, hair loss, and Pura d&#x27;or.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months and 2 bottles of Pura d&#x27;or  later  (my better half and I share it) I cannot be happier. The first 2 weeks I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have a lot of falling hair anymore. I wonder what they put in this shampoo! I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not superglue. Then as weeks passed by with me religiously using this shampoo twice a day I noticed new hair growth where my hairline was receding on my forehead. My only regret is that I did not take before and after pictures to prove my case. Oh well, I am completely satisfied and that is all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, falling hair is the least of my worries. Thanks to whoever invented Pura d&#x27;or. I am truly grateful.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, it really controls my hair fall... I want to give 10 start. After trying this shampoo i couldn&#x27;t find any other shampoo better than this. I being using this product past 2yrs simply super.</li>
    <li> Since ive been using this shampoo many things happened with me. Im 22 years old. My libido definetely drop out! Terrible! I cough for many hours everynight after using the shampoo before going to bed. Probably was the shampoo i was really normal! I will stop it today and in some weeks i will check if the reason is this shampoo. I came here in some weeks to say.</li>
    <li> I really liked the shampoo. I&#x27;m not really sure if it had any effect on hair loss. At minimum, good shampoo.</li>
    <li> I spent quite some time searching for an organic anti-hair loss shampoo and I found pura d&#x27;or. I have observed less hair loss and my hair looks healthier.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. will buy another one</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;ve been using this about a month.  I &#x27;m 64 and have thinning, naturally curly hair.I like the product and wondered at first if I should use a conditioner.  I decided not to as if I rinse my hair carefully it doesn&#x27;t tangle.  If gives my hair body without using other products and my husband likes the scent of my hair.  The only thing that I questioned at first, was the scent.  The fragrance seemed kind of pine scented at first and I am allergic to pines.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the efficacy of this product after discovering that some of the five star reviews might not be genuine. But I decided to give this shampoo a try anyways since I had already received it. After 6 weeks of regular use, frankly I am not disappointed. The hair loss has definitely reduced. Wont hesitate to buy again.</li>
    <li> I have spent the last two years on a quest for a shampoo that would help my limp thinning hair.  I have been using the gold label for about a month now.  My hair is stronger, softer, has more body and looks fuller.  I first started with the brown and blue bottle which I loved and then changed up to the gold.  I am completely happy and will never spend any more time or money looking for another shampoo.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it worked or not. As a shampoo it wasn&#x27;t great.  The hair softens up almost the same if you use conditioner this makes the thinning more apparent. I don&#x27;t understand the really high rating here.</li>
    <li> I lost almost 50% of my hair volume in past 15 years. Few months after I had my daughter, I lost BUNCH of hairs. I started to use organic/no SLS shampoo. I tried alterna caviar, desert essence organic series in past two years. Pura Dor anti-hair loss shampoo is the 1st anti-hair loss shampoo I tried. I have been using it for 1 week now. I don&#x27;t see any miracle, but I noticed I had less shedding . The essential oil smell is not a problem for me. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave 4 stars, because the price is kind of high. I have medimum hair length, one 16 OZ bottle probably won&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just realized I bought Pura Dor Argan oil Body, Hair &amp; face treatment before, I think I got it from Groupon. I will see if I can combine them to get better result.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for my hair</li>
    <li> I have used numerous so-called Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo but this one has risen top of my list. After two weeks of use my scalp and hair feel clean and moist. I will repeat for sure.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is organic and effective.  I have tried two of this brands products and have been happy with both.</li>
    <li> One month of use no result I even take picture of my hair before I start it but not happy</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this product since my hair has been thinning after having 3 babies close together. After all the positive reviews I had read,I really thought this would make my hair look fuller, but unfortunately it didthe exact opposite. My hair looked so limp and flat after I used this shampoo, which also made it look thinner than it actually is. I&#x27;m so disappointed and feel like I wasted my money and my hope in the product.</li>
    <li> I have only used this shampoo for a couple of weeks, so I cannot say if it stimulates hair growth, but I can say that it has almost no smell to it and it does make my fine thin hair thicker looking and feeling. I will update this review after a few months, but for now, I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell you if this product is working so far... Here is what I can say. I am at the bad end of 24 and seem to be losing my hair at an alarming rate. The hair loss has led to stress and I know stress isn&#x27;t helping. I found this product in a search for different products that help slow this process. While I can&#x27;t yet confirm that it is working, I can say that buying/using products that claim to help has reduced my stress, which will likely slow my hair loss. It is extremely expensive but the reduction in stress, even in the slightest, is more than worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using pura d&#x27;or for about two weeks my hair is looking thicker and don&#x27;t see any loss of hair. Not sure about the smell,but I think I will use it for awhile to see how it works long term</li>
    <li> Love this product! No harsh chemicals to smell and leaves my scalp feeling fresh! I have high hopes for it. I&#x27;ll be back soon to give some update.</li>
    <li> I contacted Pura D&#x27;or regarding this product a month ago. My question to them was - Does this product contain Ketoconazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two people that responded to my emails did not know. They seemed pretty certain that the ingredients were currently being updated and Ketoconazole was being removed. Based on this I purchased several bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order only to find after using this product, it contained Ketoconazole and several other surfactants not listed on the Pura D&#x27;or website not on any listing on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked Pura D&#x27;or once again about Ketaconazole and they once again assured me it was being removed. However, a month later the ingredients for this product have been updated on Pura D&#x27;ors website to list Ketaconazole and even the quantity of this ingredient in their product. Also, listings on Amazon have been revised to list Ketaconazole as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only writing this review to make other buyers aware that you need to be careful about what you are actually purchasing here. Some of the bottles of Pura D&#x27;or Premium I received were battered and quite dusty and the labels appeared sun faded as if they were quite old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still pretty certain one bottle I tried to use contained essential oils that had gone rancid as I had a severe reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a good product, however it is a little hit and miss as to whether or not you receive a good, fresh bottle.</li>
    <li> This works.  I purchased a few months ago and within a few days could tell it was working.  Before using this product my hair was falling out by the handful each day.  Within a few days, 2 or 3 strands would fall out in the shower and by the end of the week, no hair in the shower falling out.  I am not saying when I brush my hair, that I don&#x27;t have some fallout.  But the difference was significant.  After a month of using, friends could tell a difference.  I will purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Hi, I purchased this product for my husband after seeing positive reviews..well it was awful and did not help him at all..plus it smelled horrible!!</li>
    <li> Yes, this product is expensive, but for what you get its definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve had thinning and receding hair for the past five or so years, and I&#x27;ve tried a number of products. Most of them had harsh chemicals that made my hair look dry and dead. Pura d&#x27;Or made my hair look healthy while following through on the promised results. I&#x27;m only not giving it five stars because it is quite expensive, but like I said, worth it!</li>
    <li> One of the best products ive ever used. Pura d&#x27;or, it beyond the best brand. I will never use another brand.</li>
    <li> I used to use this shampoo a few years ago and just started using it again. I tried countless other shampoos to prevent hair loss but nothing seems to work as good as this shampoo. Great smell but the shampoo itself is more oil feeling compared to other shampoos. I highly recommend if your worried anout hair loss.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I am noticing  less hair shedding  with the dreaded wash of my very fragile hair.  Hair seems at least a little fuller and markedly softer.  The best I have used for awhile.</li>
    <li> Updated 1/8/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially started using this shampoo a few months back and noticed right away that my hair feels more natural and clean with no dry scalp whatsoever compared to other \\&quot;quality\\&quot; shampoos.  The lack of SLS I think has a lot to do with it since I&#x27;ve read a lot of bad things about all the normal shampoos out there that contain sulfates.  My hair feels clean longer and I tend to use less shampoo because I don&#x27;t have to wash as often.  However, I&#x27;ve decided to use it often just in case its ingredients are helping my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has gotten thicker and I&#x27;ve had new growth (short little hairs where I had only a few long hairs).  How much of this is from the shampoo I can&#x27;t say because I started using it at the same time as the Ultax Labs Hair Maxx supplement.  Since the shampoo is only used on the head, and my body hair and nails are also growing very fast, I would have to say that a lot of the benefit is from the oral supplement from Ultax Labs.  That being said, I will never stop using Pura d&#x27;or as my shampoo since my hair is healthier and thicker than it has been for 5-10 years.  Even if only a small portion of the benefit is from the shampoo or none at all, its still worth it just for the healthier natural clean feeling you get and it does at a minimum give you thicker feeling hair by adding body.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo help me a lot on losing my hair A++++++ all the way</li>
    <li> I received package very quick. But the pump was broken. I took one from old bottle. I have been using it over a year. I am not sure it helps hair loss. I will try something else after this bottle.</li>
    <li> Second bottle of this shampoo that I have purchased; too soon to know if it helps replenish diminishing hair.  It cleans hair will without drying out the hair shafts.  It only takes about 1/2 teaspoon volume to clean my hair; so for my hair length of about one inch the bottle lasts for about 180 shampooings.  As to it&#x27;s ability to regrow hair; I have some thinning on the top center area of the scalp but no male pattern baldness.  Over the two months of use it seems as if my scalp is less visible.  One caveat though is that I am also applying minoxidil 5% foam to that area BID.  Either way it seems that doing both of these things is showing a difference for me.  Even if the shampoo did not help with hair follicle regeneration I would continue to use it because I like the way it cleans my hair and the way it looks throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is amazing!  I came across it on Amazon because I was losing hair and decided to try it.  It has help reduce hair from falling out and makes my hair feel nice and fuller.  I would recommend it to anyone especially because it is a completely natural product with no harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now and am already noticing the difference in how full my hair feels.  I purchased another brand of hair loss shampoo that did not lather like this one with very little results and it was more expensive.  This shampoo is working so well that it has already begun to fill in my thin areas.  I rarely see my hair falling out when shampooing now where as before I was losing multiple hairs daily.  And another great benefit is it contains all organic ingredients...nothing harmful.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> good product. good smell. waiting for the effect to become obvious. may need another bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and noticed that I&#x27;m not losing much hair.  My hair feels soft and my scalp not dry like it was before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old male with fine and slightly thin hair. This shampoo was suggested to me by a friend who had heard great reviews. i had my doubts. However so far i have been using it for 2 weeks and i feel a difference and have begun to see a difference. Hopefully more and more good results to come. BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. After a week of using my hair looks healthy.  I have tried other shampoos but this feels natural.</li>
    <li> MY SEARCH IS OVER. I have been known as the shampoo guru by my friends since I always in search for a better shampoo. and as a Purad&#x27;or customer, I was satisfied with the regular anti loss (regular) shampoo. however, the gold  label changed the game for me. After 4 weeks of use, I can see the difference: my hair is thicker,stronger, and darker. If you have thin hair and you want to take care of it without the harsh chemicals, try this one and you won&#x27;t leave for ever.</li>
    <li> I have used it for several times and my wife told me that my hair looks stronger and there are more baby hairs now. I&#x27;m so happy with it.Will see what will happen later.</li>
    <li> I am a 28 year old male with mild thinning on the top of my head. This product has a pleasant not overpowering scent. It also lathers very well compared to other organic shampoos. It states that it takes around 3 months of use before you will se results. I will update this review with my results after 3 months .</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing . My Hair looks very healthy and thicker ! I Have been using this shampoo for about 1 month and 2 weeks . The results are very good . I can see new hair regrowing on my bold spot on the front . The shampoo is just amazing I recommended this to anyone that is suffering from hair loss .</li>
    <li> My dermatologist diagnosed me with an incurable scalp condition.  My hair was thinning dramatically with every wash.  I was using a very strong steroid prescription drop on my scalp, antibiotics twice daily, and a prescription shampoo.  The condition seemed to be getting worse not better.  I was desperate for a solution, and after reading the reviews for Pura d&#x27;or, although still holding onto some doubt, ordered a bottle of the shampoo.  The first thing I noticed was that MUCH less hair came out when I washed it, and during comb out.  I was amazed but still hesitated to be hopeful.  After a few weeks of use, I noticed new hair coming in around the crown of my scalp.  It was curly, not straight!  Must have been new hair.  I had a stylist look at it, and she confirmed it was new hair, not broken shafts.  I also noticed much less itching.  My hair is dry, so I may look into a conditioner if one if offered by this brand.  I am sold on this product, and will order another bottle when I finish this one.  I am truly converted to a believer from one who would rarely order this way.  Thank you for you amazing product.  I will also mention that the rest of my hair is filling in, much to my surprise and delight!  Again, thank you!  Barbara</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me a bottle of this anti-hair loss shampoo last year on my birthday.  Ever since then, the amount of falling hair kept on decreasing. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.  The shipping speed is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week and have noticed a little more volume to my hair.  I like this shampoo for the fact that it has all natural organic ingredients with no harsh chemicals that can over time contribute to or accelerate hair loss.  Time will tell if this product can actually regrow hair or slow down hair loss........so far I like this product and will remain patient to see if this shampoo gives me even better results,</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Love the way this product makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! My hair and scalp feel clean and healthy. I really like the way my hair feels and it is manageable and soft and shiny Usually my scalp gets itchy by the next day after i wash it and with this shampoo im not having that problem. Im really impressed. Dont know about the hairloss yet but im hopefull and based on other reviews i expect good results.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it, it helped him so much. We will be buying again!</li>
    <li> After a month of use this product seems to be working very well. I have noticed better hair growth and overall hair health. I would recommend this product to anyone who has fine or thin hair who is looking for a alternative to all the chemicals out there on the market.</li>
    <li> This natural product works great leaving my hair soft. It lacks the harmful sulfates. It&#x27;s too early to tell about the hair regrowth and is a expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the 1st time. Love the way it makes my hair feel. Too early to know if it makes hair grow. I gave it 4 stars instead of  5 because the odor is string and takes a little getting use to. It&#x27;s not a bad odor, just a strong one. If you&#x27;re a person who wears perfume, which I don&#x27;t , it may not be a problem.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working so far. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product.  I do believe that it prevents hair loss.  Gentle enough to use on your face without drying it out.</li>
    <li> It simply works!  I have been using Pura d&#x27;or for about 3 months and have noticed a significant reduction in hair loss.  I also noticed that I no longer need conditioner as shampoo does not dry out my scalp and hair.  This is my 2nd order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 32 year old woman that has been experiencing an extreme amount of shedding/hair loss over the past 4-5 months.  I would lose probably 100 hairs every time I would brush my hair and another 150-200 every time I&#x27;d wash my hair.  It terrified me at how much hair I was losing because I was getting very noticeable thin spots around my hairline.  I went to the dermatologist and she recommended I try biotin and Rogaine.  I tried Rogaine for 1 1/2 weeks and couldn&#x27;t stand the itching and flakes that it caused.  I&#x27;ve tried hair loss serums, vitamins, etc, and nothing has remotely came close to slowing my shedding.  I ordered this shampoo with not too high of hopes, honestly.  To my amazement, my hair loss dramatically decreased within a couple weeks of using this shampoo!!  I&#x27;m not even kidding!!  I&#x27;m completely shocked at how well this stuff works!  I maybe lose 2-3 hairs when I brush now and only 10-15 when I wash!!  This has been a miracle for me and I&#x27;m so happy!  It&#x27;s an all around great shampoo too.  It smells wonderful, it lathers up really nicely, and it&#x27;s organic and made from healthy ingredients.  I haven&#x27;t noticed it drying out my hair at all, but I do follow it up with a conditioner.  I might add.....I started taking NOW brand double strength black current seed oil capsules at about the same time as I started using this shampoo.  Research black current oil and hair loss, there&#x27;s tons of info on how it helps.  I think the capsules and the shampoo are working really well together for me!&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness I&#x27;m not going bald anymore!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband since I have used pura d&#x27;or products for over a year now.  He has less hair fall out the first time he used it, and his hair has more of a thickness to it.  He is sixty years old and has always wore his hair long, so he is very happy to be able to use a shampoo that will hopefully stop a lot of his hair fall out. Amazon always has great prices Pura d&#x27;or products[[ASIN:B00FH692PQ Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label), 16 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Before I begin my review, some background about me... I am a 25 year old male and baldness is on neither sides of my family. I noticed a few years ago that my hairline started receding and I wasn&#x27;t to scared about that. I just figured it was normal. but as the last 2-3 years went by I definitely noticed that the hair on top of my head was getting thinner to the point a few months ago I noticed after a shower that the &#x27;horseshoe&#x27; pattern on my head was forming. Reacting normally, I started freaking out. I have done endless research on baldness and DHT and starting obtaining natural products since I don&#x27;t have thousands to dump on hair transplants. I decided to try out this product and I honestly can say I am very satisfied with the results! I notice my hair is incredibly soft and feels more natural, but most importantly... THICKER! After 2 months I can tell what I have been doing is showing improvement. Three major things to add... I have also been using Saw Palmetto, Biotin, pumpkin seed oil and doing Castor oil treatments to myself in addition to the shampoo so I can&#x27;t solely say it&#x27;s the shampoo but it&#x27;s definitely not hurting.... You have to have patience! Regroath doesn&#x27;t happen overnight so stay the course and keep the faith... And finally, we are all individuals. Something that works well for me could work better or worse on somebody else. IN CONCLUSION, I am very happy with this product and I plan to make this my go-to shampoo</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product.  Mild &amp; pleasantly fragrant.  Such a nice alternative to harsh national brands. My hair does indeed feel thicker &amp; fuller which was the primary reason I bought this shampoo to begin with.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice to neutral which I prefer to overly-perfumed shampoos and soaps.  It takes a little getting used to since this shampoo does not lather as most over-the-counter brands do.  My hair certainly felt clean afterward, but I did need to use spray on detangler to comb out afterward.  I have curly,longish hair which USED to be very thick.  It is too soon to tell whether or not it will help stop my hair from falling out, but after 10 days of use (and maybe 4 shampoos) I haven&#x27;t noticed a big change either way.  I like the ingredient list.</li>
    <li> Quality product. It really gives more volume to hair when you use it. I have used this product for two months and haven&#x27;t seen any new hair growth, but I am shedding less hair. Not a miracle, but definitely well worth the cost for those with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both the blue and gold label Pura D&#x27;or products now, and they are so far the best products I&#x27;ve used for my hair. I don&#x27;t have bald spots yet, but my hair is getting noticeably (feel and touch) thinner, so I&#x27;m trying to slow or reverse the process as well as I can. The Pura D&#x27;or products leave my hair feel stronger and thicker, which is what I am looking for right now. In fact, when I use this product I find my hair is so much healthier feeling that I have no need for conditioner. I will continue to use this product going forward, though I wish the price was lower (hence the 4 stars).</li>
    <li> There may have many reasons for shedding problem, but I didn&#x27;t know what happened in my case. I’m only in the thirties and doing my job in a corporate office. Hair falls made me crazy and day by day I lost my appeal from my profession. Nowadays, various shampoos, medicine &amp; hair treatment products ensure that they have the capability to grow new, dense and dark hair! I think that these are not good for the scalp and hair as well. However, while I was quite disappointed, a friend of mine told me about Pura d&#x27;or premium organic anti-hair loss shampoo. I ordered the product for a good test. But, within just 30 days, I found some new hair on my scalp. I’ve got back my hair and very pleased getting back my dashing look again.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling full and full of volume. Thin hairs were noticably thicker. Will have to wait a bit and see if firther hair loss stops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few weeks.  It does a good job of cleaning my hair.  I am real big on good smelling shampoo and this has a rather medicinal smell.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in hair loss, but I have a little eczema at base of hairline and I have noticed it doesn&#x27;t seem to breakout as bad as with other shampoos. I probably won&#x27;t order again just due to the smell which is not bad, but just not good for me.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT only after one wash and I am in love thank you puls fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen my friend in a few months and when she invited to to dinner at her home I noticed how fuller and shinier her hair was.  She told me she had not gone to the salon and had not undergone any treatment but I did not believe her.  At the end of the night, after much pestering, she took me to the bathroom where she showed me her secret!  Pura d&#x27;or Organic Anti-Hair Loss shampoo.  I was skeptical......but I took the bottle home anyway (who knows I thought....).  I have always struggled with my hair and she knew how much I had spent on product promising this or that so she gave me her bottle that was half full.  I took it home and started using it.  After the first week I noticed a difference in my hair texture (I shampoo every morning).  Even when wet, my hair just felt thicker.  After 3 weeks, people started asking me if I had gone to the salon, done something new, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered a new bottle and expect to be ordering more because this shampoo surpasses any I have ever used and my hair is loving it!  If I could post a picture here I would just to show the difference that 3 weeks has made.  I know it&#x27;s selfish of me.......but I won&#x27;t be announcing this to just anyone......if you suffer fro thin hair (like me), have noticed more hair in your drain (like I used to) and want to strengthen your hair without any chemicals (no minoxidil!!) while making it full.......YOU GOTTA GET THIS!!!!!  I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I have a hair loss problem on the sides of the forehead, and recently have gotten more worried about increasing amount fallen hair after shampoo. So I decided to invest some more money into a quality anti-hair loss shampoo, and found this to be the most popular in the market.&lt;br /&gt;When I finally applied it onto my wet hair, my first impression was &#x27;nothing feels different&#x27; and &#x27;will this really work?&#x27; Then as I massaged my scalp with it, very fine foam started to form, and it gave a natural, smooth feeling of scalp cleanse. Throughout the entire washing process, I indeed felt no hint of chemical reactions or artificial feeling of freshness, it just felt like a natural wash in a forest, with the slight scent of herbs and aroma. And when I blow-dried my hair afterwards, it had definitely gotten more volume and each strand seemed coated. I was worried the natural formula would render stiff hair, but to my surprise, my hair as a whole felt much softer afterwards, too. I have only used it once so far, but I have a prettty good feeling this shampoo will guard my hair from loss, if not grow, at this rate.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, I began to lose hair since last year. Based on good review, I chose this product and tried it immediately when I got it. It smells good, and I did notice that I did not lose as much hair as before. I am not quite sure about how it goes in the long term, and I hope it could be as good as described.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 weeks, and so far I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it. It feels much better than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. Whether or not the &amp;#34;anti-hair loss&amp;#34; aspect of the shampoo works or not will be determined after I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. I have wavy hair and the shampoo keeps it well under control. Not sure yet if I will see any growth as I will have to give it a few months before they say you should see some changes. But apart from that, I love the shampoo.</li>
    <li> The pine tree smell is really amazing!</li>
    <li> My friend recommended and I&#x27;ve been using this  product since April this year. My hair is not thinning anymore!!</li>
    <li> I just used this shampoo two time, so far  i like it. I already feel like my hair has all of volume and my hair feels thicken. It smells good too, I&#x27;m going to keep using it and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> I really think this product is the best!!! Elizabeth Dickey</li>
    <li> It helps my husband lost his hair ... It works !!! Everyday when he takes a bath no falling hair at all... Before it has like 20 or more hair that I found . After he use this shampoo , it prevent it to loose some more hair... I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product, I will keep buying it . It&#x27;s the best and worth of money you can buy!!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality shampoo.  Pleasant fragrance and easy to lather.  I noticed a difference right away compared to budget store brands. I plan to keep using and will try to follow up the review with the long term outcome.</li>
    <li> Amazing results!! I have definetely seen an improvement in the thickness of my hair. My hair seems to have stopped thinning and even seems to be filling in after about 6 months of use!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I had a lot of hair loss.  I was pleasantly surprised at the way that the shampoo and conditioner left my hair: with a lot of body. The body it gave to my hair helped it to look fuller - until my hair thickens again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light, as I do not like heavily perfumed shampoos.  I like the fact that I am not adding chemicals to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using the non-gold label version of Pura D&#x27;or and have been loving it!  I tend to have matted flat hair and it gave me volume on its own that I never used to have before (I would actually receive compliments on the volume of my hair, which was never a positive feature of mine previously).  I figured why not upgrade to the gold label since the blue label worked so well? My experience so far with the gold label is very much positive as well. It retains the same kind of volume in my hair without stripping it, but I also know that all the good ingredients are keeping my scalp healthy at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other issue I had before using Pura D&#x27;or was that the other anti hair-loss shampoos would add volume by removing the matted-ness caused by oils, but would also strip the edge of my scalp and my scalp would overreact and produce oil/acne.  I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore so I am very happy that I made the switch.</li>
    <li> I am new to using this product, but my initial impressions are all positive. The ingredients list is what drew me to this product for not only what it is made of, but also what it doesn&#x27;t have in it. Nothing toxic and nothing that is going to damage my hair, scalp or the rest of my body. I have been dealing with hair loss for over ten years. I do not expect any miracles. It is still important to me that I am doing something proactive to keep my existing hair and scalp as healthy as possible to prevent more hair loss and possibly promote hair growth. I am optimistic&lt;br /&gt;about this shampoo. The packaging and label are impressive. The product goes on well with a rich lather with minimal product applied- one pump was plenty. The scent is not offensive at all and was pleasant enough without any artificial scents. My scalp feels nice and clean. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> So far I am enjoying this product. I don&#x27;t know if it will restore hair loss but it is the first product I used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp and make me breakout from sulfates and other additives.</li>
    <li> Loving it so far. It&#x27;s definitely helped to decrease the amount of hair loss I was experiencing.  I use this along with the pura d&#x27;or conditioner and I oil/massage my scalp with Jamaicam black castor oil every 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> Just started to use the shampoo. The product leave my hair not oily. Smells nice. I&#x27;ll come back to comment when I have more experience of the product.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair so luxurious! The only thing is that I don’t really like the pump bottle. I prefer a more traditional cap so that I can stand it upside-down when it is almost done.</li>
    <li> This Organic hair product is really great! My hair was much softer and I noticed that I am losing much less hair than before. Hair feels great and I would definitely purchase this product again - would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> So far I love this product. I have not used it long enough to see new hair growth. It does make your hair feel thicker and fuller.</li>
    <li> So far by my recent use of this product I can say I&#x27;m already seeing an improvement in my hair health. My hair is becoming thicker and in some areas starting to feel my hair regrow. I was spectacle about this product, but it&#x27;s really legit after the results I&#x27;m seeing from the few days I been using it.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo that works as advertised.</li>
    <li> i just started using it and will find out the result in a month or so</li>
    <li> it is a great product, and i saw its works after two weeks of using. i like it. it is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Since I am in my mid-age, I started to lose hair (from stress, not eating healthy, lack of sleep, calcium).  I brought this bottle of shampoo two months ago to try it out.  The reviews has been really good. The result meets expectation. There are less hair in the tub after shower.  I don&#x27;t notice more hair. However, the lost of hair slowed or near stopped.  Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Only had a for a few weeks but so far it&#x27;s working great for me. I would definitely recommend this and I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works wonder on my dry and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I have thin and oily hair roots, medium length. I used to use an expensive organic shampoo. My hair fell always. But now I can see a huge difference even after the first use of  Pura d&#x27;or. So, here&#x27;s what I noticed after my first use:&lt;br /&gt;Smell- natural, delicate herb smell. And I like the smell without any fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Mild shampoo, very good lather, and color safe (for real!)- My hair color now has more shine!&lt;br /&gt;Much less stray hairs in shower &amp; everywhere else!! Wow, I didn&#x27;t expect that kind of result, this soon!  Also I have to say this shampoo cleans very well my scalp. I can feel that right after washing. Another \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;-  it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard to comb through or stat icky, like my previous shampoo did. My 3rd \\&quot;Wow\\&quot; - my hair is so soft, so silky, and so manageable! I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner! More volume and very clean! 16 fl oz. -  enough for a while, to see results. And it worth every $.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m very impressed with this shampoo! I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product. No harsh chemicals. Smells and feels refreshing...</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. It does prevents hair loss. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because argan oil or these DHT Blockers but this stuff works. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 3 months and my hair shedding has been reduced significantly. From now on it is one and only shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> It has a good natural smell. The shampoo is a little thinner than other shampoos and I need to use more each time. But it seems work.  After I used for two weeks, I feel my hair loss is alleviated. Although my hair gets a little bit dry, I like it for its helpful  effect. You can use it with condition to make hair smooth. I think I will buy it again. Hope there will be more discount then.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!!I have used it for couple of months and have noticed not as much hair loss.  It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, it lathers well.  You do have to use conditioner or your hair will feel dry.  Depending on the hair length you may require more than 1 pump.  I do leave it in full 2 minutes before rinsing it.  I am planning on continuing to use this product.</li>
    <li> Anything to save the hair.  I like the way it makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair shiny and healthy, I will buy it again</li>
    <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new user and so far this product is working well.  I&#x27;ve only lost a small amount of hair in front so this product is more preventative.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> It’s different.  It leaves my hair feeling clean and the scent is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I found this product online and bought one via Amazon. I like its natual smell and feel good when I use it. You know why? Because there is no artificial fragrance. It also feels smoothly and fresh after rinse. Haven&#x27;t seen newly growing hair yet for I just started using it only a week ago. And will post further comment on the product &amp; introduce to my friends around the world in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion:  It would be great if they can make the shampoo a bit thicker, for better control during using and for easy handling for trips overseas.</li>
    <li> For now, I have see the effect. But I will wait and see.</li>
    <li> Recently I started to notice my hair slowly thinning starting from the crown. I&#x27;m sure like most people, I began researching what to do and how to prevent it. Although my hair was slowly falling I did not believe it was due to a balding pattern but mostly caused by a light case of psoriasis. After trying to find any mild or organic form of shampoo I decided to give Pura d&#x27;or a shot. Its only been a little over a week but I can already notice my scalp almost completely flake free and it is finally relaxed and not so tight now. I really do think continual use of this product will lead to positive effects!</li>
    <li> Love it! The best shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> I find my hair is soft without any residue.  I don&#x27;t have to use alot and I am loosing less hair after having used it for three weeks. I don&#x27;t need conditioner with this either.</li>
    <li> Absolutely works on my hair loss problem. I&#x27;ve been using it for two week, and I can feel there is less hair loss when I am showering.</li>
    <li> It works!!! After two weeks, I can feel there is less hair loss when I&#x27;m showering. My hair is also smoother now.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t believe there is a cure for baldness, using some organic and natural product is certainly the best place to start to at least slow it down, rather than using harsh unknown chemicals on the most sensitive part of your body. I would urge anybody with thinning hair to at least give it a try.</li>
    <li> I had a very bad hair fall for years, it always has been my problem that I don&#x27;t know what type of shampoo to use that may damage my scalp and the hair itself.. I used selsun blue and other scalp treatment but still everytime I take a shower, my hair is all over the tub. Then one time I was trying to google of a shampoo that is all natural and no added chemicals. And at last I found this Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-hair loss shampoo. I tried at first, purchased here from amazon. then in almost a week, I started to noticed that this shampoo help my scalp to hold my hair stronger. It even moisturizes my hair so it was shiny, unlike before it was dry. And I don&#x27;t see a lot of my hairs in the tub  and my shirts anymore, thanks for this shampoo! try this u wont regret!</li>
    <li> My hair was shedding a lot, so a friend of mine recommended pura dor shampoo. I bought the blue label one  a few months ago and it worked great, so i decided to give a try to the gold label one and it is awesome. It is even better than the blue label one. i highly recommended. Great product</li>
    <li> I have been trying different shampoos that to find the one that works best for me and I stumble upon Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo. I have been using this shampoo for about three month now and I absolutely love it. Best thing about this shampoo is that this is 100% organic, gluten free, and has nice smell.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo. I was very skeptical at first. I&#x27;m glad I caved in and bought it. I had nothing left to lose (other than more hair!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair super clean feeling, bouncy and full of life and shine. I noticed less shedding after the first few uses. I have been using it for a week now and am very happy with the results. The company is wonderful as well. Very customer oriented and very resourceful when it comes to hair. I will continue to use this prouduct and see how it does. So far I&#x27;m impressed and love my hair. Now I&#x27;ll have to try their Aragon oil and see how it does in combination with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used so many shampoos that I started to believe there were no good products for thinning hair.  Fortunately, I found this product and I have been blown away.  Nothing on the market compares to this - I highly encourage anyone to try it.</li>
    <li> No change noted, what a waste of money. What was I thinking when I placed this order?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product it doesn&#x27;t do magic</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. My mom has very very thin hair and we have seen an improvement within the first bottle. It also smells very nice and subtle. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> after 6 weeks of using this shampoo i can say it&#x27;s above &amp; beyond my expectations! i used nioxin about 25 years and it was good.unfortunately in the last two years i felt withdraw in my hair situation and the scalp began to noticeably shown.after a research in the net i find that they&#x27;ve changed the formula!so another research for a good substitute lead me to this product.  meantime, i can indicate a great advance: my hair is shiny,fuller,thicker and looks much better! even the scalp is less visible through the hair.try it,you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
    <li> All the natural ingredients of this shampoo are beneficial for hair growth, prevent hair loss and for healthy hair. I felt difference in first  few uses and now have peace of mind.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that I&#x27;ve used everyday and never dried out my hair! I have used this shampoo for almost 3 months now.....my hair does seem thicker and scalp seems so much healthier than previous! I don&#x27;t get dandruff anymore either! This shampoo is a pure LIFESAVER and is worth every dollar to me.</li>
    <li> Love the product due to the fact that its all natural no chemicals, does not irritate or over dry my hair, leaves hair soft and manageable, already been using it for more than a week and already feel the difference in my hair texture, its more thicker, not dry, not breaking easily, its a definite trust worthy product.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning near my scalp line for the past year or so. I have been using this shampoo for 1 month now. While I don&#x27;t see any new growth yet (they recommend using it for 3 months to see results), the volume and texture of my hair has greatly improved! Within a few days I already noticed these changes. Some volumizing and thickening shampoos make your hair dry, but since this has argan oil it provides moisture and shine as well.</li>
    <li> It is the best shampoo ever. Leaves hair glossy and full.</li>
    <li> Bought this product 3 month ago, I use it daily. I am not saying it can regrow my hair but at least my hair are not leaving me like before. Previously I can see lots of hair in the water sink after I wash my hair, but with this product, I see less. So this product is recommended.</li>
    <li> I know there&#x27;s a lot of fake reviews out there for this product so rest assured, this one is coming from a regular guy. I started using the product in-part because of the reviews, so I want to do my best to share my experience and help others. I started using the product in July 2015 so I feel I am in a position to give a fair assessment. And, yes, I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo correctly by letting it sit at least 2 minutes. And I have been using it at least a few times every week for the past year. I am a caucasian male in my late 20&#x27;s. My hair type is straight and fine. I have noticed slight thinning all over the top of my head since my early 20&#x27;s, not a severe case. No bald spots and not really any issues with hairline. The concern was/is if it gets worse. That&#x27;s why I started looking at products that are available and that&#x27;s how I came across this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What everyone wants to know: has the product thickened my hair? Short answer, no. If you have bald spots or a receding hairline, I would not expect the product to work miracles. If that was the case, then this product would be a heck of a lot more popular, that&#x27;s for sure. And the ingredients would be widespread and not just in a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars? That&#x27;s where the longer answer comes in. I do feel that my hair is much healthier and, in turn, looks a slightly thicker and fuller. Do the DHT-blocking ingredients work as a preventative measure to at least slow and deter the balding process? I&#x27;d like to think so, but it&#x27;s impossible to say. My hunch says probably not; don&#x27;t expect miracles. But I guess any little bit you can try to help your hair doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While 30 to 35 bucks for a shampoo is obviously more pricey than what I was used to, I&#x27;m still only on my second bottle in one year of use so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I use 2-3 pumps for each shampoo, depending on length of my hair. It gives an ok lather - not as good as a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo and the lather seems to dissipate when you let it sit in your hair (as advised on the bottle) and it gets all soaked in, but I don&#x27;t really care about that. It has a unique smell out of the bottle - personally I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t matter since you can&#x27;t smell it on your hair after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT advise using everyday as it will dry your hair out. At least, that&#x27;s what it did to my hair type. Dry hair is awful; nobody wants that dry, stiff, dull, straw-like texture - it doesn&#x27;t style well at all and can make hair look thinner. But I think that&#x27;s the case with any shampoo - you don&#x27;t want to use it everyday. On the days I do NOT shampoo in the shower, I will rinse and scrub my hair vigorously with my hands (as if it did have shampoo) with ONLY with hot water. Then I finish with a blast of cold water to close the hair cuticles. This has works like a charm - it gets rid of all the surface oils that make hair limp and look dirty, yet hair remains properly hydrated and styles well, has body, shine, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the days I do shampoo? Which is typically every 3 days or so. I don&#x27;t even need conditioner. Hair is soft, clean, and has a great shine. I like that it has all-natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals as well. I did not give 5-stars because the company does seem a little shady by making bold claims to capitalize on the millions of vulnerable people suffering from hair loss and the fake reviews here are real shady.ate when you let it sit in your hair (as advised on the bottle) and it gets all soaked in, but I don&#x27;t really care about that.

    <li> Smells wonderful. Hubby is starting to lose some hair (genetics). I bought him this from groupon on sale.  His hair texture feels amazing. The hair appears to be slightly fuller and thicker. I guess overtime it will be very effective. My hubby is going to continue to use it for sure.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase. All organic and no harmful chemicals. Arrived well in time.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff. I have noticed my hair is thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or anti-hair loss shampoo for close to 1 year now and I can honestly say it leaves my hair thick, healthy and strong. From what I have observed it most definitely - without question - stops hair loss completely; but of course I have no way of measuring that assessment. My measure here is \\&quot;compelling observable evidence.\\&quot;  Compared to other hair loss shampoo treatments that I have used, particularly from a price/comparison point of view, I would say this product is the best.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Satisfactory and worth using</li>
    <li> On my third bottle now and using it daily for about 6 months, it does slow down the hair loss process, but no effect on hair regrowing and thickening  .</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel and after using only a week I can tell that I&#x27;m shedding less hair throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to see the continued progress!</li>
    <li> I started off using the Pura d&#x27;or Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo(Blue) and went through two bottles and absolutely loved it! So I thought I&#x27;d give the Pura d&#x27;or Gold a try. It is by far the best shampoo I have used to date and I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner after rinsing the shampoo. To be honest I started using this line of shampoo because I am pregnant with my third baby and I had traumatic hairloss after giving birth to my first two kids and there was nothing out there in the market that really helped. So I thought I would start using Pura d&#x27;or products in the hopes that after I have my baby it will lessen the hairloss process. I will update my status when it happens!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shampoo. It&#x27;s still early to see results but the smell is nice for organic and my hair feels great. So far I am pleased. I&#x27;ll update you as months go by on results. I also have before pics for a real comparison.</li>
    <li> smells great and leaves hair feeling clean and full of body. Hard to get a good lather though.  Just started using it so I can&#x27;t report on long term use.  I&#x27;m really hoping this will stop my hair loss and actually rejuvenate for new hair growth.  My twin sister has used it for  3 months and has lots of new growth popping up.  I&#x27;m hopeful and excited to see the results.</li>
    <li> Really great product leaves my hair smooth, can&#x27;t wait to see the results in 3 months</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about 6 months and I have seen some changes in my hair growth in the areas where it was beginning to thin. It was a very slow process in the beginning as I was anxious to see a change, quite rapidly. After daily use and using only organic chemicals I am starting to finally see a different in hair growth and volume. Male, early 30&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only shampooed with this for about a week or so, and even in that short time I can&#x27;t believe the amazing results!  My thin limp hair is now thicker, more manageable and there is very little falling out.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Just starting using the shampoo last week. I already see positive change. I have much less falling hair. My hair feels very soft and smells wonderful. I am so glad I gave it a try. I would like to continue using this product for a long term.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Took 3-4 weeks to notice results, but has slowed my hair loss considerably. Using one pump at a time, a bottle lasts me 3 months. A very good value.</li>
    <li> This snarled my hair beyond belief. I cannot use this. I used it three times and each time, I ended up spending 10 to 15 minutes trying to get all of the snarls out of my hair. I ended up losing more hair because of this shampoo. The second and third times, I ended up using a conditioner and that only helped a little. Really sad. I have never had my hair with snarls before and the only thing I changed was using this shampoo. I don&#x27;t know how this has received 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Just started but seems to clean well.</li>
    <li> My shampoo just arrived and tried ir an it seems to leave my hair more shinny and silky. Will write another review to see if it really works</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks already and seen a big improvement!! glad my friend recommend it to me. I had really thin spots but not anymore my hair is getting thicker and fuller.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly as promised. Since I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for over a week now I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is very soft and fuller looking! The only thing that took a little getting used to  was the herbal scent. It is not unpleasant, I&#x27;m just used to perfumie scented shampoos. My girlfriend even asked me what I was using on my hair because it was very shiny!! I highly recommend this shampoo and will definitely be buying this shampoo again!!</li>
    <li> Quality Product.  I would recommend it.  Very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this product, going by positive reviews thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;Washed my hair following directions, towel blotted, looked snarly and felt gummy. Tried to comb through with my rake comb, it was not happening. Even without conditioner my comb will glide down my hair shaft.  Not with this shampoo.  I actually lost a few hairs in the process,more than normal. So for me it was definately not an anti-hairloss formula.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have tried several other brand and prefer this one to all. Many due to the increased hair I&#x27;ve seen as a result of combining this product with the use of my low level laser treatment. You absolutely have to have a good DHT blocker if you want to get ahead of thinning hair. Mine is on the front of my head which is typically the hardest to treat. One of my bottles did arrive with a damaged non-functioning pump, but overall I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the wonderful product is very soft and smelled my hair became like silk</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this product. I am taking a variety of medications and noticed a few small patches of hair loss. I freaked out and was desperate to find a quality product with organic ingredients. I had used Pura D&#x27;ors Argan oil in the past. This shampoo seems very promising., so far. It smells nice., was packaged beautifully and arrived very quickly. I am hoping to see excellent results based on the quality ingredients and reputation of this brand.</li>
    <li> Shampoo  when used as directed seem to slow shedding to minimal hairs.  Went from 5 or more in my hand after raking it through my wet hair to 1 or none.  Took about a week to see results.  Smell was fine, no funky odor.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I first found this product on groupon. I tried it and I was impressed with the results. After I finished, I ordered another bottle. This product leaves my hair soft and my dandruff problem is virtually gone.  Since I have been using this product, I don&#x27;t see as much hair falling out like it was before I used the shampoo. I will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old now. When I was 33, I lost one third of my hair for a disease. Since then, I have tried various medicines and shampoos to grow new hair. But, honestly saying, all of these failed to solve my problem. It made me crazy and felt very bad when everybody laughed at me. My older brother noticed my anxiety and talked with me about my problem. After a week, he gave me an organic product which is an organic anti-hair loss shampoo. I have been using it just for 2 months. Actually, I haven’t regained my lost hair within the first month, but I decided to use this product regularly because it prevents my hair fall. And, now I notice new hair and they’re becoming dark day by day. How amazing!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews at all, but for this one I must say: it REALLY works. My hair was falling insanely, so I&#x27;ve started using this product, and it has just dramatically reduced just a couple days later. Also, it smells just great and makes my hair really soft. It would be great even if it were a normal shampoo, so I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Four stars because its a great product, but the price makes a four star not a 5 star in terms of a bargain. Shampoo has a beautiful lather and a nice smell. Hair is noticeably thicker although it does dry up my scalp. I think I see a difference in thickness but you have to be consistent.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing . I only used one week,It reduces the loss of my hair and Improved my hair Make them more flexible and supple..</li>
    <li> The shampoo does not leave your hair with volume after using it.  The smell is not so bad as others claim.  However, your hair will not smell scented/ refreshed like other shampoos after using it.  So far I have not seen any hair growth or thickness increase, but I have also only been using it for three weeks.  The label says two months of use is the minimum length to see results.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel really good and soft. Will continue to use this product thoroughout my natural hair journey!</li>
    <li> I tried and been using this for two weeks.. it works! my hair does not fall at all while shampooing.. I will order again..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only using this product for a week but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my hair has more body and feels more naturally healthy. I&#x27;m 53 and my hair started thinning about 3 years ago and I&#x27;ve tried just about every shampoo and conditioner out there including Nioxin and Perfect Hair. This beats those and then some based on the fact that there are no harsh chemicals and my hair feels stronger and looks thicker. I believe the chemicals in those other shampoos do more damage than good. It does take some getting used to as it doesn&#x27;t suds up as quickly as the products with sulfates and glycols but its worth the minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Only 2 weeks into using the shampoo and I love it. Clean from scalp to ends. Will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> it is amazing , this product really work, I least worked very well in me. I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it one week, but even if it turns out not to stop hair loss, I probably will continue to use it.  My hair  changed in two uses to not feeling damaged and does appear to have more volume. It&#x27;s softer, shinier, and way less frizzy.  Nothing else I have ever used has done that.&lt;br /&gt;  It has now been a year since I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo.  It definitely did stop my hair loss and I began to grow new hair at my temples.  It did nothing for my son though.  All in all I will continue to use the shampoo.  I like the all natural ingredients and it has definitely improved my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product just for a week, but I have already see my hair is getting better. My hair is less oily as before, and is getting thicker and stronger. I stop losing hair. That&#x27;s wonderful! I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. It really works.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It smells great,  doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and really seems to work. My hair loss is very minimal, I have just about finished my 1st bottle, and I can tell the difference. I do take a supplement along with an over the counter scalp treatment for hair loss as well, but I was doing this before I started using this product. Even my stylist thought my hair felt thicker. Love it so much I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! You can see &amp; feel the difference it makes with your hair after just the first use. My hair is definitely healthier, shinier, thicker, &amp; more manageable from using Pura d&#x27;or. $40 well spent!</li>
    <li> It is obvious from the shampoo&#x27;s viscosity and smell that the ingredients are of high quality.</li>
    <li> My hair loos fuller and not loosing too much hair anymore..This is my second bottle..so happy with the results...smells great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement.still i can see lots of dandruff in my head.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for past 20 days no improvement.</li>
    <li> It made my hair really soft!</li>
    <li> Both my husband and my son are using this product and they say their hair feels fuller, softer and healthier. It is the best shampoo they have ever used.</li>
    <li> Being a sales person, I know the importance of being presentable. Every sales person is well aware of the fact that, every time the first impression stays forever as usually it becomes the last impression. The only thing that was blocking my sales success is my thick hair. No matter how well I dressed myself up, less percentage of hair is something that was hampering my look. I was really in need of a professional help that could solve my problem. At that time, my elder brother suggested me to use this product called, Pura d&#x27;or premium anti-hair loss shampoo. After applying it for a month, my hair falls stopped permanently. Though, it took time to grow new hair, but the shampoo stopped my hair fall almost in no time. It builds a strong defense against my hair fall.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product for 1 week so can&#x27;t really say if it will regrow lost hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers well. I am not a fan of the smell but it is tolerable. Overall, the shampoo cleans the hair well. It is also good to know that it is 100% organic.</li>
    <li> Update: It&#x27;s been almost 5 months since my first review below. I use this product while taking Biotin supplements. I like how soft my hair feels so I believe it&#x27;s much less harsh then the common shampoo sold in stores. I wash my hair daily, I do not use cream rinse and I have hard water. I have short hair and this bottle is lasting forever. Still about 3/4 full. After the first three months I did not notice much difference in the thickness of my hair. However after 4 months and now 5 months I can honestly say my hair is not as thin as it was when I started using this product. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will order a bottle for my mother. I give it 5 stars because I believe it has improved my hair and it does as advertised  - Anti-Hair Loss although it might also help to grow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received product yesterday. I read the instructions and applied. Suggested you leave on for at least 2 minutes.  Just a little bit produces a lot of lather. Smell is unique but pleasant. I felt the current condition of my hair would be a good test. It&#x27;s has become finer and / or thinner with age but no bald spots. Instruction also state you should give product three months for results to show. I&#x27;ll share results after three months. Four stars for now because I liked the lather it produced and the smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for my thin hair, and this is the first time I have ever wanted to write a review. Much to my skepticism, this shampoo really works. I am not sure if it is because it seems to clean my hair better or because of the chemicals are blocking the DHT, but hair is feeling and looking better the more I use it. For as long as I have hair to wash, I plan on using this shampoo. At this point, that looks like it may be for a long time. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Excellent product ... I&#x27;m seeing results.. thanks</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think a single miracle product exists to reverse or delay the inevitable hair loss, but I do think using a combination of multiple products is the best bet to holding onto one of the last things that that shows my youthfulness, my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a background, a few years ago I started losing hair at a more rapid pace, with all the evidence clear for display in my bathroom sink. I then attempted to do what I could to prevent hair loss as much as possible, so I decided to stack several products that have been shown to slow the hair loss process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I use, and what has noticeably helped:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplementation:&lt;br /&gt;Hairomega 3-in-1 DHT Blocking, Nutrient Providing, Circulation Improving Supplement for Hair Loss or Hair Thinning&lt;br /&gt;Now Foods Saw Palmetto Extract 320 mg - 90 Softgels (yes, I double up on Saw Palmetto)&lt;br /&gt;Optimum Nutrition Opti-Men Supplement, 150 Count&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Care/Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label), 16 Fluid Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stack for about a year, and I have noticed significantly less hairs in my bathroom sink, so I’m going to continue this stack as it’s worked well for me. It did appear that by using the shampoo yielded pretty fast results in less hairs in the sink. The quality of this shampoo is top-notch, not greasy, smelly, oily, and leaves me hair clean. I use it every day, and don&#x27;t have any sign of dandruff. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo.  I bought it because of all the reviews and that it helped thin, fine hair.  Maybe I need to continue to use it beyond the month or so I did use it.  I didn&#x27;t notice much difference either way.  I combat my fine, thin hair with other products to make it appear that it has volume.</li>
    <li> Ive been using for my thin scalp, and of course nothing growing fuller/thicker. I am not in early stages, Im 41 and in the mid balding stages. It does have a nice aroma and is all natural which is great, but theres no way Im paying $30 for a shampoo again.</li>
    <li> The product seems fine, although it&#x27;s too early to tell since I got it three days ago. Just keep in mind that it can get stuck in customs, like my previous order did. I was never able to get it released, because customs was requesting patent information, which I don&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than six months. I can say that my scalp feels healthy and my hair is diffidently fuller. A great product that I will continue using.</li>
    <li> Tried it last night without conditioner, made the hair nice and soft with good color. Like the fact there are no SLS or other chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;As for hair loss – need at least 3 months to really tell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks and  I still see some hair loss but I like the way that it gives my hair body and I will continue use for a few more weeks in hope that it will stop my hair from falling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for seven months.  No change whatsoever in hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients can&#x27;t get any better if your looking for Natural hair are this is it!</li>
    <li> Wow.. My friend told me about Pura d,or products and I&#x27;m glad he did.. My 2nd use of the shampo and my hair feels so much better and fuller. Look forward to the results I&#x27;ll begin to receive after 3 months.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo after my twin sister bought it for her boyfriend who was concerned with hair loss. I had a japanese digital perm twice last year, and my hair looked damaged and dull. I tried Kevin Murphy products, but they didn&#x27;t help. I had pretty healthy hair before the perm, and wanted to return their health. I bought this shampoo in March, and on the first week it dried my hair up a little. I continued to use it anyway, and they started to look much much better. 5 stars from me</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know the long term results of this product but so far so good. My hair definitely feels a lot fuller and looks glossier and healthier. I&#x27;m excited to see the longer term results of this shampoo. Also love that it&#x27;s made using organic ingredients... no sulfates. Pricey but worth it if it really works.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair drier and more fly away.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. Its reasonably priced for what ya get in my opinion. The ingredients are quality, the smell is nice, the results are real.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;m only in my late 20s i want to do everything I can to prevent hair loss. A friend recommended this product to me and now I mix it in with my daily  shampoo to  help give my hair a natural boost of health and shine. Yes it&#x27;s a little pricey, but compared to other products out there you can&#x27;t beat that it&#x27;s all natural and safe!</li>
    <li> I love this product, my cousin gave me one bottle as a gift, at that time mhy hair was losing but after i have used this shampoo, my hair wasnt losing like it was before, also i have noticed growth in my hair after using this shampoo, thats why i have ordered another bottle. thanks for making this nice shampoo!!!</li>
    <li> classic shampoo, always leaves hair soft and smelling amazing.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product i feel like it made my hair fair so much more noticeably thicker and i am exctied to be using it again</li>
    <li> Just amazing. You will see the results after a month or so but its so worth it. Obviously this shampoo needs to be supplemented with a healthy diet and lots of water, amino acids, omega 3 fatty acids, zinc and selenium, which are crucial ingredients for healthy hair growth. I followed a vegetarian diet and ate of fruits and vegetables while using this shampoo twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to people who are looking for a simple cure to thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I have experienced thinning hair lately so when I ordered this product I was hopeful but skeptical, particularly the price.  But I have heard nothing but good things about argan oil.  But after using it I have found that my hair just feels different .... softer, smoother and just plain healthier.  I am using it now exclusively and  have gotten comments from friends wondering if I have a new stylist.  I just smile.</li>
    <li> Great product! I can already tell a difference.</li>
    <li> I think it might be helping?... I&#x27;ve been using the blue label for over a year and have seen less overall hair loss. I am just now trying the gold label...</li>
    <li> I have Celiac Disease which was misdiagnosed/ treasted for several years and caused alarming hairloss whenever I had a flair-up. In my attempt to stop and hopefully reverse my hairloss, I have tried a large number of hairloss products, including most of the top physician recommended/ customer reviewed shampoos. Even though this product is very expensive, I decided to try it because it is the only product that is organic; contains all of the top scientifically proven hair loss preventing ingredients; and does not contain parabens, SLS, preservatives, or any other health hazardous chemicals. Although I have not been using it long enough to comment on it hairloss prevention ability, this is the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair soft, manageable, and full of volume. I have been looking for an organic shampoo for a while now and glad that I found this one. My hair has been thinning for the past two years due to hypothyroidism so I am anxious to see the benefits of the anti-hair loss formula.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Love the all natural ingredients. Not harsh on your hair at all. This is all I will buy from now on!</li>
    <li> I just used this product three times. I feel comfortable after using it. My hair becomes soft, and it seems increased volume a little. For the thin hair line area, I still don&#x27;t see obvious result yet. I am going to continuously use it, and write a review when I see improvement in this area.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just wishful thinking, but it does seem like it made my hair feel thicker.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.  I have been experiencing hair loss for over 20 years.  I have tried so many hair loss--hair growth treatments over the years,I cannot even begin to count them all. One thing I can say for certain, is the ones that are more natural, have been had the best  overall effectiveness, and leave my hair in the best condition.  I was somewhat skeptical of trying this Pura d&#x27;or product, because I had never heard of it--only found it by doing a search on Amazon for hair shampoos for thinning hair.  Boy, has this been a pleasant surprise.  Not only did it diminish my hair loss from the first week, it leaves my hair in the most soft and manageable condition.  I did not even try the conditioner with it--which I will buy next, but I have seen dramatic inprovement in all aspects of the condition of my hair.  I have even been swimming in a public pool several times since beginning to use the product, and I am still so impressed with the condition. I have seen MUCH less hair loss at every washing.  I am now waiting to see regrowth.  I have only been using for a little over 1 month.  I would highly recommend for anyone desiring to try a product that is healthy, organic, and is designed to deal with hair loss.  It has been a true find for me.</li>
    <li> Found a new favorite!</li>
    <li> Well,&lt;br /&gt;Initially my roommate is using this shampoo for 2 years now.. had decent reviews for it..so thought ill give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It better than the convential hard shampoo,..reduces hair loss to an extent and doesn&#x27;t worsen the situation.</li>
    <li> Actually seems to do what is claims.  My hair is definitely stronger and seems healthier.  Seems to have strengthened my hairline a bit, as well.</li>
    <li> Normally my wife use the cheaper blue bottle of the same brand. This time she likes to try a higher level one, her initial feedback is that it is a bit too thick/ condensed compare to the blue bottle so she has to mix them together to use.</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve read the 1 star reviews before purchasing this. I thought it would actually help my hair loss since I&#x27;ve heard good things about argon oil. When I first put it on I noticed the smell. It wasn&#x27;t awful but it wasn&#x27;t nice either. Even my friend noticed that my hair smelled different and not in a very good way. It also didn&#x27;t help. I actually noticed that I got more dandruff. I used for about 2 to 3 weeks. Then I got an email saying I would get a free bottle if I gave a good review. That&#x27;s when I knew I had just wasted $40! :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a week and love it so far. There are so many ingredients that are good for the hair. I doubt that this will cure my hairloss, but I feel confident that it is sure helping  the cause. My hair feels great after the shower. I let it soak for about 5 minutes. This is by far the best shampoo I have bought. Looking forward to what it will do to my hair in the coming months.</li>
    <li> Helped me a whole bunch for thinning/balding!!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 1 mo now.  The product goes on easily, lathers well, and leaves refreshing tingling sensation on your scalp for about a minute or so after application.  (Recommended wait time is 2 min)  The foam subsides while waiting, and rinses off easily and does not leave any residue.  Overall I like the product but it did not have much of an effect on hair loss.  My hairline is maintained but has not gotten better.  Hopefully I will update with better news.</li>
    <li> The hair on the back of my head started thinning and I was already thinking about what I would do with my hair if I got a really bald spot. Shave it all off, trim it really short or comb my remaining hair over it.&lt;br /&gt;But no worries! I got this anti-hair loss shampoo, followed the instructions as provided and my bald spot has stopped expanding!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works so good that sometimes I even think the spot is shrinking.</li>
    <li> I have only had the shampoo for three weeks. The smell is definitely enjoyable. It gets me going in the morning. My hair does feel softer but it&#x27;s too soon to see how effective the shampoo will be. I&#x27;ll update this review later.</li>
    <li> I AM PLEASED TO HAVE THIS PRODUCT AND THE AFTER A MONTH USING  THE RESULTS ARE SHOWING UP!!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Pura d&#x27;or Premium, and I LOVE IT. I have had a noticeable difference in my hair growth and overall health in just a matter of months. This bottle also last a really long time, so it is well worth the price because it works. I will continue to order this product and have recently tried other Pura d&#x27;or products and have been equally pleased.</li>
    <li> I love&lt;br /&gt;that this product is organic. I&#x27;ve used it several times switching from an very expensive shampoo and I am very happy with the results so far my hair looks fabulous.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife an she loves it. She has bought it a few times since. To be honest I have started using it and my wife has said my hair feels thicker. So I guess we both love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a month now, four to five times a week.  Although it is too soon to see results as far as hair regrowth I am happy with the results I am experiencing.  My hair is no longer dry looking but shiny and manageable, itching is a thing of the past, and I have noticed a slow down in hair loss.</li>
    <li> Order went smooth and I got the product as described.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for for a few weeks now. I don&#x27;t expect changes that fast but it seems like my hair does react well to the new shampoo (I have a very sensitive scalp), and my impression is that I have been losing slightly less hair than before.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I have so many issues with my hair since college. I tried a lot of products to solve hair problem. This item can be the best treatment for my hair loss problem. I totally agree with you to choose this product to protect and prevent your hair.</li>
    <li> This is what i am looking for and it really works on me. WOW</li>
    <li> Have been satisfied thus far with the shampoo.  Have not used it long enough to get new hair growth.  The oil in the shampoo makes my hair soft without using conditioner.</li>
    <li> I dread going to the bathroom for a shower and wet my hair.  My meds make me lose 50 to 100 hairstrands a day, which is way beyond the normal shedding.  I was already in a panic mode.  But as soon as I use this shampoo, the shedding seemed to put in a screeching halt.  I dont shed like a dog anymore.  Though I still lose strands on a daily basis, it is not as worrying as it used to be.  I hope this miracle shampoo will hold its really promising start and I intend to keep this shampoo for good!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo!  Hair loss is slowing.  Want to continue using to see better effects!</li>
    <li> I have been using now daily for about a month. The bottle indicates to give it 3 months so I did just buy my second bottle. I&#x27;m willing to give it the chance to work. Unfortunately, so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any less shedding and I don&#x27;t see any new growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for 6 months, and this is my third purchase. My hair seems thicker and stronger, and has much less fall out. It is not very significant difference, but it works somehow in my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a female, age 56, with thinning hair due to heredity and aging. Before using this shampoo, I collected a quarter-sized &amp;#34;nest&amp;#34; of hair from my shower drain every time I washed my hair. Within a week, the amount of hair loss was down to just a few hairs. I also notice less hair shedding after brushing. My hair looks shiny and healthy. I can not determine whether the change is due to less breakage or less shedding from the scalp, but I love the fact that I am hanging on to the hair that I have any way I can!</li>
    <li> Just after one use i can feel the difference. hair looks thicker and fuller, amazing product.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo in the market. After using the shampoo for one week I noticed my hair becoming thick and silky. I recommend using along with the pura d&#x27;or conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very good. I have used it several times. I felt my hair is getting soft. At least it’s organic, and is good to you and to our earth.</li>
    <li> Been using for a month----LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hair has stopped falling out. Hair is softer, feels very clean. Highly recommend this product!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> love the smell and how it makes my hair feel.  i do not have to shampoo every day as my hair do not get oily the very next day.  i still see some hair in my drain and after shower so not sure how it is impacting my hair fall but will continue for atleast 3 months to see the full result.  will update my review then.</li>
    <li> I have been using the blue label hair loss shampoo for about a year now. While my hairfall has stopped significantly, the shampoo had always left my hair very dry. Tried the gold label and have been using it for a week now, it feels like my hair is not as dry as it used to be before. Like it so far and would prefer this over the blue label.</li>
    <li> Omg it makes your hair soft and silky, its great!</li>
    <li> Love this! Great quality product!</li>
    <li> Work good. My hair fall reduced after using it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I just ordered my third bottle. I had thinning hair due to stress and using shampoos with harsh chemicals. My hair got thicker within months of using this shampoo. I highly recommend this product. Cheers! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product and tried it for more than 5 months, but I don&#x27;t see any major difference. And second bottle is very dilute .</li>
    <li> It works! New hair growth only after one month! I will order again!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Mild smell&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair looking smooth&lt;br /&gt;I do seem to have less breakage after using it for a couple of months, but I&#x27;ve been doing some other diet-related things too so it&#x27;s hard to say what&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t lather much so you feel like you have to use a lot&lt;br /&gt;Wet hair feels a bit dried out right after rinsing, so you need a lot of conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great Ingredient profile with a scent that is pleasantly natural.  I have just started to use it and look forward to healthier hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shampoo I have ever used. It help to stop my help loss. My hair looks much healthier in one use.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago just to see if it would have any effect on my hair loss. I have noticed that it does make my hair a lot thicker, which is nice. I also like the tingly and clean feeling I get when I use it. It&#x27;s probably going to take a while before I can say that it stops/reverses hair loss, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the product. Still, if you notice your hair loss early, and you combine this with a Saw Palmetto + Beta Sitosterol + Silica regimen, you should be able to keep your hair for a while longer.</li>
    <li> Great hair loss shampoo.  I have tried many of the hair loss shampoos and this one is my  favorite so far.  Nice smell, lathers well and hair feels clean nice afterwards.  Not greasy or oily.  Using this shampoo along with a hair and nails vitamin and hair feels thicker with some new hairs coming in.  Expensive but a little seems to go a long way compared to some of the other shampoos I have used.  I will definitely purchase this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Been using it for only a few days and can already feel the textural difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks so far and i&#x27;m very pleased with the results so far. Not only does my hair feel clean and look healthier than before, but my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch anymore like it used to and there is less hair fall out.  I love the all natural ingredients and like the natural scent too! I can feel the tingling sensation when i use it and it feels very refreshing. You can really sense the quality of this product when you use it. I will continue to use this product :)</li>
    <li> Have being using it for 3 days. My hair feels good right now and I really like the smell. I will wait longer to see further result. Excited!</li>
    <li> Got a M shape hair style since the beginning of my Ph.D. studies. Situation became worse and worse since it greatly influence my social activities. Introduced by one budy in my department, this product has been my friend shapoo for two and half years. Hair at least remain the M style without further fading. Some small hairs begin to grow after 8 months usage. Definitely going to use it before I can find any trustworthy hair growth product.</li>
    <li> I purchased Pura d&#x27;or premium Organic Anti-Hair Los shampoo three weeks ago.  I have less loss and my hair seems thicker.  I have very thin hair, but with this product it actually feels denser.  I would recommend it to everyone with thinning hair. It is not a heavy creamy shampoo, so it does not weigh my hair down.  my only issue is the scent.  It has a peppery scent, but that is probably due to the organic ingredients.  I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am a 30 year old man who has experienced a lot of stress as a worker, my hair became thin and it was turning gray. I.have found Pura d&#x27;or Gold - Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo which has made a big difference from all other products out there.  Thank You - K. Edward</li>
    <li> This is the worst decision I have ever made. Going bald at the age of 22 is the worst thing one can go through in today&#x27;s society. I have to wear a hat everywhere I go because society is cruel and treats &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; people differently.  This company preys on people like me who are desperate to try anything that may help stop or slow down hair loss. After using this product for just 3 days, my hair shed like crazy.  It was devastating.  It really made things far worse than if I had just done nothing. Please listen to me when I say that I know what it is like to feel ugly because of hair loss. Trust me, this shampoo makes it worse.  These people ought to be ashamed of themselves for claiming that it is a proven formula.  The only reason I even bought this crap was because there are so many 5 star reviews saying how great it is.  Little did I know that if you give them a 5 star rating you get a free bottle.  That is why there are so many 5 star reviews.  This shampoo set me back months of careful dieting and water-only showers that slowed down my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, the only way I know of to slow down hair loss is by not using shampoo at all. Your hair will smell a little bit for the first week, so clear your schedule if you try this, but after a week there you hair literally smells like nothing after washing your hair with just water.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE LISTEN TO ME! DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!</li>
    <li> Since I use a combination of this shampoo + minoxidil + finasteride + biotin, I can&#x27;t really tell yet if it works. I will update with results later, if any.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a shampoo. It serves cleansing purpose. I don&#x27;t believe it can serve as much as a medical remedy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on second battle now. Good shampoo, see some hair growth. The only inconvenience is that you have to close your eyes and keep them shut for two minutes while shampooing, but this is very minor. Otherwise I&#x27;m still very happy.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the shampoo. First was decent.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and my skin is wonderful after I purchased this product, impressive!!</li>
    <li> Great seller and quality product. Highly recommended. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have hair loss due to hormonal imbalance, been using this shampoo for 4 weeks, so far I see less loss of hair during my shower. it is making hair smooth and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping my hair volume and reducing the amount of shedding I was previously experiencing. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this Pura d&#x27;or gold label shampoo past 4 months, experiencing a great result. I have tried so many different products over the years, but NO good result and this is the shampoo that has really great ingredients to fight against hair loss. THANKS PURA D&#x27;OR :)</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is 100% functional. I Recommended!</li>
    <li> Ime editing my review like others said this is not the same product that use to be very good. Try bosley but use both the shampoo and conditioner even if your a guy the conditioner left on for 4 or 5 minutes before rinsing will help strengthen your hair and help with volume and thickness the shampoo it self may dry your hair a bit and does a good job but it&#x27;s a 2 step system for a reason</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo along with the blue label for years. I love it! When I run out, and have to go back to any store bought shampoo, I can immediately feel the difference (hair falls completely flat). Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> it is a great shampoo! i love it!</li>
    <li> Best Product for any hair!</li>
    <li> I can cee something different happened to my husband now，his head no longer looks oil，it keeps his head clean all day，ok to tough now，and we can see some new tiny hair is growing，feel so great now，and expect to see what going to be。</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month and I do believe my hair is growing in thicker and I don&#x27;t notice as much hair loss as I did before.  I&#x27;m grateful this works for me.</li>
    <li> High quality shampoo that can create much lather with just a small amount of product.  It makes my hair feel thicker and softer with no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for many years and made the switch to this shampoo. I have to say the texture and volume of my hair has improved..will continue to use this..  Very happy with results. I also take DHT Blockers, do rosemary oil a few times a week and take Biotin along organic superfood meals.</li>
    <li> Good product. One of the better shampoos I have tried. Have noticed a slight slowing in hair loss, but no product will work magic.</li>
    <li> I have not used long enough to see a difference, but great quality ingredients. Has a fairly strong smell of Tea Tree Oil, but not overpowering. A little goes a long way, I always washes twice and rinses clean. Will update if I see a difference down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: January 13, 2015. I have been using for a little over a month and really like the shampoo. The tree-tree oil smell can be a little strong at times, but I use the shampoo for both hair and face cleaner. No difference in the difference of thickness, but have hair has been thinning for decades, so did not expect miracles. As a shampoo I have really clean, oil free hair, but does not feel dried out. As a face cleaner, I get a really clean face, use it to shave and do not end up with a dry, tight face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this - a really nice, neck up cleaner!</li>
    <li> My hair looks so much fuller.  I have very think hair and I can noticeably see the difference in the thinning areas.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to know how much it will help hair loss, but it is the first shampoo I have tried in a year that does not leave my hair feeling dry immediately after washing. I do not even need conditioner. I am so happy I found this product. I am a 40 year old female who has been losing hair for a year (I bought the product on my husband&#x27;s account). I will give an update in a few months regarding my progress.</li>
    <li> Wow! I think my hair is stuck over my head with an iron glue! Not even one hair is shedding from my head!</li>
    <li> very happy with this product! i had a significant hair loss due to a surgery and was afraid of putting any products in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;after researching this product and the conditioner, i ordered them both and am very happy with them. Cleans well, gentle on my hair, and i am happy to report significant hair re-growth! even my hair dresser commented on how healthy my hair is and she has recommended it to other clients as well!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really the best organic shampoo for thinning hair. After using it for a month, it has visibly reduced the amount of hair loss. I see less hair during shampoo and combing after that. It also makes the hair very soft and smooth. It is not at all harsh on hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching a solution to my hair loss for years, I can say that I don&#x27;t need to search anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does what it says. Great product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this shampoo. It keeps my hair smooth and soft, and it seems to actually help with my dry scalp too, since it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the nasty sulfates and sodiums in so may other shampoos. Great product!</li>
    <li> It helps a lot with my hair loss. No fly aways and very good,do not dry my hair at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Does wonders for my skin and hair. Definitely recommended to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it all the time and my hair looks amazing and is much thicker and fuller.</li>
    <li> Good product. Organic shampoo that you can trust! I bought this along with the hair, face and skin argan oil, and loved it so much for my face that I forgot to use it on my hair.  Will be trying that next!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this shampoo already. Makes my hair look thicker and more healthy. It also smells great.</li>
    <li> Sincerely there is no obvious improvement. Maybe I need to use one more bottle. Hope this bottle starts to work.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo. Really helps with hair loss.</li>
    <li> Smells neutral so this shampoo is good for both male or female users.  After using this product for a few days, I can notice my baby thin hair has more body and volume.  Even the ingredient has argan oil, I don&#x27;t feel my hair becomes oily at all.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this shampoo because I felt like my hair was coming out in big clumps whenever I showered or brushed my hair and felt like it was getting thinner.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for two months now and I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is coming out as much as it used to.  It has a great smell and makes my hair feel really clean.  I used to have to use a dry scalp shampoo but using this product I don&#x27;t need that.  My hair feels a little thicker like it is growing back.  I am pretty happy with this shampoo so far.  The bottle says that you need to use it for at least 3 months to notice a significant change, and since I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple, I gave it 4 stars for now.</li>
    <li> So far, this product has seemed to at least slowed down my hair loss.  I haven&#x27;t seen experienced new hair growth but I don&#x27;t think this product advertises new growth.  Overall, I do like the way my hair feels and a little does go a long way.  This bottle should last many months and  although it may not be proven, I feel all the chemicals in cheaper shampoos can&#x27;t be good for my hair in the long run.</li>
    <li> My hair has been start falling for 2 months after I stat a diet.  I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks. My hair is falling less and less by this week. my hair looks more healthier and shinier. I will recommend this shampoo to any one.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on my hair and scalp. My main concern for getting this shampoo was to keep my hair clear of dht build up and preserve what I have. I can&#x27;t say how it&#x27;s going with that right now but, I can say it moisturize and softens my hair. I don&#x27;t need the conditioner afterwards but I just use it anyway because I have it. Overall this is a great product and I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Its been almost 2weeks since I started using Pura d&#x27; Gold Argan Oil Shampoo- as of now I could see it working good for the first two weeks and will have to continue for the rest duration...In the first 3-4 days I could not see any result- I was having hair fall as regular while having my hair washed but as days past by I see it reducing. Overall I feel good as of today....</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! I had been washing my hair with Creme of Nature Argan oil shampoo, but a friend of mine suggested that I give Pura d or Argan oil shampoo a try.  Her hair is so thick and beautiful, so it only made sense for me to take her advice. This shampoo is much more expensive, but my hair thanks me for it. I can definitely feel the difference. My hair is much more manageable, has nice body and beautiful luster. Even better, it is truly an all natural product.</li>
    <li> Great product that is effective over a period of time. Made in USA with premium benefits including lack of harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> The product lathers up quite well and has very little smell to it. It does thicken up the hair well and a little seems to go a long way. You do need to take time with it cause you need to leave it in for 2 mins. That may be the only downfall to it, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s to be sure it gets into the scalp and starts working on it. It is pricey but overall it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> good product, it&#x27;s very helpful.</li>
    <li> it does wonders for my hair</li>
    <li> Too soon to see results, but my boyfriend can feel it tingling on his scalp when he uses it so we&#x27;ll see what happens!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. Been using it for a few weeks and already has helped with preventing hair loss</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo can fight against hair loss. I already use this more than two weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot. i feel my scalp is getting better.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing uncomfortable is that,this shampoo doesn&#x27;t make much bubble.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s not a big deal. I am looking forward my hair come back^^</li>
    <li> Bad shampoo no good at all ...!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but boy does it deliver! I&#x27;m a 54 year old male, and after having a full head of hair until my mid 40&#x27;s, am now experiencing thinning. I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos that claim to thicken thinning hair, but this by far has given me the desired results.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed less hair falling out and my hair appears to be slightly thicker. I find that I only need to use the shampoo and do not need conditioner.  I&#x27;m glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> This product is a scam, I highly suggest you read a lot of the bad reviews and look into the validity of the good reviews before you make the same mistake I did.</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money. I am a male and go through about one bottle per year because this stuff is so effective. Even if it does not grow back hair, it is the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now.  First time ordering it in Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 2 weeks now and it definitely makes my hair feel thicker and softer. I love that it&#x27;s all natural as I&#x27;m shifting to products with less terrible things in them.</li>
    <li> Feels great and very light. being that its all natural definitely makes you feel more confident that this product is better for your hair than other products.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good, clean hair and healthy scalp after using for a week.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo for a few months, I can honestly say that it is 100% worth it. Prior to using this shampoo, I had been using Fortalex PT&#x27;s shampoo for about 8 or 9 months. Fortalex is double the price of Pura d&#x27;or, and Pura d&#x27;or works just as well, if not better, than Fortalex. I&#x27;d also like to note that the ingredients in this shampoo compared to Fortalex&#x27;s seem to be more beneficial for strengthening and/or promoting new hair growth. I was concerned about how the Argan oil would leave my hair feeling, but there was no need for that. It does not leave hair feeling greasy whatsoever. It smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is NOT a magic serum for growing hair where it has already fallen out. However, it will help maintain the hair that is still there. It also seems to give hair a nice shine while thickening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer worry about my slightly receding hairline, and I have the use of this shampoo to thank. My hair seems to be thicker and fuller than ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and started to lose hair since late 20&#x27;s. I had to take out handful of hair off the bathtub drain while showering once a week so that water could go down. I then started using a lot of different organic hair loss shampoos such as nioxin, avalon ect, and didn&#x27;t notice great difference until I found this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one had many good reviews so decided to try it out. It smells minty-aromatic and made from organic/plant based ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I usually pump the shampoo 3 times and apply it to my wet hair while showering and gently massage/rub it with tip of my fingers across the scalp, also putting pressure on it. I then let it soak in while I brush my teeth for about 5 min, then rinse it off with warm water. After shower I gently dry hair with a towel and then leave it to full dry itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 weeks of use, I noticed a huge difference in my bathtub drain. The hair I found there got reduced to be around half of what was before using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even use any other additional conditioner with this shampoo. So at the end, it&#x27;s cheaper than other organic/hair loss shampoo+conditioner products. I really recommend it if you ever feel like you&#x27;re concerned about losing your hair.</li>
    <li> Good natural shampoo. Helped to strengthen my hair.</li>
    <li> It is really comfortable when I using this product, my painful scalp can apparently feel better off</li>
    <li> This is such an excellent product. It has definitely slowed down the thinning process and it makes my hair thicker.</li>
    <li> At 46 years of age, I have found the last year my hair has been very noticeably thinning. I found this product on line and can honestly say I have noticed a difference. The amount of hair in the drain each day has significantly decreased. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and shiney as well!!</li>
    <li> Great! After several expensive efforts to stop my thinning hair and hair loss, I decided to give it one more try with Pura d&#x27;or (Gold Label). After just two weeks, a hair stylist commented on my thick hair. It feels clean, soft, strong and beautiful. And, I don&#x27;t need a conditioner. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Simply fantastic. It does what it says. It also leaves hair feeling soft and fuller. Recommended for all!</li>
    <li> Love this product! This shampoo makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo truly works!  I noticed results just after a few days of use.  My hair is thicker and I have even received complements about my hair.  The label says continue use for 3 months to see results but I believe you will see them much sooner than that!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used the blue bottle before and it really worked. This time I am gonna to try the gold label. I heard that the gold label use the best materials. I believe it will also work. The only problem is that my hair appears kind of dry after I use this series of product.  Maybe I need to use the conditioner together. Like this one.</li>
    <li> I am very please with the Pura d&#x27;or organic shampoo. Smells great, feels awesome on my hair! Hope so see some great results after 3 month of use. I have only used for a month and I started to see some improvements.</li>
    <li> Very good product....</li>
    <li> This helps my hair loss due to stress and swimming in chlorine pools (to relieve said stress)!  I like the way this product makes my hair feel.  Clean but not stiff like the other (blue label did...although I like that one too).  I stopped using it for awhile due to cost...but couldn&#x27;t find anything I was happy with....spent just as much money trying to find something less expensive.  This bottle lasts a LONG TIME!  And quick shipping was a bonus (we live on an island in Alaska)!</li>
    <li> I have definitely seen a different in my hair group after using this shampoo. My hair grows fuller and faster.</li>
    <li> This product is very good, after several weeks&#x27; use , my hair got much thicker, and lost much less hair.</li>
    <li> I am a 15 year hair loss sufferer . I&#x27;ve tried everything , this shampoo has helped the most . I am writing after reading all the one star reviews. They all claim to have rapidly lost more hair .... THIS ACTUALLY MEANS IT WORKING.  Your hair naturally goes through shedding cycles. So your body is getting rid of all the weak hairs and new strong hairs come in after , that&#x27;s why they say wait 3 months . The shedding has happened to me and I stuck with it and I&#x27;m now on month 5 and still have a 1/4 of the bottle left and my hair is the best ever .</li>
    <li> Just ordered another bottle of Pura d&#x27;or Gold Label.  I was looking for an Anti Hair loss shampoo due to my fine/thin hair a couple months ago and came across Pura d&#x27;or Gold Label.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a shot.  Since I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Gold Label, I could not be happier.  After using it to wash your hair, your hair feels healthier and fresher than ever before.  I have been using it for over a month and can tell a major difference in my hair.  You just have to stick to using it as your new shampoo to see results.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for two weeks now. Shedding on my hair has been lessening. I will share my future experiences. Thanks Pura d&#x27;or..</li>
    <li> Have a soft feeling on my hair. It has a nice smell too. I am very happy with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was very hopeful after reading some of the reviews and bought the shampoo (and conditioner), but I have been using it for about three months now and haven&#x27;t seen much difference; I am still losing my hair and is getting thin like it would with any other shampoo. the only thing i like about this shampoo is that right after I use it, it gives a lot body/volume to my hair making it look like I have more hair than I do, but that fades within 6/8 hours and takes me right back to reality.:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am on my second bottle, after the second one is gone, I am done with it. I can probably buy something different with the same effect at my health store for a lower price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for just over a month, it&#x27;s showing potential, seems like it&#x27;ll do the trick in the suggested 3 months of use.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for about 2 mo.  Nice low sudzing and volumizing.  Use conditioner.  Rinse.  Use dhc after bath hair treatment.  2 pumps. Rinse again.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working, Or If i want I just want to believe it is.The shampoo has an interesting smell, like Tea Tree. If you have short hair it&#x27;ll last you a good while, one pump is all I need to use. I have a receding hairline and I see tiny hairs. It can either be growing or dying I suppose, and only time will tell me that. It&#x27;s not a bad shampoo though, and worth giving a try. I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners and this one doesn&#x27;t give me that much of an itchy scalp. I&#x27;ll update my review in a couple of months. Especially if and when I get a bald spot, Or a luscious mane.</li>
    <li> Lately I have been noticing that my hair is shedding and thinning out more than usual. Been using this product in combination with other shampoo. This shampoo is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; without some some of the harsh chemicals. So far so good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about a month now. Smells great, lathers great, and my hair is already starting to feel a bit fuller. Will certainly follow up at around 3 months of use (the recommended length of time to wait for noticeable results). Sure it&#x27;s a bit pricey if you&#x27;re not used to buying shampoo that&#x27;s made from natural ingredients...I haven&#x27;t a clue why it took me this long to discover using something like this instead of all the el-cheapo chemical filled shampoos you find in the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Great product. It does prevent lossing hairs, and the hairs become thicker than before~. I&#x27;ve used for nearly a month, and I gonna to see if it will help to grow the new hair.</li>
    <li> when i received the product,I use it immediately.The shampoo is transparent and smell more like drug.I have to take more to bring bubble. The scalp feels a little bit stimulation.But my hair  feel fresh and tough at the next day.Hope it can improve my hair loss.As well,if the price could be lower,it will better.</li>
    <li> product just wasn&#x27;t for me however i believe it is a quality product.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Really made my hair feel great. Makes it feel a lot more full and thick. I will continue to use and hope to see some regrowth. I would recommend this for someone who wants a quality shampoo with out the harsh ingredients.</li>
    <li> Just got it delivered and already see the difference in very first use of it. This difference is very noticeable. Above all of that  my wife is extremely happy to use it and she too feel the same great experience.</li>
    <li> My hair is medium lenght,thick and very dry and for the longest it seemed that my shampoo worsened it&#x27;s state,i washed and condition my hair with tresemme&#x27;s product and the result was soft and manageable shiny hair! Im hooked.</li>
    <li> It really helps with the loss of hair. My hair grew thinner and thinner and have noticeable loss. The situation changed after I use this product and my hair become strong and thick. That is exactly what I want.  I am very happy for this result and will be buying in the future.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing! I have used it for a while now and noticed significant improvement in thinning hair. Prior to this I used the one that came in the blue bottle which was great too - I think the only difference is that the Gold Label has organic preservatives. I highly recommend this product for men who are experiencing thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I use the shampoo for 3 months, it has different ascent, may be good one. It also helps have healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I really like it. After wash my hair, it is a little dry, but it dont have any hair loss, I was impressed. I also changed my shower head into filter shower head, that would help, too. And this product is soo good and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product. I don&#x27;t have much to say about it yet. However what I will say is that I&#x27;ve read the reviews and liked what I read so I thought hey. I have thinning hair and if it helps other&#x27;s hopefully it would help mine. In time we shall see. But for the first wash I liked how it lathered. I will give it 3 months as the bottle says and give an updated review of my progress. If all goes well I will be a return customer.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product. i use it in my conditioner, in my moisturizer, and in my body lotion! i swear it makes your hair silky and adds shine within 1-2 uses. i have really dry skin and it works wonders on my face as well- stays nice and hydrated!</li>
    <li> First off I will say that I have tried a few other shampoos to prevent hair loss or to try to regrow some areas.  While none of them are quick solutions, I have had some success with these types of products, where I have less loose hair that falls out, and I even notice some new hairs in my widows peak.  So these products do help, compared to regular shampoos, such as Head&amp;Shoulders or Suave, or whatever.  I believe my use of Head&amp;Shoulders or just liquid soap while in the military with very little hair instigated much of my hair loss.  I have the receding hair lines and a very thin patch on the back top.  So there is no reason to believe these type of shampoos are just snake oil, they do help hair growth/health.  Which one you pick is the question.  After trying about three others I was getting frustrated with the application instructions or the way the shampoo left my hair feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some are already paired with a conditioner, or others say you can use any conditioner, but I have never used conditioner before, seems like a waste of time, unless apparently you have long hair or use a shampoo that leaves your hair with a dry sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part about most of these shampoos is it tells you to put it your hair for a few minutes, then rinse and repeat for a few more minutes.  Then you can use a conditioner after that.  I am not motivated enough to put it in my hair outside the shower or turn the water on and off while standing around, and waiting with the water on is a waste (in a 5 year drought here in CA).  Aside from the all natural ingredients and helping me prevent hair loss, this is the best part about the pura d&#x27;or for me.  It says to apply once, lather and leave in for about 2 minutes then rinse and you&#x27;re done.  So you&#x27;re not wasting more of the shampoo, water, or time with reapplications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next best thing I like about this product is that it is concentrated, it only requires about half a pump for my hair which is about 2 inches long on top and tapered down.  It will last a long time and the bottle is small, and no hassle with a cap in the shower.  The first time I put a whole pump in my hair and I had suds running down all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found a couple not as favorable things about this shampoo.  To get a good quick lather it seems I need clean hair to start with.  If I do not wash my hair first the pura d&#x27;or will not lather even if I add more of it with my hair wet.  If I wash my hair first with any shampoo then the pura d&#x27;or lathers easily its wonderful.  When I say I pre-wash, its just a quick shampoo application and then immediately rinse it out, no waiting.  This could just be the way it works in my hair, because the hair is kind of thin and I sweat quite a bit, it can get a little greasy I suppose between washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed is that it leaves my hair feeling differently than I have ever felt before, almost squeaky clean, not dry, just odd to me.  Its honestly fine, and the feeling is gone once its actually dry, and I had no issues with my scalp drying out either.  To kill two birds with one stone, for my quick pre-wash that I do for reasons described above, I use a shampoo that has Moroccan oil in it.  This counteracts the squeaky clean feeling in my hair from the pura d&#x27;or.  Then I don&#x27;t use a conditioner.  If I didn&#x27;t pre-wash my hair to get the better lathering effect, then I wouldn&#x27;t bother with anything to condition the hair, because it feels fine with just this shampoo, just different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo, especially for those of us that are impatient.bout 2 inches long on top and tapered down.

    <li> My brother-in-law (29 years old), who has noticeably been balding over the last few years, has tried this product and says, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve used both the blue and gold label now. My hair became thin and began falling out. This shampoo left a clean feeling. I like it because it is organic. I have noticed my thinning areas on the scalp filling in. I believe it helps prevent your hair from falling. I am combining this with daily dose of biotin supplement and i have to say it works. After about a month, i&#x27;ve noticed baby hairs growing in the area. The difference is noticeable. I will continue to use this product and will gladly order again.\\&quot; I have seen the difference myself and am so glad that he has finally found something that has worked.</li>
    <li> I love the way this shampoo smells! It came quickly! I will review again to detail my results when I have used it more!!!</li>
    <li> Hello everyone, I ordered this item on Sunday November 2, 2014 and i received my packaged on Tuesday November 4, 2014. Two bussiness days is just a Big Thank You From Me To You. So first things first. I honestly fell in Love with the Look and Feel of the Bottle and even more the fact that it is Gold Labeled. It&#x27;s definately High Class with the Right Price i can afford. I Love the Smell of it... It&#x27;s so Pure and Delicious it Smells like Mother Nature. I know that all the ingredients listed are The Best of The Best and Proven and Current on Fighting Hair Loss and Thinning Hair. If i can give this product 100 Stars i would. I Love and Adore Pura D Or Argan Oil Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo Effective Solution For Thinning Hair. 100% Natural Preservative System. I will definitely Buy Again and Recommend to All My Friends and Families. I know this product is True and Made with a lot of Love. Thank you so much. I appreciate it a lot. Thanks once again. Your True #1 Loyal Customer. From Levi Boy.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome! My Mother liked it!</li>
    <li> used for one month, haven&#x27;t seen any resualts. But I love it</li>
    <li> So I have been using this shampoo once a day for the past 7 weeks, and I am still unsure if this actually works. The fact is that I still see reasonable hair at the bottom of the shower each time so I am still shedding. Am I shedding at a slower rate than I would without this shampoo? Maybe. Have I seen any hair regrowth or regeneration of my hairline? Absolutely not. The recommended usage time for this shampoo is 3 months before results are supposedly seen, but I am half way now and I think it should be indicative at this point whether this product actually works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am currently unimpressed, but understand that I haven&#x27;t used the product for 3 months yet, I will give it 3 stars which I think is generous particularly considering that this product is rather expensive for results that are unclear. I will be updating this review at the 3 month marker.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo daily for a month. The hair is shiny and the shedding is minimal. It is too soon to talk about regrowth but Iam expecting it too happen. I will continue using it. It is a good product</li>
    <li> so far so good, I am 45 and I think I loose my hair due to low hormones. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 week only and I think I see a difference</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few months and it is a great product. My hair feels thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been in search of an organic shampoo that had both the health benefits of being chemical free and would also address my problem of thinning hair and gradual hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product on its Facebook page when being endorsed by even celebrities I decided to try it out. Over the last 6 months I am on my 3rd bottle because the results are amazing. Not only have I stalled some of my hair loss, my hair is a lot thicker than before, make sure you leave the product in your hair for 2-3 minutes to let your hair strands obtain the full benefits of the nutrients in the Argan oil before you wash it all off. There are a lot of organic shampoos out there and hair loss shampoos but no shampoo that addresses both needs and that&#x27;s why I love this product. Make sure you also use the conditioner to get the best results!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. After 2 weeks of use, I noticed less hair loss and my scalp felt healthier. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is trying to control/ prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> Definitely a must if your hair is thinning or just thin. This shampoo is not only organic but also gets the job done I&#x27;ve noticed my hair looks fuller and also sheds less. Also this shampoo has tons of great natural oils in it that are good for hair and scalp its a must buy!</li>
    <li> I have used Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo only twice but have seen fewer hair going down the drain. It could also be because I also started taking Nutrigold Biotin Gold 5,000 mcg at the same time and Garden of Life Kind Organics Women&#x27;s Once Daily for almost a month. Some people might not like the fragrance but then store shelves are full of that crap. I have started taking care of my scalp and hair, that have been sincerely abused using hair coloring products, ironing etc, by using coconut or almond oil for massaging the scalp.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s a great value, and the bottle is nice. I apply to my skin, hair and face. I could tell it was improving my complextion and health of hair. Plan to reorder soon.</li>
    <li> I have read so many positive reviews about this and as it is organic so I decided to give a try for my hairs hoping that it would reduct my hairfall, as I had bad hairfall. This is good product I felt but it did not helped to reduce my hairfall much, but I don&#x27;t blame this product for it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great on my boyfriend it says that you get results after three months of use after one month not even amount we started seeing really good results and he is continually used it and it still works fantastic it just keeps getting better and better and unlike some products that are supposed to have some chemicals to stimulate hair growth this one does not have a horrible smell like some other products night</li>
    <li> I have used a full bottle and I&#x27;m starting the second one. What can I say so far, this shampoo is definitely doing something (good). How I came to realise this is I stopped using minox altogether for around six months due to all kinds of sides (minox is a poison quite honestly I would avoid if I could), and it kept my itching and shedding in check. As soon as I switched to another shampoo, namely Anaphase Ducray which comes from a reputable french company and it&#x27;s a pretty decent anti-hairloss shampoo, the itching oily hair with SEVERE shedding came back almost instantly, in a day or two. To me this is a clear sign that this shampoo is doing something DHT wise.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say it will stop your shedding altogether and cure your androgenic hair loss. I don&#x27;t think it is the case, but I think it will definitely help you in your quest to save as much as you can, for as long as you can. I will try a few more bottles and then update this review.</li>
    <li> It has a really good smell and after using it, I feel the hair is clean and the itching on my scurf has been relieved. And I feel it is useful for my hair-loss but I will keep using it and test the result for a long time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to any hair regrow yet as I have not had the shampoo for that long.  However, it definitely makes your hair look fuller and gives nice body and shine. Would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair dull and lifeless - would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male, mid-30&#x27;S, hair has been thinning slowly for years but it&#x27;s still fairly full, and I&#x27;d been using DS Labs revita the last few years, but recently went through a heavy shedding phase and my hair and scalp were quite dry.  Tried this product and it definitely helps lessen the dryness, and my hair feels fuller and thicker.  Can&#x27;t speak to the idea that it would regrow hair, as I&#x27;ve used for too brief a time, but overall I like it as a natural and safe product and now use it as part of my day to day regimen.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used helped with my hair loss a lot. Took some patience but so worth it. GET THIS</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a week now and I already can visibly see my hair is thicker. I have used a lot of other anti hair loss products in the past, including a bunch in the amazon best sellers and none have had this thickening effect before. The shampoo also has a pleasant smell although it does make me scalp itchy sometimes.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I used it for one month now and have seen new hair growing back.  Looking forward to trying my second bottle!</li>
    <li> Great Product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this now for 3 months and see a dramatic difference in hair fullness, regrowth, and decrease in hair loss. Scalp feels a lot cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Would highly recommend this product based on the results over the last 3 months.</li>
    <li> Its ok, not as good as the other one, Pura d&#x27; or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo (Brown and Blue)</li>
    <li> So I have been using this for about a week now...I know people have said that it take a while to see full results but I can tell you right now that the results are pretty quick.  Every time I washed my head in the morning I would keep losing hair and after one week of use I lose about 1 hair...seriously, 1 hair - it wasn&#x27;t a typo.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the conditioner just to keep my hair a little softer and I am sure that the conditioner will just add to the product.  It is expensive but I can tell you that it is worth it!  I wish I would have known about this product a long time ago and I would recommend people just using it on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this is after you use it your head feels &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;...I don&#x27;t know how to explain it but you can tell your head is clean compared to other shampoos and I have tried them all...If you are hesitant on buying it, don&#x27;t be, and if you buy it and don&#x27;t like it, send it to me... :-).</li>
    <li> Doesn’t foam up like other shampoos, but it cleaned my coconut oiled hair in one wash. My hair was very easy to untangle after use. I like this better then all the other leading organic/all natural shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> No fragrance.  Natural smell.  Perfect shampoo to keep the scalp and hair healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I came across it online and glad I did.  I feel that it has helped my hair from falling out so bad due to stress and medications.  I love that the ingredients are organic and natural.  It is a nice size bottle and lathers well.  I will be ordering my second bottle soon.</li>
    <li> This a good product. I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple weeks and it&#x27;s as good or better than the blue label Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo. When I use it I don&#x27;t notice hair falling in the bathtub when I shower (like with cheap shampoo). If you&#x27;re realistic and don&#x27;t expect this shampoo to make your hair look like it did when you were a teenager then I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied. It makes my hair look thicker, and makes it easier to manage while giving it more volume. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple months and my hair has gotten really thick and shiny. I recommend it to anyone who wants thicker hair.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely worth the price that you pay for it. After trying many shampoos I finally came across this. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. I used the blue bottle earlier and started using the golden bottle recently. I am very pleased with this shampoo. I actually can see that it helps with my hair loss and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a month but can tell the difference already! Not only does my fine hair feel thicker, I have noticed in the last week that I have less hair to pull out of my brush. Also my hair is thin in the temple area and there is an increase in hair growth there! I hope the this continues over the next few months as some reviewers say you need to give it a 3 full months to see the full benefits. I will update this post after that!</li>
    <li> The shampoo does work. I have been using for only a month and have noticed less hair loss. I also use with rogaine once my hair dries. Not happy about the price but willing to spend if it continues to work. Only thing I do not like is that it frizzes my curly hair (that&#x27;s why I put 4 stars). Then again, would deal with frizz instead of no hair. Recommend to use a conditioner. I will update later after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> Buy the blue label one instead.  The gold label has some irritant in it.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, but not a fully effective solution. At 24, I&#x27;m experiencing male pattern baldness and decided to try this out. I definitely notice that the hairloss has been slowing down with the shampoo, but not completely stopping.</li>
    <li> I have a positive feeling about this product. My wife tells me she can actually see more hair growth although it is coming in very fine, but it&#x27;s still early. I&#x27;ll raise this to 5 stars if it&#x27;s still improving in a few months.</li>
    <li> Beautiful natural ingredients. Fantasic smell!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  I have only been using it for about a month but my shedding has noticeably reduced.  It lathers good and has a decent smell.  I have shoulder length hair and I only use about 4 pumps to wash my hair so I think this bottle should last a while.</li>
    <li> I love this product,left my hair very soft and shiny and less hair loss than before,i will recommend it to other people!!!</li>
    <li> Before using Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss shampoo.......I would have twenty-thirty hairs all over my white bathroom, that I would have to vacuum everyday.  After using your shampoo for about one month now, there are possibly five-seven hairs falling out of my head, which I believe is about normal. At first thinking it was the hair products I was using, I tried switching those first. To no avail!  Pura d&#x27;or shampoo HAS made a huge difference in my hair loss.  As other reviews pointed out, I do not need hair conditioner. This shampoo is definitely a must in my shower as hormones, stress and plain old aging occurs.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I suffered a heavy hair loss since last month, and I was worried a lot. Then, I heard of this shampoo from my friend. Now, I have been using this shampoo for almost 2 weeks, I feel my scalp become healthier and healthier, no more oil even after a long day work, and my hair is stronger than before. I believe my hair could be better  if I keep on using it. I would recommend this to someone who has the same problem as I had on hairs.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and have had good results. I noticed my hair started shedding about two years ago pretty heavily when I was rubbing my head. This was a frightening experience for me, being in my mid 20&#x27;s. I started looking in the mirror and noticed my hair line receding, and knew I had to do something about it. I originally purchased the non organic Pura d&#x27;or about two years ago, and within a few months, I noticed a reduction in shedding. After a year, shedding was minimal, and my thin hair already looked more full. That said, it also smells and feels good in the hair. After I ran out of the non-organic, I went to purchase more, and saw the organic gold label, and opted to buy that. Good products for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products for hair loss over the past year with no real results.  I decided to give Pura d&#x27;or a try since it is organic.  I wasn&#x27;t interested in products that could produce unwanted side effects.  I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks so I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth yet.  The shampoo does have a medicinal odor which is eliminated by using the conditioner which is absolutely necessary if you want to get a comb through your hair after washing.  I have very short hair (3 inches at the longest).  I was hoping I could bypass the conditioner due to the cost of the shampoo but ended up ordering it due to the tangles left by the shampoo.  Overall, the shampoo does thicken my hair a bit and, with the conditioner, leaves my hair shiny and manageable.  I will continue to use and am hopeful that the end result will be new hair.  At the very least, the product is good for my scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> The best shampo for my hair, love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using about 2 months and I really like this shampoo. My hair does feel thicker and soft. I bought to prevent hair loss and have noticed less shedding. Overall, my hair just looks healthier.  Very happy with product and will order again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in hair loss with shampoo after using it for two months.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic. It helped me regain strength and fullness within one month of usage. I love the fact that it is organic, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about two months now.  I was very skeptical the shampoo could really help regrow my hair but guess what, my hair stopped falling out and it actually looks more full.  I wont make some long review, I will say one thing, at least from a male&#x27;s point of view, if your hair means anything to you then spend the money and try this.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, you still aren&#x27;t out because you have to use shampoo anyways.  Just as a side note, i didn&#x27;t start noticing results until after a month.  But, since I don&#x27;t have long hair one bottle lasts over a month</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few weeks.  Obviously I feel my hair thicker than before and it smells nature no chemical.  Regarding the anti-hair loss effect, I haven&#x27;t been able to measure how much my hair fall before and after.  The price is a little high but if it does work on my hair loss problem, I will keep buying it.  I should be able to see the result in next few months.</li>
    <li> just purchased this product based on the good reviews, not sure about the hair loss treatment yet, but only used few times, it makes me so itching, want to pull my hair out.....</li>
    <li> Good lather for an SLS free shampoo and washes out nicely.</li>
    <li> Terrific shampoo -- will continue buying it</li>
    <li> I wish I could show you pictures.. Of how good this has worked for me...</li>
    <li> I got it a couple of weeks ago. I tried it and felt it has a gentle layer of foam when I put some on my hair. It smells good. I wish it could generate more foam. I noticed I have less hair lost when I used this shampoo for several times. Hope it will work even better as the times of using it increase</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t  been using this product very long so I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s it&#x27;s good or bad. The smell isn&#x27;t that great but if it stops my hair from falling out I guess the smell ain&#x27;t that important.</li>
    <li> I expect more ,the only one problem is the dandruff .Before I don&#x27;t have this problem,but now</li>
    <li> All these great reviews!!! So!!! How much money was everyone paid?!! I&#x27;ll take lets see..$30$! That should cover the price of this harsh smelling junk! It did nothing !! I do mean nothing. Well nothing other then stink to the high heavens!</li>
    <li> Its great for skin as well as hair</li>
    <li> The Pura D&#x27;or products leave my hair voluminous and make it feel stronger and thicker. So far it&#x27;s been working great to give my hair a natural boost of health and shine. Yes it&#x27;s a little pricey, but being organic and natural, its worth spending every cent!</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that would help with hair loss and I think I finally found it.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I love how well the product lathers and the scent is great. All the ingredients are organic and pesticide free which is rare to find in most shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for about a week and I am already seeing results. Less hair is coming out in the shower and my hair feels thicker.</li>
    <li> My son introduced me to this shampoo. He pointed that it contained natural DHT blockers and no harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I listened to him, as my hair looks and feels healthier. I&#x27;m in my second bottle and noticed my brush has less fallen hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I am on &amp; off of medications that make my hair fall out. This helps &amp; works wonders. I also referred my Aunt to this shampoo. She loves it. Her hairdresser couldn&#x27;t believe the growth she had.</li>
    <li> It is amazing!my hair always dry and hard.to comb，recently I want curl by myself.its product is the best partner for curl.I love it</li>
    <li> Seems to be working so far.  My hair feels thicker and softer.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product is allowed on the market. I started using and noticed the texture of my hair changing. After about a month, I noticed a significant amount of hair falling out in the shower. This continued for the next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After switching back to my regular shampoo, the hair loss stopped immediately.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with hair loss and hair thinning for a few years. Changing to different products didn&#x27;t improve the problem. So when I read the reviews for Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label) I was skeptical but at the same time wanted to give it a try. So I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shampoo a few times and I am happy to report that this is a great shampoo! It&#x27;s very soft, not at all abrasive for the scalp or hair. My hair tends to get frizzy but this shampoo took care of that and made my hair manageable. Also, when I ordered the shampoo I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed a conditioner to go with it but I felt no need to use any kind of conditioner after shampooing. The ingredients are all natural. It smells wonderful and yes, it&#x27;s safe of those who color their hair. All in all it&#x27;s a product that should be tried if you have hair problems. Now I have to (patiently) wait and  if it really works for the hair loss.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo, my hair seems healthier and thicker, as well as shiny,I&#x27;ll repeat it.</li>
    <li> I am actually a brand new customer who wanted to try a shampoo that didn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals.  After doing some extensive research I saw numerous legit reviews about this product.  I just recently have started to use it so I wont lie and say I&#x27;ve seen any results yet because I know it takes time.  What I will say though is, if it works anything like the reviews I will be a very happy someone.  I am looking forward to my progress with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 6 months now. It improved my hair a bit thats what i feel.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using it for a year and evaluate its impact afterwards.</li>
    <li> What a great find, I have already ordered more.</li>
    <li> Love this. Feels great on my skin and not greasy!</li>
    <li> So far this is a great product.  I have used it on my hair and my face.  My hair felt stronger and my face feels more moisturized.  I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This is one of the first quality shampoos that I have bought and I must say I am pleased. This product has a nice subtle smell of rosemary as opposed to some of the overpowering scents in most shampoos that I have bought in the past. By the second day of using this I noticed my hair was significantly softer and was no longer dry. It left my hair more hydrated. I bought this product as I felt that I was beginning to bald and this would be the solution. Time will tell but my hair feels fuller, thus I am confident that I will have positive results with this shampoo. My one concern with this shampoo was in reading the ingredient list. I noticed that the ingredients were derived from some type of organic matter but the list of chemicals was longer than I expected for an organic shampoo. I think an improvement would be more whole ingredients and fewer derived, but overall I enjoy this shampoo and will continue to buy it as, to me, it is the best option on the market for its price.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s helping.</li>
    <li> The front of my head was getting shiny and was only growing in the center, after using the product for a month the hair is not only thicker but the hair is growing and filling in the shinny area on the sides .  I have used everything this is the best and unlike minoxidol this does not smell after use .</li>
    <li> As for the hair loss, I haven&#x27;t seen much progress yet. However, the shampoo makes my hair feel great! It gives great volume and just for that, this is worth the buy. But only 4 starts because its a bit too expensive.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the Best for my budget and environment. Game changing decision it was to purchase this . Cheers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update : Only wrote the review cuz they offered me a free bottle but after a couple months of use I have experinced no positive changes at all . This product is a complete scam , I feel like I had a better scalp before using this . Please I beg you not to buy this .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for the past two weeks or so, I wash my hair every other day.  So far, it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my hair shedding, I&#x27;m still losing a lot of hair but I&#x27;m hoping that with time and using this product, that will improve soon.  But one thing I have noticed is that this shampoo dries up my hair like crazy.  It&#x27;s almost as if this product provides NO MOISTURE at all.  It makes my hair feel gritty and gross.....I guess I&#x27;ll continue using it until it&#x27;s done, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have stress-induced hair loss which I have been trying to alleviate with this shampoo and other products. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for about two months now and it calms the itchiness but seems to leave my scalp and hair a little dry. The hair loss is relatively reduced, but I&#x27;m also using another product, so it could be a combined effect. Overall, it&#x27;s good to know it&#x27;s organic and doesn&#x27;t have harsh components. I suppose more time is needed to see more complete results. I will update if my overall impression changes.</li>
    <li> After 3 months me and everyone can see a difference. My hair is growing and getting thicker.</li>
    <li> Does everything it claims to do.  Love it.</li>
    <li> So far my wife and I love Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Shampoo.  It gives just the right volume to my hair, which has always been a problem with other shampoos.  And even though I use the Pura d&#x27;or organic conditioner, the shampoo does a pretty good job conditioning where I don&#x27;t have to use the conditioner every time.</li>
    <li> Great product ..hasn&#x27;t been loosing hair since I got it.. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has changed the way I feel about my hair and I finally have hope that it will improve and stop falling out altogether. My hair smells fresh and takes longer to get oily again. There is more volume and the shampoo rinses off leaving my hair soft. I have been using it for a few weeks and have already begun to see a difference in the amount of hair that falls out every day.</li>
    <li> Seriously love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2 years ago. I haven&#x27;t seen any new hair to grow but It effectively stopped my hair loss. It adds thickness and shininess to hair but it also increases frizzy and anyone who uses this shampoo should use the conditioner also.</li>
    <li> I have seen less hair in my shower and on the bathroom floor since using this shampoo. I have been using this product for over a year. Love it!</li>
    <li> WOW THIS REALLY WORKED MY HAIR STOPPED FALLING AND ITS REALLY HEALTHY AND THICK THANK U VERY VERY MUCH!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Not sure on the results, but it seems to work well overall.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and does add volume to your hair. It is an overall great shampoo.</li>
    <li> Was unsure about this product at first. Sounded to good to be true. I honestly did. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I can already see a difference. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem as dry and it isn&#x27;t breaking as easy. I also notice my hair has a shiny gloss. Easier to comb through. The smell is a earthy smell.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel clean, but do not see too much effect against anti loss so far.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Just be patient and use it consistently. Trust me, it works. Be patient!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works!  I just started using it, but have noticed a difference in volume and shine immediately.  More importantly, I noticed that I have less hair loss and breakage.  It&#x27;s amazing!  Looking forward to healing my over processed hair with this natural product.  Glad I discovered Pura d&#x27;Or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label).</li>
    <li> not what I expected for the price. Way to expensive. Makes my hair blow up. I hate wasting this shampoo because of the cost but I dread when I do use it because it takes so long afterward to get my hair to tame down. Tried to add a little more argon hoping it would help but didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great for parched hair.  A couple of drops also help my dry scalp.  And I tried a drop on a spot of eczema with good relief.  A good price for this product too!</li>
    <li> I started using this after my hair had been shedding for a few months and other shampoos were making it worse.  After using this for a couple months i noticed considerably less shedding.  I will continue to use this for a few more months and see if I keep getting the same results</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My hair seems fuller after a week of using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was purchased to help prevent hair loss. I have been using the product for about 6 weeks and have not really noticed any hair regrowth. I have noticed my hair has appeared to look a little thicker. The shampoo has also slightly decreased the amount of hair that falls out daily. I am hoping to see hair regrowth in the weeks to come.</li>
    <li> I Have tried everything especially all of Nioxin 4 system... I am so in love with this product and the fact its all natural I know is so great.. I have really thin bad hair and i am usual scared to even shampoo because handfuls would fall out... My first time with this it had stopped!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple weeks now and it has been a positive experience. It lathers nice, doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, and leaves my hair clean. I obviously haven&#x27;t noticed much in terms of my hair loss yet , but leaving my hair and scalp clean without irritation and drying is very positive.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My hair has never been as soft following a shampoo (it&#x27;s to bad Dura d&#x27;Or wasn&#x27;t available when I had a bit more hair).  I use it daily and am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this shampoo. I used to have really thick hair and then lost a lot of hair due to stress and had tried everything before I discovered this shampoo. I read all the amazing reviews on it and was desperate to find something that would promote regrowth.  I have been using this shampoo about 5-6 months now and my stylist can&#x27;t believe all the new growth and how much thicker my hair feels since I started using it.  I also love that my shipments also arrives very quickly! Thank you!</li>
    <li> smell is really good and scalp itchiness seems to go away after two days of use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about halfway through my first bottle. It definitely has a different feel to most of the other anti-hair loss shampoos I&#x27;ve bought off the supermarket shelves.  My hair is naturally coarse and lately has been thinning at a good rate.  Since using this shampoo, I think there has been a slow down to this thinning and my hair looks and feels smoother.</li>
    <li> not sure if this works 2 months post purchase</li>
    <li> love the way my hair felt after one use</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really awesome and helpful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m highly impressed by the performance by this organic shampoo. I recommend people with hair thinning problem, usually many shampoo claims to cure problem but this works. My hair fall is down by at least 70% percent and I highly recommend to all the guys facing the most difficult problem hair loss. Go for it!</li>
    <li> THIS WILL RUIN YOUR HAIR!!!  WARNING!!!  FALSE REVIEWS ON AMAZON!!!!  SCAM!!!  HAIR WILL DRY UP, TANGLE, AND COME OUT WHEN YOU COMB IT.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon really should crack down on these rating gimmics.  They&#x27;re starting to erode Amazon&#x27;s image</li>
    <li> Well, after I started losing my hair at about the age of 20 from male pattern baldness, I tried using this shampoo. Even after about five or so months of use, this shampoo really didn&#x27;t have fantastic results. In fact, shortly after I started using it, my scalp started having dandruff problems. I had never had any problems with dandruff previously. Now I&#x27;m using this shampoo in combination with an anti-dandruff shampoo from Pert. Since I started using the pert anti-dandruff shampoo (about 3$ at Walmart) my hair has been softer and easier to comb through. Bottom line, this product did little for my hair except give me dandruff. Maybe it will work for you, it&#x27;s hard to say. But I&#x27;m going to start using the 3$ stuff, Gide-yup.</li>
    <li> best shampoo I ever used.  This shampoo leaves my scalp and hair feeling great.  One bottle lasted me more than 6 months with one pump per hair washing.</li>
    <li> What a luxurious shampoo but I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see if it helps with hair loss.  The only problem I had was the lid wasn&#x27;t tight and product leaked all over box.</li>
    <li> excellent product, my hair is very soft and limp</li>
    <li> Positive results so far, my husband is enjoying the use and it seems to be helping to stem current thinning after using for about 60 days.  Optimistic about future results.</li>
    <li> Great product, made my hair thicker and gave it more volume.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo with pleasant smell, bought it as a holiday present for my husband, he does not use it long enough to tell if it does the promised job of keeping the hair on the head but it feels very natural and healthy. leaves some residue on hair if you do not use conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser who I have been going to for the last four years was amazed by the results. She asked me what I was using and bought a bottle on the spot!  She was washing my hair and was astonished, saying \\&quot;where did all of this baby hair come from??\\&quot; So yes, I truly believe that this works. However you can&#x27;t expect miracles in a bottle. This, along with a healthy lifestyle, exercise, and biotin supplements can help tremendously.y say that I will not go another day without this bottle in my bath, and I too had my doubts upon buying this. I noticed that there were a lot of customers saying how some reviews are fake, but I am so glad that I bought it anyway.     If you are like me, young and losing hair, you don&#x27;t have much to lose. I cannot speak for those whose hair loss is due to mature age or other medical factors, but it definitely did wonders for me. I wash my hair every other day, and I am still on my first bottle.</li>
    <li> This shampoo immediately yielded results. After 3 shampoos I now see fine baby hairs growing in at corner hairline and 50% less falls out when combing hair out after shampooing.</li>
    <li> I said excellent normal hair.</li>
    <li> I seems to be working. Hair is fuller in the front. But I&#x27;m still balding I&#x27;m the back. Going to buy another bottle and if it doesn&#x27;t get any better I guess I&#x27;m screwed.</li>
    <li> it is good. at lease no loss much hair yet. will see later if it is more better.</li>
    <li> I find my scalp to be cleaner and less itchy. My hair seems soft and healthy. On my second bottle already.</li>
    <li> Listen, I&#x27;m a normal person who doesn&#x27;t like wasting money. I&#x27;m not here to advertise; just to help you guys out. I&#x27;m in your position too. I myself wasted money on other products in an attempt to stop DHT in my hair. Good thing that didn&#x27;t last long. I started using folliform pills, saw palmetto, biotin, and this product. Esspecially this (with the conditioner.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite sure I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 months now, and I love it. It&#x27;s really REALLY great. The price is a bit daunting, but it lasts a good while. Back in September of 2014 I&#x27;ve researched the best shampoos. Those &amp;#34;Use argan life shampoo&amp;#34; comments on youtube convinced me to use another product, and while it made my hair seem nice and smooth, it barely slowed down the shedding process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the last product you should use for your hair anyway. This alone, while it does help a lot and I highly recommend it, still isn&#x27;t quite helpful enough without saw palmetto, or nettle root, or biotin, or zinc, ect.</li>
    <li> Ive been using the shampoo for a week now and i can tell that it is really working good for my scalp. i dont see any hair grow yet but i can really say that the hair fall is a lot less now compared before and it gives my scalp and hair fresh and healthy.</li>
    <li> Just started using. Works great already noticing thinning hair in front to seem more full. Pretty pricey but would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is awesome... Absolutely love this shampoo. Finally something what works. It&#x27;s little bit pricey though...</li>
    <li> Baldness is one problem that affects my personality in a great deal. In many cases, I felt a lack of confidence due to my baldness problem. I was frustrated and wanted to get rid of this problem. A doctor advised me to use this unique side effect free product name Pura d&#x27;or premium anti-hair loss shampoo. After using it for a couple of weeks, I clearly observed its powerful impact. Pura d&#x27;or premium anti-hair loss shampoo protects hair from Di-Hydrotestosterone which is mainly a hormone that causes hair loss by blocking blood and nutrient flow to the follicles. Pura d&#x27;or premium anti-hair loss shampoo prevents this hormone and ensure regrown of hair in the bald spot. I’m completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> My hair start falling more after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> 2 weeks on it no results yet.....&lt;br /&gt;I ll update this later on&lt;br /&gt;Also im taking saw palmento lets see..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product I love it, really works and will buy more, family and friends love it to, everybody should have it, I  will try other products from same brand sense these one worked,  I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 1 month. I have noticed the difference in my hair loss. I do still loose hair, however I think it is due to hard water in my home. It is a little pricey but worth it. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Well i am using this shampoo for a while. I have tried dozens of shampoo to make my hair look thinker and most importantly healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Since i started working indoor under conditioners all day long, my hair start feeling dry and lifeless. This shampoo helps a lot and and i am here just to say thanks for that great product.</li>
    <li> Pricey but if it helps with my thinning hair and hair loss, it&#x27;s worth every penny. Love the list of natural ingredients.  Leaves my hair manageable and more healthy feeling/looking.  Need to keep using longer for final verdict.</li>
    <li> My hair just soaks that Argan shampoo in. Love it! I started to use it one month ago and can see some result. I don&#x27;t seem to lose my hair that much, and my hair looks healthier.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo!  My hair has more body than ever and l don&#x27;t have to wash it as often.  You only use a little so it will last a long time.  I like that is natural and it is helping with  my hair loss.  I loved it after the first time l used it!</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo I have ever used.  Very Gentle on color-treated hair.  No conditioner is needed after shampooing.  Leaves hair full and soft without being fly away.  I have noticed that I am losing much less hair since I have started using this product.  I would highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> Love it !!!!! My hair is so shiny and full. Will order more.</li>
    <li> i love is very good for my 65 years old</li>
    <li> Works well! Gentle on hair</li>
    <li> Rated a 3 because I&#x27;m not sure yet of the results.. After washing with the Premium Pura d&#x27; anti-loss shampoo and I have well water, still don&#x27;t notice much of a change as of yet. , My hair is fine texture and alot of it. After using this for about a month now, my hair is still tangled and takes awhile to come through.. I do have some hair growth, but still not totally convinced of the overall expectations.  I do color treat my hair and notice the color has retained.  Still waiting for the other results others have claimed.  Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s hair and circumstances varies.  So i&#x27;m still hopeful.</li>
    <li> It is working my husband has 3 weeks using this product and his hair feeils thicker and i can se new hair</li>
    <li> Iv been using this for the past 3 weeks and really like that i no longer have flakes. As far as hair growth goes i haven&#x27;t noticed my hair thickening much but it certainly has stopped the progression which ill take at this point. The bottle says to wait until 3 months of continues use before seeing noticeable results. So far i am cautiously optimistic and will continue to update my review as time passes. As a side note, i have short hair and only one pump of this stuff is enough to lather. I expect one bottle to at least last me a month of daily use. If not this can get very expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 40 male and beginning to lose my hair on the top of head near the back! Have just started using this all natural product in hopes of re-generating some hair (along with a few other products).  I&#x27;m hoping to see some results in 3 months and will re-post an update at that time.  But my hair feels smooth and silky with the all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and lathers on fine. There are no apparent side effects. However, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it is working within the initial 3-month period.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a month but have not seen the result described in other comments. Just like a regular champoo except with higher price. Will keep using it and see...</li>
    <li> I have only been using this shampoo for 2 weeks, but already see a difference in my hair. It seems healthier and thicker, as well as shiny.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this shampoo. I started using it 2 months ago and gradually felt that my hair loss condition has improved.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I see any hair growth, but I do notice less shedding and a thicker feel This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I see no results at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Give it 4 to 6 weeks and see the differents. It works.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for 7 months now and the results are great.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was damaged from over dyeing and styling and my hair was brittle and thinning from the constant hair coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I started to get new growth and my hair texture was soft with sheen after using this shampoo for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;I will continuing using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for three weeks (around 10 times), but so far I LOVE it.  I was gray by age 40 and have been coloring my hair for around 20 years.  I inherited hair loss from my mother.  Now as a 64 year old female I have very fine, thin hair.  Plus I have a double crown.  It is almost impossible to cover thin spots.  I have no confidence that my hair will become thicker.  I do love the way my hair feels.  I have tried every shampoo recommended by my hair dresser and most available at the drug store.  This is by far the best product that I have used.  I highly recommend it and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me as guaranteed.</li>
    <li> UPD 05/17/2016 I changed from 1 to 5 stars after 4 months. This is the best shampoo to get new hair! The best of all! Thank you for this product! ... I didn&#x27;t get a discount or special price for my review. This is my honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is absolutely not for me! I have natural blonde long hair, but after 2 years of breastfeeding I see that I am loosing a lot of hair during the day and after shower. I read a lot of reviews and decided to buy this one expensive shampoo! ( really expensive for me). I waited 1 month to get any result but I have nothing! Let me tel you one more: after this shampoo my hair so matted and not soft. Also I don&#x27;t like the smell...... Brrrr..... My English is not so good, but I hope you can understand me and make a right decision!</li>
    <li> Hair feels thicker - just began using it - will review again after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Bought several weeks ago with expectation in preventing hair loss.  Despite used a few times, haven&#x27;t seen improvement however hoping for the best !</li>
    <li> Have only used it once, but it works really effectively in removing the grease on my hair. I do not know the whether the other benefits are true, but I will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I havent really seen any hair growth, but it does remove a lot of the grease in my hair.</li>
    <li> This product really reduced my hair loss. It builds stronger hair but i don&#x27;t think it necessarily grows hair but with less hair loss my hair has never look as full as it is now. Great product i&#x27;m very satisified</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my scalp feel great!  There are so many wonderful ingredients in it for blocking DHT.  I know for sure it will make&lt;br /&gt;my hair grow back in fully.  Already, it is helping my hair loss.  But there is no doubt in my mind it will stop hair loss due to DHT.&lt;br /&gt;They did not skimp on ingredients.  Netttle, saw palmetto, he shou wu, pygeum, rosemary, beta sistosterol plus much, much more are proven hair loss preventatives.  You have got to try this.  It is good for women, or men.  You will not be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cw of Illinois</li>
    <li> this product create an allergic problem for me and I end up in the emergency room, I like to return it and have my money back.</li>
    <li> I started to notice that my hair is not falling anymore on the floor of the shower cabinet. It feels good on my scalp and smells nice. I haven&#x27;t noticed yet if it helps growing hair, but at least if keeps my hair from falling, it will leave a higher hair population on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and the blue version before that.  It has stopped the hair loss completely but does no regrow any lost hair.  If you are suffering from hair loss, this is the best way to stop the hair loss process and prevent any further damage.  However, don&#x27;t expect it to actually grow back anything.</li>
    <li> Due to stress my hair started falling out, I seen this shampoo on a website and decided to give it a try, although the smell takes some getting use to, the product does seem to work I have been using it for a few weeks now and have noticed a lot less hair loss. In fact I have noticed my hair is beginning to grow back, This is a product I will continue to use!!!</li>
    <li> After I had my baby I noticed that my hair started to fall.  A friend told me about  Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo. I have been using it for three weeks and I highly recommend this product, it is excellent for hair loss. My hair is not falling like before and it looks healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few months now after using the green bottle for about a year. I can say that I&#x27;ve seen better results with the gold than the green bottle. My hair has grown in a bit thicker at the roots and the shampoo feels great and lasts a while. I&#x27;m sure there is no magical cure shampoo to cure hair loss but this has definitely helped. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied and am buying this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo, No question that it makes the hair much healthier. I really like the smell as well...feels very clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. Increased my hair loss and thinning significantly. Smells bad. Definitely not as good as advertised. I really hoped it would work but it didn&#x27;t. Everyone&#x27;s different, so your experience might be positive, who knows. In any case, do yourself a favor and do not read 4-5 star reviews, most of them are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: One of my friends also tried the product independently months later and told me exactly the same thing... I&#x27;m convinced that this product does not work as intended and causes more hair loss. Stay away!</li>
    <li> Incredible shampoo. Lathers great and dont have to repeat.Cleans squeaky clean with no residue. Leaves hair very shiny.  No hair loss for the first week I have been using it. Pricey but well worth the quality. Also hasve used the blue label which is also top notch. A must try!</li>
    <li> Has great lather, not sure it&#x27;s effects have been dramatic, but it&#x27;s certainly been enjoyable to use and makes my hair feel much cleaner than normal shampoo</li>
    <li> I have been using it for less than 2 weeks and I am not sure if i have seen any significant results but i am positive. Most of the hair products are advertised to see results in 90 days and there is a reason behind it. Human hair normally grows inch or less than a inch in 30 days. So in 90 days one can expect appx. 3 inch long hair and which can be obvious to see rather than few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These product doesn&#x27;t have any fancy smell(chemicals) which makes me believe that it it truly organic. As its organic (hence no side effect) I would recommend to try it first before trying any products with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update result after 90 days to see any difference.</li>
    <li> This bottle is not cheap for a shampoo but I guess most people will pay the price for the hope of slowing down their hair-loss. I have noticed a slightly more full look of hair to my head and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking shiny or oily which is a plus to me. The smell of this shampoo is also really nice and it&#x27;s nice to know that what you are using to wash your hair doesn&#x27;t have any nasty chemicals and is organic. All in all I love this shampoo I would just love it more if the price was a little more reasonable.</li>
    <li> This product truly overpassed my expectations. My hair has been growing a lot faster, I get compliments all the time. Well worth the money, and shipping was also faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! I started losing my hair due to hair color and stress! I will be 30 next month. I can already see a dramatic difference in my hair and have been using it for 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s anti-hair loss shampoo for six months now. It takes time for the shampoo to do work on your scalp. It&#x27;s not a magic overnight solution. For me, I started noticing slight differences about 3 months in. I can say that now, my hair is fuller and doesn&#x27;t feel as weak. My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as easily. I do recommend this product but I also HIGHLY recommend that you use it with a conditioner. Since it&#x27;s an organic shampoo, I stuck with Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s organic conditioner. At first, I tried only using the shampoo with no conditioner. It left my hair a little too dry for my liking. But overall, I like the Gold Label and I think it has a more attractive scent than that of the regular anti-hairloss shampoo Pura d&#x27;or puts out.</li>
    <li> I just use this shampoo for more than one month. And I feel my hair loss less and my hair is stronger than before</li>
    <li> Love this products. My hair does not fall as much. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 weeks now and my hair looks and feels fuller. Plus it&#x27;s not full of chemicals like everything else at the stores.</li>
    <li> Conditioner came in with no dispenser.  Poor quality control during packing.  Did not return because of all the hassle.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a couple weeks and I can already tell that less hair is falling out.</li>
    <li> 21 years old, mildly thinning hair. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for four months now, following the directions on the label flawlessly. When I first began use, I noted how clean it made my hair feel after I dried it, and even if right away it didn&#x27;t do anything to enhance growth, it sure made it appear and feel thicker. I noticed less hair fall during washing and was pleased for the first month or so.&lt;br /&gt;After that, things seemed to go a little bit downhill from there. I noticed lots of hair coming out whenever I washed it, more so than the time prior to using this product. I&#x27;ve since plateaued and I experience the same amount of hair fall, maybe a little less than I just described. I kind of wish this just worked the way the 4- and 5-star reviews raved it would.</li>
    <li> It does do the job it intended to do. Reduces the hair shading. Keep few minutes before washing it during shower.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product !!!! I received it today and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, My hair has been falling out like crazy ,its dry and curly and chemically treated, it always gets very frizzy when i let it air dry or diffuse it,but tonight that didn&#x27;t happen. It has bounce and no frizz !!! I still lost a little bit of hair, but it was my first time. I can tell this is going to be a long time relationship. Will give another review in the 3 months they say to use it ,I couldn&#x27;t be more happy !!! Better than any other expensive product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom for the third time now, she says its the only thing that really works for her and she has seen improvement of her hair health.</li>
    <li> looks like my hair is growing. thanks</li>
    <li> Omg... This product actually really works. I bought this for my mom and she had definately seen soo much improvement in her hair thickness so my brother decided to try it out as well. He has seen soo much change also. Its a definate must for someone who is suffering from hair thinnning. I&#x27;lll say this though that it works better in winter months as because of the summer humidity the oils doesn&#x27;t stay on the hair long enough to do their magic but its a great product anyways and one bottle last for really long time.&lt;br /&gt;My mom is in love with this product :) and she is very picky person :) :)</li>
    <li> the item so good....it helpful for me now....i will buy again when the ends.</li>
    <li> Smells a little funny, kinda like plants, but it&#x27;s not bad. Only used it twice so far, and my hair isn&#x27;t falling out in chunks like it was before, which is amazing. I&#x27;m on a medication that causes hair loss and this has already helped. I&#x27;m very impressed and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Naturally thicker hair is way better than the thought of chemical treatments. You can tell a difference in about a week. My hair felt much thicker and shinier. Additionally it is overall a great shampoo too. If I&#x27;m away from home I now feel weird using chemically synthetic shampoos that I use to think was normal (and seemigly the most of world still does). I think I&#x27;ll be using this product for a long time. Argan oil is pretty cool stuff, try researching it online.</li>
    <li> cant tell any difference vs reg shampoo</li>
    <li> Works really well to prevent hair loss while shampooing.  I have really long, fine hair and I notice that I do not lose as much hair when I am showering as I used to.</li>
    <li> incredble. makes my fine hair voluminous!  It has shine and the highhights were superb.  Now my have to have hair product.  Fast, excellent service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it from about 3 weeks now, you can really notice the difference. My hair is already thicker and I&#x27;m seeing a little hair growth. I think it will get better and better with the regular use. The only thing that would make this product perfect could be faster results, but like every product in the market it takes a little time. I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> hair is growing! :) Gave to my sister and her husband, and both have noticed the new baby hair coming in after about 2 months of use.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Hair gets a little dry at first but you start noticing a difference very soon. Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have been using it for 3.5 weeks, and today when my wife cut my hair she could absolutely see new growth. Without question, this stuff is working for me. It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest but who cares? I&#x27;m seeing my hair come back in the crown of my head! Not cheap but it&#x27;s organic and cheaper than Rogaine. I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a month and have not noticed any improvement in amount of hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since July and have noticed a huge reduction in hair loss and some hair regrowth. I like the way it smells and leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
    <li> Good product. It has reduced the hair loss to a good extent. Only drawback is the smell during the use. However this goes away after the shower.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product. It&#x27;s a great product and also works great I am already noticing a difference in my hair quality. It is little pricey but I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Before using this product I dreaded washing my hair because most recently I&#x27;ve been losing gobs of hair. My hair would cover the drain of the shower. Just after the first try I could literally Comb my hair when it was wet and only a couple of hairs came out. When it was dry my hair looked so full and healthy. Pros: it really does work. It&#x27;s thick and creamy. Cons: it takes about 20 seconds to work through my hair (not such a bad thing) and it seems that my scalp feels a bit itchy for just a short time. However, sensitive scalps run in my family. It does have a little bit of an odd smell but when my hair dries it seems to be odorless, shiny and soft!  My final vote: don&#x27;t think twice. Just try it!</li>
    <li> I have never spent this much money on a bottle of shampoo and am completely disappointed.  I have semi-long hair.  This product maybe better suited for people with very short hair?  I have used this product for a month now and below is what I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;  It dries out my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;  Leaves hair so tangled that it is almost impossible to comb (resulting in hair loss).&lt;br /&gt;  Product is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;Though the product did not meet my expectations, I will say that Vital&#x27;s International Group provides great customer service and has issued 100% refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this shampoo so far, I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks and I&lt;br /&gt;have noticed less hair loss after shampooing and brushing.  I would like it better if it wasn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;so expensive!! As for hair growth it is too soon to tell. I&#x27;m glad it works for a lot of people.</li>
    <li> From dying and blowdrying, my hair has become really rough and damaged over the past few years. I have also noticed that my hair was beginning to thin and hair was falling out with every wash. I&#x27;ve been using head &amp; shoulders for the past few years and when I went to a salon with my problem, they told me to try out pura d&#x27;or. After about a week of washing, my hair was becoming noticeably softer and I was no longer afraid to comb my hair through. I used to be afraid to comb my hair since hairs would fall out every time, but after using this shampoo for awhile it&#x27;s been happening less and less.</li>
    <li> I was really desperate to try a hair loss shampoo but didn&#x27;t want all the nasty chemicals in the normal shampoos. This one has great ingredients and smells great. I can&#x27;t fully attest to how it&#x27;s working yet but I am hopeful!</li>
    <li> For 2-3 years I&#x27;ve started having problems with my hair - thinning, lots of hair falling out, and having trouble growing it long again after I last cut it to a bob length 3 years ago. I started experimenting with expensive branded products 1 year ago and nothing has really worked. My hair was still falling out, growing very slowly, and was a bit unruly. (I have straight hair but at a certain length it starts to &amp;#34;flip out&amp;#34; and becomes hard to style). I just started using the Gold Label shampoo together with the Premium Organic conditioner. It&#x27;s making a difference right away. My hair is still falling out in the shower in similar quantities as before, but each time I wash my hair with Pura d&#x27;or products my hair looks fuller, straighter, and less unruly when it dries. I also use a bit of the Argan oil on my scalp and face, which is pretty awesome - my hair looks super dark and shiny after the oil but not weighed down, and my skin literally &amp;#34;glows&amp;#34; all day. I have high hopes for how things will improve with continued use!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a week now but already notice my hair shafts getting thicker and I have been losing much less hair than before.</li>
    <li> A product that actually works.</li>
    <li> Been using for about a month now and so far so good.  I bought both the shampoo and conditioner together. I recommend these products.  Considering most state it takes about 3 months to see true effects, I plan to repost any future developments in another couple of months.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo. only been using it for a little while but the results are noticable.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased this shampoo. It made my hair feel thicker and smoother. I&#x27;m waiting for the conditioner to arrive but am very happy with the shampoo it doesn&#x27;t dry up my hair like the other hair loss shampoo I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy! for great price. Not sure why it disappeared from amazon. Hope it comes back soon before I run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gold product for about 4 months now. Prior to using the Gold, I was using the blue label for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I notice the big difference between the two. Honestly, I think the blue label bottle makes the hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I have noticed significant improvement to my hair loss and I will continue to use this product years to come.</li>
    <li> So far so good.. I have tried many shampoos but this one seems to stand out. It has all natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals which is safe for frequent use. I have been using it for about a month or so, generally every alternate day and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing hair loss/ thinning of unknown origin, i have tried everything from topical , to supplements.  I am hopeful this stuff will work and love the fact that it is natural.  After my first use i liked the smell, and the clean feeling it gave my hair after a shampoo, You definitely need conditioner after this as your hair is so squeaky clean it needs moisture.  I give it 4 stars only right now because of the results i have seen after a couple of uses over time i can better review the hair growth/loss .  I did notice less shedding after the 3rd wash and my hair was shiny, less frizzy and easier to blow dry for those reasons i will definelty stick with it to see what the results are (the bottle says you need 3 months to notice growth) We shall see.</li>
    <li> What I like about this product as a shampoo is that it cleans my hair really well. It rinses squeaky clean without any buildup. However, as far as the claim of marketing the shampoo as an anti-hair loss product, it did not work for me. I waited a while to do this review to give it a chance to do its magic. I had high hopes of this product, and I saved my fallen hair each hair wash to compare, and sadly, the amount of hair loss is the same, if not more.</li>
    <li> There are few things that are more depressing and emasculating than losing your hair. When it begins to happen we all hope that maybe we&#x27;re just seeing things. But take it from me, you don&#x27;t have to wait until it&#x27;s undeniable and it&#x27;s become noticeable to everyone else, because fighting hair loss is easier than you think. You don&#x27;t have to take expensive prescription drugs or put some stinky homemade concoction on your do. Just grab a bottle of this awesome sauce and you&#x27;ll start to notice result in just weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product just a few weeks ago and I already see my bald spot thickening. The best part about this product is the fact that it&#x27;s just such a great shampoo in itself. It smells divine and feels amazing on my scalp. And as a bonus, it&#x27;s all natural and organic. What more could you ask for fellas? Just give it an honest try!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I have always had thin and lifeless hair, so I was not expecting a lot when buying this product, but I was in for a pleasant surprise when I actually started feeling the difference after a few washes. My hair are definitely looking far shinier and healthier than they used to be. I would keep buying this product in future.</li>
    <li> My husband had  been using a leading hair loss shampoo for several years.  All though it worked, it left his hair greasy.  Recently we noticed his hair started to fall out again.  When I went on the computer to order more, I started to read the reviews about the shampoo.  I soon realized that a &#x27;knock-off&#x27; was being distributed that was manufactured in Mexico and it did not contain the ingredient that blocked DHT.  A few of the reviewers mentioned Pura d&#x27;Or, so I decided to buy it for him.  It is amazing!  My husband&#x27;s hair is not greasy anymore and, being totally gray, he looks more distinguished.  He hasn&#x27;t been using Pura d&#x27;Or very long, so it&#x27;s hard to say if it is preventing his hair from falling out.  The other &#x27;stuff&#x27; stopped working so he doesn&#x27;t have anything to loose...no pun intended. (9-11-14)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I&#x27;m back to give an update on Pur d&#x27;Or Anti-hair loss shampoo.  Again, I&#x27;m happy to say, &amp;#34;it is amazing.&amp;#34;  It did stop his hair from falling out, and, I&#x27;m excited to report, that he has little gray fuzzies now on the crown of his head where he was completely bald.  I started to use it myself, but need the Pur d&#x27;Or conditioner because I dye my hair and the dye process leaves it tangled.  I&#x27;m am happy to give a 5 star rating. (1-04-15)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say it was working, but he is starting to experience hair loss again, though, not much.  We&#x27;re resigned to the fact that no one can interfere with what God gave us, but he is still using it because it is a great shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;07-12-17</li>
    <li> my hair getting thicker and healthier just after one month. Best shampoo ever, Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am loving this shampoo!  I bought both this blue and gold versions and both I have had incredible results!  Several compliments the first day I used the Gold label shampoo and much less shedding when shampooing!  I have shoulder length color treated blonde hair...38 years old...hoping to hang on to as much fullness as I can for my hair is fine/thin.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few weeks and I really like it.  Smells great and lathers up with not very much needed.  It does leave your hair fairly dry so a good leave in conditioner is a good idea.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to help grow out my hair/make it stronger. At first I didn&#x27;t really like this product because I didn&#x27;t think it washed my hair completely. I decided to wait a month before reviewing and since then I have experimented with the shampoo and now I really like it. It is a light shampoo so for me it has worked best when I shampoo twice and leave it on for a few minutes. I&#x27;m not sure if its promoting hair growth but the ingredients are very good and overall my hair feels healthy. I like the shampoo so far and will continue to test it out. I will update my review if I notice any changes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 months and I have had a lot of new hair growth! I can see and feel the difference. My boyfriend was running his fingers through my hair the other day and said my hair feels so much thicker..yay!! I will continue using this shampoo for as long as they keep making it! :)</li>
    <li> I never believed in shampoo fixing your hair loss. But group on had a good deal so decided to try. I was AMAZED. After about 2 washes I noticed HUGE difference. My hair almost stopped falling out. Best shampoo ever. REALLY WORKS!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this shampoo. Three small squirts and it covers my whole head... Leaves it with a really clean feeling without feeling stripped and dry. It also gives my hair nice body. Not sure about any hair growing back. I haven&#x27;t used it for very long. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price. You don&#x27;t use large amounts of it. I was going to buy the Peter Lamas Herb stimulating shampoo. 8 oz for 26.00. This one is 16 oz for 40. So glad I bought this one instead. Trying to repair years of thrashing my hair with regular shampoo. So glad I finally found something that I&#x27;m happy with. Unlike other sulfate free shampoos, this one doesnt leave my hair greasy. Will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this shampoo for a month, but already I see difference in my hair. Before I was facing my hair is thinning and fair falling. I have used so many good products in the market but still no use. Now, this shampoo leaves my hair feel stronger and making it thicker day by day and less hair fall out which is what I’m looking for right now. Now my hair looks fuller and thicker and it also helps for scalp. I will definitely order this product again!</li>
    <li> In all honesty, at first glance I saw little to no reason to believe something as simple as a shampoo or conditioner could actually have any noticeable affect on thinning hair/ loss. However having said, with patience and research it became clear through common logic why this was worth a shot. First off all the ingredients and extracts in this shampoo are organic/natural, free of harmful sulfates and other harsh chemicals. I have noticed this to be true, due to the fact that with many previous products i had used found at market chains, slight hair loss was experience at times during and after showers. Second while no single product can cure hair loss, this shampoo does target one of the PRIMARY causes of it, DHT, and by blocking DHT( through repeated use) it allows the nutrients found in the shampoo itself to seep into individual follicles and begin the repair process.In addition with DHT out of the picture old or &amp;#34;dormant&amp;#34; follicles may be revived as well!!!! Whilst results may vary, personally I have noticed one thing for sure, and that is for now I have noticed that my hair LOSS has halted, while re-growth is starting to become. For now I have no regrets and look forward to results yielded with further use.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about a month now and have noticed less hair loss. I am using it with the Pura d&#x27;or conditioner and my hair feels thicker and stronger. Will continue to use and hope to reduce hair loss.</li>
    <li> My roommate had some of this shampoo and I figured I would give it a shot as I was a little worried about my hair getting more thin. Needless to say I was blown away by the results I saw after about a week of use. My hair was noticeably more thick, so I had to buy a bottle of my own. I would recommend this to anyone who is in the market for anti hair loss shampoo</li>
    <li> It really works great on hair reduces hair loss and also conditions scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months. I started noticing my hair getting thicker within two weeks of use. I strongly recommend this product to anyone starting to lose hair or with thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for several years now. It has been working great. My hair is thicker and has great volume.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I used to have thick hair. After I used accutane, I suffered from mega hair loss and my hair is now really thin. For years, I used the red bottled herbal essence shampoo and conditioner. I missed my old thick hair and would try anything to get it back the way it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for two months and I think my hair is already getting better. I don&#x27;t have a need for conditioner. With this shampoo, I also stared using a wide tooth comb instead of a bush, I think that has helped as well. I&#x27;m losing less hair every time I comb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> So Far I think this is working!!  The only drawback is that it is hard to comb your hair ...I&#x27;ve starting using a little childrens no more tangles spray....That seems to help....Keeping it away from my scalp.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first maybe because I wasn&#x27;t used to the type. However, after continuously using it for about a month, I have noticed that my hair is fuller and seemed stronger. It does not make my hair shiny as I expected.</li>
    <li> Already stopped the hair loss after a couple weeks............very high quality ingredients/product............I&#x27;m optimistic for regrowth of the lost hair</li>
    <li> i believe this shampoo is not for everyone or for some certain types of hair.  It has been more than a week since i started using the shampoo and i can never comp my hair because it feels like i trying to comb cardboard. It makes your hair really dry and uncomfortable. If you are aiming to make your hair to feel like trees are growing on your skull, then this what you need. For less than the money you spend on this product, you can transplant real trees on your head.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, really helped with the hair loss. My hair looks amazing and healthy.</li>
    <li> Leave hair so clean and manageable.</li>
    <li> Over the past few years I developed a condition resulting from a surgery called telegyn effluvium. My hair has been extensively shedding on and off for 1.5 years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say if this product has helped it grow bc I&#x27;m taking over vitamins and using other products yet I can say definitively that my hair feels thicker, it&#x27;s easy on my hair and I can use it daily, my hair is falling out less, my hair is healthier. I&#x27;ve just bought my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but after I use it my hair feels very refreshed.  Very expensive shampoo though, results TBD...</li>
    <li> So far shampoo is great, I am suppose to wait for 3 months for results</li>
    <li> It does clean your hair and scalp. Leaves very clean feel after shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it. fragrance is not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it does require multiple pump to have that foaminess on mid long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Mine goes below shoulder and with couple of pumps, it does not have enough foaming to clean my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I need to pump 3~4 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it does clean very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely saw less hair loosing, but unfortunately, no hair growth either. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> My favorite hair shampoo so far. Have finished one bottle already. It gentle clean your hair but stimulate your hair to grow. Loved this product and is going to keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> omg..this is one of the best shampoo ever!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was so worried about losing my hair before I got this item&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for only few days so far.. but it actually works so well&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t leave with this anymore.. lol&lt;br /&gt;love it!!!</li>
    <li> My husband and I decided to try this out.  We are using it along with Biotin and it works great!! I am  not sure about the loss prevention, but my hair feels thicker and my husband agrees.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I will ever use. I&#x27;m very sensitive to other brands and ingredients, and I also wanted to stay away from harsh chemicals. This shampoo leaves my hair smooth, straight, and oily free. I get complements on how soft and full my hair looks. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Just started using but it&#x27;s a nice shampoo with a refreshing scent.  Love that it is all natural.  Will update in three months.</li>
    <li> I have waited several months to review this shampoo, to give it a good test. I am a 60+ woman with very fine, very wavy, thinning hair and some male pattern balding. The hair loss runs in the family, so I can hardly expect a shampoo to be the magic bullet. And while I can&#x27;t really say whether it has helped with hair loss, it HAS helped make the most of what I have. It gives some volume and body to my hair, which is realistically the most I could expect. I bought my first bottle of the Gold Pura d&#x27;or after trying several REALLY expensive (I am talking to you, AVEDA &amp;#34;invati&amp;#34;) products that just made my hair unmanageable without helping with hair loss. This shampoo is a helpful part of my regime, that includes Osis+ salt spray and making some minor changes to how my stylist cuts my hair. I figure I have to shampoo my anyway, so I might as well get volume and texture from a hair designed for thinning hair. I will continue purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This thing is a huge waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t regrow hair, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair thicker and fuller, well in fact it does the opposite because it made my hair into a lighter color which makes it look thinner than it actually is. I can&#x27;t believe I paid over $30 for a shampoo. The only good thing I can say about this thing is that it uses natural ingredients but you might as well just use water because that&#x27;s how your hair comes out looking like.</li>
    <li> I know were all different but this did nothing to help with my problem :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo daily for about 4 weeks now and have noticed only subtle results so far in terms of hair thickness. I&#x27;m hopeful that with continued use I will see more significant results since you&#x27;re supposed to allow 90 days of continuous use to see results. Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I actually like the smell of this product... like incense.  I use it along with Nizoral and my hair is growing back after having thyroid and other endocrine imbalances.  I use this and alternate with the Nizerol shampoo, take MSM supplements, and use MSM gel rubbed into my hairline at night  (both also sold on Amazon).  If you don&#x27;t know the cause of your hair loss have your MD check your A1C (glucose level).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Editing my review April 2016 for fellow sufferers:  I have found after doing TONS of research trying to find the answers to hair loss that it is important to have a sufficient Ferritin levels (ask your doctor to check your blood), I started taking Iron purchased here on Amazon-Solargar Gentle Iron, 25 mg). You need iron to grow hair.  Also, many people do not know that DHT in your system will kill your hair follicles.  I have had itchy scalp during shedding periods that had no other symptoms that are common with hair loss such as flaking, inflammation, etc. and I read in a hair loss forum that the ingredients in over the counter Tagamet can block the DHT from attacking your hair follicle.  I purchased it here on Amazon for less than Target.  Yes, two a day, along with Iron, this shampoo and Nizerol 2% and my hair is growing back, rapidly I am so happy to say.  If you have an issue with breakthrough itch which I&#x27;d have occasionally and would cause a shed I used Children&#x27;s Benadryl. It will also stop the itch within hours and it too blocks the DHT but is not good for long-term use. Jason Thin to Thick is also a great shampoo and conditioner if your hair is thinning (available here on Amazon) and it smells great.  I know many doctors are not much help and do not make your hair loss a priority so it was through my own research that I discovered these things.</li>
    <li> I have been using this everyday for two weeks. Haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth yet. Will give it to the end of the bottle and then review again. Want this one to work! 😉</li>
    <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s truly organic. I also bought the tranquility shampoo and love them both. My hair and scalp feel great. It does have a strong but pleasant scent. If you like unscented, this might not be for you. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> All it does stops loosing hair. Going trough second bottle, seems pretty stable.&lt;br /&gt;Will post any progress.</li>
    <li> I heard about this shampoo from my friend who claimed it really helped her so I figured I might as well try. The smell of the shampoo is not horrible but not so great but for what it does it worth it! It really makes a difference! My hair was falling everywhere and after using this shampoo for a short time I noticed less and less of my hair falling. This is a great shampoo to help with hair loss! Only reason I&#x27;m not rating it five stars is because of the smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice effect on hair.  Leaves hair clean, not greasy and manageable.  Has not had any hair retaining benefits for me but I like is so much I plan on continuing to use this product.  I have recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, perfect for daily use.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle as a gift and loved it! it has a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or greasy. It&#x27;s gotten thicker and looks the healthiest its looked in years. I will definitely continue to use it. Price is a little much but I only wash my hair three times a week at most.</li>
    <li> Update: I used it for a while. The product ended up drying out my hair. They claimed a free bottle with review but was never received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I are enjoying this shampoo. I have much less breakage and shedding now and my husband says he likes how his hair feels and enjoys the smell.</li>
    <li> I feel this shampoo is very useful. Before I used it, my hair always get very oily, and sometimes it smells, which really troubles me. I tried several similar products, but none of them is as advertised. Then I googled best anti-loss hair shampoo and this is what I found. It was amazing that my hair seldom get oily after using it. Come and try it~</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  I have not used it enough to tell if it will slow down the shedding of my hair or help with growth, but it does give my hair a lot of extra body.  It also has a nice smell to it and actually leaves my hair feeling clean, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past that are similar.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo.  Probably the only shampoo I have ever used in my lifetime that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like straw (I have dry-type hair).  My feels great, don&#x27;t need any conditioner.  Only time will tell with continued use to see what it will actually do to the health of my scalp.</li>
    <li> I am a Doctor, and have never left a review before...stress, long hours, germ prevention caps, and aging, have been an ugly combination for my noticeable thinning hair.  I tried other regowth formulas without success, and thought I would throw money in the pot for one more product and BINGO!  Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti- Hair loss Shampoo (Gold Label), seems to be working fast, effectively, with fantastic results!  Slight balding areas have filled in, and my hair has never been so thick and healthy.  I STRONGLY recommend this product for fabulous results.  I plan to use pura d&#x27;ors other products!</li>
    <li> I have had good success with this product so far.  I used the blue label and while I wouldn&#x27;t say it actually made me grow new hair, it definitely stopped my current balding.  My hair is starting to recede in a noticeable way and I have tried at least five different hair loss shampoos and conditioners.  After using the blue at least 5-6 days per week, I noticed that my hair stopped receding.  Once I finished the bottle and started using other products I still had not finished, my hair started to recede again. I just picked up this gold label and again noticing my hair to stop receding.  I tried the Aveda, Your Crown and Glory, Jasons, Avalons and this one worked the best.  I am hoping to maybe see some actual growth with this gold label but if you want to stop your current hair less, I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that the Argan oil is not the main ingredient but I guess that is to be expected. The fact that this is also not tested on animals and has mostly organic ingredients is a big plus.  I have not tried the conditioner.  I just use this shampoo 6 days a week and then will use Aveda shampoo and conditioner one day a week, which is good for your hair to not use the same thing every day.</li>
    <li> I have some family history of early balding, so I preempted the inevitable by using DHT blocking shampoo.  Originally that was Nioxin but after they sold out to Proctor &amp; Gamble (or whoever), I heard they cheapened the formula.  I heard about Pura d&#x27;or and made the switch.  It&#x27;s got a very nice feel, and I&#x27;m not bald yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They send you an offer to review for a free bottle, which is a scam.  So I de-rated from 5 to 3 stars</li>
    <li> Received my 2 bottles a few weeks ago and both my husband and I have been using it.  You have to use more then regular shampoo to get a good suds but once you do it suds up.  My hair has been thinning a lot lately and this is why I&#x27;m trying it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet but I only had the product for a few weeks.  Purad&#x27;or smells really great and leaves your hair very soft.  I will keep using and post another review after a few months.</li>
    <li> My hair is noticeably thicker (not a huge amount but noticeable) since using this shampoo. I took away a star because of the bottle.  The pump on one dispenser didn&#x27;t work, and I have had to open and pour as the contents get low.</li>
    <li> Great product. working well.</li>
    <li> This stuff will work if you are consistent.  I can absolutely tell a noticeable difference in the overall thickness of my hair.  Consistency is the key!!</li>
    <li> Actually works! I ordered a second bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this shampoo, It cleans good without drying my hair and the scent was great and it always left my hair clean, shiny and soft and for not a lot of money, My hair seems to respond well to this non-sulfate product.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it could be found in retail stores and will recommend it to my family and friend.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair in great condition--no more frizziness and dryness.  I also am begiining to see some new and darker growth coming in.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month, I haven&#x27;t see very significant improvement on decreasing the hair lost. But I still will recommend this product, since it significantly improved my scalp condition, feels so clean and much less inching.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 2 months ago as I suffering from hair loss and hair thinning. I think 2 months is a little too early to judge but I did notice that it&#x27;s making my hair less oily (when you wash your hair it actually feels and looks clean) whereas with other shampoos that I used previously for volume all they do is make you hair look dirty the whole time. Not sure if it had helped my hair loss (it&#x27;s only been two months) but I reordered the shampoo and am willing to give a try for at least 6 months to fully evaluate. I am giving it a 4 star as I like the product not quite 5 yet until I see the results for the hair loss.</li>
    <li> I AM STILL BALD - DOES NOT WORK!!!</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair that is prone to falling out when I am stressed. My hair is the bane of my existence and I have therefore tried dozens of shampoos and hair products to make my hair look/feel/be thicker. I didn&#x27;t think Pura d&#x27;or would help, just like all the others hadn&#x27;t but at this point I was willing to try anything. I am extremely surprised at the results, despite having read so many of the positive reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a month now and there is a huge difference. First, I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner that weighs my hair down. Just the shampoo is enough. Second, my hair is soft and FULL. It looks like I&#x27;ve never had any problem with hair loss. I am in love with this product and it is entirely worth the price to me. I&#x27;m never going back to another product again. I&#x27;ve finally found something that works.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of days but I really enjoy it. The shampoo feels great in my hair and provides a good clean. I look forward to seeing the results!</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not really one to buy into hype.  To be honest, I thought this was maybe more like snake oil.  It&#x27;s hard for me to believe something that&#x27;s organic would have anything in it that would actually work, but I figured the reviews were good, and it wasn&#x27;t a ton of money.  I&#x27;m a natural skeptic, so I expected there had to be some tiny result after a couple weeks.  I&#x27;m 44 and still have about 75% of my hair. No obvious bald spot, just a bit of receeding and thinning.  It&#x27;s gotten worse this last year.  My dad has a thin bit up top, but my brother is completely bald and has been for many years.  Anyway, it works.  I cannot conceivably think there is any coincidence.  By growth length of the new short hairs, it had to have started working day 1. Seriously.  So, my hair is coarse and straight.  Used to be super thick.  I have a part on the side, and noticed I could see a couple inches back on my scalp as it thinned out.  Now, it&#x27;s getting harder to see after a couple weeks.  There is a ton of new hairs now half an inch long.  They are a little bit finer than my normal hair, but they&#x27;re in there, and hundreds of em and seems  like they&#x27;re getting thicker.  Now, one thing that is a little disappointing is that they&#x27;re not growing in the sides of my forehead where the hair stopped growing entirely.  Seems like they&#x27;re only growing in places where my scalp didn&#x27;t totally give up.  So, I&#x27;m disappointed I didn&#x27;t start this shampoo a long time ago, but I am thrilled it&#x27;s a product that actually works!  I wash my face, then shampoo up, then wash everything else and shave in the shower. By that time it&#x27;s been about 2 minutes and I rinse out the shampoo.  Great product.  Now if they had a pill I could swallow that would help me lose weight....</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. Does tend to dry out hair a bit if you are not using a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for a week and there&#x27;s already a difference in my hair! It&#x27;s amazing! My hair feels softer and healthier! I was iffy buying this at first but I&#x27;ve read good reviews about and decided to try it out and I&#x27;m loving it so far!</li>
    <li> They offer free products for good reviews!!!</li>
    <li> Nice subtle scent.  Does not lather alot but cleans and leaves hair manageable.  It seems to make hair fuller and possibly halt further loss.  No chemicals is a plus.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband, he loves it. It seems like his hair stop shedding, he also use it for his mustache &amp; eyebrow</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but from Pura d&#x27;or website to ensure I didn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;fake product&amp;#34; some reviews suggest.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to be 38 and I&#x27;m experiencing hair loss and thinning.&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo made my hair fall out more!! I used it for over a week straight, and my hair was coming out in gobs while washing and combing.  I even noticed more shedding during day and constantly picking hairs off me, something not usual before using this product.  I even Bought the Gold label in hopes it would give better results. Nope. If anything my hair is worse. Left hair dry and straw like and a big increase in hair loss. I&#x27;ve contacted pur a&#x27; dor directly so I can ship back the two bottles I purchased.</li>
    <li> wow.. helped with hair loss so much</li>
    <li> smells AMAZING, feels great, and my hair is looking better and better!</li>
    <li> Shampoo lathers well and leaves hair feeling clean.  Hair loss impact seems limited (perhaps slowing the hair loss), but I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Stripped my hair color though it says right on the bottle that it is &amp;#34;color safe.&amp;#34; Otherwise nice hair building product...could not return after 30 days:(</li>
    <li> This is a great all natural product that protects your hair from damage and falling out. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, my hair feels stronger and looks thicker.  The only drawback to this product is the smell, it&#x27;s a combination of cloves and other herbs.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but I was told my hair smells like insecticide.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  I will update in a month.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say my hair has got better!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different kind of shampoos for hair loss. This one is exceptional! In just a matter of week, The amount of hair that I&#x27;ve been losing has reduced. From around 30 strands of hair a day from my previous shampoo to only 1-3 strands of hair, now that I&#x27;ve started using this amazing shampoo. My hair felt thicker and shinier too. My scalp feels cleaner and free of any and itch free. I would highly recommend this shampoo to all the people out there who&#x27;s suffering from excessive hair loss. You will feel the difference in your hair and scalp in just a few days of using this product.</li>
    <li> Smells weird and dries my hair out. Didn&#x27;t really give it a chance to work.</li>
    <li> My hair is back to growing wildly and the bald patches near the front are gone.</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients in this shampoo.  It is a natural shampoo with no SLS so don&#x27;t expect for it to be bubbly like your general OTC shampoo.  My hair loss is maybe less but has not stopped.  It is difficult to say for sure that this product has helped but at least I am not washing my hair with a bunch of chemicals.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo for hair loss and just overall healthy hair.  I use it daily with [[ASIN:B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]] and I can not believe the complete transformation my hair has gone through. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE carrier oil, or just oil for skin, hair, and nails. I have many oils that I rotate around, but this one is my favorite by far.  This oil can be used safely as a hydration oil, carrier oil, or just an oil to help your skin heal from dryness, cracked lips, chapped skin from the cold, and I am sure many other uses.</li>
    <li> So far so good, noticeable results after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> My second bottle of Pura d&#x27;&#x27;or arrived today.  This shampoo is fantastic!  Not only did it reverse my rapid hair loss due to some chemotherapy, but it also has given my hair more body than it had ever had and it looks much healthier and shinier than it has in a long time.  My husband did not have any of the problems I had, but he tried it once and has become an advocate also.  No need to have &amp;#34;problems&amp;#34; to use this shampoo. It is great as an everyday shampoo as well as a corrective shampoo.  Alicia Laws</li>
    <li> I will not say it is a miraculous product. However, I do believe it helps preventing your hair from falling. It seems to work well for me (I have been using it for 4 month now). I would definitely recommend this product and I will most likely be buying this product again unless I can find something better, which I haven&#x27;t so far.</li>
    <li> I am a 54 year old female experiencing hair loss related to peri-menopause. It was very discouraging to see a lot of hair in my brush, on my clothing, and even in my vacuum cleaner! I had tried other products that were supposed to reduce hair loss but none really worked for me because they were formulated to prevent breakage rather than stop the shedding of hair due to DHT in the scalp. I purchased this product mainly because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I have been using it daily for about a month and I am so pleased with the results than I have just ordered my second bottle. It has noticeably reduced the shedding. I no longer have hairs randomly falling off throughout the day and when I comb out my hair after shampooing far fewer strands are shed. Not only does this product help with my hair loss, it also makes my hair feel so clean and has stopped my scalp itch.  I appreciate the organic ingredients and I plan to continue using this product.  I had been changing shampoos frequently because my hair so often felt weighed down by the parabens and waxes they contain. Ladies, although hair loss is fairly common due to hormonal changes during menopause, be sure to rule out other causes for shedding; thyroid disease and certain medications can cause hair loss. Also, take a good quality multi-vitamin formulated for women over fifty. Let your hair air dry as often as possible and don&#x27;t brush excessively. This shampoo is great!</li>
    <li> Amazing! My hair has not felt better in a very long time! I feel clean and fresh! I have noticed an immediate difference in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
    <li> love this product, haven&#x27;t been using it very  long, but I believe it is working.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this, I definitely notice less hair in the drain.  I believe this product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> the smell is quite different from other shampoo, but I like it. I do not know it would work as it claimed, I will wait and see.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for two months now and definitely see an improvement in having fuller hair. It&#x27;s great that it is organic and does not have the chemicals other shampoos have, and cheaper than alternatives. Look forward to seeing the results after even longer use.</li>
    <li> a little dab will do ya...lathers well, smells neutral, and rinses out cleanly...head feels good afterwards...good product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite sometime now. I think it is great and intend to keep using this product......my hair looks and feels better than ever. My hair loss seems to have stopped and I don&#x27;t notice the inflammation that I once had.</li>
    <li> 40 yr old Female using for about a month. Still seeing some hair loss when I shower/brush my hair.... but seems to be lessened. Do not notice my hair just falling out w/o touching it anymore. Product requests 4 months (standard to see results as the follicles have to heal and regrow hair. It is unrealistic to expect IMMEDIATE results- the body doesn&#x27;t generally work that way.), so giving it that long. Am also taking oral DHT blocking supplements, as well as thyroid support herbal supplements as recommended by my chiropractor, and using Wen as my leave-in conditioner. I have shoulder/upper back length hair, light brown, very fine, naturally slightly wavy, but after one day, looks like I have no body and lies flat on my head. No noticeable thickening of the strands as yet or new growth- but in all fairness, I COULD have some, I just can&#x27;t see it due to the texture and quality, and length of my hair. No other chronic health issues.Lastly... it also smells really good. :) You can really smell the tea tree oil, very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best product I ever used for hair loss so far and its organic! Within just a few days of using it, my hair felt thicker and stronger and it seems like is not falling as much. Keep in mind that this product can be a little bit drying but nothing a good conditioner or leave in product cannot solve. From my experience with hair loss shampoos so far, this drying effect is extremely common, but contrary to the other products, this one makes my hair very shinny and it doesn&#x27;t mess with my hair color.  Another thing to keep in mind is that this shampoo does not foam a lot (which is usual in natural shampoos) so don&#x27;t use a lot in order to make more to try to produce more foam or you&#x27;ll end up with crunchy hair. So far, I love this shampoo and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been facing this hair loss problem since my graduation. I was searching for a product that will stop my hair loss and help me gain my charm look back. I have used a number of hair tonic oil. Apart from using oil, I have also taken many medicines. But the result was unchanged. I was fading up and planning to go for hair plantation. It was really expensive, so I couldn’t afford it. Suddenly, after reading a review from this site, I attracted towards this unique product of Pura d&#x27;or premium anti-hair loss shampoo. After using it for a month, my hair loss problem slowly reduced. And, after two months, I’ve no hair loss problems and noticed the newly grown as well. Amazing!</li>
    <li> leaves my hair clean and  and conditioned. Plus no chemicals to cause health problems.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works!  I have been having issues with my hair falling out for a couple of years now and have tried all kinds of growth treatments including Nioxin, biotin, other &amp;#34;growth&amp;#34; shampoos and supplements but they all just addressed the growth. The hair loss has continued until now. It also leaves my hair really clean but maybe a little too clean for colored hair. it seems to make it more frizzy so use a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!! Bought this with very high hopes based on the reviews. After several months my hair is in even worst shape than when I first started using it. Should have listened to the 1 and 2 star reviews.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen large scale re-growth yet but my hair loss seems to have at least stopped. I have also been using other loss prevention products along with this. Will have a follow-up review after a few more month.</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers well and smells like a botanical garden.  I&#x27;ve used the blue label shampoo in the past and had good results with it.  This time I went for the gold and so far, I&#x27;ve been happy.  I feel like it is cleansing my hair and scalp sufficiently and providing it with nourishing nutrients.  My hair feels better.  I&#x27;ve noticed less fall-out and more manageability.  It is my only shampoo now.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. Smells like pine needles.</li>
    <li> Very effective product. Bought this for my mom to try, and she has been extremely pleased with this shampoo.  It contains organic ingredients, but because it seems like a medicinal product rather than just a commercial shampoo, I was concerned that it might have a chemical-type smell. However, it smells great and has a luxurious feel. Rinses out nicely leaving hair very silky and smooth.  After using it for a couple of months, she did notice a marked improvement in hair loss as well.  Would recommend giving this shampoo a try to improve the health of your hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this shampoo. I really find that I stop losing more hair than before, waiting for new growth. It says it should take at least 3 months to see the effect. This shampoo smells good and I just press few of liquid which is enough for my long hair.</li>
    <li> I just finished the first bottle and I have to say the shedding reduced noticeably&lt;br /&gt;which I thought shampoo could never do.&lt;br /&gt;But the best part is that my hair looks better than ever. Full, silky, shiny with deeper color from something that could only be described as brittle mess.&lt;br /&gt;That I guess thanks to only natural ingredients which justifies the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it even if you don&#x27;t have a problem with hair loss.</li>
    <li> Bought this product several months ago and used it together with the shampoo. Noticed hair growth about a month after use. My barber also noticed. The regrow is limited to short and thin hair so far, not enough to change the appearance completely. I am happy with the results and hope that with time, long and stronger hair will appear.</li>
    <li> Just started using it, so we will see. So far I really like it!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo about 3 weeks ago and i started to use it the same day because the package came spilling. The shampoo smells good and is silky feeling. After washing my hair with the shampoo, my hair felt silky, soft and full of body. I really like that my hair had a little body after because my hair is very thin. I would buy this product again regardless of the spilling.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo... Expensive but I don&#x27;t lose my hair anymore :-)</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is lovely! The bottle makes it easy to use, and I continue to be amazed at how many things this oil can be used for. Skin, nails, hair. My hands have been cracked from the Winter, and within two days the cracks were gone. It&#x27;s also great on dry hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Hair feels silky and full after a wash.  This is my first bottle so not sure if its growing hair but certainly feels full after a wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month.  I think I might be seeing a difference in the amount of hair that goes down the sink with each washing. What I do know is that this shampoo smells great, lathers great and makes my hair look better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve EVER used. (nice fullness, body and shine)</li>
    <li> Great product!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very good product! I have been trying this for a month and it seems like it does the job! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I been looking for this for ever I try some other ones but nothing help I been using this for 3 weeks and I seen a change on the amount of hair I was losing every time I showered .my Hair looks very nice even if I don&#x27;t put nothing on it I seriously recommend this shampoo is Awesome and it work perfect for my hair loss problem thanks PURA D OR!!!! :)</li>
    <li> After just two uses i can definitely notice my hair feeling and looking thicker. You don&#x27;t need to use much of it and it leaves hair feeling soft, with a nice scent. As an added bonus it is free of parabens and sulfates Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> and a 45 years old male and a very good health condition on a very decent hair so I was doing some research on internet about the hair thickness and I&#x27;ve saw so many 5 stars on the shampoo so I decide to give them a try so so I ordered a bottle and arrived very quick the first time I try it I was so excited because you know I was reading that this is all organic products and I use you like to eat used orgnic stuff  after I took a shower my hair turn out to be very dry that morningg but I say maybe that&#x27;s the way that it stof  work after couple days of using this product my head turn out to be very very itchy and it did not take too long maybe 3 or 4 times after washing I was losing hair like crazy my head was start shading like never before so I decide to going back to my regular shampoo that I&#x27;ve been shampoo first so many years take me about it two weeks to my hair go back to normal so do yourself a favor and save your money and save your hair and if you do not believe my review why not give them a try and see what&#x27;s going to happen because I hate this when people trying to be a millionaire by making other people losing them Harris this is horrible horrible horrible</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this shampoo!  I had some thinning on top which was exacerbated after my pregnancy.  I was losing clumps of hair every time I even touched it and the thinning on the top and sides was starting to worry me.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 3 months and my hair is starting to grow back in those thin areas!!  I&#x27;m so pleased.  I also find that I don&#x27;t lose as much when I wash or brush now.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or Premium Shampoo Brown and Blue since 2013 and was happy with the results. Because of the positive results I decided to try the Pura d&#x27;or Gold Label Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo and am extremely happy with this product. It has DHT blockers that help to prevent further hair loss. Before using this product, I had noticeable hair loss. Since using this product, I have noticed a significant decrease in the amount of hair loss and if anything my hair loss seems to have stopped. My head of hair now is fuller, thicker and healthier. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for one months, less lossing hair when I take shows.</li>
    <li> I am a male in my 30&#x27;s and I have been battling hair loss since I was 18, its not fun when you start to lose your hair even for a guy, your self esteem goes down and you you try to hide your bald spots with caps and hats. Ive tried many products over the years, but none have had any promising effects. Ive tried shampoo after shampoo but never achieved promising results, my hair strands would get thin and weak and eventually fall off daily. ive even considered surgery as a last resort but its too expensive, so ive been saving for a future surgery. Recently ive been watching you tube videos on the best anti hair loss shampoo and saw a video on pura d&#x27; or premium organic anti hair loss shampoo and how its the best shampoo on the market to battle hair loss. I was thrilled and excited to read all the positive comments on this shampoo as well as the reviews on Amazon that ive decided to give it a shot. The bottle arrived super fast, ive tried it the first time and noticed that it left my curly hair frizz free and soft, ive noticed immediately thickness in my hair and how strong my hair strand felt. Ive tried it the second time and noticed that there were tiny baby hairs growing in in my crown area and was so excited and happy, my first thought was a couple more uses and weeks and ill wont look like a bald old man anymore and dont have to wear hats anymore. Ive been using the shampoo every other day since ive received it and love it! each day my hair is growing more and as my hair grows, my bald spots are filling in. I cant wait till a couple of months past and then ill have a whole junk of hair, even my barber has noticed that I have more hair on my scalp. I give this shampoo four stars because its organic and has no harsh chemicals and leaves your hair strong, clean and healthy, plus its sold at a great price and is cheaper than other hair loss treatments, including surgery which now I dont think I need any time soon.</li>
    <li> great stuff, makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> When I used this product I notice after wards the shine that appeared due to the Argan Oil, one of the ingredients in the product. I also notice the nice smell and how soft my hair looked as well as how much more movement it had.&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret purchasing this before trying a product made of chemicals and ingredients that will ruin your hair in the long run&lt;br /&gt;I think this is one product that you will be better off trying first, than trying those name brands. What I like about this product is that its all natural and safe for everyone to use. There is never a bad time to replace your old shampoo for something that can keep your hair from becoming lifeless and thinner. The added DHT blocker helps prevent hair loss, and the nourishing ingredients help feed the scalp and your hair to become shiny, full of life, bounce, and increase growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Love the Shampoo. I guess the simple fact that you are not exposing your hair to toxic chemicals is a good thing to begin with. I am definitely seeing a decent improvement. I don&#x27;t see my hair falling at the same rate as it used to when I was using other shampoos. I have not seen the lather issue that other reviewers are complaining about. You have to use it for a few weeks before you can see tangible results.</li>
    <li> I suffered from hair lost for almost 2 months and I tried almost everything I could to stop it. My hair just kept losing and I was even afraid of washing hair when taking shower. Then I searched online to see if somebody else have same problem and how they fixed it. I read the review and found so many positive reviews at amazon for product, pura d&#x27;or. I decided to buy one and try again. This product is really amazing! Just one wash, I found the less hair lose in the morning than before. I have used it for one month and my hair lose is significantly reduced. I suggested this product to one of my friends who has the same problem because it really works!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to post two pictures. One was taken after first use of Pura d&#x27;or and the other one was taken after 1 month use.</li>
    <li> I have used other organic shampoos recently, this is by far the best one!&lt;br /&gt;So far I have only been using this product for one week, I already noticed a difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair now feels softer, thicker and has more volume. My scalp felt nourished after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am a female with straight fine medium length hair, I am using&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo with the Premium Organic Conditioner, the conditioner smells great!&lt;br /&gt;It is too soon to tell if the shampoo actually stop hair loss or regrow hair. I will continue using it and am very&lt;br /&gt;excited to see what happens after 3 months.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Really worked for us and a natural alternative to other hair-loss treatments.</li>
    <li> I used the blue label prior to purchasing the gold label product and so far I like the results.  My hair feels and looks thicker.  I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo for my boyfriend who has thinning hair.  He has been using for a month and he  absolutely loves it! Compared to other shampoos, this one makes his hair feel and look fuller and gives it more body.  Since it is organic, I know he isn&#x27;t putting unnecessary chemicals on his scalp which can prevent normal hair growth.  We will definitely be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and a sensitive scalp.  Typically I need to rotate shampoos every couple of weeks because they stop cleaning well and cause itchy scalp with dandruff.  I have tried a number of different products specifically for dandruff control and I have tried products containing no sulphates.  It always leads to the same experience.  I have used Pura d&#x27;or daily for 4 months now with excellent results.  It has been the only product I have used during the period and I have had no irritated scalp or dandruff. Another compelling aspect of this product is that I usually have to shampoo twice to get clean hair.  It&#x27;s not necessary for me with Pura d&#x27;or.  Other benefits have been that I have experienced little to no hair loss and I feel that my hair is allot healthier in general.  I mention the hair loss bit last with disclosure; I also started to take a multivitamin and biotin at the same time I started with Pura d&#x27;or.  Regardless of which is the main contributor for lack of hair loss, I will continue to use this product as it is a very good shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic shampoo since July 2013 and I&#x27;ve already gone through three bottles of Anti Hair loss Shampoo and I have to say that this is simply the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I have a history of thinning hair and receding hair line. I remember waking up each morning to a lot of hair on my pillow which was quite stressful and thought that I&#x27;d be bald by now. I tried a different shampoo before in the past which had long list of complicated artificial ingredients in which most of them sounded straight out a lab. So i stopped using it after the first bottle and switched to Pura d&#x27;or and must say that I am tremendously happy. It cleans my scalp so perfectly and leaves my hair really nice and soft but never ever oily and best of all my pillow is virtually free from hair. On occasion I&#x27;ll see a strand of hair here and there which is pretty normal. And when I look at my older pictures I can see that I have an improved density and my scalp isn&#x27;t as noticeable which means i have gained back some hair. I also really like the spa like scent of this shampoo which is mild. Lastly, only a small pea sized portion is more than enough to completely lather my entire head.  So this is an amazing product for those who want a quality shampoo with natural ingredients, with helps again hair loss. A bonus,  It is not animal tested.</li>
    <li> This is really a good shampoo which could help you to fight against hair loss. Use it for at least a month you will find how magic this shampoo is. The most important thing is this shampoo is organic. This means it will be very good for your health!</li>
    <li> This is a second time I am using this product. A while back friend of mine gave me a sample of this product that he got from his hair dresser. I&#x27;ve used it for a month and really liked it. Main thing I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair slowly stopped shedding. Much less hair in the shower was a win for me. Unfortunately, I ran out of it and never got around to get it again. For last few weeks I have noticed that my hair started thinning out again so my first thought was to find this product again and Amazon was the only place I could trust to get the real thing from. I have a high hopes to see positive results while on this product and I will keep updating my experience with this product throughout the next 6 months. Wish me a luck..</li>
    <li> I received my shampoo today and washed my hair only once but wanted to express my opinion so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 43-year-old woman, with fine curly color-treated long hair. My hair is extremely freezy, which makes it quite difficult to use typical shampoos for thinning hair (have tried Nioxin, Framesi, etc.): they strip my hair of the natural oils and make impossible to comb through and style. This was not the case with Pura d&#x27;or! So Ladies, don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase this one if you have long hair! :)))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the shampoo is horrific though (like stinky urine!) but the conditioner (blue Pura d&#x27;or) neutralizes it so my hair smells ok in the end. And if the stink is the price to pay for keeping my hair intact, I am willing to pay it! :))))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shedding, the 1st time I used it, ir went from a hand-full to just 3-4 in the shower, and probably 50% improvement during the 1st after-shower brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update my review after using this product for 60 days in regards to the thinning areas</li>
    <li> IT IS REALLY WORKING NOT FAST BUT WORKING.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 months. I have not noticed any less hair loss. I did notice that my hair is much fuller and shinier though. This fullness has been been noticed by other people who have commented how full and shiny my hair is. I have had a problem of my scalp breaking out with other shampoos over the last year. I have not had this problem with this shampoo. I am gong to order more of this shampoo because of all the positive benefit of using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but I think it&#x27;s working.  I don&#x27;t seem to have as much hair loss.  Hopefully, with time, it&#x27;ll help by stopping the hair loss!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an organic shampoo and I love it.  So far it is helping with hair loss.  I have shoulder length hair and I use 3 to 4 pumps every time that I wash my hair and afterwards it feels so soft and looks healthy.  There is no miracle product that will completely stop hair loss (especially if it is in your genes), but I know that using this shampoo combined with the Biotin pills that I take daily (10,000 mcg) have made a huge difference. I will definitely continue to use this shampoo and would recommend it to anybody that want to add something that works to their anti-hair loss routine.</li>
    <li> I guess I have sensitive skin because I&#x27;ve never been able to use a shampoo every day without irritation. I just started using it and so far this stuff is marvelous. I can use it every day. As to the effect it will have on hair loss, it&#x27;s too early to tell. It says it takes a minimum of three month&#x27;s use before I can expect to see a difference. Anyway, so far I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. They do high quality products.</li>
    <li> very helpful. can save hairloss</li>
    <li> The Shampoo is really great! Though the price is not that cheap, but it last for a really long time. I do not know whether it is the effect of physiology or it is the shampoo, I feel I had less hair loss is reduced after I started to using this. It is all natural and I think I&#x27;ll continue to use it and will report later after I use it up.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a little while now and I like the results.  I&#x27;ve noticed a couple spots I&#x27;ve had clearing up.  I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using.</li>
    <li> Female hair loss and was getting worse. Purchased about 4 months ago.  I wash twice a week.  Hair loss has stopped except for a few during wash.  Am seeing some new growth and my hair feels stronger and looks healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos in the past but this shampoo has been the best one I&#x27;ve ever used before since my hair no longer falls out when I&#x27;m taking a shower!</li>
    <li> This review is on Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Argan Oil...shampoo.  Short and simple:  Not sure about the hair loss because we got for the good reviews written about psoriasis.  We keep it on our scalp for several minutes before rinsing (didn&#x27;t read any problems about doing that).  It seems to help a lot for a full day or more.  It seems to actually help heal or get rid of some of the scales -temporarily, but any relief is good relief!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing over 8 months of everyday use.I have talked to many who have tried it and no one had any results from it. This shampoo is unproven.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 63 and for a few years have been loosing hair.  Considered a transplant.  But didn&#x27;t want to spend time (takes months to recover)  I get extensions but they don&#x27;t solve the problem.  I don&#x27;t know if this is restoring hair but it really appears much fuller.  I also recommend a supplant&lt;br /&gt;Hair-maxx.  The women who does my extensions now recommends this supplant to all her clients.</li>
    <li> This is the first organic shampoo I have used and I truly like the way it makes my hair feel. I find it to be NOT drying at all, even when I don&#x27;t use a conditioner. I cannot attest to it&#x27;s anti-hair loss properties as I have been using it for only a few months and I am using it in conjunction with other products. I will reorder this shampoo.</li>
    <li> It did NOT help me at all after 3 bottles usage.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and he loves it! He noticed his hair loss stopped after only a few uses!</li>
    <li> Ive used this a couple of months back with a few other hair loss product and my hair stopped falling and have new hair growing.  I experimented to know which caused the growth of hair so I stopped using this first and continue on with the other hair fall products.  After sometime I realized that without the Pura d&#x27;or the hair does not grow back as fast as when I was using it and the texture and thickness is not as good so I decided to bring back this shampoo and have enjoyed the steady improvement of my mane.  My husband started using it also.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it makes my hair glossy and shiny. I have long hair and every time I would run my fingers through it a few strands off hair would fall out but not anymore. My hair is growing faster as well and what I also like is that this shampoo is very gentle on the scalp so no issues with build up. I&#x27;m not sure however if I can give credit to the shampoo alone as I regularly oil my hair, take supplements and try to eat foods with nutrients that help hair growth. I believe you need a combination of all these things along with a good quality shampoo if you&#x27;re suffering from hair loss and want to see rapid results. In that respect this shampoo is worth every cent. It seals the deal on all the other work I&#x27;m doing to protect my hair. The finishing is amazing.</li>
    <li> This product is great so far. The odor is nice and it feels like it is already making a difference on my hair. I will be waiting on what this product can do for my hair in the coming months.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does a great job adding extra body to thinning hair</li>
    <li> Since the price of Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo is slightly higher than the regular shampoo, initially I was skeptical on buying it. But all the reviews gave a confidence to go ahead and buy it. So far I am not regretting it. The shampoo makes the hair shiny and thick. Earlier when I comb the hair lot of hair used to fall. Close to 95% of it stopped now. I used to use Head and Shoulder before. When I use it for sure I have to use a conditioner. But with this  Pura d&#x27;or shampoo I don&#x27;t need an extra conditioner. I am not sure whether it&#x27;s only for my hair or for everyone else. It&#x27;s little more than a month I am using it now and definitely I am feeling good about it. My wife also started using it but she is says that the hair loss stoppage for her is not that fast as mine. But she loves the softy texture of her hair after started using the shampoo.  One last thing, a very little quantity is enough for the entire wash. No need to take took much quantity unlike the regular Sulfate shampoo&#x27;s. If you really serious about stopping the hair loss, definitely you can try this one. If you don&#x27;t like it there is nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I just start using this great product, and I feel good about it already. My hair is very oily and thin hair, and this shampoo can very effectively remove the oil and increase the volume of my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo have couple of weeks. I feel my hair is litter be dry when I used Shampoo, may use some condition for your hair as well, but it really helps with the loss of hair.  I will let my friends know this magic shampoo and When I run out, and have to go back to any store bought shampoo I will choose this is one.</li>
    <li> II simply loved this product. The search for the best organic shampoo finally ends.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a month so I cannot say if it is really fighting hair loss as yet. I still have hair falling off when I shower. I can say though that it has helped to reduce the dryness and irritation in my scalp. I have to use a lot of it to get a full lather in my hair but that is no problem since it is a result of not having any harsh chemicals that regular shampoo products use.</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo for several months now and definitely notice my hair is fuller. The areas where my hair was thinning seem to have more hair also. This does work for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband. His hair was thining out from the top and had itchy scalp. I got him this product. He&#x27;s tried it for about a month and a half. So far so good, no itchy scalp and his hair is either growing out or looking a little thicker. I think this works.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and tingle it gives your scalp. More volume to the hair and less hair shed.&lt;br /&gt;You can see the difference within a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several high end hair products but this is a keeper.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this two weeks ago and says that it is fantastic. It has made her hair fuller and she said it has stopped her hair from falling out already. She highly recommends it. I have even tried it and like the way my limited hair feels.</li>
    <li> So far after using this product, I can feel my hair getting thicker and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has more bounce than before, and overall it looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not to big with the packaging - because once the bottle is almost empty it&#x27;s harder to get the shampoo at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Also the shampoo will help with frizzy hair, as mine becomes more tamed than before.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> After almost a month of using this shampoo, I&#x27;ve did noticed a difference of how much lesser I&#x27;m losing hair. I would totally recommend this brand of shampoo to anyone who has a dramatic hair loss or fall outs like I do.</li>
    <li> My hair stopped shedding after one wash with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d have to say this bottle may be a slight better than the blue label. Scalp feels cleaner and hair feels thicker. It&#x27;s a little expensive for shampoo but its definitely worth a try for those who care about their hair. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my bottle but the gold label seems a little more water downed than the blue. But the ingredients speak for itself and that&#x27;s why I will continue using Purador&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> This is a truly great product with all the essential ingredients to prevent or slow down hair loss. Many other hair products have harsh chemicals while this product is natural and thoroughly tested. I highly recommend it to everyone reading this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for my purchases, but I have to this time. I should have believed the 1 start reviews before I made the purchase. Honestly, I would not have been writing this review if it&#x27;s just that it did not work or nothing has changed, meaning if it&#x27;s just that it did not have the effect that it claimed: &amp;#34;Reduces Shedding, Adds Body, Increases Volume &amp; Thickens Hair&amp;#34;. My response to &amp;#34;no change&amp;#34; products normally is just that &amp;#34;ok, I guess I will just try something different then&amp;#34;. However, I am writing this review because it&#x27;s not just simply it&#x27;s not working, it&#x27;s made it much worse. I have used the shampoo for a few weeks, and every time I noticed that it made hair shed like crazy. I have never had this problem with any other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used, organic or non-organic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the last 5 months. A bottle last&#x27;s me a long time because I cut my hair short. My hair has been thinning near my widows peak and the crown of my head and since I started using this product I started noticing a difference in the appearance. I&#x27;m still not sure if it&#x27;s made my hair thicker or if it&#x27;s new hair has starting growing back but it does look somewhat darker. I will post an update in the following weeks.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> i have tried all sorts of products....seriously. From the expensive to the cost effective. I am a fan of organics. When I first used the shampoo I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t clean my hair because the lather is mild. I was surprised that not only did it clean my hair but it allowed me to skip a shampoo the following day. The smell isn&#x27;t coconut or flowers, but it doesn&#x27;t stink like some of the other reviewers mentioned. I was so concerned with my hair loss that I was planning to scoop it up and keep it to take to the dermatologist. I haven&#x27;t been losing as much hair since I have been using this product. And as an added bonus my hair is super shiny.</li>
    <li> I used to have scalp itch really bad especially when my hormones flared up and since using this shampoo, my scalp feels healthy with no itch.  This shampoo has given my hair a smoother texture which I think you only need a little even though it doesn&#x27;t lather that much because it seems to weigh down finer hair if you use too much.  I think it has helped regrow my hair in the thin spots That I have had for years along with lipogaine.  I will keep purchasing this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great product that is effective over a period of time. Made in USA with premium benefits including lack of harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a lil over a month now and so far it&#x27;s been great!! I can&#x27;t say I notice a difference in regards to the amount of hair I have, but I can attest that it makes my scalp feel clean.  Love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain all the harmful chemicals that some other shampoos do. I will stick with this product!!</li>
    <li> This product works great! It made a drastic difference in the consistency of my hair and it feels thicker after only a few washes. I&#x27;m very satisfied and would definitely recommend it to anybody with thinning hair, or hair-loss problems.</li>
    <li> my hair has stopped falling considerably after using this product...only thing is you have use a lot of conditioner after using this shampoo...</li>
    <li> I really like Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo; it was my first time trying it and I believe it does help to prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Hair feels healthier by end of first week.  I have been using pura d&#x27;or products for over a year and hair loss seems to at least slowed down if not stopped.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. It made my hair super clean feeling, bouncy and full of life and shine, especially after the first few uses. It made my hair so strong and health, although I still lose my hair, but less than before. I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. As a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; female adult already losing hair, finding a product that will help prevent future loss is a MUST!!! My hair feels amazing after using this product. A huge plus for me is that it smells GREAT! Im the type of person who will buy or not buy a product no matter what the benefits based on smell. Who wants to have great looking hair that stinks???? This product is now my new &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34; shampoo!!</li>
    <li> My hair feels healthy and fuller than it has in a long time!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Argan oil. I have combination skin that dries out a lot during the winter and this oil has helped balance out my skin tremendously. It is absolutely amazing. I also use it in my hair (especially the ends) and it really helps brings back the moisture and also makes your hair super shiny. Love love love this product!!</li>
    <li> Left my hair very soft and fluffy. This is exactly what I have been looking for!</li>
    <li> I love all the natural ingredients.  This is a great investment and I feel like I will be using this shampoo for a very long time.  For those that complained of the smell, perhaps this is the first time they are using a natural product. With ingredients like rosemary oil and tea tree, the smell is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great product. Only had a for a few weeks but so far it&#x27;s working great for me, cleans very well and seems to be making my hair thicker and better manageable so far. I would definitely recommend this and I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and even though it&#x27;s an oil, it&#x27;s not greasy and never makes me break out.  i recommend it very much and use it now instead of Bio Oil  which i felt was too greasy, but did a good job evening out skin tone.  Plus-- Im part Moroccan, so I feel close to my motherland!</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer, I had earlier bought Pura d&#x27;or grey hair prevention shampoo and it really worked as a wonder it not only arrested further greying of my hair but I also noticed that it also minimized my hair loss too, thus this time I thought of trying premium organic anti-hair loss shampoo and I found it to be equally good. It has a very pleasant smell, like the one used in natural spa and it work out a good lather with just coin size of amount. I agree that its price tag is on higher side but is worth for organic natural ingredients which finally works too</li>
    <li> I saw results of thickness and volume the same day. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and it has cleared my dandruff/itchiness. I can no longer see my scalp showing because of the volume and thickness. My hair is sooo much shinier. I love it and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> it is a very good product</li>
    <li> you will not find a product like this anywhere. I use it my hair grows, I don&#x27;t, I lose my hair. Nuf said. 8 stars. 180 Percent. The world of hair loss treatments has never seen a product or tool like this before... Mark my words, you will see. Try it for a couple of days. You will be absolutely astounded. I know, because DHT has been wreaking havoc on my hair in a big way, especially in the last several months. My mind is at ease. I&#x27;m back in control with Pura D&#x27;Or. I just pray that they don&#x27;t fold or get bought out to where each bottle is 150 per... that&#x27;s how good this stuff is.</li>
    <li> I was looking for nice organic shampoo for our family and this left everyone&#x27;s hair full and healthy looking</li>
    <li> Although I have used several high-end shampoos, which I had been very happy with, I wanted to try Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Shampoo (Gold-Label) for stopping hair loss.  I found this shampoo, when used with their Organic Conditioner, to be a step above everything else I had ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first shampoo my hair was extremely shiny and silky with more volume and manageability than&lt;br /&gt;I had ever known. I could not believe how incredible my hair was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would also try Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s Argan Oil after I blew dry my hair.  I used just ONE drop.  It added even more shine and silkiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 5 Stars because it left my hair in such wonderful condition.  By the way, I am 69 year old woman, who colors her hair.  If this shampoo actually stops my hair loss I will want to give this product 10 Stars.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Ingredients Love the Argon Oil has really impacted the hair shine and texture. Thank you !</li>
    <li> Great product. First of all it works. I had some hair loss problems due to pregnancy and lactation. Now that I am suing the product for several weeks I can tell that hair became more full bodied, I don&#x27;t loose them as much I did before I started using the product. Hairs stay clean for three days as opposed to two days with other shampoos. The smell is amazing, it reminds me of those fancy smells at SPA during aroma therapy massage.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product  with  Pura d&#x27;or: Premium Organic Conditioner (16 fl. oz.)  (blue label). They work fine together, especially if you need smother hair. If I need more volume, I use just the  shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product smells and feels. Has some really fantastic, natural ingredients to help fight hair loss. I love the fact it has no SLS and no harsh chemicals, which helps prevent inflammation. The dispenser is designed more like a pump for hand soap than a shampoo - this was my only real issue with the product because I&#x27;m used to squeezing shampoo out of the bottle into in my hands (a much easier way of dispensing shampoo, in my opinion.) I think this is one of the best (if not the best) natural shampoos for fighting hair loss. Bottle says it can take up to 3 months of continued use to see results. My bottle lasted for almost ten months. If you are having bad reactions to stronger, chemical-based shampoos then this is definitely worth a try. I would like to see them add some kind of cayenne pepper extract to the mix because this shampoo already has soy isoflavone in it - used together they have been proven to regrow hair in Japanese studies. Also consider adding apple stem cells (apple poly) which is proven for regrow the with it&#x27;s procyandin b2. So, please add cayenne and apple poly to this would be even more powerful - not just for stopping hair loss but aiding in hair re-growth!!!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for six months now and my hair is noticeably stronger, shinier, and healthier. I&#x27;m in my late twenties and have developed quite a receding hairline. My scalp where it recedes was always sensitive and tingled. I decided to shave my head, and use only this shampoo with daily scalp massages. Six months in my scalp in the front is strong and sturdy, no longer sensitive, and my hair is long and shiny now. It&#x27;s very healthy and I don&#x27;t have to wash it as often. The best part about this shampoo is the smell. I get upset if I smell it on my wife though. Because it&#x27;s expensive and she uses handfuls to wash her super long hair!</li>
    <li> Really great shampoo. I love to let it sit on my hair while I shave and wash for best results.</li>
    <li> This product has worked faster on my hair than Pura d&#x27;or projected.  After using it for one month, my barber noticed the apparent improvement of my hair growth.  I hope PURA D’OR PREMIUM ORGANIC ANTI-HAIR LOSS SHAMPOO (GOLD LABEL) will continue work like this in the coming months.  Thank PURA D’OR, at least for now.</li>
    <li> After using Nizoral shampoo as a hair loss treatment, my hair was left dry, brittle, stripped, and irritated. I have since switched to pura d&#x27;or gold label shampoo because it is SLS and paraben free, but it also has hair loss prevention properties. In combination with the pura d&#x27;or conditioner, this shampoo cleans my hair while leaving my scalp and hair moisturized and feeling thicker. I would absolutely recommend this product as part of a hair loss prevention regimen, especially to those seeking an all-natural alternative or for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best!!!  I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long and my scalp feels much better.  My hair loss has slowed way down and new tiny hairs are coming in.  I&#x27;m very excited about the results so far.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a 28 year old man and I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. My hair loss has nearly stopped.  I can tell because I have no shedding when I comb or run my fingers through my hair.  Also the volume of my hair is substantially more.  I think this shampoo made my hair healthier.  I use to hold a mirror above my head and could see my scalp :( now I can barely see my scalp! I no longer do the combover or spend 30 minutes teasing my hair to get it just right to hide bald spots!! I will continue to use this product and have thrown away all my other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I love this natural shampoo.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks, and already notice less shedding and healthier hair.  It doesn&#x27;t lather much, which is great, as the lather comes from chemicals and has nothing to do with getting your hair clean.  Nice scent, has a nice little tingle too.  I like to leave it on for about 5 minutes.  My hair can get dry but also weighed down, and this shampoo moisturizes without weighing my hair down.  I use a deep conditioner afterwards.  My hair hasn&#x27;t looked so good in years.  Buy without hesitation - it&#x27;s a great product, and you won&#x27;t be pouring chemicals on your head (which absorb into your bloodstream).</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo 3 days ago and have been shampooing with it and leaving on for extra time. It leaves your hair feeling thicker, texturized, and healthy! The scent seems to be mostly of tea tree and you definitely need just one pump to fully lather your hair. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months it seems to helping some what. I&#x27;m not sure about growing new hair but it seems to be giving it a lot more body.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a nice smell, but the lather is just ok. It takes a lot of rubbing to get a nice lather and it doesn&#x27;t develop very much volume even after lots of rubbing (without vigorously rubbing out the hair we&#x27;re trying to preserve). Hard to tell if the anti-hair loss part works yet, but it definitely feels nice after applying. Will update as results develop (or not). Overall, it is a bit pricey for the small 16oz bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it goes in to your skin and keeps it soft.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice and, as I cannot comment on the long term effect on hair loss, I can say that my hair seems shinier and has more body.  This product has all organic ingredients that won&#x27;t strip or further damage fragile hair so how could you go wrong? I have used similar salon products that tout &amp;#34;all natural plant-derived ingredients&amp;#34; and are far more expensive and noticed that the second ingredient is alcohol. Nothing like that in this product. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The shampoo feels different going on than regular shampoo. It does not foam as much but it smells great. I have thinning hair and after two weeks I feel like my hair is thicker. The best thing about this product is that my hair lays better and is easier to style.</li>
    <li> I reviewed some products w/ DHT blockers, growth activators, volume enhancers, etc. on-line and was of course skeptical about most of them. I have tried a few others but nothing really seemed to make a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; difference.  I gave Pura d&#x27;or Premium Gold a chance, figured I would spend extra and get the best formula offered.  It has been over a month or so and I must admit my hair seems fuller and thicker. My hair also seems more healthier and has certainly brought back some life it has lost the last few years. Of course it will take months/years to see if it helps keep my hair and scalp healthy and continue to help retain what hair I have left, I am in early stages of loss so hoping for the best.  Great product so far and highly recommend as it is also one of the most natural products out there.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair-loss products before and nothing seemed to work. After trying this product, my hair looks a lot fuller. There are a lot of baby hair coming out of my head. I would recommend this product because it made my hair healthier when no other product did.</li>
    <li> Great product, will purchase again</li>
    <li> Does everything you think it can do; give it a few months and you will be pleased with the results. Awfully expensive but I can&#x27;t see myself not using this shampoo going forward. The shampoo makes my hair fuller, shinier, and it actually is reducing my grey. I kinda thought my hair looked darker and my grey was less obvious. This was confirmed when my wife and kids started commenting on my darker hair. Not sure if this is some sort of optical illusion but the hair looks great. I wish I could find it more easily in Canada. For now I am ordering from the U.S.</li>
    <li> this is very good shampoo.</li>
    <li> Like the result, will try again</li>
    <li> I have used this for ~4 months now. I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my hair growth. My hair and scalp do feel very nice after using this product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is very good; the smell is pleasant, stops itchiness and flaking and hair loss seems to be controlled. I would recommend using this shampoo for hair loss.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this shampoo. My hair over the last six months has lost some of it&#x27;s volume, and I heard from a friend to give this a try. So far so good, I hope I continue to see the same results with continued use. I&#x27;m not sure about the &amp;#34;anti-hair loss&amp;#34;, but it has without a doubt made my hair feel much healthier, and has given my hair more volume.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Makes my hair soft.  I have noticed less hair falling out! !</li>
    <li> Shampoo works really good. It leaves my hair looking and feeling cleaner; I do not see hair falling off everytime I shampoo my hair like I did before with other shampoos. I have recommend it to other friends.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am still now sure if it is helping me for my hair loss but it makes you feel your hair natural and fresh.</li>
    <li> It does work after several weeks. recommend!</li>
    <li> I have only started using this shampoo this week but have noticed a serious difference in the amount of hair I lose brushing my hair as well as at the end of a shower. I am really satisfied with the shampoo. I expected it might smell funky but that was not the case at all.</li>
    <li> Having used a well-known \\&quot;anti-thinning\\&quot; shampoo (for years) that changed its formula for the worse, I decided to try several other shampoos touting \\&quot;anti-hair loss\\&quot; properties.  After just a few uses of Purada, I noticed la lot less hair loss and a thicker texture in my hair. Also, my hair is growing a lot faster!! I would recommend this one over the other ones I tried because it works.  It is also \\&quot;organic\\&quot; which is also nice.</li>
    <li> Smells great, stops hair loss, and adds a little body.  It does make your slightly dryer than other organic shampoos.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty effective for hair loss. I have been losing lots of hair expecially in winter during my shower. I started exploring various shampoo to figure out which one fits me best. I lose little hair in the shower by using this shampoo. Moroccanoil helps losing hair at a more expensive price. So I would like to recommend this product for those sufferring hair loss as me.</li>
    <li> I purchase this shampoo and was so impressed with the deliver speed and first couple of applications.&lt;br /&gt;i could almost feel the hair growing.  i recommend everyone to use this product even if you are not losing your hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this great smelling shampoo for 3 weeks now and have noticed new hair growth all along the hair line, less shedding and my hair is a lot more fuller looking and feeling. I had used Nioxin several years ago, but read reviews that the product content had changed when they changed manufacturers. So I was glad I tried the Pura d&#x27;or instead, it&#x27;s much easier on my tender scalp, no red inflamed look or dried out itchy feeling. I will be using this for years.</li>
    <li> This is working great! I can see new small hairs growing! Great product!</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is totally waste of money.  All reviews are fake and this have got so many great reviews just because they are sendinga free shampoo to everyone who is writing a good review I have been using it for 6 months.  My hair is falling more and getting more dryer.</li>
    <li> Seems like loss less hair after using it for few weeks. Waiting to see the result.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product, it decreases hair loss from the first week. I hope in long term, it helps with the regrowth, as well...</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Worth it.</li>
    <li> Have been using regularly for two weeks. Appear to be shedding less and hair looks and feels great. I don&#x27;t know if it prevents hair loss but it&#x27;s just a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> Did not stop my hair fall, but like to continue using for couple of months to know better</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo twice a day for well over a month. I have noticed significantly less shedding and my hair and scalp look and feel healthier. This shampoo lathers nicely and smells nice too. I am very pleased with the results and will continue to order. I definitely recommend for anybody wanting a shampoo that can detox the scalp and leave your hair and scalp feeling healthier.</li>
    <li> excellent, especially if you scalp is sensitive to chemicals in other shampoos</li>
    <li> This product great! My wife and I started to use it about two months ago and we can visibly see the difference in the way our hair looks and feels. Our hair looks and feels fuller. We like the fact that it suds up so easily and rinses off quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good product and I would like to continue using it. I have been looking for this kind of shampoo for a while and bought this because of its excellent reviews and I am happy with it. I generally use it 5-6 times a week as my hair requires daily wash and all I need is a very small amount every time I use it and it is Organic!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, left my hair shiny and soft, and bit fuller. Plus, I like the fact that it is organic as opposed to non organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think I will purchase this product again once I run out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have no complaints about this product, and I think I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo a month ago and I must say this product is absolutely amazing. I noticed after second washing a huge difference....My hair feels thicker and looks so much healthier....This product is amazing.... ..... I recommended it to my friends and family and ordered two more bottles for myself.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gold Label for about 3 months now, so I think it&#x27;s time for a review. The shampoo has a wonderful texture and scent to it. It doesn&#x27;t build up a lather quite like most other shampoo products, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much. I haven&#x27;t experienced terrible hair loss, but I have noticed quite a bit of thinning over the past 1.5 years, so that&#x27;s why I gave Pura d&#x27;or a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I build up a decent lather and work it into my scalp, I get a nice tingling sensation. I leave it on for a couple minutes while I wash the rest of myself. It rinses out quickly and I apply a small amount of Nioxin 2 conditioner. Between the two products I have actually noticed a small difference in my hair. All the hair that fell out is gone and never returned. However, all the small thinning hairs sprang back and have started growing back slowly. VERY slowly. But nonetheless... I always lost a bunch of hairs in the shower and I noticed it has been less common recently to see hair in my hands after applying the shampoo. If I forget to use the shampoo for a day, then it seems to start falling out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does seem to make a difference. For that, I give it 4 stars. For the price, I would expect a little more substantial results, but we shall see in time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again!! Even my boyfriend made a comment that my hair looks and feels thicker. I&#x27;m so convinced that this shampoo is making a huge difference with my hair that I ordered the conditioner that goes along with it. There are so few draw backs (nothing is perfect). The only minimal pet peeves are that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell as great as the chemical junk (that isn&#x27;t good for your hair anyway) that you buy for you hair in stores and I definitely notice that my hair feels like it needs a conditioner afterward (feels tangled.) Otherwise may hair feels clean, full and lovely. All other products I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many, pale in comparison and were even more expensive. I LOVE that it&#x27;s organic and has a DHT blocker!</li>
    <li> The BEST !!! I have no doubt that the product works for me.</li>
    <li> I like that it leaves my hair all clean feeling and full. Only problem is that it is a bit drying to my hair.</li>
    <li> Tingles on your scalp and leaves your hair looking full. I believe it is helping with hair loss....it all seems to have slowed down. Great that it does not have preservatives and worth the price - a little goes along way.</li>
    <li> I suffered from an extremely dry scalp when I moved to a dry climate and nothing I tried seemed to make a dent in the itching, flaking, and redness. I subsequently experienced hair loss do to my scalps condition. Using Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo in conjunction with Natural Conditioner By Maple Holistics, my scalp has improved tremendously in only 2 weeks. I am already starting to see some hair renewal, and am very optimistic that my scalp will only continue to improve in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> I used a full bottle and it lasted about three months. The shampoo made my scalp feel very clean and felt like a clarifying shampoo by degreasing and de-gunking what may have been blocking my pores or follicles. I saw some new growth around my hairline where it has started to recede. This isn&#x27;t an overnight change but the results are slow and worthwhile.</li>
    <li> Hair seems thicker and more manageable with each washing</li>
    <li> I can feel the change after only one week. It strengthens my hair and gains volume. I have short hair, so the product can last a long time.</li>
    <li> it is not helpful to improve hair growing</li>
    <li> After using for 3 month, it doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo in February.  I have been experiencing steady hair loss for a few years now.  I&#x27;m 40-something and I think it might be hormone related.  I was taking biotin and actually considering stopping coloring my hair just to minimize the chemicals. I&#x27;ve also been trying some Lush products in an effort to get away from chemicals.  I&#x27;d see big clumps (not the normal one or two hairs fallout) when washing or brushing my hair. When I&#x27;d visit my hair colorist she would also make recommendations.  (Nioxen being one of them).&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this product while searching for more options.  The reviews were okay, because we know some of them could be fake, but the fact that it was natural,  ALL NATURAL, was what decided it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product in conjunction with all those others already mentioned (biotin, nioxin, lush products) and I gotta say I&#x27;m amazed.  Yes, my hair is thicker, less balding areas, still some fallout but not at the level it was before.  My hairdresser actually commented that she has noticed a substantial difference in my hair from when I started going to her a year ago.  I can&#x27;t say it was just this product, but I believe this, with the vitamins and everything else, have succeeded in turning around my hair loss. Don&#x27;t expect this to be a miracle product.  I do not believe any shampoo alone will bring my hair back.  I think a multi-pronged attack (eating better, taking vitamins, using natural products instead of chemical ones) all work together to make my hair look better and better.  I&#x27;m getting more of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I DO recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is silky and soft and I really like the regrowth around my crown. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> i am using this product and i have no complaint. is the best and effective product  for hair loss problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bben using this shampoo for 2 weeks and it has stopped psoriasis on my scalp and hair loss. My scalp feels very comfortable after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> It did not do what I needed it to, my hair continues to shed profusely. I gave it a 2 week chance with no positive changes, I ended up with an itchier scalp. To top it off the smell was awful.Would not recommend, don&#x27;t waste your time,money or hair!!!</li>
    <li> My hair has been falling for months. Have tried various products and nothing has worked. I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks and its a miracle. My hair is falling less and less every time. my hair looks more healthier and shinier. I finally found the solution to my hair loss. Im so excited im finally going to have a a thicker and fuller hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is no different from any other shampoo. My hair is still shedding after a month of use. Coincidentally 99% of reviewers who are giving rave 5 star reviews are new users who only review PURA D&#x27;or products. Seem sketchy to you? Yeah, me too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple weeks now and it has been a positive experience. It lathers nice, doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, and leaves my hair clean.  I obviously haven&#x27;t noticed much in terms of my hair loss yet, but leaving my hair and scalp clean without irritation and drying is very positive.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as he was constantly nagging about hairloss/dry hair. SO I decided to buy it for him as a gift. He loved it and tried it straight away. recently had alot of hair fall and he was very paranoid about loosing his hair, so I thought why not try organic shampoo and I found this Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-hair loss shampoo and after just a few washes I seen my husbands hair become silkier, no more damaged hair - shiny hair and instantly looked moisturized and stronger, this organic stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Great product! Wont regret it at all!</li>
    <li> I suffer from an itchy scalp and flaky, dandruff hair. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the commercial brand products out there that you can buy from stores like Walmart, and I haven&#x27;t been satisfied. But ever since trying this shampoo 3 weeks ago, my hair has shown a great improvement! I don&#x27;t have flaky, greasy looking hair anymore and my scalp finally feels great and itch free. My hair has never looked or felt better. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I had problems with my hair and was frst sceptical to try it.  I&#x27;m glad I caved in and bought it. I&#x27;m really satisfied with the results:&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair super clean feeling, bouncy and full of life and shine.It feels a bit thicker too. I would recommend this shampoo to everyone who is fighting hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rate it five out of five! Great smell! Great feel afterwards!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used purador blue label shampoo for last 3months and my thinner hair has been improved so I satisfied with the blue label one. Then I just want to buy a gold label one for this time and it worked very well for my hair too. I am sure that  it will imporove your thinner hair to be more thicken.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous hair loss prevention shampoos, ointments, etc...and some worked better then others, some not at all. Pura worked amazingly, within 10 days I noticed a significant difference. I used this shampoo with Pura&#x27;s other products and together they really enhance growth and I have nothing but praise and thanks for this product! Brings back my youth :)</li>
    <li> I am a 59-year-old male and my hair is very important to me. I inherited a full head of beautiful wavy hair, that is now a unique white in front and salt and per throughout the rest. I do take the time to style and coif my hair to perfection, and receive countless accolades on its beauty. I am a professional psychic medium, spiritual teacher, and speaker. Not only am I in front of the public eye throughout the year, I am also on television doing guest spots. So, needless to say, my hair is important to me!  I accept aging very well and believe I am doing a good job at it. HOWEVER, the hair has been leaving! I have tried numerous remedies, pills, and shampoos without any satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! First, it makes my hair feel incredibly soft and shinny. And second, it is NOT falling out in my shower towel or on my brush every day! Now, I have to say I have not been using it long enough to if any hair grows back, but it does not claim to do that. Nevertheless, I believe if you take care of everything that makes your hair fall out, the reverse will occur-new hair will grow in. I am a believer in positive attitude, so I KNOW this product is going to stimulate some hair growth on my head and keep it looking good until I say it&#x27;s time for me to leave! You will NOT go wrong using this product. I also purchased the accompanying conditioner and will leave a separate review for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Finally, I found a product that not only works, it&#x27;s is NOT going to kill me using it! It is so natural and made from mostly vegetables, that you almost can drink it! Don&#x27;t though because you may grow hair on your tongue! And look for me on TV. I&#x27;m the one with the beautiful head of shinny grey hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used blue conditioner and gold label shampoo since 10/3. I love both products. I&#x27;ve seen less hair fall after a month of using. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> After only one use this product seems to be working. Hair was thicker immediately!  Smells medicinal but not really bothersome. Eager to see more improvement in the hair loss issue. Overall very pleased!</li>
    <li> Very impressed that just a small amount works into rich lather. Was hesitant about shampoo with Argan oil, but it did not leave my hair flat, but incredibly glossy and bouncy. Smells wonderful too. I have used it for about 1 month and see less shedding.</li>
    <li> So far it has been about 6 weeks that I have used this shampoo. I can see and feel the difference in my hair loss after about a month. There is a noticeable decrease in hair fall that it seems like I&#x27;m back to my normal amount of hair fall. Prior to using the shampoo, I was having such bad hair loss for a few months it had me worried. It fell out all the time and I would find my hair all over the place. It was saddening. Though, with some patience and continued use with this shampoo it has done wonders for me. And I&#x27;m so very thankful. I see less hair fall after showering, less on my pillow case, and less all over. I will keep using it as it made a difference for me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo helped my hair a lot. Right after the first use, I noticed that my hair was lighter, cleaner, and a lot of the frizz had disappeared. The only down side is that it can make your hair a little dry, so I would suggest using conditioner, or switching this shampoo off with another one to prevent this. Anyways, I&#x27;m not sure about regrowth in my hair, but it does make my hair feel thicker, and stronger, which discourages it to fall.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried it, feels different from other product. I dont have hair loss. Hopefully it will help my hair stay longer</li>
    <li> I just received it but I&#x27;m excited to try it. Heard good things about, but they said they need 3 months to see results. It smells good I can say that and my hair feels healthy afterwards!</li>
    <li> You will see small hair grow in about two months. It really works!! Please dont let it go into your eyes its like acid for them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and it has been working pretty well. it smells great and noticing a little bit less hair loss.</li>
    <li> it works well.  its a great product.it stops the itching</li>
    <li> The hair feels light &amp; good smell as well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman in her 40&#x27;s and was experiencing severe hair loss both when I washed as well as styled. This shampoo stopped the loss begining with the first use. I used to lose about 20 strands per hair washing and another 10 from styling. Now I only lose about 5 strands per wash and 5 per styling. I would highly recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I Heard about this product by a friend of mine didn&#x27;t believe in much until I order it today I used it for the first time I noticed it had a great smell and by far the best product I have used</li>
    <li> I was suffering from post-partum, hormonal, hair loss.  Since starting this shampoo, approx 3 weeks ago, I have noticed a significant drop in the amount of hair I am losing each time I shower.  Thank you Pura Dor!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Been using this the past three weeks and this controlled my hair fall.</li>
    <li> So far so good.... Nice product, lathers fairly well compared to most. Shedding is already getting lighter and it has only been a few weeks. Nice smell and leaves your hair soft. So far no complaints and the price is reasonable for the quality and quantity.</li>
    <li> I noticed new hair growth after about 1 1/2 weeks so it&#x27;s doing as advertised.  I combined this shampoo with &amp;#34;pura d or&amp;#34; Argan Oil conditioner and between the two products my scalp has never felt better.  I was suffering an out-break of eczema on my scalp when I started using these products and about the time I noticed new hair growth my eczema had cleared up and my scalp felt great.  I&#x27;ve found my new shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love what this shampoo does for my long, straight fine hair.  I worried that the Argan Oil might leave my hair limp or greasy.  Not at all!  Also, my scalp, which tends to be broken out, is healthy and smooth.  I asked my doctor about an Argan Oil shampoo for my scalp, and she said that&#x27;s what she uses herself, as it definitely supports scalp health.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for 6 weeks, and am thrilled.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo! No harsh chemicals!</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of an organic shampoo and I was a little hesitant based on the higher price compared to non-organic shampoo.  After using this product for a couple of months, I can say that the experiment has been well worth it!  I have noticed that there has been slightly less hair in the drain after using this product and my scalp has never felt better!</li>
    <li> Light shampoo that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
    <li> Have been using for over six months and see no improvement on hair loss.  Don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Good Quality Product. I have been using it for a few months and noticed a reduction in hair loss rate.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and my hair has a bunch of new growth and has grown about 3 inches. The best thing about is it ACTUALLY cleans it. It doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy or flat like alot of natural shampoos do.</li>
    <li> i just used the oil today and my first impression about the oil was pretty good. the oil absorbs really fast into the skin, it&#x27;s non greasy and my skin feels really soft</li>
    <li> I spent a significant amount of time researching various products that would help alleviate my thinning hair, and found this products ingredients, review and reputations to be worth the try. Took a shower, and noticed that my hair felt revived from the first try-almost like it was re-stored. Its moisture balance and strength were my first impressions, and with continued use I am excited to see results with long-term use!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom because I wanted something without chemicals but she decided she didn&#x27;t want it, so I decided to use it myself.  I have so much hair, that I didn&#x27;t care that it would be all over the floor and every time I washed, a handful would be on my hands.  I liked the ingredients and although I needed to apply a little conditioner to help the combing, suddenly, about 3 weeks later, I noticed that I had only about 3 strands on my hands after washing my hair, and there was hardly any hair on the floor.  I was truly surprised and amazed because I did not expect it to work but liked that it was natural.  WOW... I recommend that anyone concerned about hair loss try it out for themselves.  I&#x27;m going to order other products from their line to try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a week. Though it&#x27;s far too early to comment on whether it works to prevent hair loss or promote new growth, I can honestly said it has made a good difference on how my hair behaves. It&#x27;s the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve used in a very long while...and I buy &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; products. My hair is bleached and was pretty lifeless...wouldn&#x27;t hold a style. At all. Now it holds curl and has a nice shine. It definitely doesn&#x27;t have that weighted down feel. I really like this stuff and can&#x27;t wait to see if some of the hair I lost last year (stress) starts to return.</li>
    <li> I received this on time and have been using this shampoo for some time. I still have a way to go, but my shedding has significantly reduced. I am thrilled that this version has a natural preservative and love that the ingredients are natural and that key ingredients--saw palmetto, rosemary--are included.</li>
    <li> I am trying this product for last 2 months and not seeing any improvement. I am still losing hair. Not sure this product really helped others. In optimistic way, continuing this product. Let me update this review again in 2 months.</li>
    <li> Great product, so far it seems to work!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo (and conditioner) for about 6 months. Still on the first bottle as a little goes a long way! After trying the expensive hair vitamins, the home laser &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34;, and numerous other products, for the first time in years, my hair stylist said she thought that part of my hair was actually a little thicker! Music to my ears after years of unsuccessfully battling thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I like this shampoo, regardless. I don&#x27;t know how you can use it without the conditioner, though, as it really tangles my  shoulder-length hair. It provides a little lift/fullness to my fine, thin hair, and every little bit helps! When my hair fills in in all the thin spots, I&#x27;ll promote this to 5 starts.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for my hair. My hair do not feel dead and dry as with other shampoo products I used before. Hopefully overtime I will edit this review regarding how it prevented further hair loss.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Since growing the relaxer out of my hair and using this shampoo my hair has had less breakage and it been easy to manage. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very good for all types of hair but it&#x27;s very good on my natural hair. This is my second bottle</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference in hair loss :(</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband who has very sensitive scalp and seems to be losing some hair. We have been using it together since I bought it and we love it. It is very mild on your skin and keeps your scalp clean. It also really helps with the lose of hair. After so many tries with other anti-hair loss products, we decided to stick with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Always had a full head of hair but, now that I’m in my 50’s, my hair turned white and it was looking and feeling thinner. I&#x27;ve been using this product for just over 4-months.  I have noticed less shedding and more volume. If nothing else this product feels good and leaves your hair feeling clean and thicker. The bottle will last a long time too. I only use one pump and work it in. I think I’ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference but I will check back in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Have been using for three weeks and already hair feels thicker.  Leaves hair extremely manageable.  Smooths hair so it is not dry or frizzy and leaves a sheen on hair (but doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;).  Will definitely order it again.  So happy with shampoo, I ordered the conditioner.</li>
    <li> After I used Pura d’or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label) for a month, I signifiantly feel I lose much less hair than before. Before, after I took shower and dried my hair, I can see a lot of hair on bathroom floor. Right now, very few hair can be seen on the floor. Will continue to use this product and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a month and I can my hair feels thicker and fuller and the day to day shedding appears to have noticeably slowed and could very well have stopped.  It has a pleasant smell, it lathers nicely and just seems to work.  I&#x27;m committed to using this product for a full year and my expectations continue to be high in terms of growth.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a solid product.  I&#x27;m not sure if my hair has grown noticeably since using this product but it hasn&#x27;t receded too much either.  I think it&#x27;s doing its job.  I will continue to use this shampoo in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used it just now, it&#x27;s very dry on my hair, but I am looking forward to see more hair.</li>
    <li> For an organic product with all natural ingredients, this product really lathers up nicely and has a nice effect on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of residue and rinses clean. I feel my hair bouncy and thicker after using it, especially if I use the blow dryer. I would recommend this to anyone who might have limp or thinning hair because even if it&#x27;s not making more hair grow, it definitely gives the feeling and illusion of thicker hair within a couple of washes.</li>
    <li> Just a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of shampoos and this one really does help. It&#x27;s not exactly back to what I&#x27;d love but it&#x27;s A LOT closer than it ever has been! THank you! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and have had a decrease in shedding.  I also really like that it is a safe product, without harsh chemicals like SLS and parabens.  Be sure to let it sit for about two minutes, so it can penetrate your hair follicles.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> After about a month I&#x27;m seeing a considerable reduction in hair loss but not a drastic improvement.</li>
    <li> So long story short I was experiencing hair loss in the front, middle, and center back of my head as my hair was thinning. Weird thing was I did not notice my hair was thinning until my co worker pointed it out. When I check I was surprise how fast my hair was thinning. Mind you baldness is not in my family, but hair thinning is which sucks as I am mixed black and white. Majority is black in me. So I started looking for a solution since I am only 24 years old I wanted to fight it before accepting what was happening. Back in early August is when I purchase the product and the label says please allow 60 days to see results. All I have to say is the product worked better then I thought it would, plus it does dry your hair old so I recommend finding a conditioner. The first three week nothing happen which sucks, then my hair grow back and I was able to her hair cuts and line ups with out wondering if it will grow back. At the moment I do not cut my hair to slow to my scalp, but I hair has grown a little faster then normal, but I am not able to grow it with out it looking weird. My advice try the product and buy a conditioner to fight the dryness. Do not cut your hair to low and I hope it works out for anyone who use the product.</li>
    <li> It is so good,my hair feels so soft.</li>
    <li> I just started using this a week ago, but it already makes my scalp feel great and my hair feels better. I cannot comment on the hair loss part yet, but I have some thinning in the front and hope it helps. It&#x27;s an awesome shampoo either way, and I prefer organic over overly chemical products.</li>
    <li> Pro: I like this product. It smells very good. I love the smell. As for hair loss, I do think it makes my hair healthy and I don&#x27;t even need conditioner but how much does it stop hair loss? I feel it takes more then just shampoo. I also take biotin. My hair stills falls out but I do see it healthier and thicker, compared to no using this shampoo and biotin.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Which the bottle was bigger for the price</li>
    <li> reduces hair loss with continuous use, does not dry hair, adds body and shine</li>
    <li> Love the product. good packaging. Trying to stay away from artificial conditioners. This is the best choice. Recommended by friends because it works. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used Josie Maran products before but this I think is better. Love the delivery system. Feels great on the skin.  Will definitely order again! !</li>
    <li> love this product, very smooth when using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand after reading other reviews.  I had tried another brand and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  The shampoo cleans my hair well though it doesn&#x27;t seem to lather much.  Although I generally wash my hair every day, I&#x27;m fine with every other day with this shampoo.  Was not bothered by the fragrance at all.  After a few weeks of use,I did notice not as much hair collecting at the drain so I hope it&#x27;s working.  Will likely purchase again and try the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I tried this product several times since I just bought it last week. It felt very good, fresher and smoother. because i just used it, it still take time to see whether it is effective for prevention of hair loss.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I did not know about this product before! . I have been washing my hair with Pura d&#x27;or gold label for a couple of months and as a result I do not lose hair any more, furthermore I have noticed that thin short hair started growing in my bold section.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!!! Really boosts my hair, I have curly hair and I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo as good as this one! Hair is getting thicker and thicker, I will be buying more...AAA+++</li>
    <li> Try to use it and hope it works</li>
    <li> On the bottle it says to wait three months before any noticeable results. That would be February 2015.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! Was experiencing severe thinning and after researching the hair-loss effects of sulfates and other harsh additives found in virtually every brand of shampoo on the market, I threw them all out. I began to look for alternatives and came across Pura d&#x27;or. Since I&#x27;ve started using it, my hair has stopped falling out, its fuller and have seen my damaged hair begin to recover. At the same time making my hair feel clean and also smells great. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and the results have sold me on this product. I will never use regular shampoo ever again!!!</li>
    <li> I love it,smell good,fell good!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a high quality product without the sulfates and preservatives found in most shampoos. It is gentle but cleans thoroughly. Nice spicy fragrance. Too early to say whether it actually encourages hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> Bought this product a couple months ago because I notice my hair was thinning and figure that since it was an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; product, it would help with the thinning and keep my hair at least looking thick. I&#x27;m a month in and now my hair is even thinner than it was when I started using it. Worst purchase I ever made and one of my biggest regrets, I&#x27;ve switched back to the shampoo I was using before because at least it doesn&#x27;t make my hair fall out. I started using some natural oils on my scalp and stopped brushing my hair when it&#x27;s wet, hope it works. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS GARBAGE!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and while I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s growing hair yet I do seem to notice less fall out and less of an itchy scalp. The only thing bad about this product it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
    <li> I happened to chance upon this shampoo on Amazon when I was searching for a good shampoo. I am so glad I did! I had never heard of this brand before. But after reading so many positive reviews about it, I decided to order it. And I am so glad I did! I used it for the first time 3 days ago, and I really love it!! I love the smell first of all, it is so minty and fresh! And when I used it I found that even though it&#x27;s organic, it lathers beautifully and immediately the hair feels fresh and full of luster. The lather is soft, not harsh at all like so many other shampoos. From the lather itself I can tell about how good the shampoo is. My hair still feels so clean even after 3 days. I will definitely be ordering this on an ongoing basis once this one finishes. Try this shampoo, you will not regret your purchase! A little goes a long way. It is a wonderful shampoo, I am very happy I came across it and this will surely go in my list of favorite shampoos!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever I have used in my lifetime. Small quantity can do everything you need for your long hairs. A coin size is more than enough for one time. Though it seems like pricey it is same as using any other shampoo where large quantity is required every use. So I would say it is not costly at all. Also it helped grow hair and also stopped hair loss that was my frequent problem. I would strongly suggest this for anyone who is looking for an anti-hair fall shampoo !!!</li>
    <li> i have been using it for about a week or two and i like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Not sure about re-growing ( haven&#x27;t seen any after months of use) but it has definitely stopped the hair loss. No more hair in the shower after a wash.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It makes my hair feel great even my barber said the he sees the change. I have told my family about this shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well so far, will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now. I like the feeling that my hair feel very soft and light after every wash. I have oily hair and I need wash my hair daily. It makes me feel better that I am not put harsh chemical product on my hair. It may takes a little longer to see new hair growth. I will keep using it until I see result.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair look awesome. I have been using this for over 6 months now. I don&#x27;t think its doing an amazing job stopping my hair loss but maybe one day... The hair looks and feels great after this which is why I am on my second bottle. All the healthy ingredients cant be bad. I am a male.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old woman. I always have really thin hair, which is getting worse because of LA&#x27;s water quality. This is my first purchase for pura d&#x27;or premium gold label shampoo. I found it as amazing as Lush&#x27;s BIG shampoo, but all with natural ingredients. I feel my hair is really getting thicker and also brighter now. I cannot wait to buying one more!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT SHAMPOO! BEST ON THE MARKET!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and helps my hair look fuller. Been using for a few weeks now and notice a difference.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what i was looking for.  Natural and organic ingredients.  No more harsh chemicals for me!  Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I like the product. Is it a miracle in a bottle?  Not really. I do like knowing that I am not putting a harmful product in my hair and scalp that is causing more damage. It seems like they threw the kitchen sink in this bottle with regards to good ingredients for hair and scalp health. What&#x27;s almost more important to me though is the lack of harmful products. I have seen a possible slowing, to no change in my hair condition over the last six months of consistent use.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are identical to the blue label and smells and tastes exactly the same. Save your money and buy the blue label!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been using this as well as the blue label purad&#x27;or shampoo and my hair is still way more fine then it&#x27;s been, but it&#x27;s re growing and has body like it used to.  I even have &amp;#34;baby hairs&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t seen that in years.  I am a believer.  I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days and already feel the difference.  It gives a clean comforting feeling after wash and dry.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Does everything it claims to do. Have seen less hair on my brush and leaves hair soft and smells great!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have a hair loss problem - just got this product because it was organic. however I started loosing some hair after started using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now and I can say that I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my hair- now I look like a q tip.  But seriously, this does make your hair poofy after you use it.  Is that what they call body?  As for growing new hair, it&#x27;s hard to tell but it does seem to have gotten thicker by both volume and count.  My hair still isn&#x27;t where I want it to be, but I hate to imagine what I&#x27;d be at now if I decided to not buy this.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle.  This product has a nice smell and I enjoy using it.  I always make sure to leave it one the directed time and then rinse.  It leaves hair feeling smoother and shinier.  I have notice slight improvement in the amount of hair that I notice coming out.  I am in my 40s and hair thinning began at 40.  I have noticed slight slowing of how much hair I see around my sink and on my hands while washing my hair.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> It is actually working!!!! I have been losing so much hairs every night when I shower. However, the amount of losing hairs have been definitely decreased. I love this product and I highly recommend this product to anyone who has concerned about losing hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and have tried many varies product without siginificen chanege. After search in Amazon and found Pura, read previous positive review, decided to try it out. First the feeling of hair care is quite good, after each washing with Pura, my original oil hair could feel clean and make whole day quite comfortable, 2nd the hair losing seems slow down and hair looks thicker than before. I will continue to use it for more months to see the result.</li>
    <li> Good product...notice the diff</li>
    <li> Its very good &amp; the smell is amazing, Had an issue with my packaging when arrived, called amazon and they sent me a replacement overnight.</li>
    <li> This, believe it or not, works. I read about it on Amazon, and it claimed to make your hair thicker. It&#x27;s incredible how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;I use this, then one pump worth of Wen Cleansing Conditioner, and my hair never looked better. Thanks for the recommendation.</li>
    <li> I think I like it! It has good smell and really mild. Also comfortable to use, but just a little bit dry after use. Less hair loss after using it for several weeks. I will see if it can make my hair grow faster. Anyway, a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product. all natural. I ordered the first time off groupon, now I buy it regularly.</li>
    <li> I used to have a really itchi scalp due to high levels of DHT, and my hair was thining a lot. This is my second bottle and what a difference, the itchiness has almost completely stopped and my hair has started to gain more volume. I recommend Pura d or shampo to anyone having this problems. Just have patience it takes about a bottle or two to start seen results but its well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair loss formula for a while now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  My hair loss has definitely slowed, and it sure looks as if I&#x27;ve got some new stuff coming in.  My hair may never again be as thick as it once was, but I&#x27;ll be thrilled if my bald spots continue to fill in.  I tried several products, some much more expensive than Pura d&#x27;or, and this is my favorite.  I recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Shampoo for a couple of weeks and so far I have noticed less hair going down drain.  My hair also feels thicker, it is a little pricey but if these results continue it will be well worth it</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel extremely clean and luscious. I recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. It makes my hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for a few weeks and my scalp feels wonderful. I have also started to see hair growth along my balding crown. I am confident for the future. I will give five stars when I see further growth. Great product!</li>
    <li> Perfect product for hair, skin, and nails. I was originally using Burt&#x27;s Bees natural oils and after trying this product, decided to make the switch. Unlike other oils I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s moisturizing, leaves your skin incredibly soft, but it is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily.</li>
    <li> We were happy (my wife and me) to find this product. After few days you can notice the big difference. We love this stuff and for sure: Will buy again!!! 5 starts</li>
    <li> Decent shampoo but Did not stop hairloss.</li>
    <li> Started using this shampoo 1 month back and i can really see the difference. It reduced the hair loss and makes my hair a bit shiny. Thanks Pura d.</li>
    <li> Compared to other shampoos I&#x27;ve used, this one has topped them! After only a week of use, I noticed less hair in the tub and less hair falling when I&#x27;m combing. My scalp feels refreshed and hair feels very clean. The fragrance matches with how my head feels! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> felt good with very first application</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using it, and i am really happy with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are top notch, and i will definitely be using this product from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it makes my hair feel and smell, i would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2-3 weeks so far and am very happy with it. It arrived promptly in the mail and was packaged well. I decided to spend a bit more on the organic version and am glad I did. I would recommend this product, and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Very good product for my hair. I will recommend it to my friends, it is very helpful.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product after reading all the positive reviews. I ordered and started using it right away, at first use, it seems a little strange because it doesn&#x27;t foam as much as a regular shampoo but I guess that&#x27;s a good sign, right? less chemicals and garbage :)&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any difference the first week, but now , a month later I can feel the difference. I have PCOS and used Minoxidil all my life, but its really annoying and using hormone for so long, is not good either.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I see a real difference, my hair loss has reduced to almost zero. I am very satisfied. Softer hair, good smell, feel healthier....hair look thicker.&lt;br /&gt;The only cons : a little expensive</li>
    <li> I work till very late at night. I started to lose a lot of hair in the central spot. I started using this product and I am really getting better</li>
    <li> I got it from my wife as a Christmas gift. She asked me to use it, and I&#x27;m glad that I did!</li>
    <li> i have been looking for a shampoo like this for a long time! i love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 3 weeks and it does work!  I bought it to stop my hair from shedding, the past couple of months my hair has  been shedding so badly I could make a few wigs with it and this shampoo has stopped my shedding about 70%. I did some research to find this product and I am so glad I found this and would recommend it to people that have excessive fall out.  As for hair regrowth, I do not know because my hair is not thinning and it is to soon to tell.  I will say this shampoo leaves your hair very clean and fuller I can go longer between shampoos, Im so glad I found this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Got it for my sweetie who&#x27;s forehead extended.. He&#x27;s happy with it ;)</li>
    <li> I purposely waited before giving my review. After using for over two months, I can see new fine hairs growing on my scalp near my hairline. No fear anymore of a receding hairline. I am over sixty and noticed the shine in my hair is getting less and less. Now after using for the product every other day, I&#x27;m noticing shine again! I love that feature!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1-) Cleans well,&lt;br /&gt;2-) Observed immediate result for hair loss but I have also been using Biotin pills since 3 months now. But again I see less hair on the brush since I started using.&lt;br /&gt;3-) My hair texture is softer yet fuller. Softness could be because of the crazy high humidity in Houston recently. But I have more volume for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1-) Product doesn&#x27;t smell so nice while washing but don&#x27;t leave any after smell</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two months and my hair is fuller and I see far less scalp. I have very little hair in my comb or brush. There is really no other way to tell if your hair loss has stopped and more has grown in. I lost my hair after Chemo and it grew back strong but then began to thin on top to the point that I not only saw my scalp but also the curve of my head,&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells nice not perfumed but natural and herbal like some of the Kheils products.&lt;br /&gt;I gave a small bottle of this shampoo to my daughter, whom has no hair loss problem, and she loves it because it made her hair thicker with just a few washes. I have ordered a bottle for her. I will submit updates as I continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three months.  My hair is thicker and has a fuller look.  The smell is nice and light.  I always hear that your supposed to use the same shampoo for 6 months so your hair can get used to it.  I will post again in three months with a six month review.</li>
    <li> I honestly believe this product does not work to reduce hair loss. I&#x27;m 26  years old male Asian who has been having hairloss problem since I was 22. I was a student then and have prepared myself for the worst. Before this shampoo I have tried nioxin system 2 which at that time was somewhere among the highest rated hairloss shampoo in amazon. Of course, now it&#x27;s drowned somewhere under for no reason. These hairloss shampoos are definitely better than over the counters in term of result and ingredients. But that&#x27;s about it, it gives you a fuller hair, peace of mind that it contains DHT &amp;quot;blocking&amp;quot; ingredients and the high reviews. You use them and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s in your head in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually liked the Nioxin system 2 better because it gives you a tingling mint sensation after you use them and it smells wayyyy better than these. This shampoo for some reason have a terrible smell, it&#x27;s definitely chemical-ly smell and whenever I use them it just feels like I&#x27;m doing it for the sake of not wasting the $30 I spent on them. The reviews on these are so convincing, the before and after pictures, the overwhelmingly positive reviews. If you dig further into the reviews you&#x27;ll find that most of them 80% are fakes or biased. The shampoo came with a tag that if you write &amp;quot;honest&amp;quot; review you&#x27;ll get a free bottle. Some people have written that they wrote 1-4 stars and never got them. So if you&#x27;re buying these based on reviews, I&#x27;d suggest you think very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, let&#x27;s get on the positive side. The shampoo contains Argan oil and biotin. Arguably, some of the best ingredients you could find in a higher end shampoo. Which is great!, because while they&#x27;re definitely not going to regrow your hair,  you could definitely use healthy ingredients for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m not halfway through the bottle and I&#x27;m just waiting for it to run out and get my money&#x27;s worth. I just can&#x27;t stand the smell tbh, if they were nicer in smell I&#x27;ll probably be using them for a lot longer just for the fact that they do contain healthy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps boys, hairloss is genetics, don&#x27;t mess with it.n smell I&#x27;ll probably be using them for a lot longer just for the fact that they do contain healthy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps boys, hairloss is genetics, don&#x27;t mess with it.</li>
    <li> Hair has been thinning for a few years...can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s growing back any hair, but it makes my hair look more full after using. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Overall this product has an excellent outcome. I feel that my hair has regained its original fullness and I am happy to keep using it. I recommend this to anyone who has thining hair and needs a shampoo that can help treat this problem well.</li>
    <li> I am a 64 year old woman who has experienced a lot of stress as a new widower, my hair became thin and began falling out. I was desperate, started on biotin and other shampoo&#x27;s. I have found the shampoo  Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo that is helping my hair and I have much less fall out. I am very grateful for this product and will be buying in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You - Linda Holmes</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about whether or not it would work or not as I had previously tried a different product with no results but decided to give this a try as I had noticed some hair loss.  In the past 2 months that I&#x27;ve used it, it&#x27;s managed to not only slow down my hair loss but also to accelerate the growth of my hair as evident by all the new baby hairs on my head.  I&#x27;m a repeat customer and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have used this product only a few times. But I LOVE IT SO MUCH! It makes my hair appear shiny and healthier, full of bounce and body, without making it sticky, gooey, stiff, or anything else.So I have been using the shampoo, conditioner and the thickening serum. The consistency of the shampoo is very thick and doesn&#x27;t lather like most shampoos. It rather smooths on. I am always letting sit for 3 minutes, combing through with a wide toothed comb and then rinsing with cooler water. As the product says its pure organic no harm to use when it provides the real value for the money and result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair look thicker after first application&lt;br /&gt;Unisex fragrance&lt;br /&gt;No itching or flaking&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs into scalp&lt;br /&gt;Does not make hair dirty&lt;br /&gt;Very effective with small amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Results depend on constant use&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for amount purchased</li>
    <li> I have always had long hair. I have been battling hair loss for about 4 years now since about the age of 54 or so. My hair was getting so thin and starting to see my scalp in spots. Even my eyebrows was falling out. I would pull wads of hair daily from my hairbrush. Find it all over the floor when I would sweep. The drain catcher was full every time I washed my hair. I was trying everything. My hairdresser suggested 10,000 mcg of Biotin. It helped some, My nails now grow like crazy, but I felt I was still loosing too much hair. I decided to try organic products from Amazon. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews like this, but this product is AMAZING!! My hair loss stopped immediately. I even put it on my eyebrows and it stopped too. My hair &amp; brows are starting to grow back. My hair is getting thicker. And when I brush my hair I only get  2-5 strands in it, instead of 30 or more....No exaggeration! Thank you Pura d&#x27;or. I Highly recommend this product. I will be using it for life now!</li>
    <li> excellent shampoo.. thanks for the fast delivery</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help. Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
    <li> I originally got this as a gag gift for a friend who was slightly balding. He was always the self conscious type. Anyway, the stuff worked, and worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has hair loss problems!</li>
    <li> This product has worked for the past 3 months but I am beginning to see no change anymore.  It is easy to use and the price is decent.  I recommend this to anyone who is losing hair or balding.  I am very happy with the results but I hope it starts to do more again.  It takes a couple of weeks to start to work so don&#x27;t be discouraged if it doesn&#x27;t work at first!&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine product.</li>
    <li> I shed hair like a dog. Its went worse last year when I had to take some mediation  and sooner I realized that my usual shampoo brand won’t help me much now and it’s time to rethink about my hair care regime. I was happy with my old shampoo brand but when it comes to prevent hair loss it scored a big 0. I knew about this organic shampoo from Pura d&#x27;or but started using like 3 months ago for a week I wasn&#x27;t able to see much changes but after a while kind of 2-3 weeks or so I slowly started feeling that yes the product is working.Its good and really mild and relaxes you mind. OH !! Yes for all those who are suffering from an itchy scalp, I would recommend this product as it works like a charm  after all organic products are definitely the #1 choice</li>
    <li> Was not very optimistic when purchasing because I have tried everything on the market, but I bought it and tried it and love it. I will never buy anything other than this. Would definitely recommend this product to a friend. This stuff has improved my self esteem dramatically. The price is not bad either</li>
    <li> As my husband&#x27;s 37th birthday was coming up, I decided to get him this shampoo. As it&#x27;s anti-hair loss, it&#x27;s exactly suited for his as his hair line is receding. The product actually worked, and my husband is now happy again. Because of his pre-mature baldness, he was shy to go out, and even wanted to buy a wig, but now all is well and we can go out as a family againl. I rate this 4 stars because it works very well, but the smell could be a bit better.</li>
    <li> I had bought the shampoo in the brown and blue bottle and it had worked great. I decided to try the new gold label and it somehow works even better! I was losing too much hair when I would use most shampoos because they were loaded with chemicals. When I use this I look in the drain and see one or two strands of hair. This is top of the line and is worth every penny. The bottle is large and will last for months. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of those products that it&#x27;s a little hard to review since I use it in conjunction with other hair-loss products. I love the sensation and the smell is nice. I feel other shampoos might smell better but I&#x27;m not too picky on that aspect. I bought this to stop my receding hairline around the temples, which is not easy to stop. Did I manage to do it? Yes, to an extent, but I can&#x27;t tell the contribution of this product alone. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently and finally after 5 months or so I&#x27;m seeing some physical results. I will continue using it for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the best part for me is that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and it has no parabens.</li>
    <li> Smells great and thick lather! I was reall happy to see that it was just like non organic shampoos. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months now and Im glad i decided to try the new anti hair loss shampoo. My hair had been starting to fall out each morning and it did not help I had begun to start thinning in some easy areas to spot. So I tried every shampoo that promised to thicken my hair and help grow new hair. This only left me more unhappy as while some products did work it left my scalp and hair really dry and i was still loosing hair, Then I began reading the reviews about the benefits of argon oil and came across  the purador product and gave it a shot. COmbined with the conditioner they sell online, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. After about a month my hair slowly began to thicken and using the conditioner my hair began to shine and look healthy again. I would recommend you be patient as it does say results are after three months, but if your tired of dry hair and itchy scalp than I suggest you give this product a try. It wont work a miracle and cure balding but at least your hair will thicken to the point all anyone notices is how thick and healthy your hair looks.</li>
    <li> I have literally tried just about every Anti-Hair loss shampoo on the market.  This one makes your hair feel fantastic.  I&#x27;ve done research on the ingredients and their efficacy and I&#x27;m thrilled.  My hair after 4 washings feels fantastic and feels super full.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way on my curly hair so this bottle should last a while. I have noticed less hair loss on my pillow and when shampooing after 2 weeks. Hair feels very soft and scalp feels healthier.</li>
    <li> Husband likes the way it cleans scalp and hair. It is too early to tell if it is preventing hair loss.</li>
    <li> I first used this product as a gift from my brother. I have fine, thin hair so the right shampoo is important to me. After using the entire bottle I can honestly say I am pleased. Hair seems thicker and not brittle. Nor is it frizzy. I just received my own bottle and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> It adds a wonderful texture to your hair and make then very smooth and shiny. I also think it helps with hair loss by providing a natural skull treatment.</li>
    <li> I used to use the blue label, and want to try this one out. I have tried other products and this one works. Personally, this product gives me confidence.</li>
    <li> I have not faced any problems with this product so far! I&#x27;m very excited to continue using it and see what happens</li>
    <li> It definitely works. I just waited for a month to see if the results do appear. Hair fall has definitely reduced and the hair feels fuller after the wash. Will definitely recommend, if you are loosing hair on a frequent basis.</li>
    <li> Noticeably reduces hair loss. Been using it for a few months now. Has a soothing feeling during application. No phosphates which is why it doesn&#x27;t lather very well so you end up using more product.</li>
    <li> Made hair worse, dried it out. Made hair loss worse. Boo</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really a good product. Helped me getting my hair back. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love it, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair so long and healthy!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many other products for my hair loss. By the third time I used this product, I could see an incredible change in my hair. It wasn&#x27;t shedding like it used to, it became stronger, and shinier. I could not believe it! I also use the Pura d&#x27;or conditioner, and it is a magic combo! I have shared my experience with several of my friends, and they have purchased the product and have loved it. I am a true believer in this product, and so should you. My hair is growing strong, shiny, and healthy. Try it! it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Have had this Shampoo for a reasonable time to judge results.  I think it&#x27;s an excellent product.  Pretty much covers the spectrum of DHT blockers.  I use it with polysorbate 80, which also reduces hair loss (would be great if these guys added polysorbate 80 to the shampoo!)</li>
    <li> From the very first time I used this product I could clearly feel a good feeling in my scalp. Almost tingly. Felt clean. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. It lathers very well and smells nice. After using this for one month, I noticed that my hair fall out much less and a parting in my hair doesn&#x27;t stand out anymore. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s gentle and leave my hair smooth, shiny and reduce hair loss by approximately 30- 40%. I will keep using it. The only issue is price rather high. I definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> When I first started using this I had some itching and flaking, but it was the beginning of the winter cold and I always get itching and flaking from dry skin in the winter, so I&#x27;ve been using a coal tar solution shampoo once or twice a week (like I usually do in winter months) and that took care of that. So I don&#x27;t think the itching and flaking had anything to do with this shampoo. I like they way my hair feels with Pura d&#x27; or. I&#x27;m using this shampoo without using any conditioner, but I don&#x27;t need conditioner now. It leaves your hair feeling pretty soft and not dried out at all. I&#x27;m a guy with thinning hair. Small bald spot on my crown, receding hair line, and hair that is up there is getting very thin. I&#x27;ve been perceiving the thin area looking a little less thin after a couple months using this shampoo (and I&#x27;m not seeing any noticeable shedding any more). It looks more like normal hair up on top now, and not to the point where I need to keep it pretty short on top in order for it not to start looking like it&#x27;s on the verge of wispy, comb-over hair when it grows out. Now it&#x27;s looking pretty good when it grows out a little longer. Then the other day my daughter asked me if I changed shampoo, because my hair looked fuller and less thin on top. So I guess that backs up my own perception and it is looking fuller. I like that.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time last night.  I have always had very thin hair on the top of my scalp and as I&#x27;ve aged it&#x27;s only gotten worse.  In addition I was losing a lot of hair due to shedding and just using a wide tooth comb to comb my hair.  The first thing that helped me was getting the &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34;.  It really reduced the amount of hair I was losing due to combing.  Then I stumbled on an Amazon ad for this product (Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo - Gold Label) and decided to challenge my Cucumber Aloe Wen products.  I have to say it seems to do everything it promised except I needed a conditioner and was glad I had ordered the Lavender Vanilla Pura d&#x27;or conditioner at the same time.  I only really needed to use the conditioner because I was worried about detangeling but I think I over did the conditioner because my hair kind of frizzed out.  Anyway, the hair I lost in the drain and in my wet brush was not to much more than I normally lose and it does look thicker - the huge thing for me was the next morning when I brushed my hair - only 3-5 strands came out!  For me - that&#x27;s huge!  I would love to see re-growth but for now I&#x27;ll settle for just not losing so much.  So far it&#x27;s worth what I spent - Wen is just as expensive (if not more because of how much you have to use) - Only one and a half pumps is needed for my medium length hair.</li>
    <li> I must say that this product works miracles! Due to hormonal changes, my hair began to fall off a few years ago. I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that can regrow my hair, and I am pleased to say that this product truly does work. I have been using this product for about a month now, and I can already see the changes in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Must try!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel so good, my scalp too. Honestly just after one washing, I notice less hair loss. I&#x27;m not sure if my old shampoo was causing that or if this stuff is working wonders, but it feels really good to be using a natural product. When you apply, it smells kind of intense, like Vick&#x27;s Vaporub or something similar, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any residual smell (which I am fine with). I also notice my hair gets way less greasy in between washes. So far I am loving this, and I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> have only used it once.  I&#x27;ll know more to tell you after a few more shampoons</li>
    <li> I used the product for about 1 month now. I can see the hair fall is stopped. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Hair Loss shampoo is said to be a certified organic product that is made from natural ingredients without the harsh or artificial chemicals commonly found in commercially produced hair products.  I feel that the shampoo cleanses my hair well and even if I wash my hair everyday, I know none of the ingredients can harm it.  However, as much as I want to believe it promotes hair growth, I haven&#x27;t seen any after almost finishing one bottle.  I should also say that I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair loss progression either.  Whether it truly does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I&#x27;m content with the fact that I&#x27;m not damaging my hair further with chemically infused preparations.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product so far, with just a week of use.  I have very fine and thin hair.  Shampooing with gold label actually makes my hair look much fuller and thicker.  Haven&#x27;t used long enough to determine if it will slow down or reverse hair falling out.  But, because of the fuller/thicker feeling hair, it at least immediatly looks that way.</li>
    <li> Did not show any improvement after several months of continuous usage.</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers well and leaves a nice feel on my hair. Besides, it does not contain any sulphates and my hair feels strong after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to know whether the Shampoo is truly working.  I could be a number of factors or it could be the shampoo.  That being said this product smells nice, goes in easily and washes out just as easily.  Its a nice shampoo regardless of whether it is truly having an effect of my hair-loss.  Price is the only reason it gets 4 stars.  If I have more evidence further down the road that it is the shampoo I will revise the score to 5 stars as at that point the price will be justified.</li>
    <li> Actually, I never believed that I would lose my hair so quickly. In fact, I was proud of my dark and curly hair. However, suddenly started to lose my hair and noticed a few bald spots from a year back. So, I desperately needed a great shampoo and ultimately, I discovered the fantastic product. I tried only one and already noticed a significant difference. I will probably need to continue a little more to get back my lost hair! Would definitely love to continue the great shampoo getting back my beautiful hair!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter who&#x27;s hair was falling out, a lot.  We took her to the doctor and he did blood work and told us nothing was wrong with her so I thought we&#x27;d try this shampoo.  She&#x27;s been using it for about three weeks and reports that she thinks her hair loss has slowed.  I clean up after her and I think it has slowed as well.  Whether this is just the end of a shedding cycle or this product is doing something, who knows but she really likes it.  The only things she doesn&#x27;t like are the fact that it makes her hair &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; in her words but she uses Advance Hair Repair Daily Hair Conditioner which we also got on Amazon and that takes care of the squeaky feeling.  She also reports that she can&#x27;t get the pump to work so she has to take the whole top off to get the shampoo out.  From my perspective her hair looks really nice, soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I thought this product made my hair feel dry, but my son said he has noticed his hair not falling out as much, so he likes it. It&#x27;s expensive but you only have to use a little to get a lot of foam, so it should last a while.  UPDATE: I&#x27;m hooked on this shampoo also.  I am over 50 and have light loss of hair and it has stopped since I started using it.  My son is still using it and his hair loss slowed down a lot.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Year later still using this product.  My son&#x27;s hair quit falling out or is so slow it&#x27;s very unnoticeable. Before I quit using this I could never grow my hair out past my neckline because of frequent shed cycle. It also appears that it minimized my grey hair. I had all grey hair and now I&#x27;m salt and pepper.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate that it has natural and organic ingredients (which is why I gave 2 stars), but I don&#x27;t know if I want to wash my hair with this again.  Darn........I had high hopes for this product to help with my hair loss and thinning hair.  :o(&lt;br /&gt;Besides the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t really suds up on your head (which is not a big deal).......my real issue is, it really makes my hair fall out alot! When I am in the shower and rinsing the product off or after I towel dry my hair- strands just fall out like nothing.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m willing to put up w/ that for at least 3 months on a daily basis (as the instructions say).  Not only that, after I wash and dry my hair, my hair is quite lifeless and flat.  I always have to put a whole lot of root boosting sprays and volumizers which is very frustrating and time consuming.  It&#x27;s quite disturbing for me to see my hair so easily falling out like that- more than usual.  I&#x27;m sorry but I&#x27;m gonna have to pass on this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great shampoo, it smells a bit of tea tree oil which is great.  It doesn&#x27;t really smell like other shampoos, very herbal but that&#x27;s fine for me.  As far as keeping your hair in it works as well as normal tea tree oil and thus isn&#x27;t magical but it&#x27;s worth it if you&#x27;re worried.</li>
    <li> I never, ever write reviews but felt compelled to do so here. I truly believe after doing some research that many of the positive reviews for this product are fake. I have suffered from hair loss for three years. As a result, my hair is thin an dry and so I&#x27;m always looking for new products to try to help both the loss and the texture. I took a leap of faith and did so, trying this one even though I have found something that I&#x27;m rather pleased with, which is Agadir Argan oil shampoo. But this is not for hair loss, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It&#x27;s horrible!!!!  It leaves hair dry and gummy-like. When I tried to brush it, I must have yanked out 20 hairs. I cried for a least two hours in regret. How is this helpful?  Even if the product worked over time I could never tolerate what it does to your hair in the meantime. Going to return this ASAP. Please be careful if you are a hairless sufferer and particularly female. I live with a deep sadness over it and when something actually exacerbates it, well it really sucks.</li>
    <li> We bought this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation for my daughter who has a dry skin condition with hair fall. In the past two weeks of use, we have seen improvement in the condition - less noticeable hairs in comb and keeps the scalp moisturized. Although bit expensive, this is worth those are looking for a product without harsh chemicals. It will payoff in the long run.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for one month and I really like the way it makes my scalp feel very clean I feel like I&#x27;m losing less hair</li>
    <li> The shampoo has helped me to regrow my hair and will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> I been using it for 6 month It show big deferent after 2 month using it,, every time I wash my hair it used to lose a lot hair with this shampo I don&#x27;t have this problem no more ,, and it&#x27;s safe for every day use</li>
    <li> Smells like.... The bathroom of a Subway. Seriously though, it smells like Subway&#x27;s bread.... Fortunately, the smell dissipates rather quickly and does not linger. Appears to be working though, as my hair feels healthier after weeks of use. I&#x27;ll continue to use it. ...</li>
    <li> This product was introduced to me by my father and brother in law and they have been using for a while now.  I have been using it for a week now and my hair is much thicker.  I have thin hair and so far it is working for me and I can&#x27;t wait until 3 more months of result to gain my hair back.</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago I purchased Pura d&#x27;or anti-hair loss shampoo. One word, WOW! After one use I saw such a difference in the fullness of my hair. I hesitated to share, after the first time using it, for I felt others would not believe me, but it is true. I have not noticed whether there has been hair loss since I started using the product, but one thing I do know is it has done wonders for the body of my hair. My hair has never felt or looked thicker.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair extremely dry and dull!</li>
    <li> ok product work for me i was losseing my hair line and i use thos sbhampoo everyday day and took biotin pills and my hair line came back in a month, its not full line but you can see hair fragments here and there that looking real good i will re use the product untill i see hair line come back competely, love this product, im goin to look at there other products as well</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful! It makes your hair so shiny and soft. It smells decent. The thing I love most about this product is that it actually leaves your hair feeling clean. A lot of organic shampoos leave hair greasy but not this one. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> still losing some hair, but it does make it thicker</li>
    <li> Very fast and very nice product</li>
    <li> I have been using another shampoo with  ketoconazole for months to help with constant shedding due to hormonal issues and was looking for an even healthier option. I am very pleased to say that I HAVE!!!!  Within the first few days I am seeing an improvment in condition of my scalp.  I happen to get a few stubborn dry patches and itchy bumps from time to time. Well I am so happy to say the bumps are disappearing.  I am a huge fan of the natural oraganic scent considering synthetic fragrances irritate my scalp like crazy. Some reviewers have said they had increased shedding when starting the product.  Not my case at all folks no shedding!  Only con is that it can feel a little dry on the hair but if you use a good conditioner .... not a problem!!!!  love love love!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT!!! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYTHING ELSE TO ANYONE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this! Leaves my hair and skin baby soft. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen less hair loss after three months. So far I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> A week into using this and already i can see results of thicker hair.  Still noticing hair follicles falling out though.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pura d&#x27;or gold label for about 2 weeks.  I don&#x27;t care for it, makes my hair flat and lifeless. Would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have being using this since two months and have my hair loss has reduced dramatically. I don&#x27;t have new hair grown yet but the hair loss has gone down significantly. I highly recommend this shampoo since it is organic and not harmful to hair. I&#x27;m going to continue using this.</li>
    <li> Excellent - have been using for about a week and really enjoying the way my hair feels during and after shampoo.</li>
    <li> I took before and after pictures...it either did nothing or accelerated my hair loss a bit more....not too sure</li>
    <li> Bad allergic reaction, reaction even on my neck and shoulders from rinsing.  If you have allergies, test this on a small portion of your body before use</li>
    <li> It seems that the bottle was only 70% full. But it was sealed.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed this before, but now I have the advantage of reviewing after stopping for a month...my advice is to keep using it.  Once I stopped, it took about a month before my hair began shedding again.  This shampoo smells wonderful.  My husband never commented on the smell of my shampoo until I used this one.  It has a very pleasant incense kind of smell.  I typically like the shampoos that smell like yummy fruity stuff, but I would much rather keep my hair and wash with this!  Worth the price, you get lots for the money, and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> i have used this shampoo for about 5 weeks.  i have noticed a difference in my hair--it is soft yet it has body and better texture&lt;br /&gt;it will be interesting to see my hair after three months</li>
    <li> Perfect shampoo for thin hair. I don&#x27;t think it really grows any back but it is lightweight and leaves my thin hair looking as good as possible</li>
    <li> I have used other organic shampoos recently, this is by far the best one!&lt;br /&gt;So far I have only been using this product for one week, I already noticed a difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair now feels softer, thicker and has more volume. My scalp felt nourished after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am a female with straight fine medium length hair, I am using&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo with the Premium Organic Conditioner, the conditioner smells great!&lt;br /&gt;It is too soon to tell if the shampoo actually stop hair loss or regrow hair. I will continue using it and am very&lt;br /&gt;excited to see what happens after 3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and my hairdresser said she noticed tiny hairs coming out of my scalp. I hope she is right. This shampoo is so gentile, I suds it in, put a showercap on, and rinse after my shower. My hair has more bounce and it feels healthier. I had been using a program shampoo and scalp treatment that starts with an &amp;#34;N&amp;#34; but it weighed down my hair. I saw this shampoo in &amp;#34;The Good Life&amp;#34;  magazine, checked Amazon, and noticed it was a &amp;#34;best seller.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Bottom line: I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product. Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;I already use Rogaine, but realized that it has limitations, so thought about trying this shampoo hoping to have a better impact. But it didn&#x27;t. It actually had a bad effect. My hair look worse, and if I reduce the use of rogaine, but continue using the shampoo my hair starts falling faster.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I listed to the real reviews, not the 5 star paid ones!! seriously save your money!</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer. I can assure you that this product works. I not only stopped losing hair, I&#x27;m growing new hair. My hair also looks fuller. The product was recommended to me by my wife who is a cosmetologist. Just a small amount of the product is need to obtain excellent results, so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> is a good product. But I don&#x27;t think is good enough for oily ,greasy scalp.</li>
    <li> I have so many issues with my hair since college. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every hair are product without any results. My hair was thinning at an alarming rate. Since using this product I have seen a significant decrease in lost hair follicles. I will definitely continue to use this product!!</li>
    <li> I have Celiac Disease which was misdiagnosed/ treasted for several years and caused alarming hairloss whenever I had a flair-up.  In my attempt to stop and hopefully reverse my hairloss, I have tried a large number of hairloss products, including most of the top physician recommended/ customer reviewed shampoos.  Even though this product is very expensive, I decided to try it because it is the only product that is organic; contains all of the top scientifically proven hair loss preventing ingredients; and does not contain parabens, SLS, preservatives, or any other health hazardous chemicals.  Although I have not been using it long enough to comment on it hairloss prevention ability, this is the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have been using my first bottle of Pura d&#x27;Or for about a month now, and while I can&#x27;t say I see new hair growth where my hair is thinning, I understand that it can take up to 5 or 6 months for meaningful regrowth to appear. Saw palmetto is the primary anti-DHT ingredient in this shampoo, and it has demonstrated good, if not perfect, results with hair regrowth and DHT removal. (If it were perfect, it would be a cure for pattern baldness.) I appreciate that Pura d&#x27;Or has more saw palmetto than any other anti-DHT shampoo -- makes sense, right? The more saw palmetto, the better it is at washing away DHT.&lt;br /&gt;I used Nioxin for a while, and noticed visible results with that shampoo, and it had far less saw palmetto in it than Pura d&#x27;Or. So I am anticipating good results. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars is because argan oil shampoos (another hair-healthy ingredient in this shampoo) make my hair feel oilier and need washing more often. Not a fan of that stuff. Otherwise, thi... Read more</li>

    <li> I decided I had to try this shampoo after using other &amp;#34;sulfate-free&amp;#34; ones to see if it is as good as the reviews its getting.  So far from the very first time I used it, I like it Alot. My hair was clean like when I go to the salon, very soft, silky &amp; tangle free.  I have not used it long enough to know about the hair loss but am excited to see how it goes as my hair has thinned since hitting 50 and am in serious need of something that works.  I will review again after 1-2 months if it holds out on that end too.</li>
    <li> It works great.  I mix it with my shampoo so that it suds up better but I really think it is helping!</li>
    <li> Actually, I was disappointed while I noticed severe hair fall a few months back! Who wants to be a bald headed guy? Actually, everybody loves thick hair and like others, my dark hair made me proud! However, the intensity of hair fall was too high that I noticed a few bald spots all over my head. So, I was looking for an organic solution and came to know about organic anti-hair loss shampoo. It was fantastic and a great addition to the hair fall solutions. I started to use it and within just a few weeks, my hair falls reduced remarkably. No more hair fall and now the newly grown hair has brought the old look of my hair!</li>
    <li> I bought the shampo and the conditioner 2 weeks ago and of course it is way too soon to see if it does any hair &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; but i am in general skeptical as if it was true, the drug companies by now would have used the ingredients somehow and made it a big time, money making machine ! based on my own hair which is usually dry and waivy it makes  my hair :  softer, more straight , and kind of POOFY !  i think that sort of poofiness gives the illusion of having more hair.I appreciate if anyone else observes the same and let us know. thanks.</li>
    <li> I wish there was something like a negative star for this piece of crap. Total waste of money as once I used this product for about a month, my hair started falling off like anything. It didnt even spare the sides and back portion which are relatively immune to hairfall. I continued use for about a month but it still didnt stop. Out of frustration I stopped using it and within a week my hairfall stopped. Never ever buy this stupid product which has got so many fake positive reviews which are for sure paid. I even confirmed with one of my friends and he faced the same problem using this product. Never ever try it and if you do, you will get your answer by yourself. I couldn&#x27;t even return it as I tried it for more than a month. All money gone waste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Pura d&#x27;or organic products but this one just did not do it for me. The product states that it prevents hair loss and increases hair volume but I did not experience that when using this product.  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like about this shampoo was no harsh chemicals, it is not only great for me and my hair but I actually know what in the world is in the ingredients which is great. While I did not experience any increase in hair what I did gain from this product was a little more shine to my hair and when mixed with the anti-dandruff conditioner I had no flakes so I still continue to use it.</li>
    <li> So I got this as a gift from my girlfriend as well as other hair products.  I didn&#x27;t notice but my hair was thinning and I guess I&#x27;m losing hair as my girlfriend put it.  So I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks and I can say from just my daily grind of fixing my hair it really does feel fuller and thicker.  Also, not that I noticed but my girlfriend stated that I haven&#x27;t been losing hair on the bed anymore so I guess I&amp;#34;m doing better in that end.  Really like and recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Ya know, I gotta admit it-- it works.  My hair has gotten substantially fuller.  I use a good conditioner on my ends though as it dry&#x27;s my hair out just a wee bit.</li>
    <li> After I started losing hair I decided to take action about a year ago. I heard all the talk about Nioxin and how well it worked for some so I decided to give it a try. After a few months the Nioxin wasn&#x27;t working. I don&#x27;t know if my body chemistry was off or the formula just wasn&#x27;t strong enough but I wanted to shift my strategy to something else and I found Pura d&#x27;or. It&#x27;s simple to use just like regular shampoo and it seems to be working good for me. I&#x27;ll continue using the product longer and hope I can have the hair I had when I was in my twenties!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has left my hair looking volumized and less frizzy. Works very well. I have dry hair and I noticed that it looks more moisturized after using this shampoo just a few times. I like the fact that the ingredients are natural. Overall very good product and it works.</li>
    <li> I just started using this Pura D’Or Argan Oil Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo with gold label, AFTER using the Pura d’Or Argan Oil Shampoo with the blue label for several months.  I could not figure out why this shampoo (with gold label) was so much more expensive than the other formula, but I must admit this seemed to make my hair much more manageable than the other shampoo.  This shampoo, like their other formula, works to help prevent hair loss.  There are no SLS, no harmful Parabens and no harsh chemicals.  It is safe for color treated hair.  You only need about 3 pumps to get a good lather.  The consistency is a bit thinner than other shampoos but it does an excellent job of cleaning the hair.  I liked that there are no heavy perfumes.  The shampoo has a slightly medicinal smell and I noticed natural smells of mint, citrus and a slight woodsy aroma.  This smell was not unpleasant and after rinsing and using conditioner I did not detect any medicinal smell at all.  What I did notice was my hair was very soft and manageable after using this product.  Much more so than when I was using the Pura D’Or with the blue label.  Overall, I have noticed less hair loss since using the Pura D’Or line and I would recommend this shampoo for men and women.  After using this gold label shampoo, I will stick with it because I liked the results over the blue label formula.</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT. i&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 4 months and i&#x27;ve got to say it: it seems to work, I&#x27;m not loosing as much hair as i used to. i would recommend this product i you have hair loss or thinning hair, you will see results after 3 to 4 months of using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on the positive reviews. It smells nice and easy to use. I can feel more volume just after one wash. Wish it will help for fighting hair loss. I am using this together with Rogaine and Revita.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with female pattern baldness and telogen effluvium four and a half years ago.  I had lost about 40% of my long, wavy/fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am quite impressed that this particular product contains such an abundance of proven beneficial ingredients.  I have been purchasing and using many of these ingredients individually with good success for the last four years, but it can get QUITE expensive.  This is a pricey product, but it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently basically &amp;#34;flipped out&amp;#34; after noticing a major resurgence in hair shedding after four years of great success in restoring ALL of my hair.  It was super healthy and vibrant and I spent A LOT of money and time getting it into such great condition.  I also use 5% minoxidil (for men) as I was instructed by my dermatologist. (I think 5% minoxidil may have stopped working for me as research shows happens to some people.). Nevertheless, I am afraid to stop the minoxidil, so I desperately need to find something to stop the immense shedding.  I now have lost about 30% of the hair I regrew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it four times so far, but I am seeing a reduction in the amount of shedding I had been experiencing.  I am excited to see what happens in the next week or so.  I will post updates!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo every day for two weeks.  I have fine hair and have low thyroid.  Occasionally, I begin losing hair which is a concern.  I have noticed that with this shampoo I no longer have the &#x27;see through&#x27; spots on my scalp.  My hair seems fuller and easy to manage.  I even stopped using a hair gel to thicken my hair.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Substantial new hair growth visible after one month of use! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several weeks and I can say I definitely see a difference so far. Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dry and frizzy like other common drug store shampoos. Have bought 2 additional bottles so I never run out.</li>
    <li> My friend is at that age where they start to lose hair. She tried everything from using expensive conditioners to going to hair specialists, watching after their food, and getting consults. She would use hair products from all sorts of brands, from the cheapest price to the most expensive price. But none seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, I recommended to my friend to change their shampoo for a better brand that is organic and natural. So, I looked up Amazon and found this brand. At first I was skeptical for the price and quality of the shampoo ($39.00 is not cheap for a 16 fluid ounce shampoo). But after much research and reading of customer reviews, I decided to buy the product and give it to my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**2-3 months in** My friend was pleasantly surprised on how well the product worked. At the first few days, the product did not show any results. I would like to emphasize that this is NOT a short term product that gives instant results. However after a couple weeks, her hair felt tighter and less prone to thinning out. The best part about all this is that the product is all natural, organic, and smells great as well! I would definitely recommend this product for strengthening a person&#x27;s hair and making it healthier, it is by no means a &#x27;miracle worker&#x27;, but a solid solution to hair loss.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  Every since I started using this my hair has almost completely stopped falling out.  Its getting thicker, Ive seen new growth sprouting, and Im so glad.  I also take the Mega Hair supplement to stop the DHT, which is very inexpensive.  Combine those two together and you&#x27;re going to start growing hair like crazy.  I bought the conditioner too.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo only a few days ago so I only got to use it once. I was a bit worried when it arrived as the dispenser had been broken during shipping and I thought I would have to change it. Fortunately, it was all alright and I was able to use it just as it was.&lt;br /&gt;But that has nothing to do with the shampoo itself which is indeed wonderful. To start with, I&#x27;m very happy it is free of any chemicals and harsh or even mild preservatives. Secondly, it does give thin hair more body. Thirdly and most importantly, it seems to have reduced the quantity of hair that I lose when showering, let&#x27;s say by a third. I do hope that things will get even better after I&#x27;ve used it for longer.&lt;br /&gt;As for the price, it really depends on what budget each person has. It might seem terribly expensive to some but affordable to others. I, for one, am really worried about the amount of hair I lose, so the price was not an impediment.</li>
    <li> This stuff is tremendous.  It has halted my hair loss progression. That isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s growing new stuff. I&#x27;m using minoxidil for that.  I used this for 6 month before I got the drugs and there were fewer hairs on my pillowcases fewer hairs in my shower and vacuuming wasn&#x27;t needed daily.  The lather from this stuff is truly amazing.  As a wet shaver I know a thing or 2 about  lather and this makes me wonder if I could shave with it.  It is rich, creamy, substantial and leaves my hair feeling very clean.  The scent is just another bonus. Pretty androgenous without being too feminine or masculine.  some spice scents, nothing flowery and no industrial chemical smell.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> this product definitely left my hair feeling different after just the first use.  I am anxious to see the long term results.  I will check back in a month or so and update.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and its the best product on the market.  The product doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals and I can feel comfortable washing my hair often.  I can&#x27;t say for certain that it causes hair growth, but  I can honestly say that my hair has remained shiny and full and always receive compliments about my hair.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel rich and full and it feels nice and cool on my scalp. I can feel the dry skin falling off this a wonderful product</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago so I can not say I see hair growing yet but I have hopes with this product. It leaves my hair feeling full not so fine.  The scent is okay not too strong. Would be nice if it was minty or green tea like. The price wow lets just hope it works and I won&#x27;t feel like it is pricey.</li>
    <li> My husband is the one using it and when i asked him he said it makes his hair really soft and color becomes more black,he is hoping by continously using it ,his hair will be thicker as to what it promise</li>
    <li> This is my 4th bottle of Pura d&#x27;or.  I started with the blue label and this is my first time trying the gold label.  It definitely has a positive effect on my hair loss. When I&#x27;m using this product I notice less hair on my hands when I shampoo and comb my hair.  My hair also looks shinier and healthier.  I wish I would have started using this years ago.</li>
    <li> I have used it for couple of days now and my hair feels really soft and not falling as much as it used to.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a little over 2 weeks. I can tell you that in that short a period of time i have noticed less falling out and healthier hair. I was really thinning bad because i have a rare blood disease and have to take 2000mg of a chemo pill everyday. Its caused alot of damage to my hair. I like this product because nothing else has worked for me. Only thing its a bit pricey when you are on a very limited income. So i guess maybe I will let you know how its going after a month or 2 of use. Oh yeah and this thing where you write a review and get a free bottle sent to you, be careful. There is alot of reviews on that site being a scam for all your info. I refused to do that.</li>
    <li> Works Really well in thickening.  Noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a shampoo to regrow hair, I may tell you to look elsewhere.  But if you are looking for a shampoo to slow or stop hair loss and add body and thickness...look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Pura D&#x27;or Gold Label for nearly a month and have noticed SIGNIFICANT improvement...even after the first week.  I can say, for a fact, that my hair loss has has decreased dramatically.  Before using this product I could run my hand through my hair and would easily find several hairs in my hand.. Now, I might find one.  My comb and the spot on my sink where I leave my comb is nearly free of hair.  My baseboard heater behind my bed has less hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew about this product 5+ years ago when I started losing.  I&#x27;ve tied two other &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; products and they really don&#x27;t even compare.  They may have added a little thickness but they never ceased hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure it ain&#x27;t cheap but if spending a few extra bucks to keep my hair is what it takes then so be it.  I have been using this shampoo every day for the last 4 weeks and there might be 90% of the bottle left. (I have short to medium length hair so I don&#x27;t need that much per use).  At this rate it should last me a year, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Pura D&#x27;or, this is the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I love this product, and ever since I started using it a few months ago my hair stopped falling out. I noticed my hair got thicker. It made my hair very healthy again. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best Hair Loss Shampoo used for 10 times feels my hair get more thick and drop less.&lt;br /&gt;Is a great product. Will recommend to my friend who need it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and immediately noticed that his hair loss slowed and his hair was thicker and fuller. He loves the fact that it&#x27;s natural and though he&#x27;s never been bothered by his hair loss, he now only uses this shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if the product is actually preventing hair loss, but I have noticed thicker hair all around. Smell is fine and the finish is clean without a residue. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> its amazing what it does for my hair</li>
    <li> The very first time that I used this shampoo, I was amazed.  I ordered this product due to having a good amount of hair loss because of loosing significant weight, but as much as that, I was looking for an organic hair product due to the fact that my scalp constantly ithched, was scaley, and agravated psoriasis.  I have a volume of hair but very fine and have to use a lot of product to look like I have volume.  I had read from some of the reviews that this shampoo gave their fine hair volume.  I don&#x27;t know how that is the case, but after the first use I did not have to use a root boost, but just a little hairspray.  Out of habit I find that i go to scratch my head and there is nothing to scratch, no flakes or irritation at all.  As far as hair growth, it is too early to tell, but very happy with results so far.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. I see a vast improvement in my overall hair quality since using the product. I will definitely be purchasing the product again.</li>
    <li> Great product - all natural &amp; no chemicals ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I actually started to feel like something is actually happening to my scalp from the first day.&lt;br /&gt;There was a bit of cooling and tingling sensation on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Will update more on its actual performance few months from now...</li>
    <li> A quality product that I would recommend. What interested me in trying it was the fact that they make with natural ingredients. I try to steer away from harsh chemicals as much as posible, especially when using a product that I&#x27;m putting on my hair on a daily basis. After a few weeks of use, I can already notice a definite difference in my hair&#x27;s body and consistency. I would definitely suggest it for hair thinning problems.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from a massive hair fall issue which made me look older than my age and to get a perfect solution is like really tough as mostly what the product claims are not always true. Just casually after looking at the review in amazon and few other places I thought of giving this a try and I must say it&#x27;s good. I can&#x27;t say about other products but at this price this is really worth. It has just been a month and I can see good results. I usually brush my hair a little harsher and usually keep pulling my hair casually just to find our hairs coming out or not but the hair fall has really reduced. I Do like the product and yes its Organic which is even better !!.</li>
    <li> I have a medical condition which leaves my hair very thin and constantly falling out. I have tried Rogain, and a few other that I thought was promising.  Some work, some doesn&#x27;t. When I use a product like this, I look for certain things to know how well I would like it. How it works, what it&#x27;s made of, How well it smells, and lastly How much it is helping my hair. I bought this product a few months ago and was leary on using it. I was so used to Rogain that my doctor suggested. This product I have been using for the last month, and let me tell you I love it! It&#x27;s not what I expected and it helping my hair better then the other stuff. I would advise others with the same hair thinning problem, man or woman to give this a try. You might like it like I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star only to make a comment.  I am appalled at the number of &amp;#34;verified&amp;#34; purchases where the person has only 1 posted review and it is for this product.  I would be very suspicious of reviews for this product.  If anyone can correct my thought process on the veracity of the reviews for this product, I would appreciate hearing them.</li>
    <li> First, i hate losing hair and this shampoo is not strong at all which I was expecting. I am use to these types of shampoos being so strong you can smell it a mile away but its very mild. So, results, well, i have seen a different but what i do is I massage the lotion in my hair for five minutes and then was out not just putting it in my hair and doing nothing. Also, your hair loss might be due to weight loss, stress and other factors so always check that along with diet. This product really has shown me great results.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this product a few timed before I wrote the review. Turns out my first impression was correct. This stuff is amazing! I don&#x27;t have a big issue with hair loss. My hair is just very fine. This shampoo makes me feel like I have a new head of hair. My hair is full and much thicker. Also very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about spending so much money on a bottle of shampoo.  Read all of the positive reviews and decided to give it a try.  I have been using it daily for about 2 weeks and my hair is without a doubt much thicker and doesn&#x27;t fall out nearly as much as it did before.  The shampoo is very mild as has a pleasant but not overpowering scent.  My girlfriend has also begun using it and the amount if volume her hair has after using the shampoo amazing.  She is equally impressed with how healthy and thick her hair feels.  This shampoo is a definite must try and a great addition to any hairloss/regrowth regimen.</li>
    <li> ordered this product encouraged by the good reviews, actually had already tried many other shampoos and none worked, so I decided me and started using Pure Dor, at first did not notice a change, but still continue to using it because the instructions they said that had to be used some time to see results, and so it was really me is running, hair stopped falling in quantity, still falls but nothing compared to what I was missing before and the most incredible is that it has broken me much new hair, I am very happy and I will continue using it!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this argan oil for my hair since my end are so dry and starting to split.. I applied it ever after wash and my hair stays shiny and soft without the feeling of being so greasy.. I also use it for my elbows keeping it so supple..</li>
    <li> I would like to thank you for this product because I&#x27;ve been using a lot of products and they were expensive, too. I can never get anything for my hair to stop breaking off. It has been a few years since my hair has been breaking until a few weeks ago, I found this product. Ever since I have been using it, my hair loss has been slowing down every day. Thank you very much and keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> smells great. excited to use this shampoo. hoping to see results after awhile!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 2 weeks. My hair feels good.  I&#x27;m not finding as much hair in my comb as before and my scalp feels fantastic. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have dry and damaged hair and always have to use hair gel but after using this shampoo I don&#x27;t need to put gel anymore and my hair looks lot better. I will still have to wait and see if it prevent hair loss but so far I ham happy. Will come back and update review in few months. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this product over the last 2 months. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less hair going down the drain and less hair falling out, in general, as my hairbrush can testify. I wanted to wait a while before I wrote this review to make sure the product was working for me. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thinning hair but with the lack of SLS &amp; parabins it is a great shampoo. I could use just this and I think it&#x27;d be awesome but I use their conditioner after and it has great results.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING.  And leaves the scalp clean and feeling refreshed. No harsh chemicals.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this product for more than six month and It didn&#x27;t help me to stop the hair loss. I bought this product after seeing so many positive reviews but it was not helpful for me. It was wastage of money for me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product for my skin. My skin has never felt more moisturized! It seems like it would be too greasy but after a few seconds, my skin just soaks it up. I use it daily under makeup and alone. By far the best moisturizer I have used! Has no smell and feels very natural. Recommended to all of my friends as well.</li>
    <li> I have always been using hair products from the shelfs of regular stores and didn&#x27;t know what is good for me until I tried Pura Dor produce line. Never could imagine that shampoo can make my hair look and feel so good. It feels soft and clean and what&#x27;s most important feels hydrated.  I enjoy the natural and calming sent as well that stays all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product that makes every day differents and something I would definitely buy when I&#x27;ll run out of supplies.</li>
    <li> After a health issue, I&#x27;ve been experiencing issues with hair loss.  It was getting so bad that every time I washed my hair, I would have a considerable amount of hair (about 30-40 strands) in my hand.  I would also find a considerable amount of hair (30-40 strands) in my detangling comb as well.  I didn&#x27;t want to use any chemical solutions to help with stopping the hair loss (such as Nioxin), so I wanted to give this product a try.  All I have to say is &amp;#34;yes, it does work&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about 3-4 pumps, and I use it as directed (wash through the scalp, leave it on for at least two minutes, rinse).  After 1 week of using the product, I noticed that I&#x27;m not getting many strands of hair in my hand anymore every time I washed my hair.  After 2 weeks, I noticed that I usually had ALMOST NO STRANDS of hair in my hand every time I washed my hair, and I&#x27;m seeing maybe 1-3 strands in my detangling comb.  As an added bonus, my hair looks shiny, bouncy and healthy without any flyaways, and it styles so easily now.  For styling, I used to use mousse, texturizer, hair spray, blow dryer, hot air blow-dry brush, velcro rollers and (sometimes) a flat iron to get a style that lasts for maybe 3 hours before it starts looking limp and oily!  Now I use just a hot air blow dry brush and a little bit of hair spray, and the style, bounce and shine lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell, but that doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair, and compared to the benefits that I&#x27;m getting, I can live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering this product again as soon as I start running low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record - I&#x27;m not being reimbursed by the company for this review - I&#x27;m a real customer who purchased this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had. My skin is very sensitive. I&#x27;m allergic to many shampoos, but this product works so good on me. Also, I barely see any hair on the sink after shower.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had been using Aveda for years (and I liked their products a lot) but over the last couple of months, I began experiencing unusual hair loss and hair thinning problems. I had tried the Invati system but did not help at all so I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s time to switch shampoo. Then I cam across this by googling and decided to give it a try. And just after the first use, I&#x27;ve noticed much reduced shedding after showering and blow drying hair. My hair also appeared fuller and more voluminous. So far I am really satisfied with this shampoo (I&#x27;ve also started using their conditioner). My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit drying so I need to use much more conditioner or it&#x27;s hard to detangle hair especially at the ends.</li>
    <li> It smells great, has a nice refreshing feeling on the head when lathering. Just make sure to use plenty the first time because it takes more than usual to foam up.</li>
    <li> Hair loss is getting less, I hope I can have it recover. The first couple mouths seemed like not effective as expecting, but it finally works.</li>
    <li> The product is great!</li>
    <li> by far the best shampoo ive ever used. will continue to use. this coming from a guy who doesnt care what products i use as long as im clean. immediately noticed the difference. and not much is needed to get clean. oh and the smell, while subtle is very attractive. just dont get it in your mouth. lathers ups nicely and is very thick. as im not a body care type of person its hard for me to explain what makes this so great but believe me this is a must buy.</li>
    <li> It works well, but stinks</li>
    <li> As an Aveda products user, I bought this to increase the volume of my hair. Have not noticed an incredible difference yet.  But, I have only been using it a week.</li>
    <li> We are on our second bottle and it seems to be if not encouraging new growth it is slowing down the loss of hair. Since we are on the second bottle I guess we think it is worth sticking with.</li>
    <li> I tried the Wen product line, it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of medicines and my thyroid, my hair started coming out every time I combed it. Before I figured out the problem, I thought the problem was the weight of my hair (which was down to my hips) so I cut it off. The hair loss processed and as did the dandruff. Somehow I ran across data this product. I found Amazon carry carried the product. I read most all the reviews and decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss... in March, 2015, and have been using it 3 times a week.  After using the product for about 3.5 months, I&#x27;m sold on it! I just got my hair cut last week, not because the ends were brittle or dry. The hair was in great condition. The hair looked great...no split ends or frizziness or dryness but just wanted it cut short for Texas summer. The beautician was impressed; was amazed the condition of the hair that had not been cut or trimmed in over 6 months. I attribute most of that to Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a little bit goes a long way, I don&#x27;t see the need to reorder the shampoo for a few more months. At 69, grey hair can look dry and yellowy; not mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BE REORDERING THIS PRODUCT; because my  hair looks and feels soft, luscious, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received no compensation in the form of products or money for this review.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo every other day for 3 weeks and I love it.  My hair appears thicker and is more manageable.  It holds the curl better and has greater sheen.  I used to have itchy bumps on my scalp and they are gone.  I would recommend this shampoo to everyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Not as great as mentioned here. I used it almost for more than 2 months now &amp;  still me &amp;  wife are having hairfall problem. Im now having questions about people positing positive reviews, are they real or?</li>
    <li> Contemplated writing a review so early. I have been using this for three weeks as well as some supplements and a laser comb. Can not say this is definitely what is helping but my hair has definitely thickened in other area including the balding spots. 4 stars because it is so early into using the product. I do like the fact it is all natural and today it seems things always have hormones pumped into them or genetically manipulated in some way.</li>
    <li> Ive just started using this shampoo,all  i can say that my hair looks great and shiny, its like i just got out of the shower.. my hair feels a bit thicker too... for me its working, i might considering buying another 1 soon!</li>
    <li> Hair loss has drastically reduced.  Lathers very well and bottle lasts a very long time.  I have medium length hair and wash my hair every other day and this shampoo has lasted 9 mos and still going.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Only been a few days since shipment delivery but I can&#x27;t complain, my scalp and hair feel more full!&lt;br /&gt;The natural ingredients really do pull through as I have noticed less strands of hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid product</li>
    <li> This shampoo is truly worth having. For a while I suffered from breakage and I can say this stopped it. It has a great smell, good feel on your hands, and rinses well. I really appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals and is safe for everyone to use. I am recommending this to people I know.</li>
    <li> The blue one was way better than this one.. sometimes price don&#x27;t help even though this one has more ingredients. I started losing more hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks ,My hair lookes so healthy and beauttiful&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve never thought i could found a great shampoo that can really works for my hair , but since i started using this product i can say that this is the best shampoo that i&#x27;ve ever used for my hair i mean woww .im very impressed with the results i received on my hair</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have major hair-loss but I do have some hair fall, and I’ve noticed my overall volume of my hair diminishing. The thing I love most about this product is that it has Argan Oil, I’ve seen many youtube gurus use Argan Oil to help damaged hair. I’m so glad I used pura d’or, my hair is think and soft, also my ends aren’t damaged anymore. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am a 50 yr woman who had some minor hair shedding post surgery in 8/2014. On 1/2015 my hair was recovering. On 3/2015 I decided to buy this product to help with the positive re-growth progress. After 3 months of use, I stopped using this shampoo yesterday. My experience- The first 3 weeks were fine. I was pleased with the fullness it gave my hair. The 2nd month I noticed not so normal shedding any hour of the day and small clumps in the shower drain. My scalp started itching. The 3rd month I noticed my scalp was showing everywhere. I started to do comb overs (and still am). The itching on my scalp increased and a few pimples started showing up. This shampoo did dry out my hair and scalp from the beginning. So much for the 3 month challenge. STAY AWAY from this product! Like others have mentioned, I should have read the 1 ratings and not the 5 &amp; 4 ratings. Lots of fake reviews in the 5 &amp; 4 ratings. I am sad. It will take months to recover from the all the harm it did.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product I though that it helped my hair become stronger and long lasting. I noticed that hair wasn&#x27;t falling out as frequently before. I have actually received complements about my hair because it holds that deeper black color that it was loosing. However, I did notice by the end of the day my hair did get greasy, but I think that might just be my hair type because I haven&#x27;t found a shampoo that hasn&#x27;t fixed that problem. However, overall a very nice product.</li>
    <li> Refreshing smell, less hair in the bathtub strainer but when I read the label, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be 100% natural/organic. Some better ingredients than in other drugstore shampoos but still not ideal.</li>
    <li> Only had the product for a couple weeks but leaves hair feeling very clean, does not leave any redness or itchy scalp.  Will continue to use to hopefully get the benefits of the shampoo..</li>
    <li> This is the second time I am buying this shampoo. It took 14 weeks until there were any visible results... definitively not a 30 days with results shampoo. However once the shampoo finally  &amp;#34;kicked in&amp;#34; it dramatically reduced my hair loss. I am a guy with very short hair and this shampoo lasted me almost 4 months with daily use. The shampoos gel fills a bit runny but it lathers up well a minute after I apply it to my hair. It took a little getting used to the &amp;#34;herb&amp;#34; like smell, runny texture, multiple washes on Cardio days and  the long waited results! However I can&#x27;t argue with the results.</li>
    <li> My hair is healthyer and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about hair groth, but it really helped my hair become healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bottle, and I&#x27;m really happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> After using for 5 months I&#x27;ve noticed deceased amounts hair loss however using every day caused hair to become a bit greasy shortly after a shower</li>
    <li> I tried an other brand before I bought this and expect it work the same way.  I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I saw so many people write  review for this product.  After I received it, I realized the reason, they offer a free bottle if you write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you try different brand next time.</li>
    <li> Be careful, you can have a free bottle if you leave a good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband hates the smell and he loses more hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brand.  It cleans my hair and scalp like nothing I have ever used.  It smells awesome and it leaves my hair looking healthy which is  saying a lot because my hair is always dry and wavy.  I like to think this shampoo really does help remove or reduce DHT in my scalp.  I can really say that it truly seems my hair isn&#x27;t falling out as much if at all.  Yes, the price is more than the best brands at your local store x 3, but it&#x27;s worth it.  Honestly, even if the shampoo was found to not completely stop hair loss I would still buy it.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product along with the conditioner my hair is not falling out anymore.  I also take Vibrance vitamins for hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 2 months now. I have to say that it cleans the hair very well and helps with reducing the hair fall count. The shampoo has a subtle pleasant fragrance that does not linger. I work it into my scalp for about a minute and leave it in for about 5-7 minutes before rinsing it out. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I was beyond please with the shipment of this product! showed up earlier than expected and was very secure in the box. Cant wait to start using it</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo for few months and I notice my hair is fuller and healthier.</li>
    <li> Saw no real difference in my hair or scalp.... when I use it i have to deep conditional cause it left my hair a little dry</li>
    <li> Started using this shampoo bout 4 weeks ago for major hair loss my dermatologist told me was telogen effluvium.  While it has not stopped my hair loss in this amount of time it did calm down a lot of scalp itching I had around the time I really started losing hair.  It doesn&#x27;t lather very well so I wind up using a lot every time I shampoo.  My hair is wavy/curly and dry on the ends from highlighting.  It is not the best shampoo for my hair type but at least I know that it is one of the kinder formulas out there and if there is a shampoo that will help this is probably a good bet.  I think if you have a sensitive scalp this is good shampoo to try.  I hate going to get my hair cut or colored because whenever the salon uses the brands they carry my scalp starts itching really bad in a few hours.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this shampoo.  The bottle says use it every day for 3 months to see results which is unrealistic since not many people I know shampoo every day.  But 3 months is about the time it takes for new follicles to grow in from a resting state.  So I am very hopeful in a few months I will see new growth.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d take a chance and try out this shampoo. After using this shampoo for over 2 weeks now I can definitely say that my hair has felt softer and I&#x27;ve lost less hair in the shower. My wife has also noticed the difference in my hair. I have been using this every other day on my hair. Just read up on the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see how it has all your hair needs. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. I have been using Regenpure for the past few months which has been ok. I will be switching over to this organic shampoo from now on :)</li>
    <li> I have been losing hair for months. So I decided to give this one a shot. Thank god this product works very well for me--I can immediately tell the difference. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I am in my late 30 and have oily hair type. My hair started thinning about 10 years ago and the rate of hair loss has accelerated rapidly in the last 4 years. I have been using so many different products like Rogaine and Nioxin follicle booster to regrow the hair I have lost but they cannot seem to keep up with my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago my family started asking what kind of shampoo I have been using and whether the shampoo of my choice (which may contain Sulfate or paraben or other harmful chemicals) could be have triggered the accelerated rate of hair loss. Frankly I have often blamed my thinning hair loss on DHT or hormone but it is something I am willing to explore. So I have tried a number of different brands like Every man Jack or ShearButtle shampoo but they all seem to cause more problems like inducing dry itchy scalp (and making my hair loss even worst)or spiking up the oily grease in less then 3 hours after wash. With more and more hair found in the shower drain each morning I was about to give up and be ready to shave off my head in about 2 years or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet I took a leap of faith after reading all the positive reviews from others on Amazon about this shampoo. I have been trying it for about a week now and it does wonders. Now that when I brush my hair after wash each morning I don&#x27;t see a pile of hair in the sink and the hair found in the shower drain has probably dropped by 80% (for real). This shampoo really DOES wonders. After wash my hair appears fully with more body and feel refreshingly clean. The typical problem of showing oily grease and lifeless after 8 hours does not seem to appear anymore (with my other shampoo). WOW I am a believer and I will be repeating my orders for life !</li>
    <li> I received my pura d&#x27;or premium organic shampoo. I have read so many positive reviews in regards to this product!  My first impressions were great, I was surprised to be honest as so many products promise the world.  My hair felt really clean &amp; less dry &amp; I had no hair fall using this product.  So things are looking up going forward &amp; I will review again in couple of weeks to see if there are any other added benefits to using pura d&#x27;or shampoo!!! So far I&#x27;m really happy!</li>
    <li> Only been using this shampoo for about two weeks. A lot of my hair was falling out every day. I have noticed a significant effect. My hair has much less fall out (almost none), scalp and hair feel better and hair is more manageable. It dose not have a great smell to it, but it seems to be working. I will continue to use the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I used to shed hair almost every time I played with my hair. So, I was desperate for a solution. I  have used this product for about a week. So, I guess my review is not fully complete, but this is what I&#x27;ve experienced so far. The first day I&#x27;ve used it, my hair felt a lot smoother. I still shed some hair as a normally do, but I noticed I don&#x27;t shed as much the more I used it. So, I think this shampoo works pretty good so far!&lt;br /&gt;I also want to emphasize that diet, exercise, and stress management also affect hair loss. So (other than using this shampoo), be sure to eat healthy foods for hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I would not have reviewed this product (with an incentive to receive a new bottle) if I seriously didn&#x27;t think this stuff work for me. I would have careless about getting a free bottle. However, since I have seen some improvements so far, then sure...why not? After all, I paid like $40 for one bottle. I should have waited when it got cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know for sure if it&#x27;s working. My hair loss has slowed but for what reason, I&#x27;m not sure. My doctor did blood work and I&#x27;m on iron and D also, plus it&#x27;s been 3 1/2 months since my surgery. I&#x27;ll see where this goes and then possibly rate it again a little later. I may get some for my daughter and niece also. They are both complaining of losing hair.</li>
    <li> Friend of mine refer this product to me and he gave me half of his bottle to use. after couple of weeks my hairs fall reduce and looks better than before. I order the second one and start using it  and really positive about that.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not an expert in shampoo products whatsoever, this shampoo really makes my hair soft and comfortable, not to mention the &amp;#34;anti-hair loss&amp;#34; solution. I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of days so I can&#x27;t vouch for those effects, but I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I think this product is worth the effort. Wish I read the negative reviews and believed them, I guess I was just desperately looking for a cure to this awful sudden hair loss. I&#x27;ve used This product for about three months now and it made my hair worse. And after each use it makes my hair so dry (even though I tried using an organic conditioner with it as someone in here suggested) but this shampoo gave my hair a very damaged look and didn&#x27;t help with hair loss whatsoever. I thought I&#x27;d give it time but it&#x27;s only getting worse.. so just so you know all the positive reviews are BS..</li>
    <li> The Shampoo was recommended by my doctor and I will have to say that after only 2 weeks I can already tell a difference in the thickness of my hair. I am hopeful that I will have the same results that many other users have posted. Yes it&#x27;s pricey - Maybe the manufacture will offer a 2 for 1 or a discount if more than 1 bottle is purchased. It&#x27;s sure worth a try!!!</li>
    <li> I had bought a bottle prior to this one and have been using it for a little over two months, I can see small new hair growing in and have not noticed any further thinning.</li>
    <li> Smells good, soft, it is better than other shampoo I have bought. I love it. I haven&#x27;t found any hair loss problem. Maybe I should use it for months.</li>
    <li> After only two weeks of use my hair is way stronger, shinier and feels so soft. I have not seen the benfits of anti hair loss yet, but I know that takes time. I am really impressed with the way this makes my hair look and feel.</li>
    <li> So, far no hair loss while shampooing.  Getting ready to purchase the conditioner, cause getting more breakage then hair loss.  Haven&#x27;t used it long put I can see the results.</li>
    <li> As far as growing hair back, I don&#x27;t know how effective this product is. It does however contain good ingredients to promote the best environment for hair to grow. I used it, and my hair felt really nice afterwords.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a few weeks. I have thinning, fine, dry, very curly hair. I need organic shampoos as my skin is sensitive. My hair does appear fuller up top where I most need fullness. The shampoo is very gentle and also has a mild scent.</li>
    <li> Really works! I have little baby hairs growing in. I&#x27;m also using vitamins but I will definitely be buying more of this shampoo. Not the lavender and Vanilla conditinar though. I have found that using this shampoo I don&#x27;t really need to condition every time. My hair was shiny, soft and looked amazing. I have dark fine very long hair. I&#x27;m growing for locks of love and have a thyroid issue and started losing it. Very upsetting so I starred shopping amazon for products to help bring it back to life. Bingo found it!</li>
    <li> After trying almost every other good rated products on the market, I came across this one (Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label) ).&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this you are probably having same hair problems like me. Loosing lots of hair and thin fragile hair. After reading amazon user reviews and  recommendation from a friend, i decided to give this product a try. Thinking if this product won&#x27;t work it will just join the list of all other products that i tried and dint work. And besides this product had the lowest price compared to other once.&lt;br /&gt; Its been almost 2 weeks since i have been using this product and i have to admit i have high hopes from this product. Starting from the first use, i felt my hair was shiny and smooth. After using it for almost 2 weeks now i have seen some great improvements in my hair quality and hair loss. Its too early to say it solved my problem once and for all because there is no miracle or chemicals in this product its Organic. i have a good feeling that after using it for couple months i will see much better results.  if no other product has worked for you then give this one a try i think you will like it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about 1.5 months. defiantly loosing less hair, although it does not feel any thicker yet. I am also using Black Jamaican Castor oil daily along with this shampoo and I have see some new growth of hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair feel very clean and oil free.  I really enjoy the bottle pump, which makes using the product easier.  I am also a fan of the fact that it is a certified biobased product.  Good stuff and will certainly continue to use!</li>
    <li> I have bought the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo for the purpose of dealing with my thinning hair. It has been about a month and has shown some improvements to my hair. I will definitely keep on using it and recommend people to try it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically do product reviews but felt compelled to leave feedback for Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo. Let me start by saying I didn&#x27;t purchase this product for the obvious reason...hair loss. Although I have a little thinning on the front and the temples, I had a different intention in mind. You see, I am extremely sensitive to dyes, chemicals and perfumes typically found in non-organic shampoos so I&#x27;m always keeping a weary eye out for organic products that have great reviews. Store bought shampoos cause oily, crusty spots on the scalp that is made worse by letting wet hair dry naturally. Mix in the chemical swill in commercial hair products and my scalp was a mess. What I noticed with this product from the very start was the perfume was pretty neutral, almost non-existent. The shampoo is a light amber to clear color that correlates to an absence of dyes. So far so good. It passes the sniff and eye test like a lot of natural products do. Next, I actually used the product in the shower and immediately was impressed with the suds and the cleanliness without feeling like &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; chemical hair. It isn&#x27;t a cheap product but, once again, that wasn&#x27;t my intent. I can see where people with long hair may want to shampoo first with a cheaper product and then finish with this shampoo. The results were impressive. I have thick hair to begin with and this product actually added body after the first use. Combine that with no chemical reaction, i.e., no oily, crusty spots on my scalp, and I am very pleased. Whether it helps with hair loss or promotes hair growth, time will tell but I am happy that it does what I hoped it would do and this is provide a clean scalp and healthy hair without the negative side effects mentioned previously.</li>
    <li> It gives volume and I noticed a decline in the hair fall</li>
    <li> Great product, been using it for a month now hair feels thicker and is not dry anymore. I would and have recommended this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over 2 months and have NOT seen any differences. Wonder if it actually does anything !?!?!. Will update the review if there are any improvements with my hair.</li>
    <li> So far so good, My hair looks heathier now.But I just have been using for 2 weeks so, I&#x27;ll decide whether I&#x27;ll order more or not after 2 more weeks.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a couple of weeks.  I use one pump, and I can&#x27;t believe how clean and thick it leaves my hair.  them smell is great and I really like how easy it is to comb with little sculpting product.  It has cured my dandruff too!I wish they made and hair gel as well. I will follow up in a few months to see if the hair growth worked as well.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a long time and you definitely notice the difference. I stopped using it this past year and also noticed the hair line going back again. Definitely happy coming back to this product and will continue using. Great when you use both the shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> My hair use to break when I used the other shampoos, After using this shampoo, my hair become so silky and its stopped my hair fall</li>
    <li> Amazing Shampoo!  I cannot live without it!  I was losing 100 hairs a day and shortly after I started using Pura d&#x27;or my hair loss stopped!  I have now been using Pura d&#x27;or for 6 months and my hairdresser and my husband have noticed a drastic improvement in the appearance of my hair.  My hair is thicker and stronger than it has been in years.  I feel tiny new hairs growing all over my head!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo so much. It makes my hair fuller and smoother, it also help clarifying scalp, reduce oil buildup and a flaky scalp.&lt;br /&gt;feeling refreshing after each wash. I will continue using this line of products , it gets the job done and promotes hair grow. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is the best shampoo I ever used!! It makes my hair feel so clean and neat. Very reccomended, no harsh chemichals! 10/10</li>
    <li> I noticed that I have more hair after using this product!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo,my hair dresser noted that I have a lot of hair.  For my age I believe it to be a good thing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, before this I used many products even costliest one&#x27;s nothing stopped my hair fall, After using Purador my hair fall is completely stopped now am full happy :)</li>
    <li> So far so good!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using the product on my thinning hair and bald spots for few weeks. The hairs doesn&#x27;t seem to be stressed as it used to be with other shampoo washes. The hair loss stop and regrowth is something i will have to come back and revisit once i have had used the shampoo more.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo just because my sister told me about it, that this is the only shampoo that helped her hair, so i took her word and bought it for myself.  I have been loosing my hair like never before, so I decided to give it a try.  After using this shampoo for two weeks, I have noticed that my hair feels so much healthier and doesn&#x27;t shed as much as it used to. However, my scalp is usually really dry so this shampoo is little to dry for me but with conditioner its perfect.  My hair looks really healthy and shiny.  I love it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and smells good but so far after one  bottle and just know starting on my second I can honestly say I see no difference in new hair growth or existing small fine hairs growing out but I will give it the three months they recommend</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple different products, but this feels and looks way better. I have even seen reduction in hair loss after the first month of usage. It&#x27;s also nice due to the amount of foam it makes!</li>
    <li> Just started using it. I am 45 years old and lost a lot of hairs. I tried to use many different shampoos and think this one works. I like the smell as well. Hope it can prevent my hair loss. Keep my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> So far this shampoo has my hair feeling fuller with noticeable volume. The smell is somewhat herbal but refreshing, not full of fruity artificial stuff. Be warned that this product really doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of lather. I&#x27;ve only used 1-2 pumps of product to get my long hair clean. I try to concentrate most of the washing to the roots only to not dry out the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any signs of hair re-growth, but will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Love it. Finally I am not afraid to take a shower</li>
    <li> My hair has been noticeably thinning for the past few years, so I&#x27;ve been searching for a shampoo and conditioner to help stop hair loss. The Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner work. They leave my hair feeling thicker and healthier. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for hair loss, and none of them can compare to the Pura d&#x27;or products. A little of the shampoo and conditioner go a long way, so they last a while, and they smell great. I can already see a tremendous difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Whether or not this actually might help your hair grow or repair it is irrelevant because you cannot manage your hair after using it!  Your hair will feel like a crusty, stiff mess and will need so much conditioner (and that for fine hair is the kiss of death) that I can absolutely assure you that you will not have a good hair day.  I tried it for a week, gave up and threw it away.</li>
    <li> Great product and service. Made my hair feel stronger and thicker</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for one month now.  My hair loss prior to using the shampoo was extremely severe.  Seeing all of the fallen strands on the floor, on my pillow, in the car and in the shower only heightened my anxiety about my hair thinning out.  After about a week of using this, I noticed fewer strands on my pillow in the mornings and not as many in the shower.  I know that hair growth follows a cycle and there is some lag time between using this product and actually seeing new growth.  While I am not seeing new growth as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s probably a little early for that.  At least I don&#x27;t have hair covering my floor.  If this shampoo can curb the rapid rate of loss, I&#x27;m happy about that.  If there is to be new growth, I will be thrilled.  I&#x27;ll provide an update in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  January 9, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product daily for almost five months.  Hair isn&#x27;t falling out as rapidly as it did prior to usage and I&#x27;m pleased about that.  However, I am not seeing new growth.  My hair still has some very thin spots that expose my scalp and nothing has changed about those thinned-out spots since using this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite. I am seeing new hair growing. Im exited about keep buying this product!!!</li>
    <li> Its more like volumizing shampoo than hair growth shampoo. you hair will look good but i don&#x27;t think it will grow back. Usually  hair loss is different for every one, so try it your self and find out. it&#x27;s primary draw back is its price in my opinion a burts bee volumizing shampoo will do same thing as this one with lesser price.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous anti hair loss products in the market in the past I even ordered products which costed pricy shipping from foreign countries. However, non of them really worked up until Pura dor caught my attention and I ordered it. It works and even beyond my expectation. My hair stopped losing and it became stronger.  I am very thankful that pura dor has such a great product. And I am going to stick to it.... Amazing product!</li>
    <li> very good smell excelent  feeling after shower  i just start using it and still do not know how much will help to regrow hair  but i love it so far i will be back with review after few months</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worried about losing my hair for a long and didn&#x27;t know what to do about it. Just about four days ago, I&#x27;ve found out about this product in a advertisement site which gives me a link to Amazon. I was first very skeptical about any shampoo which can prevent or even reverse hair loss. However, I still wanted to give it a try because of the good reviews. After only two uses, I&#x27;ve totally fall in love with it. I can feel my hair gained significant strength and thick in volume compare to before. It is truly amazing! I will keep updating follow up effects on my hair after a week. I know the cause of losing hair depends on many factors and varies between different people, yet I this is product just might be my remedy to my hair. Highly recommended to give it a try!</li>
    <li> First day using product. Received the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label), 16 Fluid Ounce in the mail this morning and I also received the Conditioner. I have used it twice today, once in the morning and evening. First thoughts are: my head/hair feel alot cleaner and when I stand under an AC vent my head tingles. Not even about to assume theres a change already. After reading the reviews I don&#x27;t smell the baby powder smell, it smells more like sun tan lotion (or something along those lines, cocoa butter?) to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little on my situation: Im not bald, but have seen a little thinning in my hair, just enough to see a little of my sclap through my hair. I am 40 years old. I will update my findings after finishing the first bottle of shampoo/conditioner and I am interested to see how long the bottles last me.</li>
    <li> After 2 months using your product, my hair stopped falling;it works.Thankyou for making a great product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair. My hair start to fall out after I gave birth. I tried so many other products but it didn&#x27;t help at all it only ended up with itchy dried scalp. I first started with pura d&#x27; or brown and blue. It did help a lot  from falling but using&lt;br /&gt;little over year it seemed like the blue label didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;worked. So I wanted to try new product and l&lt;br /&gt;find out that there was new gold label. It&#x27;s been&lt;br /&gt;two weeks with gold label it&#x27;s working great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!! Pura d&#x27;or</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and so far he likes it - but after one bottle it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it makes a difference in his hair loss. His scalp tingles during use and is less &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; afterwards; so at the very least, I think it&#x27;s having an affect on his overall scalp health. Knowing that this product is organic - continued use is well worth a try.</li>
    <li> smells really good, just use once since I just got it today. hope it will work good for my hair.</li>
    <li> After experiencing hairloss from taking B5 for acne, I started losing A LOT of hair. After a lot of research I decided to try products that inhibit DHT. I started with nioxin which did make my hair feel thicker. While it does help, it contains ingredients I don&#x27;t feel great about putting on my scalp. I ordered this, thinking it would product similar results without the bad ingredients. After regular use (3-5 times a week) I feel that I have new growth. I am not sure that this is decreasing the amount of loss I am experiencing but my circumstances are different than most (look up the connection between high dose B5 and hairloss) Sad face.... I intend to keep using this product (with whatever condition I have on hand).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair loss shampoos and this one doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp like others do. I like the way it cleans my hair too</li>
    <li> I like it. my hair seem growing or not losing a lot.</li>
    <li> So far so good. This shampoo is better than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used when I compare the amount of hair loss I have after shampooing. I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and noticed that my hair started thinning at about 20 so I have been really concerned about stopping it. This shampoo suds well, has a non-offensive smell, and does not make my hair too dry or too oily. I do, however, need a very light conditioner afterwards but that&#x27;s not a big deal. My hair is usually oily by the end of the day but with this shampoo, my hair isn&#x27;t oily until the next day. I also love that it has natural and organic ingredients and I&#x27;ve been switching most of my products over to ones that are better for my skin and hair. Overall, this shampoo fits the bill for what I&#x27;ve been searching for for the past few years.</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying I was a bit skeptical, I recently started hair shedding and after so much research I came across this product. After reading a few reviews I went ahead and gave it a try. I am so happy I made this choice, this product doesn&#x27;t grow hair back that I have noticed as of yet, but it does stop the shedding which to me is better then nothing. Also the fact that it&#x27;s organic is even better, I recommend everyone try it and be patient I&#x27;m sure you will be satisfied at the end.</li>
    <li> Just received my order, so it&#x27;s too early to tell how well it will work, but based on other reviewers I&#x27;m excited to give it a shot. I bought the Pura D&#x27;Or blue label conditioner as well and love the way it conditions my hair. I have very fine and thin straight hair, and the conditioner gives it nice body--it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look dry and frizzy.</li>
    <li> just started using this, hope my hair is improving.</li>
    <li> I waited for 2 months before posting this review. I was very skeptical at first. I&#x27;m glad i bought it. Helped with some hair loss.Also, bought a second bottle.</li>
    <li> It smells very healthy and my hair feels more natural looking.</li>
    <li> As a 50 year old with mild male pattern hair loss, I used Nioxin products for several years and I honestly feel that they worked well.  After finding out the ingredients changed since the company was bought by P&amp;G, i decided to try another product.  I researched online and gave this a try.  What a great decision. The product is fantastic.  In just a few weeks a notice less thinning.  The smell is great and the ingredients are awesome.  My wife has started using it too!  I will continue to use product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My guy turned me onto this product.  I&#x27;m always very skeptic towards products that claim miracles, so I would have never tried this if it wasn&#x27;t for him.  He has had a bald spot on the back of his head for as long as I have known him.  I know exactly where its located on his head.  One day, I was running my hands through his hair, and realized that the spot was no longer there!  I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.  I spent the next few moments digging around his hair, trying to see if I had looked at the wrong spot.  No bald spots ANYWHERE.  He had only been using this product for about a month.  So, I decided to try for myself.  Its only been 1 week, but I have noticed less fall out myself.  I am waiting for my 1 month result to be as great as his, with one spot on my head that has always been scant to fill in.  I have already spread the word about this shampoo to my fellow girlfriends, as well as male workers.  This product is truly a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> I just got it today and try it, but already see a difference in my hair. It seems healthier and thicker, as well as shiny. For an organic shampoo, it lathers well and smells nice. I plan to order again!</li>
    <li> Great product, will definitely buy more.  My hair is healthier and better looking than ever.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews with positive ratings I was very determined to order this product for hair loss.  So I did.  I love the way the Gold Label shampoo left my hair after several washes.  I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Product was as represented; leaves hair smooth and feeling nourished. Not an inexpensive shampoo but feels like a quality product.  Too early to tell about the anti-hair loss effectiveness as this part will take months to assess, but am optimistic that using this in combination with biotin and other supportive measures will slow the process.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work; shedding wasn&#x27;t reduced whatsoever. Only thing that it did live up to was that it added shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I tried this shampoo. I felt it was a bit expensive but now that I&#x27;ve had the chance to use it for a while I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and will continue to use it. It really thickens my hair and I notice that less hair is falling out.</li>
    <li> So far so good. This shampoo is better than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used when I compare the amount of hair loss I have after shampooing. Just need a very light conditioner afterwards but that&#x27;s not a big deal. I also love that it has natural and organic ingredients and I&#x27;ve been switching most of my products over to ones that are better for my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this bottle as some friend has recommended and I have seen some difference of not loosing more hair already and hoping to continue , I will keep updating the result.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month.  My hair is visibly fuller and feels stronger.  My hair loss is slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the product as my husband likes the results as well! I will say my hair is slightly dryer than normal.  It may be because of the tea tree oil but a deep conditioner really helps.</li>
    <li> My hair had been thinning for a while and I was told by somebody that this product helps slow that process.  I have been using it for about 6 months and, so far, I still have something to comb in the morning when I get up.  The lather is similar to regular shampoo and thankfully it is so concentrated that it doesn&#x27;t take too much to make it feel like the shampoo I bought off the shelf all my life.  I was worried about it when I saw how small the bottle was.  I figured I&#x27;m going to go through this pretty fast.  Even with daily use, it lasts a decent amount of time because of the way it is dispensed in measured pumps.  I thought about buying some other product that reportedly helps regrow hair but I ultimately decided against it because I didn&#x27;t want to risk using a chemical concoction that may harm my health in another way.  Also, I figured this was easy to use.  So, voila.  I can offer no guarantee and I don&#x27;t know for sure if my hair loss was slowing anyway but I don&#x27;t think I want to test it.  I will keep using this product until it doesn&#x27;t do the trick anymore.  I sure hope that day never comes!</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 2.5 months ago. I am suffering from hair loss, thinning and recessed hair line. I used this produce one of the other day. I can notice that my hair becomes denser. Not sure if it had helped my hair thining and recessed hair line. I am giving it a 4 star as I like the product, not 5 yet until I see more significant results.</li>
    <li> I honestly thought I would hate this shampoo.  Ive tried my fair share of &amp;#34;NATURAL&amp;#34; shampoos and all it ever did was left my hair feeling like it wasn&#x27;t clean.  Theres something to be said about chemical shampoos, they leave your hair super squeaky clean.  However, I was more than surprised when I first tried this shampoo and realized how amazing my hair felt after the first, second, third time.  It left my hair feeling clean but not too dry, I also noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t falling out as much as well.  I am really excited to continue to use this shampoo and will continue to update my review!!</li>
    <li> I began to notice my hair thinning and hair receding late last year. For years I would buy low-quality shampoos, so I decided to do research on high-quality shampoos that would best fit my needs. And I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a previous shampoo for a couple of months and didn&#x27;t work. So, I decided to give this shampoo a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit hesitant to purchase this shampoo because of the price, but after using it for a while, it has a nice fragrance, includes good ingredients - and its USDA certified organic, a big plus. But best of all, it gives me hope that it will help with my thinning hair. So far it&#x27;s all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll check back in a few months.</li>
    <li> Bought the Lavender Vanilla conditioner, the Argan Oil Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo and the Argan Oil together to fight my thinning hair loss.  My stylist suggested the Nioxin System instead so I tried both before I returned to the Pura d&#x27;or products that produced a better appearance without the drying affect from the Nioxin.  The Argan Oil is a great skin product to boot.  The hair loss issue remains but slower than before and there may not be a cure for this issue given my research on the subject.  At least what hair remains will be much more presentable with the Pura d&#x27;or products and I am happy to discover the benefits of the Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> This is good. When I use it, I hair isn&#x27;t feel oily, but my hair keep lossing as before, I will keep using it and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Tried it for 2 weeks now. Didn&#x27;t yet seem helping my hair grow. Hair became very dry and looks un-shampooed. Will try little longer and will edit my review if any difference.</li>
    <li> Awesome product really works</li>
    <li> This shampoo really let my hair loss less. Usually when I wash my hair it lost a lot and after I use this shampoo, I feel my hair loss less.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review not to get another free bottle but for others to try this stuff out as well based on my personal experience. I had been using Nioxin system 1 and 2 for the past 6 yrs and have had great results. I am from India and we do tend to incorporate oiling of our hair once or twice a week . I mix oilve oil, Mustard oil and sesame oil plus egg white and leave this mixture in my hair for an hour and shampoo after that. This had given me great results. I came across Pura Dor 10 days ago and wanted to try this stuff considering it had good ingredients in it and most importantly it was all natural. I didn&#x27;t want to come here after my first use and write a false claims just to get another bottle because I know a lot of people including myself look at reviews before they try a product. I would hate to pay $40 for something that does not work considering there are tons of people who have given great reviews of this product. I have been using it almost daily and my hair sure does feel fuller and healthier as if I am oiling my hair everyday without the stickiness of the oil. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it that I have noticed dandruff with it&#x27;s use. I have also started incorporating Ketoconazole to combat this and the overall combination is working great. I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 b.c of the cost and dandruff issue but I will continue to use this and will report back in a month or so. Thanks and gluck.</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting recommendation and sample from my cousin. I used it for few days and really liked the product. I am not sure if this will help me with hair loss problem yet, but I will continue to use it. I think it has helped me with itchy and dry scalp. Only concern I have it its price.</li>
    <li> Easy on Hair. Less breakage and loss.</li>
    <li> Just started using this and was skeptical of all the positive reviews. But really this shampoo is the best I have ever had. I will buy more. Great product and leaves my scalp feeling so fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Hair feels clean and light, loving it so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 5 weeks.  I really like the way it makes my hair look.  Some reviewers mentioned the smell of the product.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with it, but I use the conditioner (blue), and prefer the smell of it.  The shampoo leave my hair feeling a little course, but I like how the conditioner leaves the texture of my hair.  I like both and will continue using them together.</li>
    <li> Cant&#x27; tell if it helps w/ thinning hair, but it feels gentle on the scalp.</li>
    <li> Best product softer hat I have used for my hair .... Smell is not so good but amazing results .. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. I loved.</li>
    <li> This was good but not as good as the blue pura d&#x27;or bottle. The blue label leaves my hair thick and clean where as this gold label I have to use triple the amount to get the same results.</li>
    <li> Shhhhhhhh.  Do you hear that unfamiliar sound?  It&#x27;s water going down my shower drain that my hair is no longer clogging.  I don&#x27;t love the smell, but I really couldn&#x27;t care less, since I am losing FAR less hair than I have been for the last 2 years.</li>
    <li> Product arrived within two short days. love the smell and its uniqueness. we will see here soon if it olds up to its claim.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple a weeks now , I am not sure if it actually grown any new hair but I love the feeling after I use it and the smell is great, I believe it&#x27;s also helping me with my dandruff  problem.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27; or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo for about 4 Months. I love the way my hair shines and looks fuller, and i have noticed a dramatic reduction in hair loss. Have not noticed any regrowth, however if I can keep what I have, I will be thrilled.</li>
    <li> This product made red lines all over my temples where the shampoo touched. It looked like cat scratches. It also gave me a headache and very tight scalp for a few hours... and I do not have a scalp sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a very unpleasant smell, like a burnt hair smell. I&#x27;ll stick with AG shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is growing back where my hairline is.</li>
    <li> Product maybe is good but service is horrible :(</li>
    <li> Ive decided to give this a try and so far it feels great on my hair, i love the fact that its organic and theres no harsh chemicals. So far so good!!</li>
    <li> I am in shock...im a 31 year old Caucasian female and not one for dramatics, but my hair was garbage before this product. Totally burned up by my flat iron. My hair now after about 5 washes is completely different. I noticed after the first wash it was soft, thick and honestly i felt like i was wearing a wig...THAT unrecognizable! So im excited!..Hair falling out in shower has decreased 80 percent. Let me tell you i have used every salon shampoo etc etc and this is unmatchable...The only down side is that it smells like straight up tea tree oil..then again its made from things from the earth so the give and take im 100% ok with! Also, i use only 5 pumps each wash and my hair is to my shoulders.</li>
    <li> So far I can&#x27;t see much of anything happening.  Not sure I would order another bottle.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working well as my hair loss is dwindling.  I have only used it for about 3 weeks but I am happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> I am 31 year old male and have been battling a receding hairline since my mid 20&#x27;s. I was first turned on to ProDesign ReviveTH Thinning Hair Shampoo/Conditioner/Treatment system by a hair stylist friend of mine back in my mid 20&#x27;s which was working pretty well for me as far as thickening up the hair I already had, but didn&#x27;t seem to do much for regrowth. After noticing my hair line receding more and more last year, I decided to finally break down and try Rogaine along with it. It seemed to be helping but more towards the back of my head but my front hairline was getting worse and the expense and time with Rogaine didn&#x27;t seem worth it. It also seemed to be causing breakouts on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some more research and discovered that DHT is one of the main causes of hair loss. After researching more into ProDesign ReviveTH and Rogaine (Minoxidil), I discovered that neither of these actually blocks DHT. So after searching out for a better shampoo that claims to block DHT I came across this Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label) that was Amazon&#x27;s best seller and had great reviews. The thickening and DHT blocking was exactly what I was looking for and the price was great for how much you get. I figured I had only hair to gain, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of use, I noticed less hair in the shower and on my sink then I had seen in quite awhile. And mind you it is less than when I was on Rogaine and ProDesign ReviveTH. My hair also has thickened up quite a bit and is much easier to style. This also moisturizes my hair and scalp so well that I discontinued the use of my conditioner due to the conditioner seemed to be overkill on the moisturization, making my hair harder to style (another great money saver there!). Due to my research on DHT, I also found a Hairomega Pill that contains a DHT blocker as well. I combined these with this shampoo to give me extra DHT blocking. I definitely can say my hair loss has all but stopped and will have to give it a few months before I can claim any regrowth, but so far this is the best solution I have found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!stopped and will have to give it a few months before I can claim any regrowth, but so far this is the best solution I have found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I payed $40 bucks for this product! Bad smell and I honestly feel like it&#x27;s not helping my hair at all smh I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy!!</li>
    <li> What a surprise!!! The shampoo is very well made and you can easily feel the difference after first use. Hair becomes ticker and ticker every time I use. Scent is also pretty good. Highly recommend to people who care for the hair. This is very good quality shampoo and worth every penny. With the cost, I think it is well worth every penny. I will keep using the product.</li>
    <li> Not sure what this does to help stop or stem your hair loss. It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I recently had my second hair transplant procedure in 12 years, and while I&#x27;m very happy with the results (Dr. Bolton&#x27;s one of the BEST in N. America), I was looking for some products to help protect my investment. Almost every shampoo designed for thinning hair and/or to help with re-growth seems to be loaded with crazy chemicals I don&#x27;t recognize, much less can even pronounce the names of. Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s (Gold Label) shampoo is formulated with plant derived substances that are clearly marked on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And being into Traditional Chinese Medicine, I&#x27;m particularly interested in herbal derivatives or extracts that can block DHT at the follicle with out wreaking havoc on my hormones like, unfortunately, finasteride (Propecia/Proscar)does. Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s choice of herbal extracts and ingredients are top notch, it smells good, lathers nicely, and leaves my hair feeling very soft and clean. While I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks now, I have confidence that the shampoo will help do it&#x27;s intended job of keeping DHT at bay on my scalp, while helping to nourish the follicles at the same time. And all with out harsh chemicals or preservatives that are questionable at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update every 3-4 months for a year to let everyone know how effective it&#x27;s been for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:10/2/14&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been over 3 months since I started using this shampoo. Now granted, as you&#x27;ve read I had gotten a hair transplant a couple of weeks prior. The newly transplanted hair is coming in great by the way, and although it&#x27;s honestly too soon to tell whether the Pura d&#x27;or Gold label formula is helping to accelerate and/or nourish the new grafts, I feel that the ingredients are very helpful and supportive, as you&#x27;ll notice many of them are used in prostate formulas, since there&#x27;s a connection between benign prostrate hypertrophy(gradual enlarging of the prostrate) and male pattern baldness. The secret ingredient in my opinion being He Shou Wu/Fo Ti, a very good DHT regulator of the body. Note, see one of my responses to a reader&#x27;s question on my thoughts on HSW/Fo Ti, for more info. I love the earthy herbal smell of the shampoo, and it lathers really nicely as well. I&#x27;ve since had my hair cut shorter than I&#x27;ve worn in years, thanks to the new grafts coming along nicely, so even though a bottle of the Gold Label stuff is kind of pricey, it should last me at least 6-7 months. When you break the cost down by the month it&#x27;s pretty reasonable. I&#x27;ll update again in about another 90 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:1/11/15&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been over 6 months since I started using the shampoo, and still very happy w/it. The transplanted grafts are almost at full maturity and I&#x27;m very pleased w/the results and feel the shampoo is indeed helping to nourish them as well as my scalp in general. Since it&#x27;s winter now and I&#x27;m not washing my hair everyday, as I feel it makes the scalp too dry, but the bottle will easily last me beyond 6 months because of this. So again, the price is justified.good DHT regulator of the body. Note, see one of my responses to a reader&#x27;s question on my thoughts on HSW/Fo Ti, for more info.

    <li> This is a good hair prevention shampoo.  Easy to use and a nice natural scent to the shampoo.  Been using it for a couple of months now and I see a stopping in the hair loss on my head.  Will continue to purchase the shampoo in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product that is soft on your hair and smells great.  Just started using it!  There is a great need for such a product.</li>
    <li> Before using this shampoo I had no irritation nor lice on my scalp. After using this for 3 weeks Im starting to have problems with my scalp. I read the good reviews and bought it. Which was my biggest mistake. My hair seems to fall off more often. Its a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Used this product for several years now.  Seems to work reasonably well.  Seems to be based on natural products.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic, my hair stopped falling out and feels healthy!  I will buy again, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Dont use i am shedding hair like anything</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Gotta get it.</li>
    <li> This is super dooper shampoo. It made my hairs even thicker than they be already. I like the organic ingredients and the way it foams on my scalp.</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!!! A HUGE MAJORITY of these 5 star reviews are solely written by the reviewer to get a free bottle of this shampoo. BARELY ANY OF THEM TRUE.. I have used this shampoo for over 3 months with no improvement in my hair loss. It has actually dried my hair out even more than before and has given me bad dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please stay away and do not support this SCAM. I rarely write reviews, but had to write one for this SCAM.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  I really like this product.  It feels good, works good, and smells good.  I can&#x27;t use other shampoo anymore</li>
    <li> Significant decrease in hair loss after just 3 uses!  Also, I have thick, frizzy hair - it&#x27;s never felt softer and that is with no product added?!  Truly remarkable!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried MANY products, some that worked well, but this one is superior.  Using the blue conditioner along with shampoo</li>
    <li> With first use, my hair was soft and manageable all day.  To know that there are 15 DHT blockers and that it&#x27;s all-natural and chemical-free is well worth the investment.  A little goes a long way as I have short hair.</li>
    <li> Never used this product before. When I first dumped it on my head there was no lather, so kept pouring it on. All of a sudden the lather was thick and heavy (poured way too much on). Needless to say, it got my hair clean, scent is very mild. I&#x27;ve been using for a month or so, look for hairs while towel drying hair, can&#x27;t find any. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it works if even one hair fell out, or was left on the towel. Highly recommend much to my surprise!</li>
    <li> I suffered rapid hair loss for a few months due telogen effluvium and male pattern baldness.  I knew that propecia was a death sentence (don&#x27;t know why people take it and risk systematic hormonal failure) - never took that pill and was quite miserable for a while as I tried a lot of things.  Then I tried Pura d&#x27;or and I gotta say, this thing works. First 2 times and the hair loss stopped. Before my hair would fall out by the 10s and 20s if I even gently touched it. Now I can comb through it vigorously and shower properly with no hair loss at all - well 5-10 hairs in a long shower/shampoo session which is well within normal range. All my friends have also asked me why there is much more hair on my head.  I have a thick mane now. Try it out!</li>
    <li> The best solution for prevention and on top of that it is Organic - you cannot get any better than that!  Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, lathers well, smell not good but not bad either.</li>
    <li> Great product....works well and and scalp feels much better.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and in good shape.  My hair began falling out recently, for reasons I fail to understand.  As my hair is nearly 6 feet long, I very much wanted to stop the process.  After the first, I noticed less hair loss.  After the second use, still less hair loss.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference with this product. Not enough lather for my taste. Hair still felt dirty.</li>
    <li> thought wouldn&#x27;t help my &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; but it did!  Smell is a little strong + be careful not to get in eyes but all in all a great product!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Used it primarily to wash my beard. It made it very full and shiny. Will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> Disappointing... I spent more money on this shampoo than any shampoo I ever bought, all in hopes that it would stop (or at least slow down) my hair fall and thinning hair.  I&#x27;m sorry to report that it hasn&#x27;t done that at all.  I also don&#x27;t like that it dries my hair out, makes it hard to comb through, and stinks.  Another sour note was that the bottle wasn&#x27;t even filled to the top.  It was only filled to the top of the label.  In my opinion it was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> toosoon to tell if it works but I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going on my third bottle of this shampoo. It smells good, but more importantly my hair is no longer thinning!</li>
    <li> It works great for hairfall. Only concern is that it makes hairs dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 years. It last long and my hair feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I&#x27;m using my second bottle now and I also use the conditioner. It definitely helps with my hair loss! :)</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s maintainin my hair, maybe helps the hair loss but I&#x27;m only 1/2 in my first bottle to soon to tell, I will continue to use and contnue to see.</li>
    <li> I found my hair was fuller and softer after using it for three weeks I hope it will continue to be that  way. I will continue to use</li>
    <li> I just love it. Perfect  for “hard” water.&lt;br /&gt;I got this shampoo because I needed one for hair loss and first, based on the reviews, I thought it could be a good one and I wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Now I just can’t stop buying it, bottle after bottle. I am on my 4th one. I have tried every single shampoo you can imagine from the grocery and drugstore and nothing compares to this one. Where I live the water is so hard and I have always struggled with that, it really affects my hair, now it lasts much longer clean, no itchiness, no dryness; my mom says my hair shines so beautifully, no more hair loss, and it feels so soft to the touch. I was always struggling with my hair while using other shampoos, all kinds of brands.  I really love this shampoo; even my mom uses it now. I wash my hair every other day and it feels awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen major improvement since using this product. I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle and have already ordered my second one.</li>
    <li> This is our second bottle, great natural shampoo. The best shampoo for fighting hair loss.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE SMELL… HAIR DULL, HATE THIS PRODUCT. MY HUSBAND WON&#x27;T EVEN USE IT.</li>
    <li> Shampoo leaves hair rather dry even when it&#x27;s used with the pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Argan Oil Hair, hoping this will get better with the second bottle. Hoping to see hair growth results.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a short amount of time, but I like this product already. It&#x27;s got a refreshing smell and doesn&#x27;t over-dry my hair. I prefer this shampoo to the Organix shampoo line that I was using before. I can&#x27;t say whether it has actually prevented hair loss or helped my hair grow back, but it is a great shampoo. I&#x27;ll update in three months and see if it has actually helped the hair growth.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, is the best shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> I was having trouble with dry skin in the area around my nose and eyes.  I have been using this product (Argan Oil) for about two and a half weeks now.  I noticed great results early on and as I continue to use it the better my results get.  I have no noticeable dry areas any longer.  My skin feels smooth and much softer. You do not need to use a great deal of the product to get great results.  I usually use three quick squirts in the palm of my hand and then apply by dipping my finger and applying my problem areas.  This product gives me the best results out of anything I have tried and I have tried many solutions but none compared to the pure Argan oil.  I wholeheartedly recommend this product.  I wash my face with cool water and some non-scented soap then pat dry and apply the Argan oil.  The other nice thing is the product feels oily smooth on your skin but the oil doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy spots on my pillows.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> So expensive it&#x27;s like literally pouring gold down the drain. This is absolutely not worth the price tag no matter what&#x27;s in it. I&#x27;ve used their regular-label shampoo for some time and trying the &amp;#34;gold label&amp;#34; was a last ditch effort. None of it did anything positive for my long-time thinning hair. Although I can somewhat rejoice in the fact that I no longer have any hair to warranty using these products. Just shave it and use bar soap. Save the cash to wipe yourself.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!  It actually has shown me hair growth in balding areas on top, sides, and EVEN FRONT!!&lt;br /&gt;So easy  to use, lots of lather, and leaves hair easy to comb, style, manage. I color my hair and it has not hurt my hair a bit.&lt;br /&gt;WILL  DEFENITELY KEEP USING THIS SPECIAL PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I bought this the same time I got the blue label, unfortunately when I opened it, this bottle came HALF opened and had spilled (!) everywhere inside the box. :(&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to use it too! But then I saw that, I was crushed. Amazon representative was helpful and they did refund me for it. I did get to use what was left in the bottle for a couple of days, then I used my blue label bottle. It seems to work, and helped slow down my hair loss! Not sure if it&#x27;s the combo of the two or what... But I will never know truly if the gold label is better or the blue label is, since I no longer have any of the gold label left to try.</li>
    <li> so here&#x27;s a thing..this is my 4th month since m using this product. In shower while washing my hair, the hair fall has stopped..(m happy) however, once its dries and i comb my hair i still do have some hair fall which i guess is natural. In my opinion it really depends on your hair if a product will work or not. I will still recommend this product as i felt my scalp (front extreme left side) is not seen nowadays as it used to before 4months. Still being positive and will update after 6months :)</li>
    <li> I got this product for my son who is a quadriplegic and and was experiencing some hair loss. The last thing I wanted for him was something else discouraging. This has been a great product and has made a significant difference in his hair. It is much fuller and new growth is coming. Very pleased with this product and will definitely continue using it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks,I don&#x27;t loose my hair crazy like before.I see obviously result and I will continue use this.</li>
    <li> As a young single guy with a dad and grandfathers on both sides of the family who are bald, it seems inevitable that it will eventually happen to me too. However, I&#x27;ve found that using this product definitely seems to be slowing down my hair loss (way less shedding) and may even be helping to regrow hair. I like that fact that this shampoo is all organic (premium ingredients derived from 100% plant based extracts), smells great, and lathers well in the shower. If you&#x27;re on the fence about it, I would say to definitely give it try and see if it works for you. Overall, I&#x27;ve been happy with the results I&#x27;ve gotten and a bottle seems to last me a few months. If you&#x27;re wanting to learn more about ways to educate and manage your overall hair loss, I&#x27;ve also found hairlosstalk.com to be a good resource to look into (no, I don&#x27;t work for them or am in any way affiliated with the site).</li>
    <li> It works!  Less and less of my hair is on the bottom of my shower after shampooing.  My hair is also more manageable.</li>
    <li> The smell is fantastic and very refreshing.  You can feel the tingle oh so slightly on the scalp which feels great.  Sudsing is good.  Easy to rinse out.  Will post later on the effects of the product after my 3 months are up.  Remember all, nothing ever happens over night and you must be loyal to the routine.  Excited about this product.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. I was expecting glass bottle, but it is plastic. It smells very natural, it is not like fragrant, more like herbs. Haven&#x27;t noticed a positive or negative change on hair loss, but i have been using it for only a few weeks. I have highlights, didn&#x27;t damage the color. So, I am pretty happy so far. I just wish that there was more information regarding this DHT hormone block. I wonder if there is any side effects of this product especially for pregnant ladies.</li>
    <li> Great product. It keeps my hair from falling out. I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Hey everyone, i bought this recently becuase i had been hearing good reviews, it does seem like it has reduced my hair from falling out, i like the consistency of the liquid, it allows me to give my scalp a good massage without feeling like i pull on my hair, it also has this tingling feeling of the active ingridients which tells you it is working,  feels really good too. Overall its a great product, im gonna keep using it to see how far this will help out . Its nice to know this is an all natural product aswell, when dealing with thinning hair you want to make sure you use the best ingridents.  You have nothing to loose if you wanna try it, good luck guys.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has made a significant difference in the health of my scalp and hair. I use it in combination with their Argan Oil Body,hair &amp; Face treatment and everyone compliments how shiny my hair looks. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Yeah!  Finally a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat and stringy.  Even better, it conditions my scalp while my hair stays fluffy and holds the curling iron style. I have thin and thinning hair and finding a product that works adds a shine to my day. As for the anti-hair loss, time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;Keep Moving</li>
    <li> I just received this shampoo this morning, I jumped into the shower to try it and I will have to say that I do like the smell of it. A few months ago I bought a shampoo that claimed to help fight against hair loss but it did not work and the smell was so overwhelming that I could still smell it after the end of the day. I can&#x27;t guarantee if this shampoo will work but I can already say that as a normal shampoo this product feels great on your scalp and softens your hair almost as if it had a conditioner in it as well. I hope to see some progress soon with my hair, I am in my 20&#x27;s and unfortunately my hair line is receding and my hair is slowly thinning out. This is probably my last resort, I hope it works if not well I&#x27;ll just accept the fact that I will be going bald and shaving my whole head off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used couple of bottles of the blue label Pura D&#x27;or products, and currently using gold label. Everything I have tried so far this is the best product I have found. I have noticed that my hair fall reduced (although I had already lost quite a bit before I started Pura d&#x27;or). What I like most about this product is the satisfying feeling I get by using this herbal organic product knowing that it&#x27;s not going to do any harm.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much healthier already!!  I purchased some pura d&#x27;or argan oil about a year ago and it has changed my life completely.  My adult acne is completely gone.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my hair will look like in a few months!!</li>
    <li> Yes, it works, after using this shampoo, i fell my hairs are strong and the hair loss reduced. The anti-hair loss shampoo is mild, better than other product. You know, some anti-hair loss product I used will cause terrible hair loss before it works.&lt;br /&gt; I very like it!</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo----after even just the first time using it, my hair felt and looked thicker!! Will definitely keep using and will purchase again. Thanks for this shampoo....there is help for thinning hair!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product about 4 times and like it a lot.  My husband is now using it because I&#x27;ve encouraged him to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Most important - I&#x27;m experiencing less hair fallout.  My hair seems to stay cleaner longer.  I like the fullness after blowing my&lt;br /&gt;hair dry.  Sincerely, G. O&#x27;Neill</li>
    <li> I had bought this shampoo in November 2014 for my son and have noticed there is less hair loss then before using it. The ingredients are what is needed for hair loss. As of now I will continue buying this product.</li>
    <li> Used it for about a month and it was not good for me. It really dried out my hair and shedding increased. I did a lot of research on this product before and while i used it and still couldn&#x27;t figure out if it is a scam or not. Maybe I&#x27;m one of the unlucky ones, i don&#x27;t know. If you choose to buy this, just proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> I tried many shampoos  to control my hairfall And never saw the same as this shampoo. This got best and pure ingredients which is really required to control your hair. Other shampoos in the market has lot of chemicals and essence which causes lot hair loss. This shampoo is not the same as other products. More genuine shampoo. I prefer for every one.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I made a mistake of purchasing the blue label first, but with the gold label there was a huge difference, I see hair that was supposed to be there since birth. I can&#x27;t say thank you enough to this company, you bought my confidence back to 110% I feel even more comfortable getting a haircut, now there&#x27;s no special cuts. Thank you</li>
    <li> still shedding alot in the shower</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I cannot really tell a difference compared to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for miracles but was hoping to see a little difference.  It does make your hair feel &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; once dried but quickly goes back to the thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Claims it&#x27;s all organic and natural but what about all the other ingredients in the product. The more research I do, the more upset I become. still looking for an all natural product that will do wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> I waited quite a while before I reviewed this product.  Some of the lower rated views were; let&#x27;s say aggressive. So I decided to give this shampoo a nice long trial.  Honestly this stuff is legit.  My hair was coming out at an increasingly faster rate.  I was thinking about getting Rogaine but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to get it. I knew it had chemicals out the wazoo and I didn&#x27;t want to put it on my body.  That Keranique stuff seemed like a scam, to shady, so searching through the bad reviews of it a lot of people were saying that they started using Pura d&#x27; or when the Keranique failed. It was serta fide organic and I figured it was worth a shot. I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for the past four months and my hair sheds very little, no more itchy scalp, and my hair is being to grow back. I&#x27;ve started using some of their other products and they are also very good. This takes some time your hair isn&#x27;t instantly going to change after a week. This worked for me and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get the Rogaine or Keranique.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to have purchased this shampoo. Mostly I just wanted all the hair that fell during my shower to stop or at least diminish.  So I did a lot of research and decided to go with Pura d&#x27;or.  The decrease in the amount of hair that I lose when I shampoo now is incredible.  Literally, I might lose 5 or 6 hairs now but usually it&#x27;s just one or two hair strands and that is it.  I am so happy and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Still waiting hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for almost 3 months.. so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any less shedding and I don&#x27;t see any new growth.&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting for another free bottle to use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo def helps and thickens your hair</li>
    <li> I have been using the anti-hair loss for a couple of weeks now and my hair has never looked better. My hair shines more than ever and feels so much thicker, it is much easier to manage. I can&#x27;t tell yet if more hair is growing in but I will be looking for it. This is just what I have needed even my hair dresser said it feels thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn Roe</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I had thinning hair on the top of my head and I was mortified.  After a couple of months my hair was almost back to normal. (I have short hair).  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  This will be my shampoo for a long tIme.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Will see if it works.</li>
    <li> lose less hair after using Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic refer to my friends they think it work too. like the product will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! It was helpful for me</li>
    <li> You really have to lather in order to get suds going. I didn&#x27;t see any change after using for over a month consistently. Waste of money and smells funny.</li>
    <li> This stuff will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo. Lathers great, and less hair daily in the comb. I do use a conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> i returned this product. It dried my hair a lot. It was like straw!!!!! Even after using the conditioner my hair was toooooo dry.</li>
    <li> I was using it, it worked for me, at least it prevent lose， I used it for 2 month，will still use！</li>
    <li> My hair became thiner and dryer so I decided to change shampoo. I read many good review of this, but I didn&#x27;t expect that high. First, smells good, not too strong, and not artificial. I&#x27;ve been using everyday almost two months now, and I feel my hair gets much healthier. If you haven&#x27;t used this before, try it. You will see the result.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product. Hair loss is become a serious problem to me. And first time using this, it works, but not obvious. I will try to using it for more time. I think it will help.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this product a lot. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks and my hair shedding has noticeably decreased. In the shower I&#x27;ve been leaving less than half of what I was normally shedding and leaving behind next to none that I&#x27;ve noticed during each day. First and foremost I&#x27;m a fan for its non-harmful ingredients and believe that it will end up producing good results with my thin, curly-wavy hair. My scalp feels a lot healthier and doesn&#x27;t get itchy like it used to, and the shampoo itself lathers nicely even with just a little in the palm. Make sure you rub it together with some water before applying and that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. The smell is not your typical popularly branded shampoo scent but I happen to enjoy the natural herb-like smell and find it soothing. It doesn&#x27;t leave the scent in your hair after washing out, however. You might also experience dryness in the lower part of your hair, especially if you have longer hair since the shampoo does its job of cleaning out well. You might want to use a conditioner and leave-in conditioner or some argan oil to moisten the strands. I will continue to use the shampoo and already recommend it if you&#x27;re experiencing thinning hair. You definitely don&#x27;t want to be putting harmful chemicals on your scalp and quality products like this can be hard to come by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve now been using the shampoo for a month. I can now see that in the part of my hair which had been showing much more scalp since my late teens (I&#x27;m 23), is now seemingly filling in with little new hairs. At a glance and at the touch I don&#x27;t feel as much bare scalp like I used to for the past few years. I hadn&#x27;t been to the doctor for several years because of lack of insurance and found I had a big deficiency of Vitamin D this year (the number was half of what it was supposed to be). I&#x27;ve been taking Vitamin D pills for 3 months so it is possible this was a contributing factor to my hair growth as I&#x27;ve heard lack of Iron and Vitamin D can lead to thinning hair in women. However, I did not begin to visually notice/feel these seemingly new hairs until a month after using this Pura D&#x27;or shampoo. All I can say is it appears to have worked/helped! Very happy.can lead to thinning hair in women. However, I did not begin to visually notice/feel these seemingly new hairs until a month after using this Pura D&#x27;or shampoo.

    <li> Great Product. You can tell this is natural and organic. Infused with Argan Oil which leaves hair full and strong. Not sure about the &amp;#34;Anti-Hair Loss&amp;#34; part, but we&#x27;ll see. It is pricey so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order it again. If my vanity sets in then yes maybe.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 3 months now.  The amount of hair fall has decreased. Hair overall feels healthier and stronger, but it is too  soon to say if any new hair is coming in.</li>
    <li> I was using the regular Pura D&#x27;or shampoo (in a blue bottle) before and I would say I was really satisfied with my experience, so that I decided to try a premium version. This one feels like a decent shampoo, too. The scalp skin feels nice after using it - much better any of the regular/cheaper shampoos I&#x27;ve ever tried - no itching or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good option for people with thinning or generally thin hair. Makes hair look healthier and more volume. The only thing is that I don&#x27;t really see any difference from a regular version of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It smells good and leaves hair feeling good. It cleans good and does not leave hair stiff.</li>
    <li> It is really good cos while using other shampoo i see a considerable about of hair falling but this one does not affect the hair with any chemicals moreover its organic and no cruelty on any animals thats the best part.  Waiting for 3 months to see the best result</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product; it made my hair brittle, dry and hard; not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks or so, but so far the first thing I noticed was how my hair feels, very clean and silky and my scalp improved also, from dry and flaky. Don&#x27;t know about regrowth yet, hopefully there will be but I&#x27;m going to keep using it, since the health of my hair and scalp seemed to have improved...oh, I also noticed less hair is falling off when showering so that&#x27;s a plus too. Hopefully, with more time and use, even less will fall, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I am more than glad to provide a review for this product. As a female experiencing extreme hair loss I&#x27;ve been seeking something that is made with my needs in mind. This product is all natural and gentle in every way, even the scent is natural and gentle. I&#x27;ve not had the product long enough to provide a results review, however just the thought of knowing that I am not using anything unnatural, harsh and harming to my hair makes me certain of a positive end.</li>
    <li> I was a user of Brellil and thought I&#x27;de give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good shampoo all around,  and I like the fact that it is organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it leaves my hair oily,  perhaps it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month and a half already and have notice that i don&#x27;t get that much hair loss anymore the only problem i noticed is having slight dandruff but i was using a different brand of conditioner w/ it, so i bought same brand conditioner to see if its because of the shampoo or the conditioner. I just started using it so i have to wait for any changes. But still I like the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I do Love this shampoo ! Looks like a real Keeper !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a year now. I can say that my hair seems a lot thicker but do not notice any new hair growth. I will never know if this shampoo is preventing further hair loss but will definitely continue using it for the long term.</li>
    <li> It is the product that make me feel satisfy. My hair is very oily, Hair loss, and smell bad even after shampoo. I try many shampoo, but nothing improve. I saw this product on Amazon and have a good review, so i try it. it is the best shampoo and see the result since first use.</li>
    <li> great product andd very fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years! Never let me down!</li>
    <li> Though I just use this  one for few days, I can feel the different. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it everyday, hair looses bouncy. Have not seen hair on the shower floor.</li>
    <li> So far still the same as the blue bottle. Not quite sure what the difference between the gold and blue is.  However, it&#x27;s only been a 2 weeks with this shampoo.  I&#x27;m hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> I was always proud of my curly and thick hair. My friends use to tell me that I’ll die with my curly black hair! It was really pleasing for me. But, the reality was not the same as I thought! Suddenly, I started to lose my hair and it made me crazy. How can I be a bald headed guy at the thirties! Well, my nightmare was over when I started to use organic anti-hair loss shampoo. An elder brother of mine suggested me about the product. It helped me stop my hair fall in just two months! Is it a miracle? At least, I think so! Oh dear, my friends were right!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for few weeks now and my hair is not fowling off like it was before, very few every now and the.  My hair is soft and shine, I really like it.</li>
    <li> pump doesn&#x27;t work right and have not seen an improvement in hair loss. plus doesn&#x27;t lather very well. have to use 3+ pumps to get enough to clean properly.</li>
    <li> I have this for a several days now and the loss of hair has stopped. I have natural oily hair so seeing the dryness after without losing hair was a good sight. Also I recommend taking one to two squirt each time will running from hot to cold water. You will see the result if you do. Lastly, I tried several hair product and this one works the best. If you especially have oily hair, don&#x27;t hesitant. It works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing thinning hair &amp; gradual hair loss for around 10 years now and have tried a lot of shampoos, supplements, etc...to no avail. I&#x27;ve then resorted to using 4-5 hair products from thickeners to sprays to serums - all so that my thin hair would look more voluminous. Fast forward to a few months ago, my husband started noticing that his hair&#x27;s thinning and (with lots of selfies!) he found a thinned spot around the top of his head.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t let him use my for-females-only products so had to buy him his own antihair-loss shampoo, etc...however, they don&#x27;t seem to be doing anything to help his hair.  Until now. I was looking at all sorts of shampoos and found this Pura d&#x27;or ORGANIC anti-hair loss shampoo and had to order it! It contains no parabens or toxic stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using this product for only 2.5 months but the voluminous look was instantaneous! It leaves our hair soft and not straw-dry (some anti-hair loss shampoos caused my hair to become straw-like dry). It smells fine as well and the best thing is that it works! I don&#x27;t see much hair lost after each wash (and I wash my hair 6 times a week), my hair feels really nice and isn&#x27;t dry, and it feels and looks voluminous - even my husband concurs. I&#x27;ve already bought a 2nd bottle way in advance just so we don&#x27;t run out of it. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try! By the way, I don&#x27;t have to have separate his &amp; hers anti-hair loss shampoo now, and have cut down on hair products to just 1. We&#x27;re very happy customers  :)</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for one month and my hair has gotten really thick and shiny! pure and simple, this shampoo works and i highly recommend it to anyone who wants thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, works wonders.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful. I definitely see baby hairs growing where there weren&#x27;t any before! It&#x27;s not a cure for baldness, mind you, but it does seem to thicken things a bit.</li>
    <li> Time waits for no man, and sometimes it takes his hair with it.  This shampoo seems to at least paused the hands of time from my shoulders up.  Some may be put off by the scent, but its really not offensive.  It&#x27;s just not the typical sudsy perfume one may be used to lathering up with.  Cant say for sure that my hair is growing back wildly, but I never wanted to look like Sideshow Bob anyway.  It does what it says it does.  I&#x27;ll pay for that.</li>
    <li> Immediately noticed more volume and an overall healthier feel. Itchy scalp is much better already. So far so good. Will definitely buy again,</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loves it.  It seems to have helped thicken some of the hair that was thinning at the front of his head, and he also says it helps to keep his head from drying out.</li>
    <li> it did absolutely nothing for me, go for something else, be careful they will try to get you to give them good reviews by promising a free bottle, so if you&#x27;re gonna review them please wait till the bottle is done and see what it does for you. They definitely have better products out there</li>
    <li> Started using Pura d&#x27; or 5 months ago. Currently I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I&#x27;m also using a generic minoxidil product and can honestly see a difference in the thickness of my hair. I&#x27;m also visiting the hair cutters more often these days. I use to get 6-8 weeks between haircuts and I&#x27;m now going almost monthly. I still have a little thinning but not nearly as noticeable as before this product. I also want to note I have been using the minoxidil for about a year now and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in thickness till I started using this product. Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes and you will be good to go.</li>
    <li> I first tried the blue label version of this shampoo about a year ago.  Given how pleased my whole family was with the results, I thought I would give the gold label a try.  Firstly, the shampoo has an almost immediate effect on any type of scalp condition - e.g. dandruff, psoriasis, itchy spots - which periodically plague both my husband and son.  Single use, perhaps two, and the flaking is basically gone.  Secondly, it definitely has a volumizing effect on thinning hair - both my husband and I have noticed this.  And thirdly, as I have color-treated hair, I appreciate the fact that this shampoo conserves the very expensive color process.  Highly recommended.  I would just note that I am not 100% convinced that the price difference between the gold and blue labels is really warranted, given the effect on one&#x27;s hair and scalp.  Both are great.</li>
    <li> would recommend this product- i have been using it for a couple of years, notecable less hair falling love it</li>
    <li> Great all natural anti hair loss shampoo that leaves scalp feeling very clean.  Definitely helping me maintain the hair that I have left.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this shampoo. About three months after I gave birth to my daughter, I started to lose a lot of hair. I began searching for a good shampoo that wasn&#x27;t loaded with harsh chemicals that would affect my skin and baby, that would greatly help with this mass shedding I was experiencing, and give me that squeaky clean feeling as well. A tall order, I know, but this shampoo did just that. I have been using it for around a month now. I was very skeptical when I first used it, hoping that I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money. Expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean better, and I had my doubts. The moment I put it on it gave me a tingling sensation through out my scalp that caused me a little concern, since I thought that I was going to be allergic or that it was going to make my problems worse. It didn&#x27;t do that at all however, and the first time was the only time that happened. I now believe instead that it was deeply cleansing my scalp, and activating my hairs cells. My hair loss has greatly been reduced to the point where I no longer feel like I&#x27;m going bald.  My hair stays clean longer and the ends of my hair feel moisturized for once. They give you approximately a three month supply, so although the bottle is only 16oz, don&#x27;t be fooled. Depending on how long your hair is, is how much you&#x27;ll use. My hair is long--past the middle part of my back-- and I only use about three to four dime sized amounts. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price and I highly recommend it. I will be buying this again once I use my bottle up. :)</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of this product for daughter who was losing hair. The product really worked and significantly improved the hair loss issue very quickly. We love this product.</li>
    <li> Great smell, good quality, good shampoo</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few weeks now and I really like it a lot!  Smells fresh and cleans well.  It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos, but that does not bother me.  I feel like my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy as fast as normal.  I think it helps balances out my natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;As far as re-growing hair, I am not sure yet.  I will be back to update once I have been using it for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have now used up the whole bottle. I REALLY wanted to like this shampoo and I was hoping it was a possible solution to my hair loss issues.  Unfortunately I have not noticed a difference in my hair loss.  I have however, noticed a difference in my hair texture.  It feels super dry and course.  I&#x27;ve had to switch to a more moisturizing conditioner and also have been doing moisture masks on my hair once a week.  If I had short hair maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but I have medium length hair (just an inch or two below my shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;I took some before and after pictures of my scalp and hair, and honestly I can&#x27;t tell a difference, my hair is just as thin as it was before and ive noticed the same amount of hair coming off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Gives added body to hair, smells good, a little goes a long way so the bottle lasts a long time.  Your scalp feels super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  No difference (for me) in hair loss, it felt super drying on my longer hair, the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll personally order again.</li>
    <li> Used this for over two months and was disappointed. It left my hair feeling weighted and oily.  I did not care for the smell.  Saw more hair loss than with my keratin shampoo. My hair is fine and hair loss is due to stress and being a female in her 50&#x27;s. A lot of reviews like this product, not everything is going to work for everyone or every type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been fighting hair loss for over 10  years. Did rogaine and got tired of the expense and chemicals. What is working best for me is a keratin shampoo, I like Mill Creek Botanicals Keratin shampoo. I also love Folicure moisturizing conditioner and have been using it for over 8 years. I also use  Wild Growth hair oil the night before I shampoo, about every three days. Those 3 things along with a massage brush I use twice a day has  finally  given me more hair growth and normal amount of loss.</li>
    <li> this is very safe product with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> It worked for me! I had some corners thinning out and I used it 3 times a week and have seen results already!! My barber noticed as well!!!</li>
    <li> I love Pura d&#x27;or anti-hair loss shampoo! I can already tell that my hair is healthier and stronger and is falling out less when I comb through it after showering and during styling. I leaves it really clean feeling and the smell is great. I highly recommend this shampoo for those who want thicker looking hair!</li>
    <li> So far I have it seen a major change. But I feel that my hair have more body after I wash with it</li>
    <li> Great product, I have been using this for about six months and it has made a huge difference in my hair loss.  A little goes a long way, I just received my second order.  I would and have recommended this product.</li>
    <li> I started using Pura d&#x27;Or roughly 11 months ago and the results have been very good, more hair, stronger hair, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Will continue to use, going forward.  Smells awesome, too.</li>
    <li> So far, I love using this shampoo! It gives my very fine hair some body, has cleared my scalp of flakiness, and has drastically cut down on the quantity of hair left on my brush.&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to find such a clean and clear shampoo that isn&#x27;t loaded with perfume, chemicals, artificial coloring, and other stuff. The health food stores are some of the worst offenders because you expect them to have healthy hair choices without having to go thru the ingredients list with a magnifying glass.&lt;br /&gt;This Pura d&#x27;or Premium Gold Label Shampoo is wonderful for my hair and scalp. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good shampoo . I start using it from last week. I love it. I want to use it again and again.</li>
    <li> I was moving abroad and traveling a lot for work when I started noticing hair loss, undoubtedly from the stress. This product not only had the best reviews, but the best list of ingredients! I tried it for a month before I left and saw results instantly. I have very thin hair and find that most shampoos/conditioners are too heavy for my hair - this one is perfect. I loved the product so much, I even took it with me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great finding a product that contains all of the major known hair-loss prevention ingredients in one.  It&#x27;s organic, safe, and a real bargain! I will continue to use this product as a preventative measure.</li>
    <li> I rarely ever write reviews.  But this product has really changed my life.  I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have noticed thinning over the past year, plus I haven&#x27;t really regained the mane that I had during my last pregnancy.  As time has gone on, I&#x27;ve become increasingly more paranoid about being able to see more scalp in the mirror.  After reading all the positive reviews, I ordered my first bottle back in April and am just now about to finish it up.  I figured that I can finish the bottle and see if I notice any difference (I hate throwing anything with a purpose away, even if I don&#x27;t like it).  Considering that it is now August and I&#x27;m just now about to finish the bottle, there&#x27;s reason number 1 for the value I feel can be attributed to this product.  But the real bonus is I&#x27;d say in the past month, I&#x27;ve noticed that I have a bunch of new growth.  I&#x27;d say its already grown out to be about 2 inches long.  But my hair appointment today with my stylist confirmed that I really am seeing results.  She kept commenting on all the new growth and said there is quite a bit about. She asked if I changed my routine or if I was using any new products.  I told her I switched to a new shampoo a while back but that&#x27;s about it.  Its such a relief to find out that this actually appears to be working and its being noticed by other people.  I am also using this conditioner, as well.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will mention is my hair did seem a bit more oily when I first started using this product, but my scalp/hair seemed to adjust within a week to where that wasn&#x27;t a problem.  It was also hard to get use to it not producing the amount of lather that other shampoos do.  I realize that its most likely due to the ingredients in this product versus the chemicals in others, but it did take a little getting use to.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a few weeks now. The smell is clean and it lathers really well for being a non sulfate shampoo. I was really quite surprised. I did not buy the conditioner but have noticed that I there seems to be an ever so slight difference in the amount of hair I&#x27;m losing on a daily basis. If nothing else, the shampoo leaves my hair tangle free which is a huuge bonus plus my hair feels overall stronger. I typically leave the shampoo in a little longer than I normally would and am sure to lather from the scalp out to the tips of my hair.</li>
    <li> I really like how clean and shiny my hair feels after only two washes. I can tell my hair is benefiting from the ingredients in the shampoo. I was a avid Nioxin shampoo user. Until my hair salon pulled it and I tried Bosley shampoo that they replaced it with and I disliked how Bosley left my hair feeling so dry and damaged feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I researched online and came across this and it rated the highest on customer reviews and thought I would give it a try. I look forward to the coming months to see how well it performs in having my hair regrow. But so far the removal of build up is amazing</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the shampoo uses all natural ingredients - no harmful chemicals like sufates or parabens.  The shampoo has a distinctive smell that takes some getting used to but it&#x27;s not a bad smell.  I do like the fact that this shampoo has a nice clean feel after using it.  If you use styling products for your hair, it will remove it completely.  Keeping your head pores unclogged doesn&#x27;t hurt in preventing hair loss.  The only complaints I have is the lack of lather from the shampoo and price.</li>
    <li> The smell is excellent!</li>
    <li> (Torrey&#x27;s Son) Smells nice and cleans my hair, haven&#x27;t used long enough to rightfully judge the hair-loss aspect</li>
    <li> nice for my family , we will keep use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month and have already noticed significant improvement. Almost no hair on my towel when I dry my hair as well as thicker hair. Great product! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product going on 3 months now. I&#x27;m almost through the entire bottle and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any hair regrowth. It does, however, seem to have slowed down the hair loss/thinning process. I&#x27;m 25 years old now and originally wanted to try the product at the first signs of hair loss just to prevent or slow down the process.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this product, my scalp has become very dry and itchy. This could be due to the fact that I&#x27;ve used the same shampoo my whole life before recently switching to pura d&#x27;or. I will go through one more bottle before I decide whether or not I can&#x27;t to continue using. By that point I will have used pura d&#x27;or for half a year and if I will ever get any noticeable results, I should see them by then.&lt;br /&gt;My example is not the best seeing as how I&#x27;m using this product to prevent and/or slow down hair loss, but I think my situation can be very relatable to many out that that are on the fence about this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both this shampoo and the blue label Pur d&#x27; or.  This one is worth the price difference.  The blue label is a very good shampoo but this one is much more rich and made my hair silkier.  I have really long hair and even though it was not falling out it does break off a lot.  I gave this shampoo a shot and my hair instantly looked fuller and had more volume.  As for what it will do for my hair follicles becoming healthier I will have to wait and see since it is too early.  The bottle says to wait 3 months for results and so far I&#x27;m only a week in but I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far!!!</li>
    <li> My hair loss become worse, and I have tried all kinds of shampoo, but none of them worked. So I turned to my friends ,and they recommend this gold bottle, it is not cheap , but I want to take a try. After few days, I can see that my hair loss fewer. I will keep using this shampoo, and thanks to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love the way this shampoo smells.  I am very picky about the way shampoo smells.  A lot of scents give me a headache.  I have only been using this product for a month now.  I haven&#x27;t noticed hair growth but I will happily continue to use this product based on all the positive reviews it has received.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great for me.  I can definitely notice a reduction in shedding.  My hairs feels thicker &amp; fuller.  You only need a small amount to get a rich lather.  Hair feels super clean afterwards.  Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> I have noticed a great improvement in my hair.  I have less hair loss, which is what I was trying to achieve.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this shampoo. My barber and I both notice the difference. My hair grows quicker and is much fuller. It only takes one plunger to give myself a complete lather. I will continue using this produce.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair loss was becoming a significant problem for her.  She tried several treatments with little success.  Then we found Pura d&#x27;or through a friend.  After about a month there was a noticeable decrease in her hair loss.  Her hair is starting to become normal again.  We are definitely going to continue using Pura d&#x27;or.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have been diagnosed with genetic alopecia in May 2014!Dr put me on rogaine and also purchased hairmax which is a laser comb!  When I read reviews about pura d&#x27; premium organic gold shampoo I thought this would also keep me from losing more hair!  I am a female in my 60&#x27;s and had very thinning hair!  I tried this shampoo and so far it is great!  Smells good and makes hair seem fuller! It has taken me 6 months of rogaine and hairmax and now with shampoo I think I&#x27;m finally seeing good results!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shampoo. After using for over a month, finally feel like hair shedding has reduced.and Yes, you should use conditioner too.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does do the magic to prevent hair loss.  I will continue using this produce and highly recommend to anyone who has the needs.</li>
    <li> The pump was open. 1/3 bottle is empty. Plastic wrap is open. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It smells like dog shampoo, does not foam well and my hair does not feel clean.</li>
    <li> Exellant shampoo organic for the hair fast shipping thank you</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo.  Have only had it a short time, so I do not know if it helps prevent hair loss.  However, I am very familiar with the ingredients and it is true that the ingredients do prevent/slow down hair loss.  Good cleanser and not overly sudsing (which can strip hair and scalp of vital protections).</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo after my doctor told me I needed to start using a shampoo for hair loss.  This product is great.  I started using it and within a few days I noticed that I was losing let hair.  Now I have almost no hair in the sink in the mornings.  I would recommend this to anyone who had a problem with hair loss</li>
    <li> Well, it works after I first time used it. But after that, it is so-so. However, my daddy has same problem as I have, I WILL RECOMMON him and my other friend to try it.</li>
    <li> I use this along with Nizoral and I noticed only a few hair falling out a day now. You must keep it lathered on your head for at least two minutes to get max effect. I use this for two days then I use Nizoral for the third day. My hair looks fuller too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! its a fairly large bottle, and a little goes a long way! as soon as I received it, I put a tiny dot in my palm and massaged into my hands, which get very dried out during the winter. it slid on like silk, and absorbed very quickly, leaving my hands soft, with no residue or even slight stickiness.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and have tried many products on the market.  I love this shampoo!  Not only does it deliver volume, but I love the natural ingredients!  I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> very mild. good for daily use. I use it with massage on scalp and I feel my hair get stronger and thicker. Definitely worth to try a bottle of organic shampoo...</li>
    <li> I tried the shampoo for just two times, and it is really good to use. My hair loss problem is kind of better than before, I think I should keep using it.</li>
    <li> My daily shampoo Ibe been using s long time before I ised the regular purador blue bottle one and now I ise this one because it says has argan oil I&#x27;m not sure though if it actually does grow hair or stuff that I don&#x27;t notice that but reason I get is because of the natural ingredients</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, love the fact its all natural, smells good, and a little dollop goes a long way. Makes my hair feel thick not sure if it helps regrow hair but I think it definately preserves the hair you have.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s little more than a month I have been using this shampoo. Since it is mild, I use small amount every day. Now I see less hair in tub. Good thing about it is that shampoo is made of organic natural stuff without harsh chemicals and it smells good. The shampoo makes the hair shiny and thick. My wife also started using it, but she adds little Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil into shampoo. She loves the soft texture of her hair. We both like this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 weeks. So far, not noticing much difference in the amount of hair I lose in a day. What I do not like about this shampoo is it does not leave my hair feeling fresh and clean. Instead, within hours, my hairs gets oily. It&#x27;s unlikely that I will order this again. Two stars for natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY this product. simple as that... I used the blue one for a year and I saw this &amp;#34;Gold Label&amp;#34; product came out and as a typical consumer, I was mesmerized with their selling strategy... So, I purchased it and what happened? :) NOTHING.. nothing ever changes with my hair thickness or loss at all... please do not fall in their stupid labeling..</li>
    <li> What a great product would defiantly buy again !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many products for ending hair loss.  I&#x27;m glad I am finally going to stop researching and testing other products.  So far, I&#x27;ve been impressed with how Pura d&#x27;or organic is working.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a month and can&#x27;t say whether the hair loss has stopped completely.  But I do like the natural lather and clean feeling without the annoying tingle.  Hair is shiny and easy to style.  I plan on using it for the recommended 3 month trial and giving an updated evaluation.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo, you can see the effects after the first use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo for nearly a month now. After a handful of uses, I noticed that I&#x27;ve had significantly less hair loss in the bathtub and filter which is definitely a sight for sore eyes. I&#x27;m relieved to have found a product that delivers what it says it will do. I think the shampoo is great in how it is gentle to the scalp and hair. It&#x27;s a worthwhile product to try if you want to preserve the health and look of your hair at any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product in a timely manner and am glad it was packaged nicely to avoid spillage or a broken bottle.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this product is completely organic and it has made my hair softer and less frizzy. However it hasn&#x27;t really impacted my hair shedding.</li>
    <li> I have noticed my hair thinning and wanted to cut it at the source. Been using this product for a few days now and have noticed a difference in the way my hair and scalp feel. would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Going on 4 months of use with no noticeable improvement in hair loss or growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I&#x27;ve had successful regrowth with prescription DHT blockers in the past (taken internally). I just wanted to try a more natural approach to it (external, topical). So, yes, I do have a condition that DHT blockers would reverse. Just not this product. I used this bottle well past 6 months and didn&#x27;t get anything but bumps/pimples around my forehead and scalp.</li>
    <li> Ive tried other organic shampoos before but none of them seemed to lather well enough. Although you dont get the lather you would with a normal shampoo this does cover the head quite well. I have been trying to take better care of my hair as I have recently started bleaching it blonde, and I know that can weaken your hair alot. This shampoo has really helped me grow it out longer even despite the bleach. I used to be able to go about 3-5 weeks between root touch ups( with 3 weeks being when I first saw the roots, and 5 being when they really got noticeable), after having started this I now have to do a touch up every 3 weeks on the mark.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and I&#x27;ve seen some impressive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. I notice a big difference in the daily hair fallen out of my head. There&#x27;s not much in the drain filter when I get out of the shower, and when I brush my hair the number hair falling out has reduced.&lt;br /&gt;2. My hair feels a lot thicker now. I haven&#x27;t seen my cousin for about 2 months or so, when I saw her she said that my hair appears thicker and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. There&#x27;s really no smell to this shampoo, I use it with the PURA D’OR: PREMIUM ORGANIC CONDITIONER, and that&#x27;s how I get my hair to smell good.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t lather much, but this shampoo is 100% natural so I understand why that&#x27;s the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while for me to notice any difference in my hair, so be patient with it if you just started the product.</li>
    <li> Pretty good so far. Not very foamy and adds volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> Made my shedding worse!!!!!!!!Worst product ever。 So disappoited</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It makes my hair look and feel great. I had read a review from someone saying it made their hair puff out or something and he couldn&#x27;t wash it out. I&#x27;m glad I went ahead with this purchase because this makes my hair feel as good as any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Just started using the product but it made my hair feel great</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome, i love it. I never really had a favorite shampoo before, but now i do. I&#x27;ve tried many other shampoos, even from the salon but  i didnt really care for any of those either, but this pura dor shampoo is wonderful. I love that its organic too and doesnt have those sulfates, parabens or other harsh chemicals. Its definately worth the price.</li>
    <li> It has OK smell and nice organic feel.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed it gives my hair more volume and far it is not bad compare to other hair loss products that does nothing although I don&#x27;t see much improvement on the hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s, female, and have hereditary thinning in my family. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months along with other things (10,000 mg biotin supplements almost daily, cut wheat out of my diet, keeping sugar to a minimum) so I couldn&#x27;t tell how much I could attribute the renewed volume of my hair to this product. Then I noticed my husband&#x27;s fine baby hairs on his head getting thicker. (Picture a hairline like George Costanza and the hairs on top that are gone or baby fine but still present).  I thought he just due for a trim but sure enough his hair is noticeably thicker.  What&#x27;s gone is still gone  (the bald spot at the back is perfectly hairless still and shiny smooth) but what&#x27;s left up top is really more voluminous. He has been using &amp;#34;my shampoo&amp;#34; since I bought it a few months back. I bought more for me and a bottle for my sister for Christmas. Glad to see the price just dropped (after I bought it of course). Try it - what do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty terrific. I purchased for my husband whose hair was thinning. Within a few uses the texture of his hair was awesome, soft but think, looked amazing. He asked me to make sure we don&#x27;t run out of it. Fabulous product.</li>
    <li> First time doing a review! I purchased Pura d&#x27;or about 4 months ago and I&#x27;m on my third bottle. I started to see results after the 2nd month. My hair got stronger and thicker so now every time I shower I don&#x27;t see a bunch of hair in my hands. Plus I got compliments from my brother and friends that my hair looks better. That&#x27;s something I like to hear! I&#x27;ve used countless products like nioxins or Rogaine and hair still kept on thinning.  I&#x27;m very happy I found this product and I highly recommend pura d&#x27;or to anyone with thinning hair! Thanks Pura d&#x27;or!!</li>
    <li> Since my pregnancy my hair started to fall out in hand fulls. I have tried a well known salon brand anti hair loss systems with no success. I decided to give this a try. With combination of a daily biotin supplement i have to say that this works! After about 4 weeks of use I have baby hairs growing in the areas of hair loss! I am truly amazed how quick and how well this product works! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love the product thus far, feels good and it foams up really well. My hair is starting to feel fuller and healthier, I hope it is not the placebo effect.</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommended. 100% satisfaction.</li>
    <li> i am 28 years old and my hair started falling off about 8 months ago and nothing has worked until i tried this product...my hair smells good it has stopped falling out and my hair seems thicker and more healthier</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo a couple of weeks ago and I really like it.  My hair started feeling stronger after a few uses.  I like the smell, it&#x27;s pretty earthy, but not too much.  As I haven&#x27;t used it long, I can&#x27;t say much about long term results, but I will keep using it.  I wish I would have ordered the conditioner at the same time.  I&#x27;m prone to tangling and I think I need to order the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I found Pura d&#x27;or shampoo to be very drying. My hair looks fuller, but that&#x27;s probably because it dried it out to the point that it looked very frizzy. I did not find a conditioner with the GOLD LABEL maybe that&#x27;s the issue.I did not notice improvement in hair loss either. :(  I really wanted this product to work for me because it use&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> My hair is soft and shiny.  I also used the conditioner.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but I do notice that the hair loss has not worsened.  There&#x27;s the same amount of hair in my brush, or maybe a little less.  I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle so far.  I do notice that it makes my hair dry.  Therefore, I do recommend a conditioner, especially if you have hair longer than an inch or two.</li>
    <li> This product helped to improve the health of my hair, and I see that it also became a bit heavier. although I didn&#x27;t use the product for the recommended period &amp;#34;3 Mothes Daily&amp;#34; yet, I can still see some improvement. I&#x27;ve a bald area above forehead, and I was expecting a magical effect of regorwing this region, but that didn&#x27;t happen anyway. I would still recommend it due to various reasons e.g. it performed well in dandruff removal, and overall scalp health. A great product that I&#x27;ll continue using until I find anything more magical.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product now for 3 weeks. My hair looks and feels thicker.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: After using the entire bottle of this very watery shampoo, I have not found any benefit to it at all. More of my hair is falling out than ever. I hate the texture of the shampoo and it&#x27;s so runny that it&#x27;s hard to keep it from running off of my hand before I get it to my head. This shampoo did not come with any instructions about how often it needs to be used or how long it should be left in the hair. I gave this product a previous, early review because I was promised a free bottle for a review. I will not be using the free bottle. I recently started using Bosley and it seems to be helping reduce hair fall.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been using the product long enough to know if it helps with hair loss. What I can say is that the shampoo is very thin and runny compared to other shampoos I am used to using. I am not crazy about the texture of the shampoo but will use it for some time to see if it helps stop my hair from falling out so much. I will update my review in a few months.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and will continue to use it. I&#x27;ve used hair surge before but this stuff trumps it</li>
    <li> I bought this product weeks ago due to the previous reviews.  I wore my hair in short spikes for a number of years and recently decided to grow it out.  I purchased this product in hopes to thicken my hair during the grow out process.  I like this product because it is gentle and my hair looks healthier in years.  Soft and shiny.  I feel that this product will help me achieve thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly this shampoo worked, noticed a difference right away on the comb.</li>
    <li> love this product makes my hair soft and shiney</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and have new hair growth... granted I have also been trying to remember to take my biotin... which I had been taking for a year and then added this shampoo and finally see new hair growth... granted... my hair seems to be dryer now... less oily too... the first week to two weeks it felt like my scalp had to adjust so a little itchiness and some bumps (similar to acne or ingrown hairs) but that stopped and now I have little new fly away hairs all over the top of my scalp.  I need to use a deep conditioner now more frequently... but that is for my ends... I have very long dark blonde hair that has been thinning for the past 3 years... this with biotin seems to be the first thing that helped.  Naproxin from the hair dresser just made my scalp (and any skin it touched) red and raise... never saw results... this shampoo I saw new hair after about 2-2weeks! Drawback is... it smells very herbal and you need deep conditioners.</li>
    <li> It really works. I don&#x27;t loss any hair anymore. I used to see a lot hair on the foam when I scrubbed my hair. But no more....Thank you pura d&#x27;or!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is falling out less and it feels clean and healthy. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy with build up. great product.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from hair lost since 10 year ago, I have tried a lot products such as shampoos, hair tonics and capsules but nothing haven&#x27;t stoped it. However I have been washing my hair with pura d&#x27;or shampoo since 4 months ago and the hair lost have significantly diminished. This product is fantastic, every moring I found less hair lose in the shower. I&#x27;m growing new hair and my hair also looks fuller and healthier.</li>
    <li> I bought several hair products, and this is my favorite. Is short of time to fully judge the product as I have used it for 1 month, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I drop less hair with each wash. I&#x27;m using the product every day right now, but I think it&#x27;s safe to say this shampoo is very beneficial</li>
    <li> This was a good product i would consider buying this again</li>
    <li> I bought both shampoo and conditioner  after using it for a few times I notice my hair is much more healthier, softer and smoother.  I like this product so much. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;ve noticed in the last year of use . Seems my hair lose has really slowed down a lot since I&#x27;ve started using this product . Leaves my hair feeling clean and I feel it is safer for me than some of my other choices on the market . Thank You for a fine product .....</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair so I thought I would give this a try. I have been using this shampoo for a little over 4 months now and here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- I noticed an increased volume in my hair after a week&lt;br /&gt;- One bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;- Natural preservatives (although I&#x27;m not sure if it makes a difference)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable slowing in my hair loss&lt;br /&gt;- I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable increase in new hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I will still continue to buy this shampoo, I like the increased volume and if there is any chance it could help slow my hair loss and/or start more new hair it would just be a bonus.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on ordering this on the Amazon Daily Deal but reading the reviews from others made me feel comfortable to try it --- not to mention the good price!  I am extremely happy with this product!!!!  I have been using it daily and the area that has truly made me a believer are my cuticles.  I always have dry cuticles (especially in the winter) and have used many oils and hand lotions in the past and none made a difference.  After just two applications of purr d&#x27;or my cuticles are so much softer!  I had a manicure the other day and the technician even mentioned how nice my cuticles were --- and this is not typical for me.  I am using it on my hair and face.  Very very pleased.</li>
    <li> I like the lightness of this product. The smell is ok, but would like a bit of a citrus or floral scent</li>
    <li> Hard to tell how much it helps, but haven&#x27;t had any bad side effects or anything.</li>
    <li> I find it very difficult to review this product because I began tying my hair and washing it a lot less coincidentally after purchasing this shampoo. Also, another change that occurred around the same time as introducing this shampoo was that I began to be much more gentle to my hair when washing. I used to run my hands down my hair while in the shower to smooth out the surface and that took out a LOT of hair. I don&#x27;t know why I kept doing it. Actually, I do. The reason is because I knew that we all lose hair naturally and I thought that I was only losing what I would have normally lost. I recently learned from my new stylist that the combo of being rough with your hair and your scalp being nice and hot and open from the shower water makes you lose MORE hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 2.5 stars because I like the smell and I like that it&#x27;s natural. I do not like the formula. It does not lather luxuriously and has left me going back for more pumps of this pricey shampoo. In my case I can&#x27;t say if it has actually stopped hair loss.</li>
    <li> seems like a very good shampoo.  makes my hair feel strong, soft and clean.  have been using this for about a year now, can&#x27;t really tell if it appears to be working or not to be honest.  My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to have gotten any worse so I will continue use to see what happens.  Overall, a good product, would recommend trying it at least.</li>
    <li> gets a little greasy after a while. left my hair feeling great and full. overall, good shampoo!</li>
    <li> My hair after the first washing had bounce and shine something that has been lacking for the longing time ever!....so encouraged with the out come I immediately ordered the conditioner . Looking forward to healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now. Before I started using this product I was losing hair fast. Since I&#x27;ve been using it however, my hair loss has come to a crawling stop. My hair also is beginning to look fuller as well. It&#x27;s taken time, so don&#x27;t expect your hair to grow back with one bottle. But I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is beginning to lose their hair. Plus the product lasts a long time and is great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I used the shampoo and my hair feels thicker and has more body. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any hair growth.</li>
    <li> Looks good so far, I will write some more after using whole bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works great and lathers great also....and you can&#x27;t beat organic chemical free hair care.  We have ordered it several times.  Always arrives fast!</li>
    <li> I really love this product ! I&#x27;m from france and I just could find it here on amazon.com. Really smooth, nice perfume and extremely effective. I&#x27;ve searched for a good DHT blocker for years and I think this is the one.</li>
    <li> My 60something girlfriend turned me on to this shampoo.  her hair has grown in thicker since she started using this 3 months ago.  I&#x27;ve only used a few times and my hair feels already is healthier looking.  even my husband commented on how good my hair looks.</li>
    <li> An altogether great product for thinning hair. I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo which was so effective. My hair feels thick/more volume, and more manageable. Only con is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any difference in my hair and I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo now for several months.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, make yourself a favor and add this amazing shampoo to your anti hair-lost routine.</li>
    <li> noticed a big difference with the first shampoo.  time will tell, though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female in my early 30s. No illnesses of any kind, just hair thinning that runs in the family. After using this shampoo for a few months the shedding has significantly decreased. I&#x27;m hoping that after a few more months of use the hair will start growing back in thinning areas.</li>
    <li> I Love this shampoo so much...I have tried others that claim to be the best...THIS ONE IS! The lather is so thick and rich. I also use the Pura d&#x27; or condition...The combination is outstanding! I have fine hair, not to mention it is color treated...and you know that can be a mess all by itself...so do I recommend this product? You bet I do! You have a loyal customer right here....Thank you for an organic product that feels so rich...</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this product after noticing hair thinning throughout my scalp and wanted to take action to prevent it from getting worse.  I have tried a few different products with nothing making any noticeable differences.  After using Pura d&#x27;or shampoo I can see a noticeable difference in hair fullness and believe the product is definitely doing its job.  Well worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a month now haven&#x27;t noticed any changes still loosing hair.  Will update later.</li>
    <li> My hair feels lot healthy after 2 weeks of regular usage. I notice less hair fall now.</li>
    <li> This is the first and only shampoo that has actually lessened my hair loss. I use it in conjuction with an organic hair loss product and internally taken blackberry oil capsules. This trifecta has worked when nothing else has. Is it making my hair grow back? Not sure I could go that far, but I&#x27;m no longer concerned that I&#x27;ll be bald by summer. Just hope it keeps working.</li>
    <li> it really DOES work. this one and the one with the blue label, doesn&#x27;t matter which one you use, you will see the results in about 1 month (at least for me it took about a month to see the results). i&#x27;ve been using Pura D&#x27;or for about 3 months now and it hasn&#x27;t only prevent hair loss, but it also lead to hair growth. i never believed anything might help, but due to so many positive reviews i decided to give a shot and ordered several of them altogether (2 with blue label and one with gold one). thanks Pura D&#x27;or !</li>
    <li> I am a 37 year old female with PCOS. I started losing my hair around age 13 and have the kind of hair where you can see my scalp. I started researching and found this product and after 3 months of using it daily I HIGHLY recommend it. I have hair growing in all over my scalp. In addition,  the hair that I already had is feeling much stronger and healthier. If you are a woman with PCOS and associated hairloss,  you really needs to try this. People with PCOS produce too much of the hormone that this product works to block. I just can&#x27;t believe that my doctors never told me about this.... it works!!!</li>
    <li> Not the best smelling stuff, only been using it for a couple weeks but no serious complaints here so far. :)</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband who has been using for little over a month coupled with the anti-hair loss shampoo.  Not enough time to really see real improvement but he likes it for it&#x27;s conditioning results.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and will buy again.</li>
    <li> The bottle came leaked, but the seller instantly sent replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With overwhelmingly positive reviews on this product, I expect it to help slow down my hair loss.</li>
    <li> It really loos working! Deserves oversee shopping!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really works on my hair and make my oily scalp comfortable. Other products always emphasize how merriment they will be but I don&#x27;t need it. I have an oily scalp. Thanks for the fantastic thing. Only one pro, it is a small bottle but worth the price.</li>
    <li> Changed the formula without warning. The last bottle I had had all natural ingredients and now includes Ketoconazole. The WHOLE reason I originally bought this shampoo is because it didn&#x27;t have that ingredient. Now it gives me horrible headaches (I never get headaches otherwise). I want my money back because I bought this product under false pretenses!</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair about 2 years ago. Every time I washed my hair (daily) I would see more than I wanted to in the tub. It is very embarrassing for me as a female, age 53, to be losing my hair. If you are a female looking at this product then you can relate.  I have tried different salon products and nothing seemed to work. Then, I found this, tried it and I am so very glad I did!!!  I have been buying it from Amazon ever since. I will NEVER use anything else.  My hair loss stopped almost immediately. I am not kidding!  I am being very honest here.  I have read some of the 1 and 2 star reviews and I just don&#x27;t get it.  I am sorry it didn&#x27;t work for them but I am so glad it is working for me.  I use it along with the available conditioner as well.  The shampoo sort of smells like coffee beans, while the conditioner has a very light scent of lavender and vanilla. I will be in trouble if they ever stop selling it!</li>
    <li> The natural oils in this shampoo leaves your hair super shiny. Great Product!</li>
    <li> Great product, hair feels and looks healthy unlike those big name brand ones</li>
    <li> Been working great! Fast Delivery!</li>
    <li> This product has worked great for hair fall. It also smells terrific and leaves my sensitive scalp clean.  I would recommend this organic product to anyone with scalp issues.</li>
    <li> i have  worked in casino before  , i alway  have  night shift ，and i  need  wash hair  everyday ，so  i have calvities now。I&#x27;ve tried many types of shampoo，i love this shampoo，you  can use it everyday  and your hair will not  dry 。my hair feels fuller ，and i introduced it to  my friends， i love this shampoo，i will buy  it  again。</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for about 6 months now.  I think it has stopped the shedding and I really like how my hair feels after I use it.  I have short hair, so I don&#x27;t need a lot to lather up...which means the bottle lasts quite a while.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but I think it&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment on hair &amp;#34;regrowth&amp;#34; as I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m there just yet, but I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that my hair is not coming out like it was prior to using Pura d&#x27;or!!  I&#x27;m so thankful!  The smell is pleasant, not heavily perfumed.  It lathers nicely, though I use very little.  I will definitely get this again!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Was really excited about getting this product after seeing so many positive reviews. I have fine, thin hair and have started having hair loss, which is hereditary. When I opened the shampoo, it smells kind of like medicine. I used it one time. As I was washing my hair, I ran my fingers though it and could feel some hair stands come out. I hurried up and rinsed and applied the condition. As soon as I lifted my head up, I looked in the sink and saw a small clump of hair. I tried to comb it out and more stands where coming out. I hurried up and washed my hair with my regular shampoo like 3 times and hair stopped coming out. It seems to be okay now, but will not use again.</li>
    <li> Recently ordered this shampoo. I have been using for about a week and although no obvious results that can be seen by others but I do see some difference</li>
    <li> Not worth the money, I love the other hair product better and it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Seems to work ok - will dry your hair though so be prepared to use a conditioner along with it</li>
    <li> Great product, seems to be doing the trick!</li>
