      <li>I love this thing!</li>
      <li>However it does not seem to have any kind of odor .  </li>
      <li>Takes a bit to warm up.</li>
      <li>After I changed out the oil that came with product, and used one from my own collection...</li>
      <li>Its nice that it comes with refill pads.</li>
      <li>so I am hoping it keeps up doing the great job and makes my car smell lovely:)</li>
      <li>Will try w my own oils.</li>
      <li>Not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>I use this handy plug in for aromatherapy in my car.</li>
      <li>The car must be running and the diffuser has to &#x27;warm up&#x27; before the aromatherapy kicks in.  </li>
      <li>This works well and along with the pads and a nice liquid scent makes my car smell nice.  </li>
      <li>nice concept, but cheaply made!</li>
      <li>My favorite is lavender oil which is a nice calming smell for stressful driving.  </li>
      <li>I worry about this product because it is so cheap and diffuses by heat, but for my light driving purposes its great.</li>
      <li>I was happy using this item for the first week.</li>
      <li>Any pure oil will work, but mint or citrus oils (like grapefruit or sweet orange) have worked best for me in my car.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>My 45 minute drive to and from work is more enjoyable with energizing or de-stressing oils.</li>
      <li>and we all love ours and suggest it to others.</li>
      <li>The set of diffusers for the Aromatherapy Room and car diffusers from Aura Cacia is wayy better than synthetic chemicals used in home scent diffusers.</li>
      <li>Works ok, wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Great price &amp; FAST shipping.</li>
      <li>I was able to &#x27;smell&#x27; the oil in my car.</li>
      <li>These are ok and I love the concept.  </li>
      <li>Love this in my car.</li>
      <li>Make sure you unplug each time you turn off your car.</li>
      <li>I love these types of car diffusers.</li>
      <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>but i always unplug the diffuser when i turn my car off, and i wouldnt ever run it for more than a hour at at time</li>
      <li>In top of that the seller tried to bargain my rating.</li>
      <li>Works great and my aromatic oils diffuse into the whole vehicle.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re  supposed to load the wick and be able to use it over and over.</li>
      <li>but that is more from just having the oil on something in it.</li>
      <li>I have one of these that I use in my car &amp; have enjoyed it .</li>
      <li>Its ok.</li>
      <li>Feels cheap too!</li>
      <li>I think that I would be better off &amp;#34;spilling&amp;#34; oil in the car.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is noticeable within a minute or two depending on how many oil drops you use.</li>
      <li>2 more words</li>
      <li>Seems to work well with my essential oils and makes my car smell great!  </li>
      <li>so, i was SO excited to find this,a nice alternative to synthetic scents.&lt;br /&gt;Alas</li>
      <li>However, the option to switch scents whenever you&#x27;d like is pretty good.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve already used it for more than a week now and the 6 drops of peppermint and 4 drops of orange continues to remain strong in our car.</li>
      <li>Out of 3 this one seems to be releasing the more smell than others as this diffuser heats very quickly.</li>
      <li>I am using the pads with different kind of natural oils infused already and so far it is the best at putting on the mood I am looking for at time with working at its best efforts that can be!</li>
      <li>No real complaints here, it works great!</li>
      <li>You could just as easily make up a spray bottle to freshen up each time you get in your vehicle.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sit well in my lighter receptacle and will pop out easily.  </li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
      <li>The diffuser does not release strong scent.</li>
      <li>I used tangerine oil, and it smells nice, even on short 10 minute drives, we love it!</li>
      <li>It is great to have the scent of essential oils while I am driving.</li>
      <li>They enjoy it as well.</li>
      <li>It was cheap.</li>
      <li>The material is made with cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>The concept is great and occasionally it even works great--when it stays plugged in.</li>
      <li>When you turn the engine off, the light goes out and the diffuser is off.</li>
      <li>I received the order very promptly, which was really nice.  </li>
      <li>It was cheap, so I trashed it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to fit into our car&#x27;s lighter port.</li>
      <li>cheap and behave that way</li>
      <li>This product works great the only thing I don&#x27;t like is</li>
      <li>I added 10 drops of peppermint and my whole car was smelling amazing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. Diffuses oil for a bit but have to fill it up regularly. Comes with scent pads as well so don&#x27;t bother getting extras.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 4 of these diffusers.  They are SUPER strong if you use Bath and Body Works, Yankee Candle or even Walmart&#x27;s  Home Fragrance Oils (forget about the essential oils). They come in a great range of scents (I love Bath and Body Work&#x27;s Market Peach).  They scent the car almost immediately with 5 drops.</li>
    <li> i purchased two. one for my car and one for my truck and when i plugged them in nothing happend, i was really excited about scenting my car with natural oils but the pine tree from the car wash works better. i left them in the outlet for at least 30 min. the time it takes me to get to town but nothing. i&#x27;ll stick to smelling myself and leave the gadgets alone.</li>
    <li> When you start your car, the diffuser lights up with a green light. When you turn the engine off, the light goes out and the diffuser is off. Also, there are 5 pads that are included with this device, but they are hidden well within the package. I almost threw the package away, until I decided to tear the package open completely.</li>
    <li> It works, but I have to put quite a bit of oil on the paper pads to get it to really diffuse well.  Not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I like having an option for giving my car a fragrance that isn&#x27;t artificial.  It works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Too big for my care charger opening.</li>
    <li> I like this diffuser better than ordinary car air fresheners which can be too parfume-y, i.e artificial and heavy; with a diffuser, the smell depends on what essential oil one is using. Also dependent on the oil is the intensity and the longevity of the flavor...&lt;br /&gt;But back to our product: this car diffuser certainly does its job, and it&#x27;s really easy to use: put a few drops of essential oil on the pad, place the pad in the diffuser, plug the diffuser into the car lighter. The fragrance begins to diffuse almost instantaneously.&lt;br /&gt;The pads tend to dry out quickly and cannot be washed, but refill pads can be bought separately (the diffuser comes with five pads). All in all, definitely higher maintenance than ordinary car fresheners, but worth it: pleasanter and healthier fragrance. I&#x27;ve had the diffuser for a couple of moths and it&#x27;s still working well.</li>
    <li> Blows the fuse in my van every time.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect after a long day at work on my half hour drive home.</li>
    <li> My husband puts this one in his work truck and he says he likes it.</li>
    <li> Love running oils in my car! Great!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!! This product looks like it came from the dollar store! It doesn&#x27;t work at all, I didn&#x27;t notice any scent in my car at all. The best thing to get is the fabric air fresheners in the tin can from california scents. This product won&#x27;t do your car any justic.. What a Joke!</li>
    <li> Does the job. Its nice that it comes with refill pads. I gave one to everyone in my family! They enjoy it as well.</li>
    <li> This works really good at diffusing in the car and on the go.</li>
    <li> for the price this product worked very well...if you want to always use it you may want to spend a little more money on one....but for the price this product works very well...</li>
    <li> This aromatherapy car diffuser is very simple to use. You put a few drops of any essential oil on a small pad that you insert into the front of the diffuser, plug it into your car lighter and that&#x27;s it. The fragrance is noticeable within a minute or two depending on how many oil drops you use. Usually between three and five drops is enough for most cars. I have tried peppermint oil and it makes the air feel cool to breathe and does help keep you alert. Any pure oil will work, but mint or citrus oils (like grapefruit or sweet orange) have worked best for me in my car. The pads seem to last a long time and it&#x27;s best to use one pad for each different fragrance you use. The diffuser comes with five pads. Additional refill pads can be purchased seperately (very inexpensive). I prefer this diffuser to typical car air freshners that have a strong artificial or overly perfumy smell. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I have one of these that I use in my car &amp; have enjoyed it . I purchased this for my daughter in law&#x27;s birthday. She loved it! She is a DoTerra Rep so can reccomend it to customers as well.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell for very long at all</li>
    <li> Kept sliding out of the port; very annoying. It was cheap, so I trashed it.</li>
    <li> After I changed out the oil that came with product, and used one from my own collection...I was able to &#x27;smell&#x27; the oil in my car. Major problem...the scent doesnt last long. I will not buy another one for my other car....I guess I got burned on this one ;o)</li>
    <li> I bought this diffuser a few years ago, but never posted a review of it. I had forgotten about it, but just saw it because I recently bought another Aura Cacia product. Well, I had the same problem others have mentioned, it blew 2 fuses in my car in a matter of seconds - I had to stop using it. It costed me a trip to the auto center and the trouble of pulling the blown fuses out.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and with the &amp;#34;pads&amp;#34;, offers numerous opportunities to alter the aromas in the car while driving.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy and good price.</li>
    <li> Even in a small car, this diffuser puts out a marginally noticeable fragrance...unless you use a powerful oil like spearmint.</li>
    <li> This works well and along with the pads and a nice liquid scent makes my car smell nice.  2 more words</li>
    <li> Seems to work well with my essential oils and makes my car smell great!  Plenty of extra reusable pads included.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the kind of air freshners you would find at walmart and other stores and this seemed interesting to me. I&#x27;m so happy I came across this diffuser. I can use any of my essential oils I want in it for what ever mood. I put Sandlewood patchouli and vanilla in it and still when I get in my car I can smell it. I would recommend this Diffuser for your car or campers.</li>
    <li> The scent pads tend to dry out quickly and I need to refill too often.  It works just as well to put a drop anywhere in your car.</li>
    <li> Works ok, wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I used the essential oils I have and it didn&#x27;t give much of a sent without using a lot of oil. It also got very hot.</li>
    <li> These are ok and I love the concept.  What I do not love is when you turn the car off, it keeps running.  I went days without driving my car, and got in car only to find out this diffuser was still running.  Make sure you unplug each time you turn off your car.</li>
    <li> I love these types of car diffusers. You do have to reapply the essentail oil. Eventually the pad will get saturated and you won&#x27;t have to re-apply as often. I also suggest buying your oil at The Body Shop. Their oils are of a good quality and have a stronger, lingering scent. As a matter of fact, this is just like the one that I bought at The Body Shop years ago.</li>
    <li> wish it would of worked better! nice concept, but cheaply made! ended up throwing it away ! dont waste your money!</li>
    <li> Pretty cheap looking product.  I was surprised how small this was and it doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of fragrance.  Slightly disappointed</li>
    <li> Just a warning; this may not happen to everyone, but i discovered the hard way that this little sucker draws some serious amps! It blew 3 fuses in my 2011 Suburban. Not happy!! I took my car in and had fuses replaced and promptly plugged this in not realizing it was the culprit. The fuse blew within 2seconds. Pop! and a little smoke. Not happy- not happy at all!! I was so looking forward to a non chemical deodorizer. So disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Does not work w the Lavendar oil that comes w the Diffuser.  Can not smell the lavendar scent.  Will try w my own oils.</li>
    <li> Not a strong diffuser, but gets the job done in the small space of a vehicle!</li>
    <li> I used it in my car with lemon oil, but it never seemed to smell at all.. I usually just put the oil on a kleenex and place it in the ac vent and that works a whole lot better.. sorry I cannot recommend..</li>
    <li> I was happy using this item for the first week. Makes the car smell wonderful. Then, it just stopped working.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that it did not give scent for more than the first day.  I think that the heating of the oils destroys the strength and the integrity of them and does not allow them to perform at their strongest. I did try addressing the fact that they dry out like so many have posted so when I got it I soaked it in grape seed oil (because I had that on hand) and then loaded it with the oils in the car.  This did prevent the filter from drying out as fast but it did not help the oils stay active.  I think that I would be better off &amp;#34;spilling&amp;#34; oil in the car.  It was unfortunate that the diffuser did not work I was looking forward to my car smelling like doTerra &amp;#34;citrus bliss&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My car now smells great</li>
    <li> Its ok. but changing pad always is a pain.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my car so when sitting in traffic I feel like I am at the&lt;br /&gt;Spa.  It leaves the car smelling great with the DoTerra Essential Oils that&lt;br /&gt;I use.  Easy to use and wonderful to inhale ~</li>
    <li> Beyond Pleased.&lt;br /&gt;For such a les than low price, I truthfully was expecting little satisfaction.  But holy cow, I used my car diffuser today, &amp; KAPOWW!  I was so impressed and more than satisfied!  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to benefit from pills whilst driving around.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product (this is my 2nd one for a gift) since I sensitive to many of the strong and artificial smells for car fresheners.  I add a few drops every two or three weeks and have different &amp;#34;cards&amp;#34; for various moods.  Now my car smell like a spa!</li>
    <li> This is a great item to relieve driver stress or to offer a mental alert essence oil for one while driving.  We found ours to be a pleasant addition to our automobile.  It also makes an excellent gift item.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T!!!!!&#x27;!!!!!!!!!!! You&#x27;ve been WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!! it started to smoke!!!</li>
    <li> It only stays scented for about a day or two. I expected it to last for at least 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> I was not sure at thirst but when I put it in the car it was a wow! Comes with instruction and refill pad.</li>
    <li> No real complaints here, it works great! Heats up quickly and fills my car with scents. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love this in my car. Only air freshener that works and relaxes me</li>
    <li> Died in a week. It was cheap. Booo</li>
    <li> This is my second AC car diffuser :)  Also got one for a friend this time; she was so happy!</li>
    <li> I use this car diffuser in my car with my YLEO.&lt;br /&gt;I use YLEO usually lemon, orange, citrus fresh, or grapefruit to have sweet citrus smell in my car!!!&lt;br /&gt;Get it  and do something good for your car and your health!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would definitely buy this from this seller again-- they had very fast shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;Good gift for birthdays and Christmas presents</li>
    <li> It is a tight fit to plug in and it likes to pop back back out of the socket, but otherwise it works like I had expected it to.</li>
    <li> This works but does not produce a long lasting scent.  You have to reapply essential oil often to get the smell in your car.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This product does just what it&#x27;s supposed to.  My favorite is lavender oil which is a nice calming smell for stressful driving.  It&#x27;s nice that it comes with multiple pads to go in.  It heats up quick and you can smell the aroma almost instantly.  My husband could even smell it when getting in the car! I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for some aromatherapy while driving. :)</li>
    <li> The set of diffusers for the Aromatherapy Room and car diffusers from Aura Cacia is wayy better than synthetic chemicals used in home scent diffusers. This one works with natural essential oils form Eucaliptus, Citrus, Lavender etc. That&#x27;s The real deal.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed because it does not seems to work. Now  the light goes on when you plug in the diffuser. However it does not seem to have any kind of odor .  I tired using the and the bottle of lavendar that comes with it does not throw any scent off. I even tried a  different kind and it still does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I threw money away</li>
    <li> Fast shipping .I can decide the essential oil I want for the aroma I want in the car Works great</li>
    <li> All was delivered and came as advertised.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t sit well in my lighter receptacle and will pop out easily.  My car does smell wonderful though but that is more from just having the oil on something in it.</li>
    <li> so, i was SO excited to find this,a nice alternative to synthetic scents.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, the oil may last 15-20 minutes, then it&#x27;s gone.  So, just know that going into the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;When we have long road trips, we really use it.  The car can smell a little iffy.&lt;br /&gt;You put a few drops on the pad, put it in there and voila!&lt;br /&gt;we do still use it, just not as much as i would like.</li>
    <li> it does what is says. take 10-15 minutes for the diffuser pad to heat up. specially god for long drives</li>
    <li> These things are great!  This one is a bit chinsy (cheap) and I think they should come with more essential oil pads but it does work and I guess that is all that really matters.</li>
    <li> I was incredibly disappointed and returned this product. However, I received a MADE IN CHINA white plain box with a TERRIBLE smelling lavender -- worse than new car smell -- not the Aura Cacia AC Car Diffuser packaging or essential oil so I&#x27;m not sure if this is a distribution issue making counterfeit products or what. My non-working diffuser does look similar to the image on the site.</li>
    <li> good product would buy again</li>
    <li> I use this diffuser with essential oils in my car and like it. It works well and fits great in my car outlet.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to fit into our car&#x27;s lighter port.</li>
    <li> They were as expected.</li>
    <li> I really like being able to use my essential oils in my car not just home.</li>
    <li> Bought this to sanitize the air during flu season in my family car.  I like how long the scent lasts on the pads and that it comes with  many replacement pads.</li>
    <li> Item came very fast, a week early with super saver shipping. Comes with several pads. I used tangerine oil, and it smells nice, even on short 10 minute drives, we love it! No problems at all, even though I was a bit hesitant to get it considering the reviews of some people, so I&#x27;m glad we got exactly what we expected!!</li>
    <li> great diffuser. Does tkae some time to &amp;#34;warm up&amp;#34; and throw the scent, but would recommend to others! I have bought 2</li>
    <li> The diffuser does not release strong scent. Not as strong as a regular air freshener. It&#x27;s also a pain to have to put oil on the diffuser pad and insert in diffuser. However, the option to switch scents whenever you&#x27;d like is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Other reviews described the same thing but I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re cheap and behave that way--the connection gets finicky and then it stops functioning altogether in just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I bough the refills for this when I ordered it and I am glad I did.  The refills allows you to change fragrances and they are very inexpensive.  This is a much more economical way to keep the air smelling fresh during your commute.</li>
    <li> I received the order very promptly, which was really nice.  The product is just fine for what it is, an essential oil diffuser that uses warmth distribute the aroma and therapeutic qualities of whatever oil you choose.  It is simple to use, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  I&#x27;ve seen a small vaporizer type diffuser that works in a car, and I may try that too.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it now.  Every time we travel we have it going and we all love ours and suggest it to others.</li>
    <li> The item arrived new (without a box) and included a number of extra scent pads. It works well. No frills, but none are needed.</li>
    <li> Just put a few of you favorate drops on the pad and it last a long time.  I use clove oil and my whole car smell great.</li>
    <li> The car must be running and the diffuser has to &#x27;warm up&#x27; before the aromatherapy kicks in.  If you are driving short distances, you will never smell it.  Big bummer :(</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product until I used it.  It simply doesn&#x27;t work.  It doesn&#x27;t engage properly, so the light does not always come on and is literally falling apart and therefore is useless.  Quite disappointing.....</li>
    <li> This is definitely nice to have if you use essential oils; it seems to disperse the scent well and last for a long time during car rides or just around town.</li>
    <li> This a actually worked maybe twice. You&#x27;re  supposed to load the wick and be able to use it over and over. You may as well just dump oil all over your car&#x27;s interior.</li>
    <li> I use this in my car almost everday.  It is great to have the scent of essential oils while I am driving.</li>
    <li> I love aromatherapy and use essential oils daily in pretty much all my cleaning and beauty products, but this thing does not work. I even added more drops of the essential oil I used but I could not smell anything. It really deserves no stars!</li>
    <li> Works great and my aromatic oils diffuse into the whole vehicle.</li>
    <li> The five star rating reflects the quality of the product and the timeliness in which it was shipped.  It was ontime and the image displayed in the advertisement was exactly what i received.  The item  I wanted is what I got.  I would reccomend the product to anyone interested in this product line.  I was not dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Does not work very well.</li>
    <li> Does not fit the car lighter. The material is made with cheap plastic. Useless product. In top of that the seller tried to bargain my rating. This is just unbelievable !</li>
    <li> Yes it works.  You place a few drops on the pad and it will scent your vehicle.  I think that it gets too hot in the sense it burns off very quickly.  It maybe lasts 20 minutes.  I was hoping for a longer diffusion.  You could just as easily make up a spray bottle to freshen up each time you get in your vehicle.  It would last about as long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get away from all of those chemicals out there these days.  This one is great because it&#x27;s reusable (it comes with extra pads), and it is extremely versatile.  Whatever oils you want to use, just put a few drops on the pad, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> This is my third time buying a car oil diffuser. Out of 3 this one seems to be releasing the more smell than others as this diffuser heats very quickly. I couldnt pass two months with other they all stopped working after then so I am hoping it keeps up doing the great job and makes my car smell lovely:) I am using the pads with different kind of natural oils infused already and so far it is the best at putting on the mood I am looking for at time with working at its best efforts that can be!</li>
    <li> i expected for the unit to have a small fan blade to properly diffuse the essential oils. I would recommend it but it is a personal choice to choice or not choice how your car may or may not smell.</li>
    <li> I worry about this product because it is so cheap and diffuses by heat, but for my light driving purposes its great. I use young living oils and use about 5 drops. i have it running 15 minutes for my drive to school and back and it lasts for 3-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be overly paranoid but i always unplug the diffuser when i turn my car off, and i wouldnt ever run it for more than a hour at at time</li>
    <li> Not as aromatic as I had hoped....very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. I wasted good quality essential oils.</li>
    <li> Purchased one for my car and one for my husband&#x27;s. We&#x27;ve already used it for more than a week now and the 6 drops of peppermint and 4 drops of orange continues to remain strong in our car. We do leave the chargers unplugged when not in use but once plugged into the outlet, the scent starts up quickly and covers the entire car even after the plug has been taken out. Definitely a great purchase. Love that it comes with 6 refillable pads for scents as well!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! It keeps my car smelling great!</li>
    <li> Love this little contraption!!! My car smells wonderful and I love how simple the diffuser is to use!!!</li>
    <li> Needs to warm up faster so the oil scent can disperse before you get 25 miles down the road. That is how long it took to get a whiff of the lemon scented tab I had inserted into this thing. Feels cheap too!</li>
    <li> i use this in my car all of the time!!!! love how it makes my car smell!!! great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Takes a bit to warm up. Can use pad several months. I unplug between uses. Oil scent doesn&#x27;t last super long.</li>
    <li> This car diffuser plugs in great into my car. I really like there is directions on how much oil to add to the pad. I added 10 drops of peppermint and my whole car was smelling amazing. I am very happy I got this car diffuser.</li>
    <li> Love the diffuser in the car! Disappointed that I can not buy in bulk</li>
    <li> This product works great the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long and it takes quite a few drops of oil to be effective.</li>
    <li> This product blew my fuses in my car. I was never able to use it. Not a good choice for us.</li>
    <li> Works really well in my car.  The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.  I am using Vanilla Essential Oil and it is truly lovely.</li>
    <li> Just put a few drops of oil on the pad, and plug in! I think this a a success, I smelled the oil I applied after a few minutes... Although I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend leaving it in the lighter adapter all day, because it will keep burning... all in all, I like this product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Could never find standard air fresheners that smelled &#x27;authentic;&#x27; this allows me to use whatever oil I choose.  Inexpensive; came with plenty of extra pads; highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Wish I had not waited so long to try this in my car.  It pops itself out of the cig lighter socket after about 10 min of use.  Pretty useless</li>
    <li> I use this handy plug in for aromatherapy in my car. My 45 minute drive to and from work is more enjoyable with energizing or de-stressing oils.</li>
    <li> The concept is great and occasionally it even works great--when it stays plugged in. Problem is it doesn&#x27;t stay plugged in. Hit a bump in the road and it pops out. I&#x27;ll keep it though and see if there might be something I can do to modify it a little because it is a great idea.</li>
    <li> I love it! Great product :) Great price &amp; FAST shipping. Thx</li>
