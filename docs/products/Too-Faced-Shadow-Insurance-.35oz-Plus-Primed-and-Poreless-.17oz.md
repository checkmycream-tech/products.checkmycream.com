      <li>pretty good job not creasing eye shadow.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>it goes on so smooth and</li>
      <li>At first I fell in love with the tube-</li>
      <li>Shadow insurance is SO WORTH IT!</li>
      <li>So yes, it is true</li>
      <li>The Shadow Insurance is a must have for anyone interested in having all day wear with their eyeshadow!</li>
      <li>As a makeup artists I liked the idea of an eyeshadow primer that will keep the eye-makeup last longer.</li>
      <li>The shadow insurance is not what I expected, but it is a really nice product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to powder when I use it unless it&#x27;s really hot or been on for like 10 hours.</li>
      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t mine getting it as a present :)</li>
      <li>First, I never received the primer</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it isn&#x27;t something you can just use a little of - you really have to use a good amount, so</li>
      <li>It helps your eyeshadow stay in place all day long and makes your colors more vibrant.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really light and almost disappears on the eyelid, you need to use just a tiny bit of product to cover the whole lid, and it has no smell.</li>
      <li>If you use too much, it will crease.</li>
      <li>I will still try using it-maybe I&#x27;m applying too much.</li>
      <li>much longer it keeps eye-shadow on.</li>
      <li>and it does work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the Pore Perfection primer much.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t even need that much.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>The authentic one is silky and almost clear this one is white and like glue!</li>
      <li>The eyeshadow appears really strong and full pigmented on the primer, and it does last for long hours</li>
      <li>These tubes are super tiny!</li>
      <li>This is a high quality primer for face and eyes.  </li>
      <li>say they both do pretty much the same job.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
      <li>Well, it&#x27;s really not permanent eyeshadow, but it does last most of the day until I go to the gym for a workout.  </li>
      <li>While it might be worth the money in a bigger and local version,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not worth waiting five days for.</li>
      <li>Small amounts, yes, but their totally worth</li>
      <li>it reduces large pore visability and makes scars and wrinkles look a little smoother.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this combo for the face primer and gave my sister the lid primer and she loves it.Ive tried six other brands of primer and this is my fav so far. It works amazing on combination/oily skin. I don&#x27;t need to powder when I use it unless it&#x27;s really hot or been on for like 10 hours. it reduces large pore visability and makes scars and wrinkles look a little smoother. I would buy it more often but it&#x27;s usually pricey. These tubes are super tiny!</li>
    <li> I got this primer after reading so many good reviews on it. As a makeup artists I liked the idea of an eyeshadow primer that will keep the eye-makeup last longer. So I got it, and... At first I fell in love with the tube- it&#x27;s design is so cute and it&#x27;s really comfortable to use. I liked the texture- it&#x27;s really light and almost disappears on the eyelid, you need to use just a tiny bit of product to cover the whole lid, and it has no smell. The eyeshadow appears really strong and full pigmented on the primer, and it does last for long hours (I noticed my eyeshadow started creasing after about 9 hours).&lt;br /&gt;So the product does what it claimes to do, and that&#x27;s very good. I compared it to MAD Minerals primer and I gota say they both do pretty much the same job.&lt;br /&gt;At the bottom line- it is a good eye-shadow primer BUT- I don&#x27;t feel it does a better job than my concealer or makeup on the lids- like I used to do until I got to know this product, so I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s a really necessary buy.&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again? I&#x27;m not sure- only for the necessarity reason- but I wouldn&#x27;t mine getting it as a present :)</li>
    <li> First, I never received the primer so I cannot comment. The shadow insurance is not what I expected, but it is a really nice product.  I thought it would have some color to it, but it goes on transparent. It definitely prevents my shadow from creasing or fading.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love both the produts. Small amounts, yes, but their totally worth I an you don&#x27;t even need that much.</li>
    <li> This is the best primer I&#x27;ve used and I have tried many.  Eye shadow stays intact until you remove it, great quality and affordable.  Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Shadow Insurance is a must have for anyone interested in having all day wear with their eyeshadow! No clumps of eyeshadow in your crease in the middle of the day with this product. Primed and Poreless works well where you need it. This is a small container so I can&#x27;t use it all over my face like I&#x27;d like to, but it does help with some of those flaws.</li>
    <li> Great eyeshadow primer!</li>
    <li> The Primed and Poreless is just a sample size. I liked it while it lasted but haven&#x27;t repurchased it. I am still using this same shadow insurance 1 1/2 years later because it only takes a tiny bit. I use it everyday. If you use too much, it will crease. I also apply powder after to set it because it stays a little tacky which I don&#x27;t like. Some people do like that it stays tacky, not my preference. Botton line is it works. My shadow stays put all day without creasing when I use this.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  Item as described.</li>
    <li> I love this primer it goes on so smooth and the shadow insurance is the best, my shadow lasts almost all day! Fast delivery</li>
    <li> this stuff is overrated it works OK but I don&#x27;t see that big of a difference with my eyeshadow it&#x27;s also ridiculously overpriced if you buy this you&#x27;re wasting your time and money</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s really not permanent eyeshadow, but it does last most of the day until I go to the gym for a workout.  Otherwise, I think it&#x27;s a good product.  Not much wrinkling that I&#x27;ve noticed either.  A little goes a long way.  I would recommend it.  Wish there was something for my face makeup to last all day.  My face soaks up makeup!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I&#x27;m really pleased with&lt;br /&gt;how much longer it keeps eye-shadow on. This product has been&lt;br /&gt;recommended to me by so many people, and now I see why. So yes, it is true&lt;br /&gt;to its word and it does work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it&#x27;s not incredible, and I was a little surprised by how small it was. Yes, it does say .35oz \&lt;br /&gt;in the title, but still...$13 dollars? I think that&#x27;s a little much for such a small product. Plus,&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t something you can just use a little of - you really have to use a good amount, so the primer&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t really last long either...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I would buy a bigger version at Sephora. While it might be worth the money in a bigger and local version,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not worth waiting five days for. It&#x27;s just primer :).</li>
    <li> was the producuto I wanted and arrive on time</li>
    <li> like the squeezable container as opposed to the urban decay bottle, you can get it all out. pretty good job not creasing eye shadow.</li>
    <li> Not the product they sell in the store! completely different texture I have an authentic one and this isnt it! The authentic one is silky and almost clear this one is white and like glue!</li>
    <li> I recently had eyelid surgery and I&#x27;ve noticed that by the end of the day my eyeshadow collects in my (barely visible) scarline-it makes a dark line.  I had a sample of Shadow Insurance so I tried it and it seemed to work.  I ordered a supply and somehow it&#x27;s not working-the unsightly line of shadow is there.  I will still try using it-maybe I&#x27;m applying too much.</li>
    <li> I ordered my replacement off Amazon instead of the local story.  I love this product. It helps your eyeshadow stay in place all day long and makes your colors more vibrant.  If you are looking for an eyeshadow primer...this is your product!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t put on eye shadow without this. It has revolutionized the way I wear makeup. I haven&#x27;t used the Pore Perfection primer much. Shadow insurance is SO WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this primer from Too Faced before and I know what it&#x27;s supposed to be like. This is not the actual product so I would just buy the actual thing from Sephora.</li>
    <li> This face and eye primer is Smoothing and lasting.  This is a high quality primer for face and eyes.  I will definitely be buying again.</li>
