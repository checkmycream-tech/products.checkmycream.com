      <li>I was hoping it would be a thinner brush, but it&#x27;s still a decent brush for the price.</li>
      <li>Like the other customer that received the brush i did, i can easily go buy it at my local ulta.</li>
      <li>I was looking forever to find a concealer brush that was soft and didn&#x27;t hurt or make the process of concealing take forever.</li>
      <li>Bristles aren&#x27;t soft.</li>
      <li>Completely organic and doesn&#x27;t have the chemical smell.</li>

    <li> Excellent concealer brush! Ecotools brushes are the best!</li>
    <li> always soft and a comfortable hold.  I also purchased the ecotools makeup foundation brush, with this order.  I am loving both.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Bristles aren&#x27;t soft. Not sure what to even use it for.</li>
    <li> I also received the airbrush concealer brush instead of the one pictured. Like the other customer that received the brush i did, i can easily go buy it at my local ulta. They do not sell the one pictured by itself in any stores in my city, so I am very upset that is not the brush I received. I will never be ordering from this company EVER AGAIN. I would give 0 stars if it was possible.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and ready to use. It&#x27;s just what I expected! The brush is soft on skin and has really cute packaging :)</li>
    <li> Since it&#x27;s a concealer brush, thought it would be synthetic material--easier to use with a creamy concealer.</li>
    <li> I love the Ecotools brushes!!</li>
    <li> I received EcoTools &#x27;Airbrush Concealer Brush&#x27; instead of the brush that I ordered.

It was not worth the hassle to return &amp; pay the postage to return.</li>

    <li> I was looking forever to find a concealer brush that was soft and didn&#x27;t hurt or make the process of concealing take forever. Happy to say I found it! The brush is really soft and blends in the concealer great. Completely organic and doesn&#x27;t have the chemical smell. Comes with a reusable case as well.</li>
    <li> You will love the ease of working with this brush ! Like painting  - Love it!</li>
