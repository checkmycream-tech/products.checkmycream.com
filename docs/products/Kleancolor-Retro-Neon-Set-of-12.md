<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Came on time and all intact. The colors are rich and most of them are good for stamping, the blues and black especially. They don&#x27;t spread so well for water marbling but they do work if you drop in some other kind of polish. Great buy for the price, I picked up the metallics and I&#x27;m waiting for those be delivered and can&#x27;t wait for the pastels too! Only wish the warmer colors, orange, yellow and red, were as good for stamping as the other colors.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bold and bright colors. I love them!! Great polishes for a great price. The only downside is that they have a strong smell.</li>
    <li> They look amazing, totaly love them, delivery was right on time 😊😊😊😊</li>
    <li> not very high quality, guess the grandkids are not worth any more than that though... or so I am going to tell them</li>
    <li> The color&#x27;s are the same as in the picture well mostly I don&#x27;t think I had 2 green colors  but other then that it&#x27;s the same. The picture does not do the color justice.  I was super excited when I got these in the mail packaged in 3s only one color was open didn&#x27;t make that big of a mess I was happy over all. I could hardly stand it. But I love the Kleancolor nail laquer. They dry quickly. I painted from pinky to thumb then went back to the pinky and it was dry. I love the color&#x27;s. I REALLY love the orange color its bright and amazing (curently wearing) It does take at least 2 coats to make the color more viberant and not patchy if that makes since.</li>
    <li> very happy with this purchase. lots of colors to use. goes on nice and smooth. good brand to polish with!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. Such pretty colors and they look great on. Very happy with product and would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love the polish great for stamping on white, was packed tight and secure and arrived on time</li>
    <li> This is a nice buy the smell is a little different than other nail polish I have.  The smell of these can be a bit overwhelming</li>
    <li> Some of the colors are so nice that it makes it even more sad that they are of such horrible quality.  I didn&#x27;t have problems with them staining my nails like some people have.  For me, they chip almost instantly.  Literally within minutes of drying, even if I am not doing anything.  Usually if a polish chips easily on my nails I&#x27;ll just use it for my toes.  These chip off of my toes just as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My methods... So, if you put 2 coats on it&#x27;s too thin and totally see through and streaky (except for the metallics) and then it instantly starts to &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; off once dry.  If you apply the 3-5 coats that you need to make it look decent it chips immediately.  I&#x27;ve tried them with expensive base and tops coats and dry fast coats and nothing matters.  They are a tremendous waste of time, effort and money.  I ignored the bad reviews, thinking maybe people were expecting too much.  I&#x27;ll tell you, that they weren&#x27;t and you can make your own choice.  I&#x27;d say any drugstore brand (the .99 one, hint hint) are a major step up from these.</li>
    <li> Received in good condition</li>
    <li> For the longest time I have thought I should buy one of these cute, cheap, highly rated sets from kleancolor.  But I had never used a kleancolor before so it was pretty unwise.  They smell like glue, they apply like glue, and they dry slowly and tacky like glue.  On top of that the set arrived with a dupe and the colors were a lot less wearable than other neon sets I have had.  So I was pretty disappointed.  I don&#x27;t feel that it is a bad product especially for the price.  It is sort of my fault that I bought 12 polishes of a brand I had never used before.  It is just that I ended up not using them and giving them away.  Beauty products aren&#x27;t the most reliable thing to purchase online.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this 5 stars only because I have not actually tried it (bought as a Christmas present for my little sister!). The product came very quickly, and the colors look awesome!</li>
    <li> Stains nails when removed and needs several coats to cover.</li>
    <li> this polish is definitely nice. there&#x27;s not much of a difference between the two blue polishes. originally purchased with hopes of using them for water marbled nails, but the Polish is entirely too thick. and it smells kind of like bananas</li>
    <li> Love these colors and they came in perfect condition. Colors were as shown and the polish stays o pretty well. My 13 yr old daughter loves to paint nails and she loves this polish!</li>
    <li> these are great. the colors are vibrant and fun. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is i noticed that once i open them, the polish seems to thicken up a bit so i&#x27;ll have to get some nail polish thinner and i&#x27;m ok with that. all in all i&#x27;m happy with them. a note, use a white as a base coat for a more vibrant color.</li>
    <li> Fun for a preteen girl gift</li>
    <li> Nice, but a little old/think</li>
    <li> Love them! great colors, great price and came quickly!</li>
    <li> Ordered several for grand-daughter&#x27;s.  The colors are great.  I personally ordered the pastel sets as they&#x27;re still young.  They were delighted and the polish works great.  Price is right also!</li>
    <li> The colors are great, but they chip very fast (almost 15 min after applied).  The smell is very glue like.</li>
    <li> 1. The colors are very unique! Lovely!&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells not so strong..! Little sweet!?!?&lt;br /&gt;3. Colors are very vibrant! It comes out nicely&lt;br /&gt;4. Price is very reasonable!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this set!!&lt;br /&gt;Go RETRO!!</li>
    <li> Great way to get your collection going. The color variety is really fun.</li>
    <li> Ugly colors, for kids and wild people not people who want elegant nails.</li>
    <li> Wonderful selection of colors - well worth the investment</li>
    <li> I bought these as a stamping polish and they all work very well. But some show up better than others.  The photo also shows konad black which is definitely darker, but the klearcolor black is still great for the price. I stamped these on a white label sticker (next to their names) and on a transparency sheet over a black background. They all seem to show up best over white, but depends on the look you&#x27;re going for. The picture makes them look brighter over black than they do in real life.&lt;br /&gt;I also added a picture of neon sapphire on my natural nail.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to do nails, and this was a great buy! Came in time for her to receive as a Christmas present, and she was thrilled!!</li>
    <li> One of the bottles came opened and dried on all of the rest; quite a mess.</li>
    <li> Not the best polish, but cute and got here fast.</li>
    <li> Great colors! Good consistency and texture! Reasonably priced. Bought all of their sets and have plenty of choices from lacquer to glitter to metallic. Very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of time love the colors!!</li>
    <li> amazing, fun, vivid ,bright, long wearing polish. Id buy again!</li>
    <li> Got this set to jumpstart my polish collection after I threw out all my old stuff. Really like the colors; quality wise, not bad...not too runny and not too thick. However, only lasted about a week on my toes, noticed they&#x27;re chipping off already after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, not bad. Seller took great care in wrapping them nicely for shipping with lots of protected paddings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would buy again.</li>
    <li> These came earlier than expected and have great coverage. Look forward to ordering more from kleancolor.</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of colors</li>
    <li> I love them the colors are so vivid and gorgeous i just love it the price was amazing and it met all my expectations</li>
    <li> Just painted my daughters nails! She loves them! Very pretty colors! Great price!</li>
    <li> LOVE the color, but the paint takes pretty long to dry and within a day of wearing the nail polish, the majority of the tips are completely chipped off, even when you don&#x27;t really do much that day. For example, I painted my nails the morning of my graduation party and that night the paint was already chipped. Although this gets really annoying, you constantly get compliments on the color and it really does look very nice when done frequently!</li>
    <li> These are fun for the summer!</li>
    <li> So i just got my retro neon color set and omg the colors are amazing ...i am very happy with how they came packaged and how they came in the mail so fast with in 4 days ...i am so in love with these colors</li>
    <li> Great fashion colors for beautiful nails.</li>
    <li> Love love love this set.  Pretty colors and lots of variety.  Decent bottle and size also.</li>
    <li> Very nice item&lt;br /&gt;thank u very mucht</li>
    <li> I got this nail polish and it works pretty good! They only thing is, is that some are hard to open so you have to soak it in nail polish remover!! But that&#x27;s okay, overall works great!!!</li>
    <li> what I wanted love all the colors beats going to the nail salon every week when I can do it myself</li>
    <li> I used one color on my toes and a different one on my nails. Within 3 hours both were chipping or smudging. As one review stated....takes a long time to dry? Well if it takes more than 30 minutes...there&#x27;s a problem with that. The colors are vibrant and I got what I was expecting even though it took 11 days for shipping. Seriously disappointed.</li>
    <li> Some of the polishes were missing the brushes. This was a Christmas gift, and I wish I would have checked this when they first came. The colors are pretty, and the shipping was fast just remember to check the products!</li>
    <li> It is not good. It only can stick on your nail for a day or less and then it will crack.</li>
    <li> beautiful colors, fast drying.</li>
    <li> Colors are cute but useless because they chip within the day. Extremely poor quality, you&#x27;re much better off getting one nice polish at the store!</li>
    <li> Took a risk and bought these..can&#x27;t beat the price for a ton of polish in awesome colors. They do chip...big time...for me the next day. And the smell is like normal nail polish smell when you first put it on...but the smell doesn&#x27;t go away. My hands smelled all evening long like nail polish, beyond drying time, and after washing my hands repeatedly. Not sure what that&#x27;s all about. Anyway, guess it was too good to be true!</li>
    <li> colors arr great, polish is nice.</li>
    <li> Polishes are nice but chip very easy...after i do my nails the very next day the polish has chiped in places and i have to redo my nails...</li>
    <li> Great nail polishes. I though they were gonna be cheap and clumpy but they have great quality for a low price.</li>
    <li> Love the colors; works well in daughter&#x27;s nail salon!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my girlfriend, They wore off in a day or so. Also two bottles broke on their way here. The manufacturer did refund the price of the broken bottles although new bottles shipped to me would have been better. I would not recommend these to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love that these are cheap, I hate going and getting one bottle for 5 or 10 bucks. I can have fun with these and try different ombre effects and I do not care if I have to remove it. I think I will buy nail polish online again and again....my husband does hate having to smell it though!! lol..I try and do it when he is not home!..</li>
    <li> Love these, none of them were broken when they arrived. Great assortment of colors.</li>
    <li> I liked these so much more than I expected to!</li>
    <li> more than one coat it needed, a great way for these to get dry fast is to go outside in a windy day and paint them then</li>
    <li> some of the bottles had leaked in the package,but otherwise everything just fine!  fast delivery For my granddaughter to paint</li>
    <li> The colors are okay. &amp;#34;Neon Sapphire&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really a neon sapphire. It&#x27;s so dark it&#x27;s almost black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And #20 Neon Pink leaked all over the place and when I opened it up, there was no brush! What am I supposed to do with that?  What a mess!</li>
    <li> Okay the nail polish itself is great. The colors are bright, the coverage is good and the size of the bottle is reasonable too. However, the reason I am leaving two stars is because I received six of the same color...not as expected or pictured. I would have much rather received other colors than I would have six Greens. I am disappointed in that aspect as I feel like a better description or more careful stock selection should have been acted upon.</li>
    <li> Nice fun bright colors!!</li>
    <li> I love all of these colors! They&#x27;re long lasting, bright, and on my nails they are the same shade as they look in the bottle. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> bought for xmas present for daughter and she loves the stuff. She will get together with niece and friends and everyone will have fun</li>
    <li> There were used for teacher appreciation gifts.  Everyone seemed to like the colors.</li>
    <li> The colors look amazing. This was bought as a gift. It would have been better if they came in a box, but for the price it was great!</li>
    <li> Love them really nice colors dries fast and looks really pretty :) I&#x27;m happy I bought them was worh it :) I think those are my new favorite nail polishes thank you :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t water marble and the quality is cheap. They stain your nails badly even with base coat. I regret buying this brand.</li>
    <li> So fun! Beautiful bold colors that last! The only drawback is that the two light blue&#x27;s are very close to the same color.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift.  Loved the first set so much, ordered another! Not only did I love the gift, the 2 people receiving loved also.</li>
    <li> Colors r good but I just couldn&#x27;t open 2of them!!!</li>
    <li> Birthday present for my cousin............she loved the colors!</li>
    <li> Love the colors .Fast shipping thank you.</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and vibrant just like in the bottle. Its the color it goes onto your nails. You only need two coats maximum. They do take a little bit longer to dry but overall beautiful. My daughter is into nails and found putting a base coat on first then the color and last a top coat saves your nails keeps from chipping and looks radiant , bright and brilliant. Love the bright colors for summer. My daughter who is very particular about her polish even loves this brand. Delivered on time no delivery issues, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was worried about how well these would work because they seem to be priced lower than most. They were exactly what I was looking for. I loved all the colors. They are full sized bottles, paint smoothly and dry in a timely matter. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The colors r very cute, but when u actually put it on ur nails it looks horrible.. like other nail polishes when put them on ur nails they usually have a little flidads n some times they look shine with out puting a top coat, wel not this nail polish, the polish it self is horrible, its watery and its very hard to dry when applyed to nails its looks chalkey and ugly....its very sad since the nail polish bottle does look nice but unfortunately it dosent....HORRIBLE NAIL POLISH</li>
    <li> I LOVE this!! The shipping was great too, no broken or opened bottles! It also came four days before expected, which was PERFECT because my friend came over that day!! The colors are great, very eye-popping and a large variety. It also lasts pretty long, VERY long with top and base coat. Yet, it comes off when you want it! It is also AWESOME for nail art designs!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 9 year old daughter and she loved them.  The colors are great and the polish dries pretty quickly.  I even use them every once in a while!!</li>
    <li> Impressed with how with the darker colors you can get away with one coat.</li>
    <li> Some colors didnt work well with water marble nail designing mostly just the shimmer ones like the lighter green&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried them just painting with them though...so i can&#x27;t review on that part. But the price, quality is perfect for water marble (;</li>
    <li> I was so excited to buy this set in order to do nail art for my Halloween Party this year. I was practicing on myself and my mom and we were both disappointed when our valentine&#x27;s day design started chipping within hours of painting our nails. Do not waste your money on this low quality crap.</li>
    <li> I thought they would come packaged as a set.  Just loose bottles wrapped in paper. nice variety but not what I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Received promptly, very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I was wary ordering this item, but my fears were unfounded. The colors are bright, and the coverage of this brand is great. I have used them to stock the shelf at the upscale salon where I work. Not one complaint so far.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly bold good quality colors!!</li>
    <li> Chips instantly. Like, within 15 minutes of putting it on I had multiple chips. Day two looked a week old.</li>
    <li> Took a long time for delivery and when it came three bottles were broken what a mess. My daughter was hart broken. I trashed it all and took her to W.MRT to make her happy.</li>
    <li> The colors are awesome! The only real issue that I had was that one of the bottles leaked during shipping so that bottle isn&#x27;t as full, but other than that, it was shipped &amp; arrived on time &amp; like I said, the colors are very cool!</li>
    <li> I ordered these and two other different sets. None of them were the color they were supposed to be. The nail polish is to thick also.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast &amp; it came right on time!!!! Products are in great shape for a great price!!!</li>
    <li> I am very please with all the polishes. They do smell a little bad but other than that the colors turn out nice. I am not a picky person so for me they met all my requirement. I do recommend buying. They are a great addition to my color collection.</li>
    <li> when you open your box, you will be excited because of this wonderful colours... but after applying them on your nails , you will be disappointed... colours are nice, but quality the worst...</li>
    <li> My young daughter totally flipped about the vibrant colors!!!!!!!  These are a great gift for young girls just starting out with being girly!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love them! Go on easily and dont even need extra coats!. True to color, i love being able to change the color all the time! I also got the holo colors for a top sparkle! They arrived on time all wrapped in bubble wrap so none would break.</li>
    <li> Since trying Kleancolor I haven purchased any other polish. Dont let the price fool you, thhey are amazing! High shine,  gorgeous colors, long lasting!!</li>
    <li> Excelente el articulo me llego en buen estado y funciona a la perfección!</li>
    <li> Gave them to my grandniece for Christmas.  She loved them and her nails have been every color since she received her gift.  If you like color or want something to do with your child, buy this set.  Great fun.</li>
    <li> wonder purchase,  colors are amazing! wish i knew about this line prior to spend a small fortune at the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Not great quality. Because it goes away a FEW HOURS after you apply it :O !!!!&lt;br /&gt;But I really really looooved the color of the rose one, so I bought a strong base and a seche vite to protect it. Like that It works better, and stay for maybe 3 or 4 days depending on what you do with your nails...</li>
    <li> My go too summer nail polish</li>
    <li> Great Polishes!!! Some aren&#x27;t as opaque as I&#x27;d like, but with a white base those are fine (only like two of them)&lt;br /&gt;They do smell, but I have a few other brands such as Orly or Sally Hansen that are on par with smell, and after washing your hands the smell is gone.&lt;br /&gt;The dry time is long, but if you use a quick dry top coat it won&#x27;t really effect you.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of colors but it&#x27;s cheap. After you open it, it becomes more and more goopy. Not very good as an overall color but it works great for nail art.</li>
    <li> Weary to buy a 12 pack of nail polish online cuz I was afraid it would be &amp;#34;child style&amp;#34; dull, leaky, watery, many coats polish, but this one is really good. All the colors are as they appear and it seems to be good polish.</li>
    <li> Love these colors especially the pink and orange.  Fushia is more orange than pink.  Aqua is cool.  Navy is not NEON but a deep true navy which is hard to find.  Haven&#x27;t used the greens.</li>
    <li> colors are great. quality is what i expected for the price.</li>
    <li> - Love the colors&lt;br /&gt;- Haven&#x27;t used these as yet...but have used this brand before&lt;br /&gt;- Good coverage with one coat...&amp; long lasting</li>
    <li> Nice bright colors for the price.  it comes with all 12 colors.  Im loving the Barbie Pink its super bright and a nice shade.&lt;br /&gt;Colors:&lt;br /&gt;1. Neon Purple&lt;br /&gt;2. Neon Yellow&lt;br /&gt;3. Neon Green&lt;br /&gt;4. Neon Sapphire&lt;br /&gt;5. Neon Aqua&lt;br /&gt;6. Neon Orange&lt;br /&gt;7. Neon Fuchsia&lt;br /&gt;8. Barbie Pink&lt;br /&gt;9. Funky Yellow&lt;br /&gt;10. Melon Green&lt;br /&gt;11. Beach Blue&lt;br /&gt;12. Black</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish it&#x27;s not the small bottles that I was afraid it would be.  It has beautiful and vibrant colors and shows up really great.  I would absolutely recommend this to others.  My daughter loves it also.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. They work well as stamping polishes but too thick for watermarbleing. Shipped quickly and packaged very well. A little streaky on application and dries quickly,</li>
    <li> I received my Retro Neons and set of 6 Holos today. Kleancolor is a great product if you do a lot of nails and nail art. The colors are bright and with the selection they offer you can mix and match to make it brighter and bold. The only disappointment is they do not water marble and that is a shame because they would make beautiful designs and the colors would be amazing. Someone at the Kleancolors Headquaters need to develop a thinner formula and call it a designer series for marbling. I&#x27;m giving a 4 star rating because of what I got for the price and colors to choose from. As far as Marbling goes I will do a no water needed marble and make it work. Thank you to the seller for no problems and once again to Amazon for making it happen. Whenever I see the UPS truck I have a smile on my face?  Did you Amazon today?  Try it!  I love getting my own gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a bachelorette party for gift bags and they are great! Support bright and fun colors. Stays on about 2 days, then very slight chipping, but i do a lot of dishes! :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic! I was very pleased with the colors and the time it took to ship. This set gives you great colors and they don&#x27;t take long to dry. Very nice brand. Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my daughter and she love it, The only complaint she had was that one of the bottle was open and spill out.&lt;br /&gt;All the colors was correct just like they said. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my niece for Christmas. She is into doing nail design and she wanted new poilsh to go with other things I ordered. The colors are really nice, bright. The only thing is the paint cheeps away very quickly. Also I noticed when I got the package in the mail it had a smell. One of the poilsh wasn&#x27;t close tight all the way. But other then that she seems to like them!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this polish. It stays on for a long time without chipping.</li>
    <li> I love these colors, the price for them is great as well. I highly recommend using a white base before applying otherwise the colors don&#x27;t pop! I like them!</li>
    <li> Turns nails yellow when removed</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very happy  because after that i buyed i read the review and i was so scared but i can&#x27;t do anything only  wait for my orders , and i like all the colors i love the variety  i&#x27;m very happy  great colors , great price  i love it</li>
    <li> Came in two days. All in tact. Great colors. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> So quick and easy! Thank you!</li>
    <li> will this polish takes a long time to dry and for me a busy mom i don&#x27;t have time to wait but don&#x27;t worry money is not wasted the darker pigment colors are great for stamping because it takes so long to dry u don&#x27;t have to rush to stamp as well as it shows better then my normal blacks and whites</li>
    <li> Birthday gift she loves it</li>
    <li> I love this product though I am not sure how black is a neon color.  I have received several compliments on the colors and have referred several several to the sight to purchase them.</li>
    <li> Had to throw away since my nails started to split apart.</li>
    <li> Its not even good for nail art. There is a reason the O.P.I and sally hansen nailpaints are pricey and it serves them right. They are long lasting and look expensive unlike kleancolor or i should say no color since color fades after few hours of applying. It is a cheap quality and so embarassing when all of a sudden you look at your nails and the paint has poofed. Ladies, please don&#x27;t buy it. Indulge in an expensive brand. It ll give you long term and better results.</li>
    <li> Chips way easily. Nice colors but unfortunately it&#x27;ll last about a day till you gotta take it off and redo it.</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice. You might need 2 or 3 coats, but if you use a clear base in conjunction with a white one(not included), and put the neon on top, they pop really well, and might need just one coat. The clear base (not included) keeps your fingernails from turning yellow because of the harsh chemicals used. I guess they smell okay. My S &amp; H was good, it was individual wrapped in paper with bubble wrap and packaging on top. They came 3 days early too. They&#x27;re pretty good. Good gift too.</li>
    <li> I have to confess that after trying Kleancolor I have a bit of an addiction to them.... I was used to using essie and opi... opi&#x27;s chip like the next day... essie last a little bit longer but are a bit expensive... I found this 12 count set... and I thought I was getting the mini ones.. and to my surprise I got regular ones.... The colors are so bright and beautiful!!! I have no complaint whatsoever!!! Everyone who comes over to my house has to paint their nails with them... Bottom line... Buy them.... sooo worth it... and I have ordered a bunch more... GO FOR IT!!!</li>
    <li> Nice selection of colors ...good price.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with how bright and vibrant the colors are, and really love how quickly it dries. However, I am not impressed with how soon it chips off :( Literally within a day it starts to chip off.</li>
    <li> Really love these polishes! Beautiful colors to choose from, and very bright as well. Covers in two coats and lasts for days!</li>
    <li> The polish is pretty, but it does not last long.</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and vibrant! I recommend using a clear top coat for longer wear though.</li>
    <li> Great quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be worth it, but I thought the price was worth the risk. It turns out these nail polishes stay on very well! As a bonus, I brought out the black light for another purpose and discovered most of these colors glow neon under a black light! How fun is that?</li>
    <li> cant get enough of these</li>
    <li> I really like most of the colors, but the polish scratches off sometimes as early as the same day I put it on. Nice for 1-2 day wear, but probably better off spending the money for higher quality polish.</li>
    <li> Could not believe how nice this nail polish is.  I expected for the price to have to at least put two coats on.  I was amazed when a beautiful first coat was all I need to cover my nails.  My granddaughter and I shared these.  Both of us were very happy with the colors.  Seem even brighter than the picture shows.</li>
    <li> I got my polishes to today they were all different colors none the same, they were packaged right none broke I love the variety of colors great price I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> my granddaughter is 12 and has her own nail salon, these colors are working well for her. long lasting, and in high demand by her friends and family. reasonalble price, prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> I got this set for my niece for Christmas, its OK, but couple of the bottles were leaking. I was cleaning the nail polish off of one that I closed all the way and it leaked a little. I think the polish may be a little too runny, but I don&#x27;t mind- my niece loves putting polish on &amp; that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Had 2 colors that are the exact same and the polish chips VERY easily, compared to other nail polish I have,</li>
    <li> The color selection is great and the consistency of the nail polish works well, too. For that amount of money it was a great deal for sure!!!</li>
    <li> I received this order in great condition.  It was odd that they came in a bubble envelope and not a box, BUT they were all wrapped individually and were not damaged in any way!  The colors go on smoothly and I was impressed with how fast they try.  i would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love these colors. This brand of nail polish do not strike when painting nails. I will be buying this product again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Omg, need I say more about this set? Well I was so happy, that this was my second set I purchased from them!</li>
    <li> These Kleancolor polishes have such a beautiful range of colors, enabling anyone to find at least ONE that they like. Some have a mild frosted finish giving the polish a beautiful lustre. These polishes however don&#x27;t last as long as the pastel formula does but they are great for summer none the less! A definite recommendation!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for our 13 year old niece who LOVES any nailpolish, she was excited to have all the colors and got started right away with painting her nails after opening.  She said that the polish went on smooth.  Great price also for how many you get.</li>
    <li> I love how bright these colors are! However some of the colors were a bit gooey...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12yr old niece and she loves the colors. I don&#x27;t know how long they last cause she&#x27;s always changing them; girls will be girls. But she&#x27;s very happy with this set.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is horrible it  starts coming off like an hour after you put it on never again</li>
    <li> I have only tried three colors but they are great. They even smell pretty good. They only needed one coat and as long as you are using a good tip coat they don&#x27;t chip at all.</li>
    <li> The set arrived pretty quickly. There were two polishes that came a little &amp;#34;leaky,&amp;#34; but after I wiped the nail polish off, it was a-okay!</li>
    <li> Excellent nail polish that applies easily, lasts well, and has a low fume factor.</li>
    <li> really nice colours good product</li>
    <li> chips easy but just put a clear coat on it!</li>
    <li> The colors are great.  But like someone else mentioned, it take FOREVER to dry!  Great starter kit for my daughter who paints her nails like every other day.  It would be great for nail art as well.  The bottles arrived nicely packed so there was no broken bottles.</li>
    <li> Great value for great nail polishes</li>
    <li> Pretty colors and perfect for the summer. I bought these for the grand daughters and they really think the colors rock. The consistency is not too thick nor too thin. This is great for children and teens.</li>
    <li> Love these NEAT polishes.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have bought these for my sister because of the price.. Great colors.. Though four of the polishes weren&#x27;t good at all. Wished they didn&#x27;t chip so much, but what can your really expect? Anyways it wasn&#x27;t such a big deal. Packaging was good nothing was broken and shipment came in a good timing.</li>
    <li> This is being posted by Ryan&#x27;s wife, Samantha:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to receive my polishes, the colors are vibrant, no repeats in the order, and the coverage is full, with just one coat. Just a few days after completing my manicure, my polish started chipping &amp; peeling as if the manicure had been done with children&#x27;s \\&quot;peel off\\&quot; polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, I&#x27;m quite disappointed in the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on, I&#x27;ll stick with my dollar store polish that FAR outlasts the Kleancolor.</li>
    <li> I just received the package yesterday and fell in love with the colors.  Will definitely purchase more in the future!!!</li>
    <li> This product arrived exactly as described. Great value for the money! The assortment of colors is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Could not give a better rating as I was unable to use product, it broke when shipped.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as a gift and was a bit concerned it would turn out to be disappointing.  I was totally wrong.  These are exactly as described and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again. I think the young recipient is going to love this part of her gift.</li>
    <li> to many colors close to the same</li>
    <li> I love these beautiful summer colors for my nails and I brought...Hollywood Nail kit and Salon Express Nail Kit for a touch of fun design for my nails with a coat of color...a must buy for kleancolor!!!</li>
    <li> Oh! My!  I love this polish!  Go on so smoothly, dries fast, stays on until you take it off.  No chipping, no rub off edges.  Keeps the lustrous shine until the day you remove.  I get compliments on my nails every day.  Everyone asks I love that color where did you get that color?  I always respond amazon.  I should be getting a promo fee for advertising.</li>
    <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
    <li> They are in tiny bottles almost like a trial size.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The colors are so fun and bright! A few of them you need two coats of polish but some you don&#x27;t. Shipping was right on time. I&#x27;d definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is the best polish.My favorite polish by far. Beautiful colors. Goes on so good,covers in one coat,but two is awesome.Bottles are full size.</li>
    <li> I like the kleancolor brand for its value.  The polishes are generally well-pigmented and some can even be used as stamping polishes!  The two blue colors in this collection in particular make great stamping polishes.  I also really like the shimmery neon yellow-green over other greens.  I will note that kleancolor as a brand generally doesn&#x27;t do well for water marbling, but some polish thinner might fix that.  I&#x27;ll have to experiment.</li>
    <li> Teenager I bought this for was very happy, started doing her nails right after she opened the nail polish, great gif for someone who has everything.</li>
    <li> I love the colors of the nail polish. The only problem was I was only shipped 10 not 12. I did not get one of the yellows or black. Other than that I like them.!!!</li>
    <li> My mom bought these and the look good on me they last awhile. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes neon nail polish.</li>
    <li> great fun for the teen agers</li>
    <li> They were used i wanted new ones</li>
    <li> I like the colors.  I have not used it yet.  I will be giving it as a christmasgift...</li>
    <li> These are GREAT for nail art! The colors are gorgeous and bright! Came in super fast, with no spills, cracks or a drop of polish out of place. Kleancolor has been a favorite of mine for over a year now.</li>
    <li> I really like the colors they work great and they look great!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful bright colors. Polish not runny and does not chip easily.</li>
    <li> Daughter is happy with this item.</li>
    <li> I know a person that loved the polish when she first started using it! After 2 months, her nails are all brittle and chipping off! Not Happy at all :(</li>
    <li> Love kleancolor nail polish works awesome for stamping 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> As pictured.  Can not say about longevity yet.</li>
    <li> They are pretty. But did not stay on my nails.</li>
    <li> I just received my polish and at first was a little disappointed because it appeared i received two blacks and two neon aquas. after reading the labels though I realized I was mistaken and they just look very similar in the bottles. I am currently painting my nails and so far (with only one coat) it looks pretty opaque but will probably do a second coat just for the richness. if you&#x27;re looking for a very shiny polish, this isn&#x27;t it. its very matte which isn&#x27;t such a big deal since you can use a shiny top coat. But if you&#x27;re looking for something you can do one coat of and no top coat and expect it to have a high shine, this isn&#x27;t the product you want. However, I do love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell really bad like most polishes. To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all. I will do an update in a few days to see how durable the polish is and how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 2-3 weeks since I ordered these. Honestly, I&#x27;m not so thrilled. They&#x27;re really goopy and hard to get smooth. Plus, they chip pretty easily. An they don&#x27;t &#x27;chip&#x27; per se, they peel. So you can&#x27;t just touch up the end and be done with it, you have to completely redo your nail. And when it does peel, I&#x27;ve noticed my nails feel kind of brittle like I had just popped off an acrylic nail. Probably wouldn&#x27;t get them again, even with the great price.</li>
    <li> Colors are nice but cracked shortly after applying. I can use only on my toenails but chipped and flaked off my fingernails almost completely by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> My set came without a black (as pictured) and one of the yellows. Instead I received a neon lime and neon amethyst. This is an issue for me because the BLACK was going to be the base for my nail art with this set. I knew immediately that some bottles were opened as soon as I opened the package based on the smell. Two bottles had leaked from loose caps, a small mess to clean up. IF it had come with the black as shown, I would have been very satisfied despite the opened bottles. I don&#x27;t like false advertisement. I still have an expense of buying a black polish.</li>
    <li> I have bought a few things from Amaxon, and this so far has been my favorite.  I love how bright the colors are.  This was a great deal, and I am beyond happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I am not a nail professional, but rather a Mom to two girls who are crazy over all the nail art people on Instagram and YouTube :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were looking for some bright colors to do nail art with, but I knew that I did not want to spend $8+ a bottle on the nicer brands like OPI, Essie, China Glaze, etc. Many of the cheap polishes in the stores look bright, but when you apply them, it takes about 10 coats for them to look even half way decent. The reviews on these polishes seem to be mixed, but they weren&#x27;t bad, and for the price, I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recieved these a few days ago, and the girls instantly wanted to try them with the water marble technique because the colors are so bright and seem like they would work well. We found out that these are really thick, and so they did not work well with the water marble. But, because they are so thick, I instantly knew that they would be great for nail art and for stamping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we tested them out with a simple nail art design (picture below) and they were great! I didn&#x27;t find that they took any longer to dry than any other polish that is out there, and with two coats (which is what you have to do most of the time anyway), the colors were super vibrant and amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t found problems with chipping either like a lot of the reviews. We use Sally Hanson UV Top Coat and our nails have held up great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give these 4 stars and not 5 because the polish is really thick, and so it is a little challenging to do some finer detail work, and the brush inside each bottle is not my favorite. Would I buy these again, absolutely! Are these my go to brand, probably not. But, for the price, colors and the purpose, they are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**In my picture, we used the black, navy blue and regular yellow from this set. The white and silver are not this brand. **</li>
    <li> what a fantastic set of nail polish.  The colors were awesome and the price was unbeatable compared to stores or other online sources</li>
    <li> exactly like u see in the picture, great color, so amazing and looks beauty on ur nails! dry very fast</li>
    <li> Bottles were well packaged and arrived very quickly and in good condition. One of the colors (the brightest yellow) had no brush on the end. Not really a big deal so I did not contact the company for a replacement. With the brush, I would have definitely given 5 stars. The colors are very vivid, my daughter loved this gift!</li>
    <li> I ordered this nail polish set for my daughter for Christmas!  It was exactly what she wanted and the color selection was perfect.  She has tried many of them already and was quite happy with the quality of the polish.  Even the more funkier colors are fun to try on.  It arrived undamaged and was well packaged.  We were very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter was truly satisfied with all the different colors!! We were very please with what we how pretty the colors were.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this stuff. Speedy shipping too.</li>
    <li> so i just recieved my collection today and when i opend the box the nail polish was clean brand new and not ruined in any way. im so excited!!! i put one stroke of the pink nail polish on and just fell in love! &lt;3 :D i am one happy camper</li>
    <li> Wonderful colors. Granddaughter  now does everyone&#x27;s nails in the family in rainbow colors.</li>
    <li> ok, this is definately not nail salon quality nail polish. I bought for my daughter and we do cute designs so I liked the variety of colors.  You really need 2 coats and a top coat or else it will peel within a day.  The blues are basically identical...but overall its worth the $</li>
    <li> This polish is a GREAT bargain...exactly what I ordered, just as they appear in the pic!! The colors are beautiful and no knock off...its the real brand as described (Kleancolor) &amp; all the bottles were full, not damaged. I ordered this 4 days ago &amp; I already got it. I actually bought 4 color sets (42 polishes total) with different colors &amp; I&#x27;ve gotten 3 sets already. I can&#x27;t wait to use them all!!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive fun.  Decent quality.</li>
    <li> This polishes are just amazingly gorgeous, When I am going to do my nails, I really have a hard time deciding which color I am going to wear, they are all so nice. I got all the colors from the picture and I had no problem with shipping, nor broken bottles, nothing, and actually they shipped the polishes all rapped up in like plastic so that they wont break. I am very happy with these polishes.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I love this product, I love the colors,They arrived nicely wrapped, and great price and free shipping, and one of the color was out of stock and they included another neon color, and in my next order the seller its going to include the missing color at not cost, and this is very nice, and this package does not take to long to arrive to my home, this polish nail are perfect for my nail art designs.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love all the colors.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that by day 2 they were already chipping.</li>
    <li> These colors a beautiful and colorful! I got them for stamping and they work great on white!! Black they aren&#x27;t quite bright enough to show up buy I love the colors on lighter colors and they go on great! You do have to move quickly if u are stamping because they do dry pretty quick! I would definitely recommend these to friends!!</li>
    <li> Great Color and Dries Fast.</li>
    <li> Great price and fabulous colors!!</li>
    <li> My order arrived in record time and the nail polish is amazing. My nails look like they were done professionally.  For the price and quality...total no brainer. Definitely reccomend.</li>
    <li> Amazing colors and decent quality</li>
    <li> This polish is a better quality than what I expected for the price. We received 12 different colors (no duplicates). They were packaged securely and nothing was damaged upon receipt. My teenage daughter uses them regularly and loves them. Great deal, awesome bright colors that look the same on your nail as they do in the bottle. A true PLUS!! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> love them colors are wonderful</li>
    <li> These colors are really great and vibrant. The black is SO black and slightly shiny. Not dull at all. I don&#x27;t know much about nail polishes but these are thick enough that you don&#x27;t need a million coats. I definetely recommend</li>
    <li> Nice colors however it takes more than 2 coats.</li>
    <li> Ive made my purchase on Feb.21st and it came today on Feb.25th, earlier than I expected Lol was such a pleasant surprise :), the colors look great and they don&#x27;t need more than two coats to look great! although, the price did go up a but after I purchased this product, because i paid $12.29 for this. I would definitely be purchasing again it is totally worth it, and this brand is very nice. I&#x27;m use to using OPI and China Glaze, but I was looking for something for a lower price and found these :). I rate it 5 stars ♥️♥️</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, nice big bottles, I&#x27;m totally satisfied and would recommend Kleancolor to anyone.  The Retro colors are the bomb!</li>
    <li> Got this for the wife.  She loves it.  Lots of colors, it was a great way to fill out her collection.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Exact listed colors. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I was about to buy this, when i looked for more and found these:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A11RCGI/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o08_s00_i00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these ^^^^ and they are amazing. I honestly recommend these ^^^^ because, the ones on this page only have 12 for 16.00.  The one in the link has 32 nail polishes for only 4.00 dollars more. CHEAPER AND MORE NAILPOLISHES!!</li>
    <li> My daughtger was looking for nail polish for Christmas. Bought these and the colors are rich and vibrant. I know she&#x27;ll love htem.</li>
    <li> I received these colors a couple days before scheduled. I was very happy with them. the only reason I gave them 4 stars is because a couple of the brighter colors are a little thin and translucent, but that can be solved by applying a layer of white polish underneath to make them pop.</li>
    <li> Amazing colors! Sturdy bottles of polish too</li>
    <li> The colors are great, the coverage is amazing. It only takes 1 coat for most of the colors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not bad not good</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for 19 years old Bday. She said she really love the polish &amp; the vibrant colors.</li>
    <li> Love it but I may have to reorder. Having 6 girls around I can&#x27;t hide my order. They like Klean color to.</li>
    <li> Super fun colors, especially for summer.. came in new and nothing wrong. they actually stay on nails for a long time! thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love the neon colors, if they were actually all neon. I received a melon green,neon Aqua blue,neon sapphire,neon purple,neon green,neon yellow,tangerine burst,pink lady(which was a glitter polish),neon fuschia,neon lime,sea ice,&amp; a black.</li>
    <li> So affordable goes on with one coat however after a few used polish gets thick</li>
    <li> Like these A LOT. Since the colors are not listed, you get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea Ice (113 the lightest blue color in the picture)&lt;br /&gt;Neon Aqua (14 the medium color of blue in the picture)&lt;br /&gt;Neon Sapphire (15 the darkest blue in the picture)&lt;br /&gt;Black (5)&lt;br /&gt;Neon Fuchsia (21 looks like a red color)&lt;br /&gt;Neon Purple (16)&lt;br /&gt;Neon Yellow (18 the darker of the yellow colors and not really neon)&lt;br /&gt;Funky Yellow (85 this one is actually neon yellow and the lighter color of yellow in the picture)&lt;br /&gt;Neon Orange (19)&lt;br /&gt;Neon Pink (20)&lt;br /&gt;Melon Green (12 - the lighter of the two greens it is NOT matte)&lt;br /&gt;Neon Green (17)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are true to the image and are opaque with the exception of the lighter green color, Melon Green-it is not a matte finish and takes several coats. I do have to mention that they take a REALLY long time to dry so I am thinking about investing in a nail dryer. I ordered these because I needed a black, orange and a couple different blue colors. I knew I would pay MORE for 4 colors than buying these so this is a VERY GOOD VALUE. They came quickly and unscathed. Thanks Kleancolor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think these are fabulous colors. They are exceptional because I cannot find these colors at Sally. HOWEVER they take SO LONG to dry (I did end up buying a nail dryer and it didn&#x27;t seem to speed up drying time significantly) I will probly not order them again.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my daughters for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to see that I received all different colors, no repeats as I have read in a few other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The colors look beautiful and are full size bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment on the polish quality yet.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a gift, I was really disappointed that they didn&#x27;t come in some kind of a box.  They were each carefully bubblewrapped but just came thrown in a box.  I realize that wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the description, I just assumed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments from this set of polish than any other I own. The color Is very neon vibrant the purple and the pibk are my favorite and most complimented on. I&#x27;ve also bought the metallic set and am equally as happy!</li>
    <li> most of these are good opaque colors with just one coat.</li>
    <li> Great product and Seller to work with.</li>
