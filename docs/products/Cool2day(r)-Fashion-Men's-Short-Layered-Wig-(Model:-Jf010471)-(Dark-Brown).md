      <li>Nope, just a good wig!</li>
      <li>TO YOUR LIKING, A BEAUTIFUL ONE.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this wig!</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>for the price, a great wig to have for Cos Play.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Color looks good &amp; uniform&lt;br</li>
      <li>) Style looks good</li>
      <li>the price I paid, under $20 on sale, it is a good wig for what it is.</li>
      <li>In bright light, it looks plastic.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>While the color is close to a natural appearance, it is almost too perfectly uniform.</li>
      <li>cap is a good fit.</li>
      <li>Velcro would be better or a better hooking mechanism.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still okay for the price.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I took the chance.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many people said, with shock, &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe he cut his hair for this play!&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>It would, however, be perfect to wear as part of a halloween costume or for theatrical purposes.  </li>
      <li>it looks more like a woman&#x27;s wig.  </li>
      <li>To be as cheap as it was, the quality was pretty great.</li>
      <li>The sellers sent two hair nets, and with the help of some bobby pins piling his locks around his head, this wig was able to fit over it all.  </li>
      <li>If the hair is blown against the \\&quot;direction of growth\\&quot;, one can easily see these gaps and the underlying cap.</li>
      <li>The wig is easy to style, however the spike doesn&#x27;t always stay into place.</li>
      <li>Halloween season was more fun with this wig.</li>
      <li>so you do have to cut it to fit your face.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;d be comfortable wearing daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wore a wig cap before putting on the wig, and used bobby pins to secure the wig to the wig cap.</li>
      <li>Superior to regular halloween wigs&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>i did wear it out to a bar at night and was able to pass off as real hair.  </li>
      <li>The wig is superior in construction &amp; realism compared to regular costume wigs you see at halloween.</li>
      <li>But for under $20, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect and as long as it isn&#x27;t hit by direct sunlight it looks like real hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a durable and nicely made wig for the money, but it definitely LOOKS like a wig.</li>
      <li>Most people&#x27;s natural hair does not have a uniform color unless its been dyed.</li>
      <li>i just bought it for fun.  </li>
      <li>It would make the wig look more natural</li>
      <li>It was very shiny and fun to wear.  </li>
      <li>Overall construction is OK for this price point, but could be better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was ready to wear right out of the box.</li>
      <li>Hair is super soft and super realistic.</li>
      <li>the asian dude in the pic........um, i&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s his real hair, not a wig.  </li>
      <li>For a $10 wig, it definitely is of higher quality than those cheap cosplay wigs you see at your local costume store/Wal-Mart.</li>
      <li>It was easy to style with a shake or two and simple finger combing.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great wig for halloween or everyday wear</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look anything like pic but still looks real</li>
      <li>When I wore it to work people thought it was my real hair and that I had gotten a hair cut.</li>
      <li>real.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look real, like in the photo.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much, much, longer.  </li>
      <li>Looks, and feels like real hair.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t have high expectations that you are getting a professional quality wig costing hundreds</li>
      <li>The shape of the wig is different from the photo, but for a costume wig its pretty well done.  </li>
      <li>You could feel the \\&quot;bump\\&quot; where a track end was not sewn down securely.</li>
      <li>He certainly didn&#x27;t want to cut his hair, but I was a bit worried that such an inexpensive wig would not do the trick.  </li>
      <li>I bought this wig because I had a hair accident and ended up nearly bald</li>
      <li>It may fit a child head or an adult with really small head.</li>
      <li>This was the first tip off that this wig is really not something I would wear out to cover up hair loss or to get a quality hair style variation.</li>
      <li>Dora wig for 3 year old, hairy man( funny on bald dad), and new look for blonde long haired teen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it for my Shinji Ikari cosplay, and it barely needed any styling at all!</li>
      <li>Like those poor quality halloween wigs, this wig has sparse wefts with huge gaps between tracks.</li>

    <li> Hair is super soft and super realistic. When I wore it to work people thought it was my real hair and that I had gotten a hair cut. It is a little itchy though but I think that is from the wig cap. I also suggest washing the wig cap before wearing it because I had an allergic reaction to it.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this wig! To be as cheap as it was, the quality was pretty great. I&#x27;m using it for my Shinji Ikari cosplay, and it barely needed any styling at all!</li>
    <li> My son, who has very thick, long hair, needed a new do for a production of The Music Man.  He certainly didn&#x27;t want to cut his hair, but I was a bit worried that such an inexpensive wig would not do the trick.  I am so glad I took the chance.  The sellers sent two hair nets, and with the help of some bobby pins piling his locks around his head, this wig was able to fit over it all.  I doubt you would want to wear it for everyday use, but for a theater show, it works really well.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many people said, with shock, &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe he cut his hair for this play!&amp;#34;  Nope, just a good wig!</li>
    <li> the wig does not look like the pic.  it&#x27;s much, much, longer.  it looks more like a woman&#x27;s wig.  however, i guess you could trim in.  it&#x27;s still okay for the price.  i did wear it out to a bar at night and was able to pass off as real hair.  during the day that would not work.  i just bought it for fun.  the asian dude in the pic........um, i&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s his real hair, not a wig.  lol</li>
    <li> Received different as picture but feel&lt;br /&gt;Like real. Keep</li>
    <li> It reacts well to curling with an iron, so don&#x27;t be afraid to!</li>
    <li> It is way too small for an adult.  It may fit a child head or an adult with really small head.</li>
    <li> MY STYLIST IS CUTTING THIS TO MY LIKING, WITH IT ON MY HEAD, NOT A GREAT WIG IN ITSELF, BUT IF YOU GET IT CUT TO YOUR LIKING, A BEAUTIFUL ONE.</li>
    <li> The shape of the wig is different from the photo, but for a costume wig its pretty well done.  The color is perfect and as long as it isn&#x27;t hit by direct sunlight it looks like real hair.  In bright light, it looks plastic.&lt;br /&gt;But for the price, a great wig to have for Cos Play.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the claims of &amp;#34;real hair look and feel&amp;#34; but this blew me away. It was ready to wear right out of the box. We&#x27;ve found lots of uses.... Dora wig for 3 year old, hairy man( funny on bald dad), and new look for blonde long haired teen. Halloween season was more fun with this wig. We carefully combed it and only a few hairs fell out. It is definitely less tangle-able than American girl hair. But it is longer than pictured, this is why it could be &amp;#34;Dora hair&amp;#34; for the 3 year old.&lt;br /&gt;Cool product</li>
    <li> Bought this for a party.  It was very shiny and fun to wear.  The part can be rotated around one&#x27;s head for different looks.</li>
    <li> For a $10 wig, it definitely is of higher quality than those cheap cosplay wigs you see at your local costume store/Wal-Mart. Looks, and feels like real hair. The wig is easy to style, however the spike doesn&#x27;t always stay into place. It doesn&#x27;t take that long to come it back into place though. I&#x27;d recommend this wig to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig because I had a hair accident and ended up nearly bald lol. So i bought this wig to kinda get it to the same length my hair was. My family didn&#x27;t even notice and neither did the security at airport! It was a bit long so you do have to cut it to fit your face. Overall it&#x27;s a great wig for halloween or everyday wear</li>
    <li> The wig looked nothing like the picture. It looked like a little girls hairstyle.</li>
    <li> The saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is spot on. The wig is superior in construction &amp; realism compared to regular costume wigs you see at halloween. Those wigs are overpriced and very poor quality, so this wig by comparison is vastly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap is a good fit. The color I chose (dark brown) is so close to my original hair color, my wife was shocked that I \\&quot;had hair again\\&quot;. Keep in mind that the color is uniform which can make it look less natural like dyed hair sometimes looks. It was easy to style with a shake or two and simple finger combing. Looking at the wefting though, I was rather disappointed. Like those poor quality halloween wigs, this wig has sparse wefts with huge gaps between tracks. If the hair is blown against the \\&quot;direction of growth\\&quot;, one can easily see these gaps and the underlying cap. This was the first tip off that this wig is really not something I would wear out to cover up hair loss or to get a quality hair style variation. It would, however, be perfect to wear as part of a halloween costume or for theatrical purposes.  The \\&quot;adjustable\\&quot; straps in back are not well designed and can detach easily due to the poor hooking mechanism. I wore a wig cap before putting on the wig, and used bobby pins to secure the wig to the wig cap. This proved satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit I received had some defects. The wefting at one point was loose. You could feel the \\&quot;bump\\&quot; where a track end was not sewn down securely. I will have to sew the track down to prevent it from becoming worse. Also, around this point of the track, a stand segment or two fell out - the attachment of the hair to the track itself was not attached well. Once I sew down the track end it should prevent future problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid, under $20 on sale, it is a good wig for what it is. Just don&#x27;t have high expectations that you are getting a professional quality wig costing hundreds you&#x27;d be comfortable wearing daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;2) Superior to regular halloween wigs&lt;br /&gt;3) Color looks good &amp; uniform&lt;br /&gt;4) Style looks good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Overall construction is OK for this price point, but could be better.&lt;br /&gt;2) Loose wefting that has come unsewed. As a result, a few hair strand segments come untied and fall out.&lt;br /&gt;3) Adjustable straps are useless. Velcro would be better or a better hooking mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;4) While the color is close to a natural appearance, it is almost too perfectly uniform. Most people&#x27;s natural hair does not have a uniform color unless its been dyed. It would make the wig look more natural had they introduced some slight sparse variations in strand color. But for under $20, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> This wig is just like a bad plastic surrgeries  dont waste your mony so artificial i am so sad about my money and my waiting time</li>
