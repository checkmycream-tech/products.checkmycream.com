      <li>This Amazon product has a very strong flowery odor.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>best products for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Gentle and smooth and the best I have bought in years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I decided to try the Weleda Rose eye cream last week and it is very refreshing and works great too.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love Weleda.</li>
      <li>I really love this cleanser as a make-up remover/night-time cleanser -</li>
      <li>I use it both ways and am quite pleased.</li>
      <li>I have dermatitis and skin allergies, on top of rosacea.</li>
      <li>This is a great gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>I love this one because it&#x27;s a lotion</li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Quality is top notch she says.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying more.</li>
      <li>and I think that it makes my skin feel nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Product is ok.</li>
      <li>and I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I felt like for the money paid it should have come with more.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t love smell.</li>
      <li>I think it is a perfect moisturizer for either evening, or prior to applying makeup.</li>
      <li>This works like magic.  </li>
      <li>I love it because it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Nice, mild scent.</li>
      <li>I can safely say it is gentle, soothing, and effective.</li>
      <li>My skin feels clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Well, I don&#x27;t think this is an original manufacturer product.</li>
      <li>It gets irritated by the lotion and the skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>A more cost-effective cleanser is Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence Facial Cleanser; it&#x27;s pretty good, but stings my eyes a bit.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter who has really sensitive skin, she uses it without any problems and her skin looks amazing.</li>
      <li>She loves Waleda skincare products and was amazed I could find it online for such a good price.  </li>
      <li>It began to improve visibly after the second application and has gotten better and better ever since.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fine for me, but if you wear makeup I could see this not taking it off your face very well.</li>
      <li>The price is better with Subscribe and Save than ordering direct from Weleda.</li>
      <li>Nice for the winter months when your face is super dry.</li>
      <li>right when I need it.</li>
      <li>This is great for my sensitive dry skin in the winter</li>
      <li>(but you definitely couldn&#x27;t use it in place of a moisturizer, tried that once just to see :) ).</li>
      <li>I have rosacea and have searched for many years to find a cleanser that soothes while cleansing, and this product definitely fits the bill.  </li>
      <li>This was on the top of the list for safest facial cleansers and after reading about some others on the list, decided to go with this one.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like it, to say exactly my skin didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>I really love Weleda products and will always use them and order them in the future.</li>
      <li>Even though you don&#x27;t need a great deal to wash your face, still it won&#x27;t last long with this size.</li>
      <li>I have always had super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It also does not dry my skin out at all and leaves it feeling healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works fast and I do not need a lot.</li>
      <li>so it runs out fast.</li>
      <li>The scent is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much in the container</li>
      <li>It does not dry your skin out in anyway, and it does moisturize and clean.</li>
      <li>It cleans your face with gentleness and yet you really feel clean----I always used Cetaphil  </li>
      <li>I am so excited to say I finally found a product that I can continue to use.</li>
      <li>This lotion is really soothing, and I love that it&#x27;s unscented making it feel really calm and delicate.</li>
      <li>the liquid is very soft , i heard it&#x27;s very save for mom, so i choose it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product and company.</li>
      <li>important note: To use this cleanser, you MUST apply on dry skin!</li>
      <li>Since I was expecting for my skin to get worse before it got better, I did everything I could to make sure I would reduce potential irritation as much as possible, so I looked to the Environmental Working Group (EWG) website for help in finding the right stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve set up Subscribe and Save for this product so that I get a new delivery</li>
      <li>so at first I used the facial lotion on my eyes.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy and leaves my face soft, smooth, and feeling nourished.</li>
      <li>Is soft.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this cleanser is not greasy or pore</li>
      <li>I have been using this Waleda Almond product for several years, but I always purchase it at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Works wonders on my Rosacea prone (read: extremely sensitive) face...</li>
      <li>No harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderfully natural skin care product.</li>
      <li>Anything touching my face would make it burn intensely and make the problem worse.</li>
      <li>It is not bad, but I am not entirely sure it moisturizes my face very well.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a decent product.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice make-up removal cream, but it seems pretty expensive to me for such a small amount.</li>
      <li>(was a flip-top cap with small opening, now is a screw-top cap with large opening) - too much product is dispensed at once.</li>
      <li>The only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea or my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this lotion is definitely soothing.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my older skin nor does it feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin clean but does not come with the tight or dry feeling.</li>
      <li>clogging and leaves my skin beautifully clean and soft, unlike other heavy, greasy &amp;#34;milk or cream cleansers.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The only other product I&#x27;ve used that comes close is MyChelle Honeydew cleanser for sensitive skin but even that stings my eyes and irritates my skin if I don&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.</li>
      <li>I have tried several different cleansers for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Just enough for sensitive skin or skin that is fairly low maintenance.  </li>
      <li>and It wasn&#x27;t worth the money for the small amount you get</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, dry skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this Waleda Almond product for several years, but I always purchase it at Whole Foods. I decided to purchase it from this seller on Amazon instead to try and save money. Well, I don&#x27;t think this is an original manufacturer product. If it is, then it is probably one sold at a discount because of a formulation error. The smell is different than the product I have been using for years. This Amazon product has a very strong flowery odor. Sadly, I will not be buying this product from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is great for my sensitive dry skin in the winter</li>
    <li> I have always had super sensitive skin and I love this product.  No irritation and it cleans well but my skin also feels softer after I use it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my older skin nor does it feel greasy.  Highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> This works like magic.  Thank you for the prompt delivery and service.  I really love Weleda products and will always use them and order them in the future.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser as a make-up remover/night-time cleanser - it even removes my eye make-up without irritation! I wish it came in a bigger size, but that&#x27;s the breaks. A more cost-effective cleanser is Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence Facial Cleanser; it&#x27;s pretty good, but stings my eyes a bit. Weleda&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with my acne-prone skin for years now. Still struggling at 25, I seeked out some extra help. I did lots of research and decided it was time to try out Tretinoin, as a desperate measure. Since I was expecting for my skin to get worse before it got better, I did everything I could to make sure I would reduce potential irritation as much as possible, so I looked to the Environmental Working Group (EWG) website for help in finding the right stuff. This was on the top of the list for safest facial cleansers and after reading about some others on the list, decided to go with this one. I use this as my cleanser, wait an hour, and then apply the Tretinoin. In the morning I either wash with this again or with just water and then apply vitamin e oil from the capsule to my skin. Well, I never had a phase where my skin looked worse- It began to improve visibly after the second application and has gotten better and better ever since. I&#x27;ve been using the combination of those three things (and zinc oxide sunscreen!) every day for about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**very important note: To use this cleanser, you MUST apply on dry skin! then rinse with warm water, then cold. For some reason, applying to wet skin just doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;*oh, and I&#x27;m using .025% Tretinoin in a cream base</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on my Rosacea prone (read: extremely sensitive) face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4-5 months of use I can safely say it is gentle, soothing, and effective. I avoid it&#x27;s use on oilier areas (T-Zone) in the summer, but for the rest of the year its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have purchased this 2-3 times now and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy this product fro as long as they make it! I have extremely sensitive skin and this cleanser is not greasy or pore clogging and leaves my skin beautifully clean and soft, unlike other heavy, greasy &amp;#34;milk or cream cleansers.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!  I have rosacea and have searched for many years to find a cleanser that soothes while cleansing, and this product definitely fits the bill.  My go-to cleanser for the forseeable future!</li>
    <li> It is terrific. Gentle and smooth and the best I have bought in years.&lt;br /&gt;Works fast and I do not need a lot. Good value. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a very nice make-up removal cream, but it seems pretty expensive to me for such a small amount. The product itself is good - the price is not.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother who is almost 70 and can&#x27;t use the computer.  She loves Waleda skincare products and was amazed I could find it online for such a good price.  Quality is top notch she says.  I&#x27;ll be buying more, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> love it!!!  It cleans your face with gentleness and yet you really feel clean----I always used Cetaphil  for many years----my daughter uses Weleda --they lived in Germany and loved their products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, to say exactly my skin didn&#x27;t like it. It gets irritated by the lotion and the skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderfully natural skin care product. It cleanses your face while not over drying or irritating it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Makes me feel dry and It wasn&#x27;t worth the money for the small amount you get it doesnt seem like it will last long.</li>
    <li> Just enough for sensitive skin or skin that is fairly low maintenance.  It doesn&#x27;t lather and a little goes a long way.  Nice, mild scent.</li>
    <li> I felt like for the money paid it should have come with more. There isn&#x27;t much in the container so it runs out fast. Not a good deal for the money. The product itself is of good quality. It did make my face feel smoother atleast.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this lotion is definitely soothing.  I use it with my Clarisonic.  My skin feels clean and smooth.  I plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have tried several different cleansers for sensitive skin. I love this one because it&#x27;s a lotion (but you definitely couldn&#x27;t use it in place of a moisturizer, tried that once just to see :) ). It does not dry your skin out in anyway, and it does moisturize and clean. Seems like a small amount but a little goes a very long way, especially if you get your face damp first. This is the only facial cleansing product I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and sometimes I even use it to remove eye make up while I&#x27;m using it to wash my face, and it does not sting my eyes. The only other product I&#x27;ve used that comes close is MyChelle Honeydew cleanser for sensitive skin but even that stings my eyes and irritates my skin if I don&#x27;t wash it off fast enough. I love, love, love Weleda.</li>
    <li> Considering the cost of this product, it doesn&#x27;t work any better than plain old-fashioned four-dollar cold cream or just plain olive oil.</li>
    <li> Nice for the winter months when your face is super dry. I also don&#x27;t wear much/any makeup so it&#x27;s fine for me, but if you wear makeup I could see this not taking it off your face very well.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my sensitive skin. I have dermatitis and skin allergies, on top of rosacea. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it is the only one I have found that does not inflame my skin. It also does not dry my skin out at all and leaves it feeling healthy and soft. Removes makeup well! I&#x27;ve set up Subscribe and Save for this product so that I get a new delivery right when I need it. The price is better with Subscribe and Save than ordering direct from Weleda.</li>
    <li> The only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea or my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time. I love it because it&#x27;s preparation follows as closely as it can the processes of nature. I use a very small amount once a day for my sensitive skin and feel very balanced and that I am giving my skin just what it needs.</li>
    <li> This is a great gentle cleanser. It leaves my face moist, but not too moist, and never irritates.</li>
    <li> I have been having severe skin allergies on my face and neck since moving to the #1 city for allergies 2 years ago. I spent a fortune in cleansing and moisturizing products. Anything touching my face would make it burn intensely and make the problem worse. Weleda Almond is the only product I can use. It isn&#x27;t too heavy and leaves my face soft, smooth, and feeling nourished. There isn&#x27;t an accompanying eye cream so at first I used the facial lotion on my eyes. It worked great with no eye irritation. I decided to try the Weleda Rose eye cream last week and it is very refreshing and works great too. Finally I have found a product that brings healing and comfort to my skin.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser! I have psoriasis and its hard to find something that wont irritate my skin. I tried this because it says its good for people with skin conditions. I figured what could be the harm, Ive tried just about everything else. This is working great. You use only a tiny amount, it gently cleanses, and doesnt leave my skin dry or tight. I am so excited to say I finally found a product that I can continue to use.</li>
    <li> best products for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> love this soothing cleanser, but the new cap design is annoying (was a flip-top cap with small opening, now is a screw-top cap with large opening) - too much product is dispensed at once.</li>
    <li> This lotion is really soothing, and I love that it&#x27;s unscented making it feel really calm and delicate. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and I think that it makes my skin feel nice and smooth. It does not cause break outs and does not make me feel oily. It moisturizes nicely and is neither thick nor thin. I think it is a perfect moisturizer for either evening, or prior to applying makeup. I use it both ways and am quite pleased.</li>
    <li> smell very weird. the liquid is very soft , i heard it&#x27;s very save for mom, so i choose it.</li>
    <li> I have always been very impressed with every Weleda product I&#x27;ve purchased and no exception with this one. It melts makeup off nicely, feels soothing, has good ingredients, and rinses off easily. The scent is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for not giving a five star is the size of the tube. Even though you don&#x27;t need a great deal to wash your face, still it won&#x27;t last long with this size.</li>
    <li> I am using this to moisturize my face daily. It is not bad, but I am not entirely sure it moisturizes my face very well. I get break outs every once in a while, I do not know if it is the lotion. Overall, it is a decent product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cleanser after trying numerous other cleansers for dry and sensitive skin, which left my skin tight and dry. Not this one! It leaves my skin clean but does not come with the tight or dry feeling. Highly recommended for those who also struggle with the cold weather at this time of the year.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, dry skin. This is the perfect solution. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Is soft. No redness. No harsh chemicals. I don&#x27;t even notice the almond scent.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has really sensitive skin, she uses it without any problems and her skin looks amazing. It is also cheaper to buy through here than Weleda&#x27;s on line store.</li>
    <li> Product is ok. I didn&#x27;t love smell. And very expensive for the price. The container is tiny.</li>
