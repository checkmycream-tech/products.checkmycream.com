### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My guess is that Perfect Life Ideas bought up Meridian Point&#x27;s inventory and &amp;</li>
      <li>This is truly the BEST and EASIEST and FASTEST way to trim nose and ear hair.</li>
      <li>no pulling or tuging perfect cut</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why Perfect Life Ideas chose to send the package this way, but it gives me, the consumer, an uneasy feeling about the product I just bought.</li>
      <li>My guess is that Perfect Life Ideas bought up Meridian Point&#x27;s inventory and &amp;</li>
      <li>but this is EXCEPTIONAL!!!</li>
      <li>Go for this baby that has the HP, and comes at a very fair price...</li>
      <li>I think I can honestly say this is the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>thank you Perfect Life Ideas :-)</li>
      <li>Good product, does what it is supposed to.</li>
      <li>For durability, this trimmer seems fairly sturdy, but as with any trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, you probably want to take care not to drop it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes, what I have mentioned is factual, but by no means does it make Perfect Life Ideas not a  legitimate Company.&lt;br /&gt;***It should be noted that I received this product free of charge for an honest review***&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the trimmer.</li>
      <li>Worked well and satisfied!</li>
      <li>This works great, is hygienic, and comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>so I took things into my own hands and purchased this trimmer for him.  </li>
      <li>Kind of a pain.</li>
      <li>I was provided with a sample of this trimmer for evaluation and review, and this is my own honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>These are questions I shouldn&#x27;t have to be pondering with a brand new trimmer advertized as &amp;#34;#1 Best Nose Hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was provided with a sample of this trimmer for evaluation and review, and this is my own honest and unbiased opinion.rks fine.</li>
      <li>I sure don&#x27;t suggest spending more.    </li>
      <li>It is probably not something where purchasing a &#x27;name&#x27; brand is justification for spending more money.</li>
      <li>we lose hair in the one area we&#x27;d like to keep it - on the top of our heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I sure don&#x27;t suggest spending more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many of the ones that cost more than this just don&#x27;t have the power this one does.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely an entry level trimmer, but its also the best I have ever had.  </li>
      <li>It is probably not something where purchasing a &#x27;name&#x27; brand is justification for spending more money.</li>
      <li>glad I made this choice.</li>
      <li>The packaging I received advertizes this to be a Meridian Point product, there is only a sticker placed on top of the Meridian Life logo that tells you it was sold by Perfect Life Ideas.</li>
      <li>Perfect Life Ideas&#x27; brand trimmer is, for all I know, manufactured in the same factory as the Panasonic trimmer I&#x27;ve used for years</li>
      <li>This case is different, because of the Perfect Life product&#x27;s quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The quality of the trimmer feels inferior or maybe a better word would be &#x27;not durable&#x27;.</li>
      <li>But the trimmer when you finally get it going is very good.</li>
      <li>This is not the &amp;#34;#1 Best Nose Hair Trimmer&amp;#34; (despite its enthusiastic labelling), but it is certainly a better-than-adequate basic trimmer, albeit with no frills.&lt;br</li>
      <li>what it lacks in bells and whistles it more than makes up for in how well it does its primary purpose-- trimming hairs from one&#x27;s nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>what it lacks in bells and whistles it more than makes up for in how well it does its primary purpose-- trimming hairs from one&#x27;s nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Is supposed to be able to be used in shower, but haven&#x27;t tried that.&lt;br /&gt;Offered free to test.</li>
      <li>If that feeling of solidity is important to you, you might consider a more costly model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>good product  works very well</li>
      <li>This baby has the power, and that is what makes it easy and painless to use.</li>
      <li>Works well,but it takes a strong grip to operate the on-off</li>
      <li>This one is far superior and at a much better price.  </li>
      <li>He said it worked fine and thinks it could also easily be used for someone with unsightly ear hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>works fine.  </li>
      <li>trimmer is well made and works fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an avid Amazon reviewer, who was offered this product, for free, in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>but the battery worked fine in another product).</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, easy to clean and works well.  </li>
      <li>This is an ingenius unit, great design, simple to use and operate, light, and inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>Add-on&#x27; item [in order to get free shipping]).</li>
      <li>If you ask me to describe this product in one word I would have no choice but to say &#x27;cheap&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Remove wrapper, toast them in a toaster, enjoy.</li>
      <li>The top does get a bit warm after a couple minutes of continuous use, yet considering I doubt most will be running it that long</li>
      <li>the &amp;#34;-#1 Best Nose Trimmer&amp;#34; works better than the more expensive Remington at clipping nose hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great little gift and/or hint for someone you love.  </li>
      <li>When my husband used it, he just ran it under running water to clean it out.  </li>
      <li>received this item at a discounted cost, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>It should at least be noted so Perfect Life Ideas does not come across as &#x27;shifty&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Hopefully they&#x27;ll have their own packaging soon, and will look look far more professional and trustworthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hopefully they&#x27;ll have their own packaging soon, and will look look far more professional and trustworthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you need a nose hair trimmer, you are an adult, and will be able to operate this device with no difficulty at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These days there are a great variety of very inexpensive trimmers available, and many of them work basically the same way - they are powered by a single AA battery, and a rotating motor drives a cutter device on the end of the trimmer that works very well in trimming hairs in the nose, ears, and so forth.</li>
      <li>Works well and priced right</li>
      <li>Even so, like for beard grooming, it never actually got hot, just warm.  </li>
      <li>I am very sensitive in the nose and sneeze easily when using something like this trimmer.</li>
      <li>And by cheap I do not mean monetary.</li>
      <li>The blades spin quickly, which helps trim the hairs fast on the first pass, every time.</li>
      <li>first being that there are NO instructions on usage, assembly, care, safety ...</li>
      <li>Thank you for reading the whole thing!</li>
      <li>First I must say &#x27;Thank you&#x27; to the seller.</li>
      <li>The package comes with exactly what you see pictured, a trimmer and a brush.</li>
      <li>The last picture will show the packaging so you may better understand my perception/first impression of this purchase.ed, that the product DOES have a &amp;#34;100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEED&amp;#34;***&lt;br /&gt;Attached you will find three photos.</li>
      <li>The last picture will show the packaging so you may better understand my perception/first impression of this purchase.</li>
      <li>However, this trimmer has enough speed to trim the hairs quickly and cleanly.</li>
      <li>If you enjoyed this review, or at least felt it was sincere, please give me a “helpful” vote.</li>
      <li>They were very helpful and responsive with an issue I had with my first trimmer.</li>
      <li>that just reinforces my earlier perception of &#x27;cheap&#x27; (the first battery i used never worked on it again</li>
      <li>any case, packaging aside, this is a fine basic nose hair</li>

      <li>[There is also printed statement saying that changing altering on the box is a violation of U.S. copyright law, which seems a bit ironic under the circumstances.]</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it REALLY REALLY tickles when I use it on my nose hairs, and sometimes it really hurts and pulls.  </li>
      <li>[There is also printed statement saying that changing altering on the box is a violation of U.S. copyright law, which seems a bit ironic under the circumstances.]</li>
      <li>really.</li>
      <li>He admitted once it arrived that he did really need to do some trimming and decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Fast RPM,</li>
      <li>/&gt;There aren&#x27;t really any cons to this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of those things that happens naturally as we age - hair begins to appear in spots that were previously bare, and hair begins to grow more profusely in areas where the population of hair had been much lower (or in some cases, completely absent!).</li>
      <li>as a result, some trimming is really needed, otherwise no matter how clean we might be, the hairs sticking out from various and sundry orifices become distracting and can eventually become quite gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the third try (because you can&#x27;t have a true test unless you have three or more tries)</li>
      <li>The price was right, it look like it should work and best of all the cutting mechanism was quite different from the rest!</li>
      <li>Has some problems in the beginning couldn&#x27;t get it to work properly but after some time and using different batteries was able to get it up and running</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t needed it on ear hairs yet, so I&#x27;ve only used it for my nose, and for that, it gets the job done quickly and</li>
      <li>Personally, I highly dislike buying ANYTHING that doesn&#x27;t spell out every step for me.</li>
      <li>And as I said, for the price even if you need only rarely is worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be using this new trimmer now and retire my old Panasonic to the hand-me-down box, to keep as a standby even though it probably deserves a proper burial with full honors for it&#x27;s years of service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got it for my husband. He loves it and it&#x27;s an answer to a long standing problem of ingrown hairs. The usual &#x27;trimmers&#x27; caused him irritation and this painful problem for years. This works great, is hygienic, and comfortable to use. NO more troubles! Recommend!</li>
    <li> Need to do some &#x27;face-scape&#x27; work?&lt;br /&gt;This little trimmer can do the job on the cheap.&lt;br /&gt;In just a second or two it whizzes around to remove any embarrassing stray hairs poking out of the nose or ears.&lt;br /&gt;No point in spending a lot for something that needs attention only rarely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided with the option to review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of those things that happens naturally as we age - hair begins to appear in spots that were previously bare, and hair begins to grow more profusely in areas where the population of hair had been much lower (or in some cases, completely absent!). All of this happening just as (for some of us, anyway) we lose hair in the one area we&#x27;d like to keep it - on the top of our heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a result, some trimming is really needed, otherwise no matter how clean we might be, the hairs sticking out from various and sundry orifices become distracting and can eventually become quite gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming, that is the solution. It becomes part of our regular grooming routine (or it should).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days there are a great variety of very inexpensive trimmers available, and many of them work basically the same way - they are powered by a single AA battery, and a rotating motor drives a cutter device on the end of the trimmer that works very well in trimming hairs in the nose, ears, and so forth. A quick cleaning after every use - using the included brush, or under the faucet (my old Panasonic did not allow wet cleaning, as far as I recall), and it&#x27;s ready for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;Perfect Life Ideas&#x27; brand trimmer is, for all I know, manufactured in the same factory as the Panasonic trimmer I&#x27;ve used for years (I have the ER 411 trimmer, which is no longer available but seems to have been replaced by this [[ASIN:B000O5VKK0 Panasonic ER415SC Nose, Ear and Facial Hair Trimmer]], presently selling on Amazon for $6.99 as a \\&quot;Prime Add-on&#x27; item [in order to get free shipping]). In other words, my Panasonic (the newest version of it) is selling for almost the same price as this trimmer which today is selling for $11.70 on Amazon with Prime shipping included. (And in fact I think it&#x27;s not possible to get Amazon to ship you the Panasonic trimmer as a sole purchase item, whereas this trimmer will ship to you even if it is the only thing you order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is well made and works fine. The battery was not included. The on/off switch is a bit stiff but I expect that will loosen up over time. The difference to my umpteen-year old Panasonic was immediately apparent the first time I turned it on, making me aware of how tired the old Panasonic motor is, even with a new battery. It still works fine, though (the Panasonic), testimony to the longevity of these little motor powered devices, which really have little to go wrong.

The battery was not included. The on/off switch is a bit stiff but I expect that will loosen up over time. The difference to my umpteen-year old Panasonic was immediately apparent the first time I turned it on, making me aware of how tired the old Panasonic motor is, even with a new battery. It still works fine, though (the Panasonic), testimony to the longevity of these little motor powered devices, which really have little to go wrong.

    <li> First I must say &#x27;Thank you&#x27; to the seller. They were very helpful and responsive with an issue I had with my first trimmer. If possible, I will be looking at their products for future use due to their outstanding support and services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ear/nose trimmer works as expected. I am very sensitive in the nose and sneeze easily when using something like this trimmer. However, this trimmer has enough speed to trim the hairs quickly and cleanly. Same with the ear hairs. Cleaning is snap too. Just be careful as the pieces are small and could be lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Barry for all your assistance.</li>
    <li> This is definitely an entry level trimmer, but its also the best I have ever had.  Many of the ones that cost more than this just don&#x27;t have the power this one does.  In fact before I came across this one and went for it simply for the price, I used one that cost twice as much that was just too weak. I used to pull the battery out just to see if it was dying.  This baby has the power, and that is what makes it easy and painless to use. Sounds simple enough, but you would be surprised how many are just too weak.  Go for this baby that has the HP, and comes at a very fair price...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie, there are quite a few things that bothered me with this trimmer......&lt;br /&gt;The first being that there are NO instructions on usage, assembly, care, safety ... nothing. The package comes with exactly what you see pictured, a trimmer and a brush. No, it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out where the battery goes or how to insert the battery. And I didn&#x27;t have an issue, as so many other reviewers apparently had, replacing the bottom cap of the trimmer after putting the battery in. It also doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out how to turn the trimmer on and/or off. But just because it doesn&#x27;t take a genius, doesn&#x27;t mean instructions should not be there. Personally, I highly dislike buying ANYTHING that doesn&#x27;t spell out every step for me. The reason why? If I do it wrong and it happens to malfunction because of it, it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to go thru any return procedure. It takes time and energy by the consumer that they may or may not have to spare. If I do it wrong and it malfunctions and God forbid causes me any discomfort, then we have a WHOLE other level of &#x27;pain in the butt&#x27; that I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t have to get into for anyone reading to understand. Instructions are just a basic component to any item. Even if it&#x27;s just a few basic bullet points or even just a diagram showing the different parts, anything is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s move on to the actual trimmer. If you ask me to describe this product in one word I would have no choice but to say &#x27;cheap&#x27;. And by cheap I do not mean monetary. I mean the product itself. The quality of the trimmer feels inferior or maybe a better word would be &#x27;not durable&#x27;. But that is just perception and perception is in the eyes of the beholder. It may actually be quite durable, but it doesn&#x27;t come across that way ... to me.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue, the first time I put the battery in to use it, when I turned it on it just buzzed for a tenth of a second and then it cut off. I took the battery out and re inserted it and it happened again. This time I shook the trimmer a bit an voil&amp;agrave;, buzzzzzzzzzzzz! For the third try (because you can&#x27;t have a true test unless you have three or more tries) I set the product aside for a total of approximately 30 minutes and when I went to turn it on, nothing. I shook and shook and still nothing. I took the battery out and re-inserted it and nothing. I went and got a new battery and nothing. So I shook it again and voil&amp;agrave;, buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz............that just reinforces my earlier perception of &#x27;cheap&#x27; (the first battery i used never worked on it again, i tried 5 times...but the battery worked fine in another product). To me, as a consumer, this is major. Is the product going to work? Do I need to carry extra batteries? These are questions I shouldn&#x27;t have to be pondering with a brand new trimmer advertized as &amp;#34;#1 Best Nose Hair Trimmer&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;These last two point are going to seem trivial to you, but I&#x27;m am an overall thorough reviewer, so it must be mentioned. 1) The product pictured is not exactly what I received. The product I received has a different on/off switch design (not a big deal, but it&#x27;s a fact) and 2) The packaging I received advertizes this to be a Meridian Point product, there is only a sticker placed on top of the Meridian Life logo that tells you it was sold by Perfect Life Ideas. I don&#x27;t know why Perfect Life Ideas chose to send the package this way, but it gives me, the consumer, an uneasy feeling about the product I just bought. It doesn&#x27;t say anywhere in the Amazon description of the product that they are re-selling another Company&#x27;s product. It should at least be noted so Perfect Life Ideas does not come across as &#x27;shifty&#x27;. Again, this last point is MY perception of this product. Yes, what I have mentioned is factual, but by no means does it make Perfect Life Ideas not a  legitimate Company.&lt;br /&gt;***It should be noted that I received this product free of charge for an honest review***&lt;br /&gt;***It shouldalso be noted, that the product DOES have a &amp;#34;100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEED&amp;#34;***&lt;br /&gt;Attached you will find three photos. One will show the actual product I received and another will show the picture of the product I should have received so you can see the different on/off switches I mentioned earlier.

    <li> This is not the &amp;#34;#1 Best Nose Hair Trimmer&amp;#34; (despite its enthusiastic labelling), but it is certainly a better-than-adequate basic trimmer, albeit with no frills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already owned a Remington trimmer that I paid for-- this one I received gratis in exchange for writing a review-- and it came with three different cutting attachments, and a far higher price tag (lit cost about four times as much).  This one, from Perfect Life Ideas in China, has only the single cutting head, to do the single job it was made for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kicker is this-- the &amp;#34;-#1 Best Nose Trimmer&amp;#34; works better than the more expensive Remington at clipping nose hair.  This was, I have to admit, unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally take care when reviewing products to only compare apples with apples-- and then only with apples of the same price range.  Comparing a $12 dollar item to a $40 dollar one makes for an unfair playing field. This case is different, because of the Perfect Life product&#x27;s quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far as I can tell, the sole reason for that quality is speed.  The speed with which the rotary blades spin to cut the hair is so fast (they say it&#x27;s 10,000 rpms) that there is no tugging, no pulling out of hairs-- none of the problems that can result in small infections and ingrown hairs.  And, it does it on a single AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t have the &#x27;heft&#x27; of the more expensive model-- more plastic and less metal in its construction.  If that feeling of solidity is important to you, you might consider a more costly model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is a bit problematic. The box contains the trimmer, its storage cap, and a small brush for cleaning the blades.  It does not contain instructions, beyond a photograph of it being run under running water. You will have to figure out how to put in the battery yourself-- it is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also another problem with the packaging, which has to do with the trimmer&#x27;s brand name.  On Amazon they are &amp;#34;Perfect Life Ideas&amp;#34;.  On the front and back of the box that&#x27;s their name, too, but only on stickers put over a different name, Meridian Point (TM), which is the brand name still shown on each of the four sides of the box!  [There is also printed statement saying that changing altering on the box is a violation of U.S. copyright law, which seems a bit ironic under the circumstances.] My guess is that Perfect Life Ideas bought up Meridian Point&#x27;s inventory and &amp;#34;repackaged it with stickers.  Hopefully they&#x27;ll have their own packaging soon, and will look look far more professional and trustworthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, packaging aside, this is a fine basic nose hair trimmer-- what it lacks in bells and whistles it more than makes up for in how well it does its primary purpose-- trimming hairs from one&#x27;s nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.Amazon they are &amp;#34;Perfect Life Ideas&amp;#34;.

    <li> received item box was crushed and parts broken on item. returned for credit.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:d077f7ad43aa3fc8042c13fd31a0cad7]]I had no issues getting this to work each and every time, so perhaps there is a bit of hit-or-miss there.  However, I can only deal with what is in front of me (so to speak), and compared to the little manual one I was using, I am frankly sold on this electric trimmer.  Does the dangling eyebrow hairs so-so, but for neat trimming the corners of goatees and van dykes (and of course gnarly nose &amp; ear cables), this does what it needs to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to laugh at the LOUD crunch when this hits a hair, but at least you know you are accomplishing something.  The top does get a bit warm after a couple minutes of continuous use, yet considering I doubt most will be running it that long, this is a negligible matter.  Even so, like for beard grooming, it never actually got hot, just warm.  Probably want to get those bad boys up in the nose caves first, though, before moving on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one thing?  No yanking, not even a slight tug.  Just that crunch.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Discounted price offered for evaluation purposes</li>
    <li> Works well and priced right</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:4eeae284a28e570e13d55da8d31f5c55]]This device works so well, it does not pull the hair out,  it cuts the strands, and  - it kinda tickles when used.  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t have any open blades, I think you could touch it while on, and it would not cause any harm.  It&#x27;s a great little gift and/or hint for someone you love.  It comes with a brush for cleaning.  When my husband used it, he just ran it under running water to clean it out.  He said it worked fine and thinks it could also easily be used for someone with unsightly ear hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I uploaded a video of my hubby using the trimmer / hair shaver.  It&#x27;s a little weird focusing closely on a nose and trying to hide his identity so he won&#x27;t be recognized as Bruce Wayne. Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> My husband has been in desperate need of some grooming and I have been telling him forever to trim his nose hairs.  He kept blowing me off so I took things into my own hands and purchased this trimmer for him.  He admitted once it arrived that he did really need to do some trimming and decided to give it a try.  He loves it!  It is easy to use, easy to clean and works well.  It trims hair without pulling, no pain or discomfort involved.  No more ungroomed husband, I couldn&#x27;t be happier and my husband likes his new, groomed look.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted cost, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Good product, does what it is supposed to. Remove that nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only caveat, no instruction. Now I know it&#x27;s pretty basic, but really. How to insert battery, etc. Instructions are good.&lt;br /&gt;Is supposed to be able to be used in shower, but haven&#x27;t tried that.&lt;br /&gt;Offered free to test. And as I said, for the price even if you need only rarely is worth it.</li>
    <li> no pulling or tuging perfect cut</li>
    <li> works fine.  I bought 2.</li>
    <li> gave this to my son. he likes it but says it burns a bit after using.</li>
    <li> This is truly the BEST and EASIEST and FASTEST way to trim nose and ear hair. At age 63, I usually do not do review but this is EXCEPTIONAL!!! It does NOT come with a battery.  P.S. This product sat in my draw and I used it once every10 days. It was NEVER DROPPED or abused or anything like that and about 1 month ago, regardless of the brand new battery, IT STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY. I have emailed the company on 2 occasions and on the 2nd email, after furnishing my proof of purchase, they finally &amp;#34;said&amp;#34; they would contact the warehouse and ship me another one. NOTHING HAS ARRIVED. I told them that if they would ship me a new one, I would refrain from giving a HORRIBLE review for the product and for their horrendous customer service. I will now look elsewhere but if it does ever come, I will add that to this review. Sad that I gave them a chance and got nothing in return............  12/21/16 The company replaced the one that broke after I told them and asked for a replacement TWICE. It took asking a second time for the replacement. thank you Perfect Life Ideas :-)</li>
    <li> NO INSTRUCTIONS. DID NOT WORK PUT IN BATTERY . COULD NOT EVEN FIND AN OPTION TO TURN ON POS</li>
    <li> good product  works very well</li>
    <li> Works well,but it takes a strong grip to operate the on-off panel.&lt;br /&gt;Not clear when out of the box as to how to open the battery cover.Pull or twist?No indication as to battery size AA or AAA? Which end is positive or negative.But the trimmer when you finally get it going is very good.Fast RPM,</li>
    <li> After reading the past reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. The price was right, it look like it should work and best of all the cutting mechanism was quite different from the rest! Simply said, it works very well! I&#x60;m glad I made this choice.</li>
    <li> i use the brush for my laptop</li>
    <li> Has some problems in the beginning couldn&#x27;t get it to work properly but after some time and using different batteries was able to get it up and running</li>
    <li> I think I can honestly say this is the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. The previous ones I have owned were typically part of a total grooming shaver kit. But this little guy outperforms them, I think. It only uses one battery, which hasn&#x27;t died yet, so I can&#x27;t testify to how often it needs changing. The blades spin quickly, which helps trim the hairs fast on the first pass, every time. It tickles a little bit, but there is no discomfort at all. I haven&#x27;t needed it on ear hairs yet, so I&#x27;ve only used it for my nose, and for that, it gets the job done quickly and smoothly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t really any cons to this product. Someone mentioned that it came without any instructions, but I can&#x27;t see what you would need that for. Not everything needs instructions. They put them on Pop-tarts anyway: Remove wrapper, toast them in a toaster, enjoy. If you need a nose hair trimmer, you are an adult, and will be able to operate this device with no difficulty at all. For durability, this trimmer seems fairly sturdy, but as with any trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, you probably want to take care not to drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an avid Amazon reviewer, who was offered this product, for free, in exchange for an honest review. Thank you for reading the whole thing! If you enjoyed this review, or at least felt it was sincere, please give me a “helpful” vote.</li>
    <li> This item replaced an old Remington model I had for several years.  This one is far superior and at a much better price.  I heartily recommend it for trimming eyebrows, ear and nose hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work unless I hold the bottom tightly against the trimmer-- otherwise the bottom pops off and the battery comes out. Kind of a pain. Looks like maybe something is wrong with the plastic hinges that connect the battery cap to the trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is an ingenius unit, great design, simple to use and operate, light, and inexpensive.  Unfortunately, it REALLY REALLY tickles when I use it on my nose hairs, and sometimes it really hurts and pulls.  I have used similar, but more expensive, trimmers, and they did not hurt, at least not as much, or tickle as much.  I would personally use a scissors over this, but I will probably go back to my previous electric trimmer instead which is similar but not painful.</li>
    <li> I was offered this product for review and I agreed now knowing if this will work or cause pain. Eventually I agreed and was pleasantly surprised. Worked well and satisfied!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he said it works like a charm!</li>
    <li> It stop working after using it only twice, it would not come back on.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the trimmer.</li>
