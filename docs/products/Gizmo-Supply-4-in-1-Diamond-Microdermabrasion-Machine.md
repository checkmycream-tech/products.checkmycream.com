      <li>So far so awesome though.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m 44 and don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; any more like in my youth.</li>
      <li>I love this machine.</li>
      <li>I like the convenience of being able my to do treatments at my convenience</li>
      <li>I love what it does to my face.</li>
      <li>I went online to learn more about the technique of performing micro-dermabrasion.</li>

      <li>I wish there was more tork.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with my purchased, its easy to use</li>
      <li>The power is impressive and I never needed to turn the power more than half way.</li>
      <li>It is not made for transporting easily.</li>
      <li>I use Cetaphil or Cerave lotion - they are the most gentle and effective lotions out there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great investment, no regrets...</li>
      <li>It does not replace the professional derma peels from a spa or dermatologist, but for in between treatments it works amazing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cool to be able to use this myself on whatever problem areas I want.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to move around.</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice but very superficial.  </li>
      <li>It feels like the microderm facial I used to get at the salon and my skin looks great.  </li>
      <li>If anything I should have invested in the 5 in 1 unit now that I am into my home spa, but it wasn&#x27;t available at the time.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and can&#x27;t say enough good things--I still want to get some photo treatments for the underlying brown spots-</li>
      <li>The suction is adequate, the machine is easy to use, it is well designed and the handheld tools are well crafted.  </li>
      <li>i love it so much!</li>
      <li>I wish the instruction booklet was more detailed as far as how many times a week you can use it.</li>
      <li>Professional results, very pleased with purchase.</li>
      <li>I clean them with my mini ultrasonic machine I sue to clean jewelry and boil the tips to sterilize them.</li>
      <li>I just use an air compressor to blow out the wands and unscrew and clean the plastic collector monthly</li>
      <li>This machine does a good job and is simple to run.</li>
      <li>It is good solid quality</li>
      <li>Also, after a microdermabrasion session, I love how lotions and face products just soak into the skin super fast</li>
      <li>My skin is softer more vibrant.  </li>
      <li>It also said it had greater depth (3mm) than the others, but in looking in the manual, all the tips are the same anyway and the manual pressure would be what creates more depth.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, my husband could tell without me telling him because he said my face looked smooth and glowing.</li>
      <li>After using this product for several weeks she is very satisfied with the results she has obtained.</li>
      <li>This machine works pretty good &amp; the suction is strong &amp; will burn the skin of you go over one area too long especially on young skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This unit, coupled with a little practice, should give anyone a great result.</li>
      <li>This does work really well, makes the face so smooth and receptive to all products you use on the face.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>was more of a professional level machine.</li>
      <li>Not only do I have the \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; of being able to do home treatments with my own machine, I have found that by using this all over--legs, arms, back, chest, feet, I have the smoothest, nicest skin--better than ever before!</li>
      <li>instruction manual isn&#x27;t very clear - but the machine is very straight forward and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use the smooth suction tip after the treatment to get rid of the dead skin and clean out the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, the Professional Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine is a good buy.</li>
      <li>After a few photo therapy treatments, the colored areas actually raised to the top of my skin and flaked off,  amazing!</li>
      <li>I love my machine, I have friends getting the same one because my skin looks</li>
      <li>I use a cleanser first then the machine then a mask afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I love this machine and use it daily at my spa!</li>
      <li>I also had a breakout after the first session.</li>
      <li>Works well, powerful, easy to use and change the different Diamond tips of the Mircrodermabrasion machine.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very straightforward and simple to use.</li>
      <li>The company responded quickly when I contacted them about it and new right away that I hadn&#x27;t allowed the motor to warm up at room temperature (must be a common issue)and I&#x27;ve had no further problem once I allowed time for it to warm up before firing it up.</li>
      <li>I mix a salicylic based lotion (Clean &amp; Clear) and a benzoyle peroxide based lotion (OBAGI Theraputic) with the Cetaphil or Cerave lotion.</li>
      <li>Not too smart.   </li>
      <li>Maybe there isn&#x27;t much to it.  </li>
      <li>I was very surprise with the results just after one treatment.  </li>
      <li>Also very portable to move around per treatment rooms.</li>
      <li>and I was very please when it took it out of the box to see that is</li>
      <li>The tips provided aren&#x27;t really all that abrasive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased the Professional Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine after several days of doing research on such products. I really wanted a good machine, I could not be happier with this machine! Not only do I have the \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; of being able to do home treatments with my own machine, I have found that by using this all over--legs, arms, back, chest, feet, I have the smoothest, nicest skin--better than ever before! I absolutely love it and can&#x27;t say enough good things--I still want to get some photo treatments for the underlying brown spots-I haven&#x27;t found anything that can remove them like the anesthician can. After a few photo therapy treatments, the colored areas actually raised to the top of my skin and flaked off,  amazing! But this Diamond Microdermabrasion is wonderful for the in-between professional treatments, and is so cost efficient--paid for itself after 2 treatments--that was about 50 treatments ago!</li>
    <li> Great machine, easy to use and my clients love it. Good results without spending hundreds of dollars. A must have if you have a small clientele,</li>
    <li> This unit works really well, it&#x27;s very straightforward and simple to use. The little paper filters fit behind the tips in the hand-piece and that is all that needs to be changed from time to time. The diamond tips are of great quality. I clean them with my mini ultrasonic machine I sue to clean jewelry and boil the tips to sterilize them. My unit didn&#x27;t work initially because it was still cold from being outside in the box when I first turned in on.  The company responded quickly when I contacted them about it and new right away that I hadn&#x27;t allowed the motor to warm up at room temperature (must be a common issue)and I&#x27;ve had no further problem once I allowed time for it to warm up before firing it up. The manual could be better as it covers every type of model they make so you really have to look through it all to get the info you need. I went online to learn more about the technique of performing micro-dermabrasion. I think I spent a little more than I needed to on this particular thinking a stronger vacuum would be better (170) than other models had, but the manual instructs to select 12-20 on the dial for the face, (no more than 20),  so it turns out I won&#x27;t need ever use the stronger vacuum anyway. It also said it had greater depth (3mm) than the others, but in looking in the manual, all the tips are the same anyway and the manual pressure would be what creates more depth. If anything I should have invested in the 5 in 1 unit now that I am into my home spa, but it wasn&#x27;t available at the time. This does work really well, makes the face so smooth and receptive to all products you use on the face. It&#x27;s paid for itself already in 4 uses.  I offer my friends some sessions as gifts now that I have the technique down. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Get this machine! I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was a teen. The Mia ultrasonic face brush greatly improved my skin - but this machine took me from just \\&quot;managing\\&quot; the problem - to literally eliminating the problem. I&#x27;m so excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t go too high on the suction. I pushed it too far on the first use and got some red bruising. It went away in a couple of days - but I really did crank the suction up too high. I also had a breakout after the first session. I think it was just purging my skin. I&#x27;ve been using the machine regularly and I&#x27;ve never had the breakout response again. Be sure to use the smooth suction tip after the treatment to get rid of the dead skin and clean out the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 light/medium treatments a week work better for me than 1 heavy treatment once a week. I use Cetaphil or Cerave lotion - they are the most gentle and effective lotions out there. My dermatologist told me to use these. Because I&#x27;m prone to acne - I mix a salicylic based lotion (Clean &amp; Clear) and a benzoyle peroxide based lotion (OBAGI Theraputic) with the Cetaphil or Cerave lotion. Also, after a microdermabrasion session, I love how lotions and face products just soak into the skin super fast and I can feel it going to a deeper level of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction manual isn&#x27;t very clear - but the machine is very straight forward and easy to use. There&#x27;s an \\&quot;on\\&quot; button and a dial for the level of suction. The filters go in the tip before you screw it on. Aaaanndd.....that&#x27;s it. Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this! I&#x27;ve never taken the time to write a review this long - but I love this machine!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been getting microderm facials regularly for over 2 years at the salon but when I found out that my salon might be shutting down, I started looking around for an alternative.  I ordered this machine with my fingers crossed.  I LOVE IT!  It feels like the microderm facial I used to get at the salon and my skin looks great.  I also wanted something I could use on my chest area and didn&#x27;t want to pay more at the salon for this service.  This machine is perfect.  I have had it for only a month but I have used it weekly.  I use a cleanser first then the machine then a mask afterwards.  Never going back to the salon for a microderm facial.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed professional facialist and massage therapist and bought this unit for home use on myself. It has the same power as the professional office unit but without the outrageous price tag. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to move around. The results of microdermabrasion are highly dependent upon the skill of the user, so for a non-professional it may take a few tries to get it right. This unit, coupled with a little practice, should give anyone a great result.</li>
    <li> great machine, save money by doing this yourself.  it works.</li>
    <li> Was tired of the expense for microdermabrasion treatments. This machine does a great job. I used this twice a week. I love what it does to my face.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice in two or three years.... to big to leave out, to heavy to get out..</li>
    <li> Works well, powerful, easy to use and change the different Diamond tips of the Mircrodermabrasion machine. Also very portable to move around per treatment rooms.</li>
    <li> I love this machine. It is bulky and heavy so it is hard to store if you have limited space. The machine itself worked very well. It left my face feeling clean and glowing. I havent had any peeling with the micro derm treatments, just redness. I wish the instruction booklet was more detailed as far as how many times a week you can use it. Also, instructions on how to use are vague.I have had professional microderm treatments before but did not get very good results and it is so expensive. The  benfits of having my own machine is that I can concentrate on my problem areas such as my dark spots. It works well for my hands as well. I like the convenience of being able my to do treatments at my convenience</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase, and the machine seems well made.  You can also order replacement parts from the company.</li>
    <li> Only used once so far but worked well.  Seems to be good quality</li>
    <li> Great quality machine. Professional results, very pleased with purchase. Delivered earlier that expected. It&#x27;s a great investment, no regrets...</li>
    <li> This machine works pretty good &amp; the suction is strong &amp; will burn the skin of you go over one area too long especially on young skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed an Aesthetic Laser Center so I&#x27;m certified to use the microderm machine. I would purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week now and the results are wonderful.  My skin is softer more vibrant.  I had a deep wrinkle on my wrist and it has reduced it.  Just in i believe four uses. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I did have to look up the installation video on YouTube, but that made it clear I was overthinking it. There&#x27;s not much to put together. I did however have to use electrical tape to keep the hose on the wand... and to seal it. This thing works like the professional dermabrasion I got years ago. It&#x27;s so cool to be able to use this myself on whatever problem areas I want. The first time I used it, my husband could tell without me telling him because he said my face looked smooth and glowing. I haven&#x27;t been using this long, so I&#x27;ll try to provide updates if my opinion changes. So far so awesome though.</li>
    <li> This has been the best micro machine I have purchased. I found that the 10 mm filters don&#x27;t work as well as the 12 mm. It is easy to clean. I just use an air compressor to blow out the wands and unscrew and clean the plastic collector monthly and I have had no problems with it at all. Don&#x27;t let the machine get cold or it takes a while to warm up. The diamond tips are good quality and haven&#x27;t rusted so I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a  licensed Esthetician for over 30 years, I have had this machine for my personal home use for the past 2 years and just bought 2 for the salon I just opened.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the results for myself as well as my clients</li>
    <li> Not a good machine, very low pressure, I don&#x27;t recommend, specially for professionals, maybe its OK for use as a home treatment, but its far too big machine for that.</li>
    <li> My wife loves  this machines and uses it all the time. Wants to use it on me--- no way will that happen</li>
    <li> This is a great machine very powerful it&#x27;s done me a world of good can&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove facial hair like when I had professional dermabrasion but otherwise, I am happy with the product.  Plenty of suction.  I have it no where near full suction &amp; sometimes I can still give myself a red mark if I&#x27;m not careful.  I have had it for some time now &amp; have had no operating or relibability issues.</li>
    <li> I have been using this machine regularly for two years now, and it performs wonderfully. Suction is good. Diamond tips are great (do clean and sterilize after each use), and results are lovely and smooth. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love my machine, I have friends getting the same one because my skin looks awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money and does the same result as a professional machines..love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this machine and use it daily at my spa!</li>
    <li> Update: When I wrote this review, it was for a different machine. This company has since changed the machine entirely and the previous, which is the one that I bought, looked very much like the Kendall brand. It was large, silver and like my review, was a total waste of money. This new Gizmo brand should have had a new page on Amazon. Not too smart.   A total waste of money. Suction is not even necessary for micro-dermabrasion. Plus, this dinosaur of a machine is gigantic and ridiculous. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Took my machine to a recycling plant, so at least it wouldn&#x27;t end up in the landfill.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my fiancé as a gift.  She wanted this machine to help her improve and remove facial blemishes.  After using this product for several weeks she is very satisfied with the results she has obtained.</li>
    <li> Have used this 4 times now since it was delivered and have seen great results. It does what it says it does for your skin. My daughter even noticed the difference. I&#x27;m 44 and don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; any more like in my youth. This helps bring it back. It gets rid of all the built up \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; on your skin that cleansers and creams just can&#x27;t do. I would definitely recommend this machine. It is good solid quality and I was very please when it took it out of the box to see that is was more of a professional level machine. The only down side to it are the instructions. They are vague at best and include instructions for several different models of microderm abrasion machines so you have to figure out which instructions to read for your machine.</li>
    <li> The tips provided aren&#x27;t really all that abrasive. It works well for most skin types, though!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchased, its easy to use and  i love it so much! My skin looks great every time i used it ( ofcourse with my moisturizer!)</li>
    <li> When you have it done at the dermatologist, its pricey. The machine pays for itself after two uses. My face feels great when I&#x27;m finished. That said I really never took a class or anything so . . . I would give it five stars if I knew what I was talking about!</li>
    <li> This machine works well and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This machine is quite impressive,I am in the cosmetology industry and have seen many of these machines come and go.I was skeptical at first with so many to choose from but this one will not disappoint. The power is impressive and I never needed to turn the power more than half way. change the filter after every use and your good to go.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but very superficial.  It almost feels like its not doing much to skin but scraping it. I wish there was more tork.</li>
    <li> Too much money for this thing... didn&#x27;t recieve the extra screw I needed... what else to I need to say</li>
    <li> this machine had plenty of power,did exactly what was expected to do. I loved this unit. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very strong machine! As good as a salon treatment!</li>
    <li> Very good at home product.  I was very surprise with the results just after one treatment.  The Machine it&#x27;s self is vey big and bulky.  It is not made for transporting easily.</li>
    <li> no filter and power goes slow very often is like a copy of other machines but the worst version. my mistake. Noisy. 2 years and now is broken does not work anymore.</li>
    <li> This machine does a good job and is simple to run. It does not replace the professional derma peels from a spa or dermatologist, but for in between treatments it works amazing! Love it!</li>
    <li> I researched and researched these mashines and I finally chose this one.  It took all but 1 minute to put together and I didn&#x27;t need help.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it does a great job.  It looks scary on the picture but it&#x27;s actually a very nice looking mashine.  The instruction are not that helpful, it only gives you a picture of what to do.  Maybe there isn&#x27;t much to it.  It&#x27;s just so simple, I was worried I was doing it wrong.  I did all the ladies in my family and they also loved it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice machine, the suction is good and it did come with the tip&#x27;s and filters. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The pro&#x27;s &#x3D; low cost, strong suction, easy to use, durable metal casing and tools.&lt;br /&gt;The con&#x27;s &#x3D; poorly written instruction/ user&#x27;s manual, limited cotton filters/ lacks ordering info for purchasing more filters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit pays for itself after a couple of uses.  The suction is adequate, the machine is easy to use, it is well designed and the handheld tools are well crafted.  However, this machine will not give you salon quality results by itself.  But, it does offer an affordable method to slough off dead skin and give a slightly smoother appearance.  For optimal results, consider using a peel afterwards.  Overall, the Professional Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine is a good buy.</li>
