      <li>A great gunmetal gray, it goes on smooth, dries quickly and lasts as long as any OPI polish.</li>
      <li>Just right!</li>
      <li>This picture of this is a bit darker than what you&#x27;ll actually receive, but it is still a gorgeous color.</li>
      <li>I have fair alabaster skin and the gray has a yellow undertone to it that did not compliment my skin at all.</li>
      <li>i go to, because I love this so much.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not as good as Essie polishes which I&#x27;ve had last 7-8 days before chipping.  </li>
      <li>even looked good after only one coat!!</li>
      <li>It really makes my nails pop, and I receive so many compliments when I wear this shade.</li>
      <li>I love gray nailpolishes and really any nailpolish that is a cool matte color.  </li>
      <li>Typically I wear bright colors, but I figured this was better suited for my job..</li>
      <li>I cant place the undertones in this grey though Its a beautiful color that compliments many different skin tones.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great neutral gray, and I see the olive green hints in it too that another reviewer saw.  </li>
      <li>Nice color, especially in the fall/ winter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice grey color for ages, and this one is great!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>I have never really been a huge fan of OPI, I&#x27;ve always found Essie to be the better quality polish.</li>
      <li>Good alternative to black.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>&quot; color type of gal...usually do pretty neutral colors.  </li>
      <li>the color is exactly what i wanted been looking for it for awhile and up to OPI standards.</li>
      <li>It looks best with short nails, and I usually put two coats on.</li>
      <li>I put on two coats and it is really pretty</li>
      <li>I got it for $8.00 (no extra costs) free S&amp;H and it arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love this color, and lasted a really long time.</li>
      <li>I love any shade of grey  </li>
      <li>Was shipped fast too.</li>
      <li>The retailer packaged the item very well, and if you don&#x27;t have a gray, this is where to jump in.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit darker, so going to save for fall as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much of a summer color.</li>
      <li>I will say I ALWAYS google the color (French Quater For Your Thoughts ), brand (OPI) and \\&quot;swatch\\&quot; to see the true color on nails.</li>
      <li>Logically I would not think grey would look great, but it works for my pale skin tone and white gold engagement ring.</li>
      <li>Dries to a sort of &#x27;dove grey&#x27; color, very pretty.</li>
      <li>I do not like really dark colors on my fingernails, so this one fits the seasons and looks good, without being to dark.</li>
      <li>Very professional looking.</li>
      <li>Looks so cute with my olive green cords and a dark top, especially next to purples.  </li>
      <li>Not too dark but not too light.</li>
      <li>It was way too easy to open and it looks only half full.</li>
      <li>No yellow or green hues and looks great when used with other colors.</li>
      <li>As usual, Opi applies smoothly, no chipping and we are happy.</li>
      <li>I gave this polish 4 stars because the color is great and you can usually get a few days wear out of it before it starts chipping</li>
      <li>Of course, being a nail polish it pretty much disappeared within a few months.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s neutral enough to still be professional but as a bit of edge.</li>

    <li> Love the color it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I just have to say that I LOVE this shade of polish by OPI. I purchased it on a whim, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. The color is this awesome light gray with just the slightest hint of olive green. It really makes my nails pop, and I receive so many compliments when I wear this shade. Plus, the staying power is great. Definitely scoop this one up!</li>
    <li> A few years ago Sally Hansen had a shade in their Xtreme wear line that was called Wet Cement. It was my favorite nail color. Of course, being a nail polish it pretty much disappeared within a few months. I&#x27;ve spent the past two years trying to find a comparable shade. This OPI shade is the closest. It&#x27;s a little bit darker but I like that!  I have never really been a huge fan of OPI, I&#x27;ve always found Essie to be the better quality polish. I gave this polish 4 stars because the color is great and you can usually get a few days wear out of it before it starts chipping but it&#x27;s not as good as Essie polishes which I&#x27;ve had last 7-8 days before chipping.  This is a nice neutral shade and I actually had my wedding party wear it!  It&#x27;s a great winter color and looks amazing with a black crackle coat.</li>
    <li> Poor quality... seemed &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is a great cool gray. Reminiscent of Essie&#x27;s Chinchilla. No yellow or green hues and looks great when used with other colors. My search for the greatest gray may be over...</li>
    <li> Not too dark but not too light. Just right! Perfect for the fall weather! Had on for 3 weeks now and still no chipping!</li>
    <li> Received this color as a gift for Christmas and I love it.  It&#x27;s a great neutral gray, and I see the olive green hints in it too that another reviewer saw.  I guess color is subjective.  Looks so cute with my olive green cords and a dark top, especially next to purples.  It also lasts a really long time without chipping.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!! It has become my favorite color!! And stays on for such a great amount of time even though I work retail.</li>
    <li> beautiful color.  Stays on for weeks</li>
    <li> My favorite OPI color. So cute</li>
    <li> I wanted something different but not neon.  This is a very nice shade of gray that held up pretty well.  I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> The color of grey is perfect for a bit of color without being too bold.  It&#x27;s neutral enough to still be professional but as a bit of edge.</li>

    <li> the color is exactly what i wanted been looking for it for awhile and up to OPI standards. Goes on very nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I actually bring this to the nail salon i go to, because I love this so much. Very professional looking. It looks best with short nails, and I usually put two coats on. It does not complement silver jewelry or white gold, but if you&#x27;re wearing yellow gold jewelry or none at all, this is a definite must try. Was shipped fast too.</li>
    <li> I love this color, and lasted a really long time.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter who was into grays at the time. OPI has great quality products.</li>
    <li> I think this polish has been used. It was way too easy to open and it looks only half full. I have yet to use it.</li>
    <li> There was one bottle of nail laquer I wanted (due to budget) from the OPI Touring Collection for this fall, and this was it.  I got it for $8.00 (no extra costs) free S&amp;H and it arrived quickly.  Excellent basic, true gray with a lovely sheen.  For any age.  The retailer packaged the item very well, and if you don&#x27;t have a gray, this is where to jump in.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a grey nail polish this is it. An additional option; I will use a silver top coat to bring it to life.</li>
    <li> I just got OPI&#x27;s French Quarter for Your Thoughts and I&#x27;m very happy with it.   Even with just one coat the color looks great. Typically I wear bright colors, but I figured this was better suited for my job.. and it&#x27;s great.   It&#x27;s a different color, almost like one of those fake plastic quarters in a money play set for kids.   I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
    <li> greatest polish on the market</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this OPI color although I have to say I am rarely displeased with any OPI. I have tried several different bran of polish as I get a manicure every 7-10 days and OPI stands up to the rest. I will say I ALWAYS google the color (French Quater For Your Thoughts ), brand (OPI) and \\&quot;swatch\\&quot; to see the true color on nails. It can be hard to tell in bottle and unfortunately the OPI swatches on the website are almost never close. I always purchase from XPRESSURSELF, I have NEVER had a problem. Quick ship, fair prices, and he combines shipping. This is a BIG plus for me since I tend to hold off and buy 3-5 different colors at a time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is in her twenties and she loves the color.  You can&#x27;t beat OPI for quality and color selection.</li>
    <li> Color did not work well with my skin at all. I have fair alabaster skin and the gray has a yellow undertone to it that did not compliment my skin at all. It&#x27;s the color of putty.</li>
    <li> So this color is not too dark, but it is not really light. I do not like really dark colors on my fingernails, so this one fits the seasons and looks good, without being to dark.</li>
    <li> I love this color. I was looking for a gray and this is it! I put on two coats and it is really pretty and it went on really nice and the color has a shine to it. I am so glad I found this, it was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> this polish was just ok.  Seemed to take several coats to cover.  Prolly will not buy again.  Gave it away</li>
    <li> Takes at least two coats to look rich, but that&#x27;s typical. Wears well, manicure lasted over a week.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color, very unique and matches everything.&lt;br /&gt; Good alternative to black.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colors in my polish collection. Goes on very smooth, no streaking and lasts for quite a while without chipping. Dries to a sort of &#x27;dove grey&#x27; color, very pretty.</li>
    <li> I tried this shade at the nail salon and really really liked it, so I ordered from Amazon!  Logically I would not think grey would look great, but it works for my pale skin tone and white gold engagement ring.</li>
    <li> This picture of this is a bit darker than what you&#x27;ll actually receive, but it is still a gorgeous color. I wish I would have ordered this in time for prom, but I would tell anyone to get this pale gray.</li>
    <li> absolutely love the color!  i have gotten several complements on the color.  im not really a \\&quot;out of box\\&quot; color type of gal...usually do pretty neutral colors.  i was a bit skeptical about this color, but i absolutely love it.  its a lighter shade of gray and goes well with everything..  would definitely recommend this color.</li>
    <li> I bought this color on a whim and now it&#x27;s my favorite.  A great gunmetal gray, it goes on smooth, dries quickly and lasts as long as any OPI polish.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new favorite OPI polish! I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice grey color for ages, and this one is great!&lt;br /&gt;It even looked good after only one coat!!</li>
    <li> Nice color, looks really awesome with Crown Me Already used as a sparkly top coat.  Nice color, especially in the fall/ winter.</li>
    <li> Saw this color on pintrest and ordered it shortly after.  I was so pleased when I went to paint my nails how nicely the polish went on and the color was awesome.  Two coats and it looked fabulous.  I was even more impressed that it didn&#x27;t chip for almost two weeks.  I am in love!  Got lots of compliments on the color. Will be a staple for me!</li>
    <li> I adore this color. I have gotten plenty of compliments while wearing it too. I cant place the undertones in this grey though Its a beautiful color that compliments many different skin tones.</li>
    <li> This unique color has a metallic sheen to it.  We LOVE this color!!  As usual, Opi applies smoothly, no chipping and we are happy.</li>
    <li> I love any shade of grey  this OPI Polish is sleek and boy the questions never such as what color polish do I have on and by who I&#x27;m truly digging this color</li>
    <li> I never thought I would enjoy but another customer was getting this color and we chatted about it. She was right - goes with everything and a very nice, conservative color for the office.</li>
