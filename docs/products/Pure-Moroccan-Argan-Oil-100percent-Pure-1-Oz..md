    <li> very good, fast shipping</li>

    <li> I thought I would try this Argan oil out and turns out I like it pretty well.  I tried it on my lips and it worked really good.  They are very soft now.  I also thought I would try it out as a moisturizer so I lightly applied it to my face.  Well the results for my skin is softer and my acne has improved.  Really nice results.  I did add a little to my shampoo because my scalp is really dry due to the cold weather and it has helped with the dryness and itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
