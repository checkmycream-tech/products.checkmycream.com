<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This color is fantastic. It&#x27;s not overly bright, but a very pretty blue teal color.</li>
    <li> I love this medium blue.  It feels like a day at the beach when wearing it.  It&#x27;s soft hue is very flattering and I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great color - for toes and finger nails. Its a unique color without being trashy. I have received lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> I have determined that it is not worth buying nail polish online because the actual colors are different than what they look like on the computer. I like O.P.I. products but it wasn&#x27;t the finish I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this pretty blue/ aqua polish after getting a pedicure with the same.  The bottle I received had the proper name but the color is brown.  I doubt this is even opi brand.  So incredibly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very pretty blue looks great on my toes!</li>
    <li> And OPI. Nail polish lasts for days and is very smooth going on!! OPI is a lot more expensive than most other brands but well worth it!</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish because it lasts a long time without chipping and the colors are beautiful.  It has looked lovely for weeks now.</li>
    <li> This is the First time I tried this kind of color, and turn out i Love the color, looks very summer. Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> Love it!  The color, the texture, the coverage.  A very pretty shade of blue that stands up to the OPI quality.  Thrilled to have it in my collection.</li>
    <li> I think I expected this to be a little more pastel.  Its a little bit darker than I was expecting, but I ended up liking it.</li>
    <li> People will notice you when you wear this color anywhere and any place.  Love the color! Love it very much!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Its more of a grayish blue than the turquoise color in the picture. I really like it, its a great  summer into fall color.</li>
    <li> This is a great color. Product listed as described. Great price for this color. Love OPI colors. The always look great.</li>
    <li> Nice color, match with my skin tone so well ... Good for this season , aqua is my best choice and clothes and accessories for this season .</li>
    <li> This was an great deal as well as an awesome color, the euro centrale collection is by far one of the best opi makes.</li>
    <li> OPI makes great polish, and I loved the color....in the bottle.  On my toes I looked like I was going to a Halloween party.  Ended up giving it to a 30-something mom and her four year old daughter, who promptly painted each others fingers and toes, and love it!  So it went to a good home.</li>
    <li> TOO DARK FOR MY PURPOSES.  COULD NOT FIND THE EXACT COLOR IN THIS SHADE THAT I WANTED AND HOPED THAT THIS ONE WOULD SUFFICE - NOT FOR ME.</li>
    <li> The color looked cute in the bottle but when I painted my nails it looked streaky and didn&#x27;t quite look like I was thinking. It was almost as if the bottle I received was old.</li>
    <li> Loved the color and enjoyed it right away.  Looks really good with chevron pattern on my toes with purple.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great color, good experience.</li>
    <li> Great Summer color. I saw it on someone and had to have it.  Did my toes and fingers both with it and got complements not the color.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a nice light blue color. It&#x27;s more of a medium blue.</li>
    <li> Love the color and ease of application.  Is a bit more difficult to dry.</li>
    <li> I love this particular color.  It&#x27;s a true turquoise.  I wore it all summer last year and it just looked so cool!  Looks nice with toe rings...HA!  OPI makes the best colors.</li>
    <li> I received a notice, no I saw that my item was places\\&quot;undeliverable\\&quot; after it was shipped! What happened?!! I was excited to get it because I&#x27;d tried this color before! Arrrg!! My account was charged I got no satisfaction.</li>
    <li> The reason I originally purchased this nail polish was in support of my dear friend who was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. She had selected this color to wear and all of her girlfriends did the same in her honor. As it turns out, I really do love this polish and it lasts for weeks. I highly recommend this to the adventurous female. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Love this color. Such a happy, summery color.  It is slightly brighter than this pic makes it appear, though.</li>
    <li> I gave this product only one star because I thought it was going to be brighter and more blue than it actually is.</li>
    <li> I love OPI polish and I love this color, I can&#x27;t wait to use it next time I paint my nails.  The color is a great blue with a light green undertone.  Not quite turquoise but close.</li>
    <li> Fun spring robin egg color.  Received several complements wearing it.  OPI does a great job with all their colors.  Buy it now!</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty shade of blue! It also looks great with a coat of OPI&#x27;s Polk.com. I&#x27;ve received a bunch of compliments when wearing the two shades together.</li>
    <li> It looks just like it&#x27;s pictured. One of my faves from the collection. Perfect for girly girls like myself :)</li>
    <li> You need like 4 coats to obtain a good color</li>
    <li> This polish is beautiful !!!!!!!!  it is a great color that goes on creamy and smooth.  Even after two weeks it still looks shiny , not chipped or lessened in any way.</li>
    <li> Love this color and it is only one of the many that OPI manufactures. Less chemicals than other polish, easy on and not so easy to chip. What is not to like about OPI?</li>
    <li> From the 40+ nail polishes I own my boyfriend says this one is his favorite. It really looks good on and gives you a little something. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Love the color!  I wound up buying two!</li>
    <li> I got my polish a couple days earlier than expected so that was nice. The color is beautiful and I found application to be easy.</li>
    <li> I keep searching out blue nail polishes hoping to find a shade that is appropriate for work.  I was hoping for something a bit more &amp;#34;baby blue&amp;#34; than this one, but it still passes for work and I&#x27;ve layered glitter on top which received a lot of compliments.  If you have something to go with this shade (I don&#x27;t often wear a lot of blue) then it is probably great, but stand alone It&#x27;s not my thing.  OPI is a great name and product, but this one did chip and wear away pretty quickly.  I had to retouch every day.  I still love it and will experiment with layers and what not.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great color and has the same awesome OPI formula, but I docked a star because the color isn&#x27;t all that unique. I found a dupe at Forever 21 for $2.80.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try OPI nail polish because I have heard such good things about it. I absolutely hate the consistency of it. It is not thick enough and goes on sheer. It takes 5 coats of this polish before it is actual a solid color. The brush is not the best to work with either.</li>
    <li> I love OPI colors and this blue is hot! I can&#x27;t wait to use it, I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed. I have yet to come across a shade that I don&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> Bought this nail color for my daughter ,delighted with this shade of blue, perfect for summer sandal wear, Opi has long lasting wear ,delivered in just 3 days time..</li>
    <li> This color stands out from the crowd. It is such an unexpected color and it is a great addition for the summer or a standout for the fall!</li>
    <li> OPI is a great performer with a good top coat to keep from chipping but give only 3 stars for there being latex included in ingredients with out disclosure. I am alllergic and found out hard way...</li>
    <li> The polish was COMPLETELY watered down. What a waste of money. I had a manicure with this collection and loved it, I&#x27;ve also had multiple OPI colors and none have been this poor a quality. Before writing this review I went out and bought this same color at a reputable OPI store. The consistency is totally different. One coat of the real stuff is literally better than 3 coats of this sellers polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to return it the seller told me it was just the way the new color is and to ask for a refund from Amazon if I have a problem. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t since it would cost just as much to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This color is so nice you can wear it on your hands and feet. Why hold back when you can do so much with it by dressing it up or down depending on the occasion.</li>
    <li> Loved the color in the picture/s provided but not so much when on.  The blue is pretty but I like a bit more sparkle/shine and when I did my nails in this color it lacked that, so I added a topcoat with some sparkles and they were much better.  All in all not bad but wouldn&#x27;t recommend to people who like blue polishes.</li>
    <li> Item met my expectations.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite OPI colors!</li>
    <li> from my wife... :)This new color not only has a &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; name but the polish makes me happy as I look at my nails. Perfect for spring.  I LOVE IT....</li>
    <li> If I had to call this color anything it would be a saturated robin&#x27;s egg blue, less green and less vibrant than a true turquoise. For me it was a 2 coater to be opaque and dried glossy. I got about 5 days before tip wear and with a base coat did not stain my nails. A beautiful color I think it would be good for most skin tones and a toned down blue that could be more work appropriate. Czech it out! (sorry couldn&#x27;t resist)</li>
    <li> Very cool color.  Looks great on the toes for the summer in super cute flip flops.  I would recommend this color for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this shade of polish. It is pretty and light and bright for the spring. It looks pretty with the OPI Euro Centrale Collection Polka.com sparkle shade applied over the teal base.</li>
    <li> Love this color--so soft and pretty--reminds me of being at the beach--a perfect color for walking on the sandy shore.</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful color. Looks very nice. It is not too flashy so you can wear it For work. The only thing is that you will need three coats to look very nice</li>
    <li> This is a great spring / summer color - very unique teal bluish color.  I have tried many different blue shades, and this is by far my favorite blue shade color.  Got many compliments when I use it, and I have used it quite  few times already.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> OPI is my go to company for nail color and this is such a fun one for the summer. Get it!</li>
    <li> Didnt like the color when I got it, but my granddaughter came over and had it on in a flash!  She loves it and it is now hers!  Thanks, better colors for someone younger than myself!</li>
    <li> Great color! Fast Service! I have gotten many many many compliments about this color! Very Happy! Would purchase with buyer again!</li>
    <li> Opi Can&#x27;t Find My Czechbook is a really gorgeous color. I&#x27;ve been wearing it a lot this spring and summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically apply two coats, and find that it&#x27;s a great base for other colors, as well. I just purchased Gone Gonzo (a sparkly blue/silver mix/[[ASIN:B0060AOCDA OPI Nail Lacquer Muppets Collection, Gone Gonzo, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]]) and plan to try it over top this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a good wearing time with minimal chipping (after application of a clear top coat.) Love it!</li>
    <li> Formula was nice and smooth and leveled out nicely. The color is beautiful and great for Summer! I used no base coat, 2 coats of this and Seche Vite top coat and my manicure held out for more than a week! Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great seller!!! Beautiful color!!</li>
    <li> This blue is unlike the many that I already have and is such a nice color. It is a very cute color and perfect for spring.</li>
    <li> Better buy from a reputable OPI supplier. Product very diluted. Different application even different color from what I tried on at the beauty supply. Spend two bucks more get sealed product</li>
    <li> My own fault.  I relied on internet swatches.  This color is almost identical to Nicki Minaj &amp;#34;Fly&amp;#34;.  If you have that already you don&#x27;t really need this.  However, if you don&#x27;t have it already, this is a great shade!  This is slightly lighter than the Nicki one but it really is so similar I don&#x27;t see anyone needing both!  Oh, well.  Great OPI cream formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain that this polish is counterfeit.</li>
    <li> Wow I order one day and get another. The color is great, awesome for summer time. I love OPI and the seller is great too. Thx.</li>
