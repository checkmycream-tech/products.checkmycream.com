      <li>I love the way it feels when i brush.</li>

      <li>This is great for sensitive or damage teeth.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to maneuver around the tooth.</li>
      <li>By far the best soft bristle brush I have used.</li>
      <li>I just wish they were still available as auto delivery.</li>
      <li>I actually enjoy brushing my teeth.</li>
      <li>As far as manual toothbrushes go, this one’s a good one.</li>
      <li>My new favorite toothbrush!</li>
      <li>I also feel like my teeth aren&#x27;t getting clean.</li>
      <li>Reaches corners remove plaque, never felt so clean before.</li>
      <li>It is very soft, but still cleans, and the head is nice and flexible.</li>
      <li>For people that have had to have  periodontal work (particularly gum grafts due to over brushing) this is literally the perfect brush.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth and was hoping this would be a great soft toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with this product, especially compared to others that claim to be &amp;#34;very soft.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Soft, good ol fashioned straight bristles clean teeth and gums gently!</li>
      <li>I love this new tootbrush.</li>
      <li>It brushes very smoothly and softly with almost no pressure.</li>
      <li>Its very soft and gentle and its angled perfectly to get in hard to reach spaces.</li>
      <li>I also find I brush my teeth more carefully as the soft bristles and flexible brush allows me to single out each tooth more easily.</li>
      <li>Great product , arrived quickly, good for sensitive teeth, small mouths and when needing to protect the enamel on your teeth, particularly if your a hard brusher.</li>
      <li>I also have the Nimbus microfine toothbrush, which is way much softer.  </li>
      <li>The neck is somewhat flexible to keep you from putting too much pressure on your gums and teeth.</li>
      <li>I purchased a much softer one in a store before but can&#x27;t find it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a daily flosser and it has significantly reduced my work.</li>
      <li>I initially loved these toothbrushes as I have very sensitive teeth and gums, and welcomed the extreme softness of the brush, especially when combined with the flexibility of the handle.</li>
      <li>Really soft on my gum, dose not cause any bleeding on my gum due to its super super softbrush threads</li>
      <li>The extra soft bristles and small size of the toothbrush head are good for me.</li>
      <li>It is very soft.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are soft, and the head is small enough to fit comfortably between teeth and cheek.</li>
      <li>It is not the very soft one I wanted.</li>
      <li>Based on the product label and reviews, I thought this would be very soft.  </li>
      <li>I was searching around for a very soft toothbrush and decided to give this one a try.  </li>
      <li>It is more for children or small mouthed adults.</li>
      <li>The head is so tiny it took me twice as long to feel like my teeth were clean.</li>
      <li>The bristles are too soft and the handle is too flexable, so I don&#x27;t feel like I;m acomplishing anything at all.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums and this brush doesn&#x27;t irritate my mouth at all.</li>
      <li>WOW.  </li>
      <li>I think it is TOO soft.</li>
      <li>but we keep a spare handy for when it finally begins to fail, which is expected as to clean the chewing surfaces of her teeth</li>
      <li>However, after the little tufts of bristles began falling out into my mouth while brushing my teeth, I quickly changed my opinion.</li>
      <li>It works fine enough, but the head is WAY too small.</li>
      <li>For someone with extremely sensitive gums this may be their only option</li>
      <li>I am an Amazon customer because frequently this is the only place I can find the items I need.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush *is* extra soft.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll go back to a regular soft bristle toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I had to get used to the smaller head, but it&#x27;s actually better for reaching behind the teeth in the back of your mouth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is soft and the long handle lets us get well back along her molars.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This one of the best toothbrushes I come across. My dentist says whatver I&#x27;m doing keep it up! Wish it wasnt so expensive.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothbrush, love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it every day. Very small head on this toothbrush. More like a childs toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush *is* extra soft. The bristles have tapered ends that are gentle on your gums, but very effective at cleaning your teeth. You will have that \\&quot;perfectly clean\\&quot; feeling. The neck is somewhat flexible to keep you from putting too much pressure on your gums and teeth. I had to get used to the smaller head, but it&#x27;s actually better for reaching behind the teeth in the back of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to the Nimbus toothbrush (similar bristles), but I like this even better. A great design. I plan on using this toothbrush from now on!</li>
    <li> As far as manual toothbrushes go, this one’s a good one.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and was hoping this would be a great soft toothbrush. It is soft, but the head is way too small. I feel like I&#x27;m brushing with a child&#x27;s toothbrush. It is okay, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> By far the best soft bristle brush I have used. For people that have had to have  periodontal work (particularly gum grafts due to over brushing) this is literally the perfect brush. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Soft, good ol fashioned straight bristles clean teeth and gums gently! Been looking for this type of brush for a long time. This is it!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I have sensitive teeth and gums and this brush doesn&#x27;t irritate my mouth at all. Its very soft and gentle and its angled perfectly to get in hard to reach spaces. Its the best toothbrush I ever owned!</li>
    <li> The head is very small like a child&#x27;s toothbrush. I also feel like my teeth aren&#x27;t getting clean. After using for a few days my teeth feel grimy. I think it is TOO soft. For someone with extremely sensitive gums this may be their only option but I&#x27;m not in that camp so I&#x27;ll go back to a regular soft bristle toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush, but this price is outrageous!  Even the most expensive store in our small town is cheaper than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Bristles splay too soon.</li>
    <li> Love this tooth brush!  Great design and feel.</li>
    <li> Great product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent for those with sensitive gums. It brushes very smoothly and softly with almost no pressure. I recommend this :)</li>
    <li> I am always on the look out for extra soft bristled tooth brushes as I have terrible recession and I&#x27;m only 36.  These are the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve found so far.  The bristles are like little angel wings against my sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> It works fine enough, but the head is WAY too small. Like the size of a child&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too soft and the handle is too flexable, so I don&#x27;t feel like I;m acomplishing anything at all.</li>
    <li> Please be aware that this toothbrush has a very small head. It is more for children or small mouthed adults.</li>
    <li> I like this one! It&#x27;s not super long, which I am a fan of.</li>
    <li> Works well for me. Couldn&#x27;t find this at the local stores anywhere. The bristles are soft, and the head is small enough to fit comfortably between teeth and cheek.</li>
    <li> I initially loved these toothbrushes as I have very sensitive teeth and gums, and welcomed the extreme softness of the brush, especially when combined with the flexibility of the handle. However, after the little tufts of bristles began falling out into my mouth while brushing my teeth, I quickly changed my opinion. Until the design is improved upon, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush and will be ordering it again. The extra soft bristles and small size of the toothbrush head are good for me. I was looking for a toothbrush with flexibility to prevent brushing too hard and found it.</li>
    <li> Based on the product label and reviews, I thought this would be very soft.  But it is not.  I also have the Nimbus microfine toothbrush, which is way much softer.  So, if you have a tendency to brush too hard and need a really soft toothbrush, go with the Nimbus.</li>
    <li> This is great for sensitive or damage teeth.</li>
    <li> This brush is fine for small or hard to reach areas in your mouth.  The head is about half the size of a traditional brush and is very soft. I have not used it long enough to see any changes in enamel of my teeth. If it was a bit harder it would rate 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was searching around for a very soft toothbrush and decided to give this one a try.  WOW.  I&#x27;m totally sold.  It is very soft.  Makes the regular &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes seem very hard.  One unexpected thing I noticed is that after I brush with this toothbrush, less food is left between my teeth.  I&#x27;m a daily flosser and it has significantly reduced my work.</li>
    <li> I really love this toothbrush. Really soft on my gum, dose not cause any bleeding on my gum due to its super super softbrush threads&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to maneuver around the tooth. Really happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes.  I just wish they were still available as auto delivery.</li>
    <li> I am loving this toothbrush! It is very soft, but still cleans, and the head is nice and flexible. My new favorite toothbrush! I will be reordering when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush I have ever used. Reaches corners remove plaque, never felt so clean before. Flexible gel pad grip gives a good grip in hand.</li>
    <li> Would buy again and probably will!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from a local market.  I hope Amazon will continue to stock this item. It works for my needs. I have a small mouth and sensitive teeth. I was pleased to see Amazon carry this item.  It has been difficult for me to find appropriate toothbrushes.  Chain stores usually only stock items for \\&quot;average\\&quot; people.  I am an Amazon customer because frequently this is the only place I can find the items I need.</li>
    <li> very smooth , so it is very good for the sensitive teeth. I had pain when using some other brush teeth but with this I finally found the solution. Thank you Germany!</li>
    <li> Softest toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used! I was very pleased with this product, especially compared to others that claim to be &amp;#34;very soft.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Ok...true confessions...we use this for our dog! It is soft and the long handle lets us get well back along her molars. They last quite a while but we keep a spare handy for when it finally begins to fail, which is expected as to clean the chewing surfaces of her teeth we let her chew on it while we rotate it so it cleans top and bottom. Speaks well for the construction of this toothbrush don&#x27;t you think?</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive gums - this tooth brush works the best that I have tried.  Amazon is the only place where I can find it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is overpriced under the brand name, and low quality for the price! The head is so tiny it took me twice as long to feel like my teeth were clean. I was trying it to help with my receding gumlines, but came on Amazon and bought one called Dr. Collins Perio which I like much better. Don&#x27;t waste your hard-earned money on this tiny piece of junk.</li>
    <li> love this. Grateful for the opportunity to get this online. Makes teeth whiter and removes plaque</li>
    <li> Great product , arrived quickly, good for sensitive teeth, small mouths and when needing to protect the enamel on your teeth, particularly if your a hard brusher.</li>
    <li> great brush and works well</li>
    <li> This brush is great. It gets the job done without being harsh. I also find I brush my teeth more carefully as the soft bristles and flexible brush allows me to single out each tooth more easily.</li>
    <li> I like the bristle brush and handle.  They are designed perfectly for brushing.</li>
    <li> It is not the very soft one I wanted. It is ok. I purchased a much softer one in a store before but can&#x27;t find it. Thought ordering one night be softer but alas....</li>
    <li> I love this new tootbrush. Its not too big or too small, its extra soft bristles are soft on the teeth. Its lightweight. I love the way it feels when i brush. I have never had a good brush like this one. Ive tried so many toothbrushes and was always disappointed and spent so much money.  This brush is perfect. I will recommend it to everyone i know. I thought i would never find a good toothbrush. I even tried electric brushes that were so noisy and rough on my teeth. I commend whoever made this product. Its excellent.  Im telling you try it its very good. I actually enjoy brushing my teeth. Its really wonderful.</li>
