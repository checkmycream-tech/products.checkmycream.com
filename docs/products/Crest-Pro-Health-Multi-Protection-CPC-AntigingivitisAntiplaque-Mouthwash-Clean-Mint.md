<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wish I had read the other reviews here (which is so unlike me). NOT a good value for the small size! Fool me once, shame on you...you ain&#x27;t gonna fool me again ;)</li>
    <li> This product is minty, cool and really works to keep my breath clean.  I&#x27;ve used numerous mouthwashes, and I like this product the best.  I like the taste.  It&#x27;s not a strong, antiseptic taste like other products.  When I use this mouthwash, my mouth and breath feels fresh for a long time after I use it.  I feel that it compliments the toothpaste and floss that I use before I use the mouthwash.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to chew gum  after using the product.  This is a product that I would like my family to use, as well.  I have found a mouthwash that I really like, and I don&#x27;t wish to switch to anything else.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Very good. I like the taste</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion from Crest and I love it.  It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and minty and it tastes great.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash for a few weeks now and I love the way it makes my teeth feel and freshens my breath. I must say I am not a fan of peppermint flavor, but this is refreshing and pleasant, it does not take my breath away as most peppermint products do. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed and the feeling lasts for most of the day. I would recommend this to anyone for use along side your daily tooth brushing.Although, I received a free sample, these opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> . Assumed I was buying the full size bottle since it cost as much. I&#x27;m going back to Walmart but I&#x27;ll buy a different product. Mouthwash that turns your teeth brown.  Sounds like a practical joke</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest products most of my life. I have tried other brands...but always come back to Crest. As a BzzAgent, I received a free bottle to try and the following is 100% my own opinions and viewpoints. I like the fact that it is alcohol free. The mint taste is strong - Altoid mint strong. But I like mint. Would also really like if there was a cinnamon flavor. Either way, swishing for maybe 30 seconds isn&#x27;t that long, but long enough to make my teeth feel cleaner hours later, even after eating and drinking. I have been using this product for a couple weeks now and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.  I wish I could give it negative stars.  This mouthwash caused brown stains on my lower teeth along the gum line for years.  I didn&#x27;t know what was causing it and had to visit my dental hygienist 4 times a year to have the stains removed using a cavitron.  I worked with my hygienist to try and determine the cause but she couldn&#x27;t figure to out either.  Started looking at Amazon to purchase all my hygiene needs and came across the reviews for this product.  I then realized that this product was the cause of this issue that had plagued me for several years.  I switched to Act and the stains haven&#x27;t come back.  I now visit my dental hygienist 2 times a year instead of 4.  My dental hygienist is thrilled that she doesn&#x27;t have to deal with constant staining.  I can&#x27;t believe Crest sells a product like this.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> This is a horrible value. The product is fine, but very small for the price. I did not pay attention when I ordered, but this is about a $1.99 size bottle. Picture looks big, but read very carefully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it has healed my gums, and made my teeth more stable. I put it on an interdent brush, and clean between my teeth, then rinse with it; it has worked wonders!</li>
    <li> crest is the only product that we use.  May seem strange to buy on line but due to surgery, I cannot drive at current time.  This is a good way to get what you need.</li>
    <li> I like how this mouthwash continues the good feeling of clean just after brushing and helps to extend the feeling of clean teeth for a long while.  And it helps to remove tiny bits that may be stuck after brushing.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive for such a small bottle.  Will buy it locally when I have transportation</li>
    <li> Used this product for the first time and really like it.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I was rather disappointed with.  No, not the product, but I thought I was buying a larger bottle than what I received!  It&#x27;s a little pricey for the size and fortunately I found the Crest Pro Rinse Cool Mint in a local store at a much more reasonable price and a LARGE bottle at that!</li>
    <li> I bought this product, and did read the small print in the back. I thought that the message saying it would cause stain on teeth meant that some white spots could appear on teeth. Then at some point I noticed light browning in between my bottom teeth. After looking this up on internet, I realized that this mouthwash can be the cause. I have stopped using the product and just planned a visit to the dentist to have it checked out. I read that it&#x27;s not permanent, I hope so!</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading as i thought it was a bigger size especially for the price. Makes no sense to return it since i have to pay a restocking fee.</li>
    <li> Getting Great dentist visits &amp; I&#x27;m a tooth grinder!  I needed a small travel bottle &amp; this was it!  About 5&amp;#34;H to 4&amp;#34;W.&lt;br /&gt;  A great help for anticonvulsant side effects on teeth &amp; gums too!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy its really small and for the same price you can get a bigger one in cvs</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned, the photo is very misleading. You&#x27;re purchasing a small bottle for a big bottle price. The husband loves the product, and so do I -- but after noticing reviews about people getting stains from it we may consider switching brands.</li>
    <li> The picture is a little deceiving, but to be fair I should have read the description a little closer. It&#x27;s very small and I definitely paid too much. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> much smaller than I was expecting</li>
    <li> This is a small bottle. Just so you know. But I can&#x27;t leave without this mouthwash. It tastes good and gives me that &#x27;fresh&#x27; feeling I&#x27;ve grown used to after a meal. It was shipped right away and in good packaging. Five stars.</li>
