    <li> This my absolute favorite shampoo!!! You will notice healthier hair in about a week. I went from dull and frizzy to vibrant and healthy</li>
    <li> I am a guy and I care about how i look and smell. This shampoo is fantastic for making your hair feel very clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite detox shampoo. It smells good and makes my hair so very soft after I use it. I only use it a few times per month, so it will last me well over a year!! Another great hit for ColorProof!!</li>
    <li> This is the best clarifying shampoo I have ever found.  It can be used often.  It does not strip color.  It does not dry your hair out like many clarifying shampoos do.  Smells great.  I love it and it has really helped my hair.  Made my hair softer and very shiny.</li>
    <li> Anybody hear Use this product for Weed? I need a shampoo to clean weed toxins out of my hair. any suggestions. Is this one worth buying for it or no</li>
    <li> My hair has suffered from city hard water (please know I am Asian for hair texture reference).  I tried Malibu and it didn&#x27;t work half as well as this shampoo.  And I had to use very little!  It may cost a bit more but definitely does the trick and is worth every penny!  I love it!!</li>

    <li> This shampoo is much less expensive than it seems.  I&#x27;ve never had to use so little to get such great results.  Hair comes out super shiny and helps color last.  I swim and want to get rid of the chlorine effects.  This does it.  My daughter, who has well water, recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> If you are in and out of a pool, this is a must have. It not only gets rid of product residue but also pool chemicals; this stuff is great. I don&#x27;t use it too often, but when I do, it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Ladies, try this Shampoo.  I use it once a week and then condidtion my hair with Color Proof Deep Quench, it does amazing things with your hair.  These products are great</li>
    <li> Definitely love this product and will purchase again</li>
    <li> Wish this came in larger size (maybe it does, I haven&#x27;t really looked around).  Worked perfect this past summer, our entire family used it after swimming.  Great scent.</li>
    <li> Am still on the hunt for the perfect shampoo/conditioner combo for my Dry ends/oily scalp hair. Was hoping this shampoo along with the Colorcare SuperRich Moisture Conditioner (as my stylist suggested) would do the trick but unfortunately it fell short. My hair was very greasy about only about 12 hours and felt like it had product buildup. Surprising since this is supposed to be a detox Shampoo. I do not color my hair and never have, but my stylist still recommended this to me. My hunt continues...</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews, I decided to purchase it. The final result was not what I expected. The hair does not feel clean at all. I have tried the clarifying shampoo from Simply Smooth and it works much better than this one.</li>
    <li> I like to give my hair a switch sometimes.</li>
    <li> Typically when I try new hair products it is difficult to tell if there is anything different.  I found that with this product my hair felt cleaner and softer.  I have long coarse curly hair and currently have the Brazilian keratin blowout.  This did not adversely affect this treatment and my hair felt clean.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!!  It keeps our hair clean and free of the green color that comes from swimming in the pool during summer months. Love the smell too!</li>
    <li> Great for swimmers hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have fine hair and it leaves it shiny and smooth.  I use all of the different ColorProof Shampoos...Volume, Smoothing and the Detox.</li>
