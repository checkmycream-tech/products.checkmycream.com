      <li>Excellent product and value from this seller.</li>
      <li>The build-upon quality is awesome,</li>
      <li>The paste has a very pleasant smell too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Good job Onesta!</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>It holds my hair great and no greasy feeling at all.</li>
      <li>Has a great look.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Great product and really good price.  </li>
      <li>Yeah it was a good price,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>Then I pinch at the ends that sort of flip out to give more definition.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite styling product and one</li>
      <li>Hi, I love the play paste.</li>
      <li>Smells more like cucumber/melon.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this holds it throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.</li>
      <li>My hair is very soft and it has good movement.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>My hairstylist showed me to really rub this on your fingers, getting it warm, before working it into your hair.</li>
      <li>Product itself works fabulous and hold my hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;Word</li>
      <li>Soft with good pliable hold.</li>
      <li>(No product really gets rid of all of them, but so many mainstream brands remain 100%</li>
      <li>The scent is fantastic, and it smells fresh all day.</li>
      <li>pH is different (deodorant, etc), everyone has different hair types (shampoo, conditioner, styling, etc), and this product is the best I have found for my needs.</li>
      <li>All-in-all a great product for straight, short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
      <li>to seller is to buy decent stickers that easily peel off and don&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
      <li>etc!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started moving everything I could over to equal in quality products and companies that try to limit these harmful additives, for my own health and out of support.</li>
      <li>He likes the paste very much.</li>
      <li>have known enough hair care &amp; beauty specialists in my life to understand how many harmful chemicals we humans now ritualistically put on our bodies.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>wow-you can really style your hair with this.</li>
      <li>The product container is much flatter than what&#x27;s shown on site.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>and I try not to use too much.</li>
      <li>This is hands down my favorite.</li>
      <li>know the price is a bit high</li>
      <li>This makes an enormous difference, giving my hair just the right amount of separation and lift.</li>
      <li>For an 88 year old woman, that is not a trivial thing.</li>
      <li>Yet it still has a somewhat natural feel.</li>
      <li>I have been using this paste for my wild hair and it keeps it under control.</li>
      <li>was old and not as creamy.</li>
      <li>It does not make my hair sticky and it does look natural.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, washes out instantly and looks natural.  </li>
      <li>I have relatively short, thick hair and this product makes it easy to style in whatever way</li>
      <li>If it looks dried up when you open the container the first time, just rub it a little and the paste will look and feel right.</li>
      <li>This helps me style my new shorter style and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my super thin hair as long as I don&#x27;t use too much.</li>

<li> a year ago I went from having long hair to a short shag type haircut.</li>
<li> but it goes a long way and at amazon it is cheaper than to buy it from my hairdresser.</li>
<li> He has a short hair cut and the paste lets him style his hair without making it look greasy or wet.</li>
<li> The only other styling product I use occasionally is a natural clay by Neuma for really messy look days.</li>
<li> have you thought about what your body absorbs/ingests EVERY SINGLE DAY from your \\&quot;enhanced\\&quot; soap, chemical toothpaste, aluminum based antiperspirant, sulfate &amp; paraben ridden shampoo/conditioner, shaving gel, perfumes, styling cremes, cosmetics, etc etc etc etc</li>
<li> It is not greasy and only a little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> Been through about half a dozen different brands.</li>
<li> A little product is enough.</li>
<li> Not much paste is needed to style.</li>
<li> Arrived on time and as expected</li>
<li> I am not sure until I talk to my friend who recommended this paste, but it appears to be old and dried out.</li>
<li> If untouched it may have that slightly shiny styled look, but I run my hands through all day and it looks dry while holding its shape.</li>
<li> I have a hair style that looks really sharp when I piece it out.</li>
<li> Something  is not right with the product I  received.  </li>
<li> The paste isn&#x27;t sticky or oily and it won&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
<li> too.&lt;br /&gt; I briskly rub a small amount of paste on my fingers and palms to melt it, and just sort of scrunch my hands through dry hair.</li>
<li> Can slightly touch-up during day if needed, but I wear my hair slightly messy</li>
<li> too- start with a little and build as needed.</li>
<li> Bought Play Paste and found it heavy and greasy.</li>
<li> My boyfriend uses this everyday, and one jar lasts him almost a year.</li>
<li> Paste is sitting under my vanity- waste of money for me.</li>
<li> Just the thought of what women subject themselves to in this society makes me quite sad.</li>
<li> Wonder if it is a knockoff product :(</li>

    <li> Excellent product and value from this seller. Ordered 3 of these and they all had big UPC stickers on the sides which took a lot of scraping and goo removal. The product container is much flatter than what&#x27;s shown on site. Product itself works fabulous and hold my hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;Word to seller is to buy decent stickers that easily peel off and don&#x27;t leave residue. All-in-all a great product for straight, short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> Something  is not right with the product I  received.  It has a chemical smell and does not apply like it should.  Wonder if it is a knockoff product :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying this paste for over a year now for my teenage son. He likes the paste very much. He has a short hair cut and the paste lets him style his hair without making it look greasy or wet. The paste has a very pleasant smell too.&lt;br /&gt;I know the price is a bit high but it goes a long way and at amazon it is cheaper than to buy it from my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> I have relatively short, thick hair and this product makes it easy to style in whatever way I like.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, washes out instantly and looks natural.  I wish I had found this product years ago.</li>
    <li> Used Pureology Texture Twist until the price went from $23 to $70 on Amazon. I have a hair style that looks really sharp when I piece it out. Bought Play Paste and found it heavy and greasy. Went to salon and tried Redken Rewind and I love it. Onesta Play Paste is sitting under my vanity- waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected</li>
    <li> I have been using this paste for my wild hair and it keeps it under control. It is not greasy and only a little bit goes a long way. It does not make my hair sticky and it does look natural.</li>
    <li> Soft with good pliable hold. My hair doesn&#x27;t look punk, but it stays in place. The build-upon quality is awesome, too- start with a little and build as needed.</li>
    <li> I am not sure until I talk to my friend who recommended this paste, but it appears to be old and dried out.</li>
    <li> Great product and really good price.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist showed me to really rub this on your fingers, getting it warm, before working it into your hair. Has a great look. It provides definition but isn&#x27;t ever greasy looking. A little product is enough. If it looks dried up when you open the container the first time, just rub it a little and the paste will look and feel right.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this everyday, and one jar lasts him almost a year. Not much paste is needed to style. The scent is fantastic, and it smells fresh all day.</li>
    <li> The product works, but the scent is  not the same as the Onesta play paste purchased through my stylist.  Smells more like cucumber/melon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have fine hair and this holds it throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.</li>
    <li> My Mom wears a CPAP mask at night. When she wakes up in the morning, her hair on the left side is all out of wack and cannot be put back in line without washing it again. For an 88 year old woman, that is not a trivial thing. Now I use this play paste on the left side of her hair and she wakes up with every hair in line. Yet it still has a somewhat natural feel. Good job Onesta!</li>
    <li> wow-you can really style your hair with this.</li>
    <li> Hi, I love the play paste. The Onesta play paste I received from you was old and not as creamy. Yeah it was a good price,&lt;br /&gt;but I didn&#x27;t know I was sacrificing product quality for that price.</li>
    <li> This helps me style my new shorter style and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my super thin hair as long as I don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> Notes: Hair never looks greasy. Holds style for entire day. If untouched it may have that slightly shiny styled look, but I run my hands through all day and it looks dry while holding its shape. Can slightly touch-up during day if needed, but I wear my hair slightly messy so isn&#x27;t a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have known enough hair care &amp; beauty specialists in my life to understand how many harmful chemicals we humans now ritualistically put on our bodies. Just the thought of what women subject themselves to in this society makes me quite sad. Cancer rates on the rise?.. have you thought about what your body absorbs/ingests EVERY SINGLE DAY from your \\&quot;enhanced\\&quot; soap, chemical toothpaste, aluminum based antiperspirant, sulfate &amp; paraben ridden shampoo/conditioner, shaving gel, perfumes, styling cremes, cosmetics, etc etc etc etc etc!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started moving everything I could over to equal in quality products and companies that try to limit these harmful additives, for my own health and out of support. (No product really gets rid of all of them, but so many mainstream brands remain 100% toxic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s pH is different (deodorant, etc), everyone has different hair types (shampoo, conditioner, styling, etc), and this product is the best I have found for my needs. I have literally tried dozens, and this one truly excels. The only other styling product I use occasionally is a natural clay by Neuma for really messy look days.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair really short (I&#x27;m a woman who has worn shoulder length hair or longer all her life). I really like this product. It holds my hair great and no greasy feeling at all. Only think is that it only last me one month and I try not to use too much.</li>
    <li> Works great. Been through about half a dozen different brands. This is hands down my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite styling product and one I definitely won&#x27;t be without.&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago I went from having long hair to a short shag type haircut. My stylist recommended this paste. This makes an enormous difference, giving my hair just the right amount of separation and lift. It adds a bit of shine too.&lt;br /&gt; I briskly rub a small amount of paste on my fingers and palms to melt it, and just sort of scrunch my hands through dry hair. Then I pinch at the ends that sort of flip out to give more definition. The paste isn&#x27;t sticky or oily and it won&#x27;t weigh hair down. My hair is very soft and it has good movement.&lt;br /&gt;A tiny amount of this goes a long way. A tub lasts for several months.</li>
