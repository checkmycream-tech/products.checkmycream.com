      <li>If you have a lot of &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; spots, this is a good concealer to cancel those out.</li>
      <li>I would recommend, it is a good concealer, it just didn&#x27;t provide the coverage I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Even if I put a good amount of foundation on.</li>
      <li>For the affordable price that has, I think it is a good product.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a good orange corrector</li>

      <li>very pleased...</li>
      <li>The product has a good texture, is creamy and very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>I was searching for a corrector that would work for my hyper pigmentation, I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>highly recommended !!!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product</li>
      <li>AMAZING as Jaclyn Hill says &amp;</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>This has been amazing product.</li>
      <li>For my skin tone, I find that a peach or much lighter orange color works best for canceling out my blueish under eyes circles.  </li>
      <li>but I could not repeat her methods at home on my own</li>
      <li>The color is nice.</li>
      <li>I have to be honest.</li>
      <li>I am editing my review because  i have found this to be the absolute best concealer that&lt;br /&gt;i have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I got my first jar and FELL IN LOVE with everything about this awesome product</li>
      <li>Works okay, but not as I would have liked.  </li>
      <li>Honestly just using a primer with the Lancome concealer looks a lot better than with this under it.</li>
      <li>But I have learned a lighter hand is needed, I use it to counteract the blue/dark circles under my eyes, with a nice top coat of foundation or powder they all but disappear.</li>
      <li>This is a great color correcting concealer if you use it right.</li>
      <li>I would recommend makeup forever color corrector palette, its creamy and very light in texture.</li>
      <li>Makes a huge difference!</li>
      <li>maybe I need to have more patience</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t notice it when I put another concealer on top.</li>
      <li>Perfect for putting under your regular concealer since it helps even out the darkness under your eyes!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>The product is ok, IF you like a pound of makeup on top of it to cover it so you don&#x27;t look like the Cheetos Tiger</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used better.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wish i could of got two when i order it i just love it!!</li>
    <li> The product is a little dry and cakey.  It is better if you mix a little facial moisturizer with it.</li>
    <li> The orange one cancels out darkness around the mouth and eyes. I love it</li>
    <li> Great product, pigmented to cover those dark trouble areas before foundation</li>
    <li> This is the best color corrector I have used. I have tried so many erase paste, MAC, bobby brown and a bunch of others.....this works the best. The best part is a fraction of the cost of the other more expensive products Ive wasted money on. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this color in stores so I ordered it online. I use this orange color corrector quite often &amp; it is very pigmented! It lasts all day &amp; does not rub off. I am already a fan of Nyx cosmetics anyway, but buying this has made me love them even more.</li>
    <li> I want to love this product because it is so cheap, but no matter what I layer on top or bottom, the consistency is so terribly thick, that you can&#x27;t spread it out and have an even application there. I would not recommend and would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Gives you a really good coverage! Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> If I&#x27;ve had a particularly long week and my eyes are dark, I will wear NYX Concealer underneath my concealer that matches my skin tone. It works to cover the dark circles but if you don&#x27;t blend it well or put on too much, you will look like you have a tan or used too much bronzer under your eyes.  Also, you need to use a primer first to fill in the wrinkles or they will just be highlighted.  Also, use a concealer brush and tap it on.  If you use your fingers you will just move it around and stretch your eyes. Also, it tends to be drying. I use it with a dab of moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as MAC&#x27;s corrector except it costs less and doesn&#x27;t have all those extra useless creams that comes in that palette. Coverage is fantastic, and can apply concealer over top with no problem.</li>
    <li> I wear clay 2 in Iman an Caramel in Revlon, this concealer gives me a light coverage my dark spots are still kind of visible.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok very dry. I had to mixed with another concealer. Will not recommend for olive skinned people. It does cover dark spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got this in the shade orange to neutralize my under eyes dark circles, however it&#x27;s not creamy enough to blend into my skin. It just cakes up on top of my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this concealer after looking at the reviews on utube and im glad I did. I only have one eye with a dark circle under it and it was driving me crazy. I was using mac concealer alone which covered but did not give me the total coverage i was looking for. I purchased this concealer and it cancels out the purplish color and i put my mac concealer on top of my powder and it looks fantastic. I will be puchasing more of this :)</li>
    <li> This quickly became a must have product in my beauty kit as soon as I realized how well it works. Works so well that I even bought a couple of extra ones to put in my backpack and purse so I am never without one. Tried applying this with my finger, a brush, and a qtip. For me patting it on lightly with my finger worked the best then following it with a bit of foundation. Fast, easy, and no more dark undereye circles ; )</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to cover dark discolorations per the advice of a makeup artist, this product did not blend easily and was difficult to place properly but it does cover dark spots and when you go over that with foundation looks quite good.</li>
    <li> Has a creamy texture that i love. But it&#x27;s too bright for me or maybe it&#x27;s because i need to use less? I have medium skintone.</li>
    <li> At first, i thought this was silly but after watching a tutorial by Carli Bybel, i just had to try this! I ordered one but i had 2 in the box so i guess it was a gift:) this is perfect for bridal makeup to make the bride bright and beautiful:)</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a color correcting concealer and sadly I did not have a good experience with this product.  I have very fair skin - my foundation shade is almost always the lightest available.  For starters, this concealer is quite dark.  I cannot stress enough how little of this product you need; a little goes a LONG way and it is highly pigmented.  But a very thin layer of this still managed to show through my foundation and setting powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation I use is Estee Lauder Double Wear in the shade \\&quot;Bone\\&quot;.  It is a medium to full coverage foundation, so I expected it to cover up the orange completely.  It did cover up most of the orange, but it didn&#x27;t look natural under my foundation at all.  There was definitely an orange tint showing through, so I added another layer of foundation on top.  This extra step also did not improve things much and the coloring was very unnatural.  I made the mistake of trying this out during my makeup routine before work and had to go to work and school afterwards with my botched makeup.  It was very embarrassing and only drew attention to my problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to emphasize again that I used a very thin layer of this concealer, but it is extremely dark and bright on my very pale skin. I don&#x27;t recommend this for porcelain/fair skin tones at all.  I believe this would be much better on medium to darker skin tones.  I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 because it is a very long-wearing concealer and with the very tiny amount you need it is an excellent value.  This lasted all day on me, even though this was one occasion where I wish it hadn&#x27;t lol.</li>
    <li> I was a little doubtful, but it actually conceals dark eye circles :-).  Not bad for just a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 orange tinted under eye correctors desperately trying to get to this product. It was unavailable for over a month! When I finally got my hands on it, I could barely hold down my excitement. I received this in the mail yesterday &amp; used it this morning for the first time. I hate to say I expected way more.. I saw multiple YouTube videos of girls using this right in front of me, and watching their dark circles just completely vanish. This offered just a LITTLE bit more coverage than all of the other orange tinted correctors I&#x27;ve been using. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, but I just expected better. I will still continue to use this product, only because i hear it helps when your regular (yellow based) concealer starts to wear off during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just add, I applied this after a good eye cream application, and put my foundation &amp; regular concealer over it (the way you are supposed to use this product)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Works better than the expensive brand name corrector</li>
    <li> This is the perfect corrector for my skin tone! It covers up my dark brown - almost black under eye circles and neutralizes them very well. Before this corrector, every concealer just ended up looking gray against my black under eye circles, but this works wonderfully to neutralize it. It&#x27;s pretty creamy but not greasy. It dries to a mostly matte finish but needs to be set with powder (whether you use another concealer with it or not). I even use it on my pigmented lips to even them out before applying lipsticks or on dark spots. It comes off brighter than it looks in the picture, but if used with a light hand, it looks peachy-orange and it can be built up to full-on orange. Give this product a try if you have the same skin issues that I did - you will love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this based on a youtuber recommendation..it&#x27;s ok I guess but I&#x27;m not sure if it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It seems a bit dark...it doesn&#x27;t add a shadow to my under eye area but still.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know what i was expecting but I&#x27;m not completely amazed by this, maybe its not right for my skin tone because I don&#x27;t see excellent results.  BUT the texture is great and a little goes a long way. Another thing is that the container isn&#x27;t really that big but i guess i paid for the brand name.</li>
    <li> This concealer is a dark orange (like a pumpkin) that is very visible once applied to the under eye area.  It doesn&#x27;t meld seamlessly at all.  I used a very small eyeliner brush to apply it and tried to concentrate on the bluest areas under my eyes.  But it made no difference at all because it was hard to blend and didn&#x27;t stay put.  In fact, I had to use ANOTHER skin toned product over it because it definitely looked very orange against my light skin.  However, the bluish circles were still visible underneath.  What a waste of money!!  I will try another application technique tomorrow, using a sponge, and maybe that will improve the outcome.  Using two concealers looks very obvious and they get cakey very quickly, even when set with powder.  It was about 15 minutes before I saw the ugly results (in a regular mirror no less).  I&#x27;m afraid to use too much of this for just this reason.  It definitely requires a skin colored product on top.  This defeats the purpose.  I want to conceal my bluish circles, not draw attention to the lines and creases under my eyes as a consequence of using this product. I think this concealer is really for darker skin tones. It look Halloween orange on me, which is not a good look at all.  This is the second NYX concealer I&#x27;ve tried.  I used the medium full coverage formula, which looks a bit orange, but it caked like all the rest I&#x27;ve tried.  Right now, I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it and will continue my search for the right product.</li>
    <li> its cool, it shipped when it was suppose to</li>
    <li> This product works wonder. The coverage lasts all day. It really conceals my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is the bomb.com</li>
    <li> was the producuto I wanted and arrive on time</li>
    <li> Helped a lot in neutralizing the dark circles under my eyes. Make sure not to apply too much or the orange color will be hard to conceal. Overall great for the price and Nyx never really disappoints me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!! I only use a little to cover my dark circles. I blend it with a brush or beauty blender. I put concealer next and set it with a powder right away, so I won&#x27;t get creasing. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I finally tried this product that someone recommend to me. It is good for the price. I use it in combination with my MAC concealer.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sitll on the fence just received and I&#x27;m not too impressed to stop looking for that perfect concealer...I&#x27;ll try dermablend next.  This doesn&#x27;t cover my dark circles no matter how much I put on.  I&#x27;ll try other tricks that was suggested on youtube but thus far I don&#x27;t really care for the product its not easy to place under my eyes with the tap the tap with your finger motion.  I&#x27;m still new to this maybe I need to have more patience so I&#x27;ll keep with it until I receive the dermablend</li>
    <li> Used for the first time today &amp; I love it!!!! Totally canceled out any blue or purple under my eyes. I set it with a powder &amp; it concealed my dark circles all day long. This is going to be my holy grail! Would buy 100 more times.</li>
    <li> I Like it it&#x27;s works well</li>
    <li> excellent concealer for blemishes and dark circles IF you are brown skinned. Actually works as a colour corrects so you need to apply your normal flesh toned concealer or foundation on top. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is not easy to get out of the container or apply to skin. Once applied it is not easy to spread. It is not a creamy texture like other NYX concealers. I usually have to use a drop of oil on my finger to get enough product on my finger and to apply (somewhat smoothly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side - the color is exactly as advertised and has no problem dominating the darkest of dark circles. For that I am grateful, however blending and creasing (because the product is so dry) makes it difficult to enjoy the demise of dark circles and spots. I&#x27;ve started to blend it with the yellow nyx concealer (love it&#x27;s texture) and moving in the right direction now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, product does what it says but requires handling by someone that knows how to layer and blend makeup. I haven&#x27;t given up on this product and still glad I&#x27;ve got it.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for myself to conceal dark under eye circles, but it seems to show up to orange-y underneath my foundation ( I am AA). I found out my mom started using it and (she&#x27;s a couple of shades lighter than) she loves it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I just discovered this product.  If you have dark skin and dark circles, this is the best product you&#x27;ll ever use to counteract that.  It&#x27;s truly FULL-COVERAGE and I will never use another product to conceal ever!!!</li>
    <li> Dry with relatively no coverage on its&#x27; own. But if I layer it under my foundation, it brightens the dark circles under my eyes really well as an accompaniment to the foundation.</li>
    <li> I have some issues with hyperpigmentation. I am African- American with a medium brown skin tone. I wear Graftobian foundation in Winter Wheat or Deep Xanthe blended with a lighter shade. I have dark brown marks and using this I can achieve a flawless face. I highly recommend it!  Remember to blend, or you&#x27;ll just look like you have orange patches your face.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I needed it to use as color corrector for my extreme dark circles. Its very dry and does not glide well under the dark circle. I even primed my dark circles and then applied it but still it did not go well. When you try to warm it up, its still very dry. I would recommend makeup forever color corrector palette, its creamy and very light in texture.</li>
    <li> This is an okay color corrector. You still have to use concealer over it. The problem is that my dark circles are so bad this isn&#x27;t even helping it. It is supposed to compliment all skin tones cause it is orange but I would imagine it compliments darker tones better.</li>
    <li> This particular concealer can freak you out when you put it on, but works to offset any dark circles.  A very light touch is required - it&#x27;s an absolute MUST - and then use a flesh toned concealer or foundation over it and your dark circles are gone.  Also works on redness in the face due to hyper pigmentation, or acne scarring, but I can&#x27;t stress enough, a gentle light hand is required so as to not over do it.</li>
    <li> I sort of stupidly bought this hoping it would drown out my dark dark circles. I am very pale and if I put even the slightest bit too much, my skin looks orange. Even if I put a good amount of foundation on.</li>
    <li> After looking at the online reviews for this product, I was a bit skeptical of it would work for me due to the abundance of reviews from darker skin toned ladies saying how well it worked for them. I&#x27;m about as fair as they come (check out the pic and you&#x27;ll see what I mean 😝) I was pleasantly surprised to see how it perfectly covered my blue dark circles when I applied regular concealer on top. Tonight I had a date outside in the summer heat and when I looked in the mirror after 5 hours the dark circles were still perfectly covered!!! It&#x27;s amazing to look wide awake at 10:00 pm (took the pic then) after doing makeup early morning. Highly recommend this product to all lovely ladies with different skin colors :) you won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this product. (Even my boyfriend could tell I looked more awake Haha)</li>
    <li> I like it though it is very small. A little is very effective. Goes on smooth with my Ecotools concealer brush. Trustworthy seller.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a different result; however product came quickly and was in tact, thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This works great.. this corrects the dark circles.. kinda drying, however i apply right after my eye cream. I prep &amp; prime my face with all my lotions &amp; potions , I  prime under my eyes with urban decay , nyx orange corrector , then nyx yellow high def concealer , last step I use Bareminerals to set it. I have a Jeniffer Lopez complexion, I use bareminerals Medium beige for foundation.This combo works!! I have tried so many concealers$$$$ this is the best, it doesn&#x27;t cake or set in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> does a great job at concealing my dark undereye circles, thumbs up !!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product . quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I am so bummed this did not work for me.  Just cleaning. Unfortunately, this shade is too dark for my fair skin.  For reference I wear the following foundation shades: MAC &#x3D; NC15; EM  (semi-matte) &#x3D; Fairly Light; Rimmel Lasting Finish 25 hour &#x3D; #100 Ivory; Revlon ColorStay &#x3D; #150 Buff; Avon Smooth Minerals Pressed Foundation &#x3D; T04 Nude; EL Double Wear &#x3D; Desert Beige; Jane Iredale &#x3D; pressed base in Bisque; Lumene CC Cream &#x3D; Fair; Smashbox Camera Ready CC &#x3D; Fair .  Orange supposed to counteract bluish under eye circles.  This shade orange however is too dark to work with my skin tone.  It is creamy and very pigmented so for some of the darker skin tone, it may work wonders.  Also, I found the need to definitely set this with a setting powder or it ended up in my crease lines.  However, I have found that to be true  for almost every under eye concealer I have ever tried so I can&#x27;t hold that against this particular product. For my skin tone, I find that a peach or much lighter orange color works best for canceling out my blueish under eyes circles.  I am giving this three stars because of the level of pigment in the ease of blendability of this product. It&#x27;s not this product&#x27;s fault it doesn&#x27;t work for my particular skin tone.  Also the price can&#x27;t be beat &#x3D;  I do not feel the least bit guilty about purchasing to try out.  Hope this helps :-)</li>
    <li> I chose a title that might attract other women out there suffering with melasma, which is a skin condition that causes dark pigmentation on the face. Often times this pigmentation is most troublesome for women when it appears on the upper lip, because it looks a lot like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and that&#x27;s just not cool. I have melasma on many parts of my face, including my upper lip and it can be embarrassing, let me tell ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest research has been about how to cover up the melasma with make-up. The very best advice I have found so far is to cover the area with a salmon-like color before blending and covering with your regular concealer and foundation. I started by simply using a lip pencil in a pinkish shade and it worked really well. I still use this method from time to time, but then I found this cover up and it really works well to help conceal that pigment over my lip. A huge plus that it also helps conceal my under eye darkness :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons for this product. It does what its says it does, it&#x27;s easily blendable, and you get a lot for the price. If used everyday, it would still last me for several months.</li>
    <li> This has been amazing product. It is creamy and not cakey. As soon as it is applied I can see a difference. Then when I apply concealer and foundation, my dark circles are non-existent.  I have searched high end and low end products and this is either sold out or this particular color is not available. This is a hard product to find so thank goodness for Amazon. Arrived on time, is as described and plan to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was initially excited about this concealer. The pot I received seemed to be slightly dry. I didn&#x27;t think much of it until I developed a rash under my eyes and on my lids. I&#x27;m still not sure if it&#x27;s the particular item I received, or it&#x27;s just an allergy, or if it&#x27;s even the product that&#x27;s causing this. Might just be a case of bad timing or one bad egg.</li>
    <li> it left an orange residue and t doesn&#x27;t give me coverage at all, this is a waste of money for any one who is of color</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely cover dark circles, but works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I have come to find that nothing is truly full coverage. It&#x27;s inexpensive so it was worth a shot for me. I&#x27;ve tried everything to cover my melasma (skin discoloration / dark spots). A makeup artist told me that orange would neutralize my spots so that I could cover them but so far nothing has really worked for me. Before this I tried a highly pigmented orange powder (blush) from MAC and the makeup artist was able to make it work somewhat but I could not repeat her methods at home on my own ( felt like I was turning into an oompa loompa!). I ordered this because it was so inexpensive compared to the MAC powder and much lighter in color. It&#x27;s not greasy but it is creamy and can result in an uneven cakey look especially when you&#x27;re layering foundation and powder on top of it. I tried several levels of applying this from a very thin layer to a bit more in my attempts to cover my spots but this wasn&#x27;t any better than other things I&#x27;ve tried. If this works for you,, great! But for me, it&#x27;s not a winner.</li>
    <li> Seems slightly dry and hard to put on but definitely stays</li>
    <li> It Goes on smooth and the color will conceal dark circles but it creases on the skin within 2 hours.</li>
    <li> I have a nightmare of a situation when it comes to the under-eye area. I mean small eyes, puffy under-bags and panda like dark circles. So basically a lot to deal with. I have medium skin tone with neutral undertones or rather slight yellow undertones (Indian asian skin). I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the bobby brown concealers (which BTW are the best but for the price) and thought of trying the NYX one. The colour was a bit too orange for my skin tone so I bought a lighter shade of regular concealer (Maybelline age rewind in the shade neutralizer) and since the maybelline one has a rotate and colour release mechanism with a sponge head applicator,  I just swirl the sponge head in the NYX concealer jar and use it. This gives me two advantages: a) I get the perfect shade for my skin tone and b) this helps me with easy application as the NYX concealer is a tad dry and does not blend that well and also creases on me when used alone. Overall, I would prefer spending the extra money on the bobby brown concealers and so may not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles from the ninth level of hell and very fair skin. A killer combo, for sure. This helps to bump up my other under eye corrector but it isn&#x27;t completely effective. I have fine lines under my eyes and the creasing isn&#x27;t bad... Just be sure to moisturize and apply a little face primer, as it can be a little drying. I&#x27;ll keep using this until I find something that works better.</li>
    <li> It stays longer and I use this to blend with my other concealer. It balances the color and erases my dark undereye circles.</li>
    <li> I am not really sure how to describe this, I dont regret buying this but I dont think its that great.....</li>
    <li> Good coverage but a bit cacky.</li>
    <li> If you have hyper pigmentation, this is amazing! It is such a good value for the price, and it covers every single dark spot on your face like nothing else can. this is gold in paste form.</li>
    <li> It did exactly what it said it would do, covered up and brighten any dark areas on my skin. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Too tick and won&#x27;t blend in.</li>
    <li> Not really full coverage -- a little too sheer but that&#x27;s good since I&#x27;m using the orange color as base for covering up blue-tinted under-eye shadows. But it might not work in the other colors as a single concealer. Good value for the amount.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even need concealer after applying this.</li>
    <li> This protect isn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; coverage. I intended on using this as a corrector for any blue spots, mustaches, and beard that my face produces. I apply this generously over my mustache, beard, and any other blue toned spots I can find before my foundation. Through out the day I noticed my make up getting patchy, separated, and cakey. As a makeup artist, that&#x27;s the one thing you should always avoid. Not too sure what else I should do with this, but I can always try again before making up my mind completely. Other than my experience so far, it&#x27;s not really impressive . . .</li>
    <li> I have dark blue, genetic, under eye circles because the skin there is so thin. I have seriously had them since I was a baby...I looked a bit like a zombie baby (eep)...and it has only gotten worse over the years. I have VERY pale, skin so it makes the blue even more noticeable. Nothing has ever come close to covering them up...Until now! I really like this concealer, it makes my cursed under eye circles way less of an eye sore (get my pun there?). It is easy to pat on, blend, and control. I am very thankful to have found this product and would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside? I am 26 years old, so I do not yet have many wrinkles. Even considering this, it still cakes a little bit and accentuates every crease.  I don&#x27;t really care though. It&#x27;s better than looking like the living dead.</li>
    <li> Orange concealer worked miracles on my brown skin. Found a few YouTube videos to guide me through the application process. This is a keeper!!!</li>
    <li> The orange concealer is a bright orange. Its very thick. When I touch my face is feels greasy. I read that the orange concealer gets rid of the dark purple eye circles but for me, mine look exactly the same. I see no difference. Maybe I need to try a different combo of makeup.</li>
    <li> My daughter says it is much wonderful</li>
    <li> This product is too dark and red on medium-light Asian skin. A yellow concealer would have been better. It looks passable once some yellow powder was brushed over it.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer. It neutralizes the gray dark cast of 5&#x27;o clock shadow and other dark spots. Love it</li>
    <li> Product came quick and lives up to the hype. Good quality and did what I needed it to do. I will infidelity order again with such an awesome price and fast delivery why wouldnt I.</li>
    <li> this is a nice thick creamy concealer. Perfect for putting under your regular concealer since it helps even out the darkness under your eyes! The only issue I have is that it&#x27;s not sealed at all! So make sure you really look at the surface of the concealer when you buy it! Make sure it&#x27;s totally smooth and doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s gross stuff on it.</li>
    <li> Finally got it and cant wait to use it</li>
    <li> Works great on my dark circles. I mix it with a skin toned concealer to get excellent coverage with a minimal amount of product. Just a dab blended into my undereye works all day.</li>
    <li> It works, but I feel like there isn&#x27;t much difference between using this and using just my normal skin-toned concealer. However, I&#x27;ve decided to be a bit nicer in my star rating since I&#x27;ve given up trying to cover my dark circles. Nothing really works on me except a good, long 9 hour sleep, but that&#x27;s pretty hard to come by too.</li>
    <li> OMG this product is awesome!!!!! I always want to try this concealer and it does not disappoint me!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have extreme terrible dark circle and it works for concealing them!!! But yes of course it is impossible for me to have my dark circles concealed like 100%,  this orange concealer helps me to conceal like 85% which i am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;So i usually put my undereye primer on first, then i apply this orange concealer on only the dark circle area, then I put my regular Nars creamy concealer in custard on top of it and blend it out as uausl. Then that it is, it just works out awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product and I highly recommend this to people who have extreme terrible dark circle like me lol.</li>
    <li> I have really dark skin so it&#x27;s hard to find a concealer to cover up the dark circle around my eyes while still looking natural. I love this product, it works for me and I don&#x27;t have to apply so much. A little goes a long way. The only thing is that if I put too much you can see the orange but blending covers that up. I hope this product works for you like it did for me.</li>
    <li> Orange works very well to help cover my sun spots.</li>
    <li> I got this in the orange color, and while it really neutralizes under eye darkness, it can be a little thick under the eyes and settle into fine lines. I make sure to get my eyes very hydrated with an eye cream before use and this really makes a difference, and the coverage is worth it</li>
    <li> If you have dark circles under your eyes, or on those days of the month, this little jar is magic.  when I first used it I though it wasn&#x27;t going to work, its a very dark orange. But one you put your normal concealer on top, bye bye dark circles. A little bit goes a long way. Highly tinted. Works!</li>
    <li> I am medium skin toned and I have DARK circles under my eyes, I pretty much look like I got popped in the eye all the time. No concealer has ever conquered the deep dark purple and blue hollows under my eyes from top quality to wet n wild, nothing worked. And then I found out about this orange concealer. ... dude... seriously.... AMAZING as Jaclyn Hill says &amp;#34;this gives me life&amp;#34; a sweep of alarmingly orange concealer top off with regular concealer and WHAMO!! Well rested younger looking perfection.  Will definitely repurchase for sure. This stuff is magical.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me because it did not provide enough coverage for my under eye circles. What did work for me if the VS Camouflage palette.</li>
    <li> I have been in search of an orange concealer to cover the dark circles under my eyes.  My search is finally over!  And I cannot believe I spent so much money for other products only to spend barely $5 for the one that sticks!  NYX Orange Concealer is really creamy and easy to apply.  It is pretty shocking once applied under the eyes, as it is really bright orange.  But I got the idea from watching MakeupGeek on YouTube and Marlena is so right!  Once you apply your foundation over the orange concealer, it blends in with your foundation and you no longer see the shocking orange or your dark circles!  It&#x27;s an amazing product and I hope Amazon never stops carrying it!</li>
    <li> Very good concealer. The coverage is not too thick or thin.</li>
    <li> Not really pigmented for my dark skin. Listening  to the raves on you tube, this wasn&#x27;t worth the hype or $$.</li>
    <li> I am pretty disappointed with this concealer. I purchased it to cancel out the dark circles underneath my eyes. While it does cancel out the darkness under the eye, it does not blend well on the skin. It does not have a smooth finish whether you apply moisturizer first or not. It looks \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; and enhances the creases/lines under the eye. It would probably look fine in photographs, but in person, someone would definitely notice that you have a makeup malfunction in the eye area. Please believe the other reviews by Aurora Borealis and C Fancher Chic Chelsy---they are telling the truth about this concealer. I will just bite the bullet and spend a little more on Makeup Forever&#x27;s 5 camouflage cream palette.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other NYX products and loved them, however this was just too orange. I used my Lancome concealer over it and you could still see it. I could deal with it if it actually covered the dark circles. It didn&#x27;t give me enough coverage. Honestly just using a primer with the Lancome concealer looks a lot better than with this under it.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest. When I first used this, I hated it. But I have learned a lighter hand is needed, I use it to counteract the blue/dark circles under my eyes, with a nice top coat of foundation or powder they all but disappear. I like my look to be seamless which is why I add the foundation. This is a great product, and the price is amazing. To all my dark circled sisters and brothers, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> i have no idea why i didnt discovered this amazing product its latterly problem solver for ur dark spots and under eye</li>
    <li> Way to orange. To dark cant cover it with my own foundation</li>
    <li> This product really works at concealing dark undereye circles. You use this corrector first, then apply your concealer on top of this product. The orange color really camouflages the purple bluish discoloration under the eyes. Especially good to cover tear trough circles. Love this item...</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I have been a faithful Amazon customer for yrs. I loved them up until today. So I tried to buy this product along with 3 other products that was not sold by Amazon but sold by outside vendors. When I went to checkout, I couldn&#x27;t purchase this item I could only do an \\&quot;add on\\&quot; and would have to purchase 25 dollars of products that is sold by Amazon in order to purchase this!! I called thinking this must be some mistake but it was correct. In order to purchase this, I had to spend more money!!! Reminded you, I was already spending $70.00 on other products. But because is wasn&#x27;t sold by Amazon, it didn&#x27;t count. I was told the reason for this is because this is such a good price for the product. It&#x27;s the exact same price on NYX website!!! Amazon will no longer get my money...account cancelled!!! I have to spend 30 dollars to get a 5 dollar concealer??!! How dumb is that!!!</li>
    <li> this corrector is thick and like stage makeup, you put it on and when you go to put you foundation on it looks crazy waste of $6.00 fond another way ladies this is not it.</li>
    <li> Too thick to spread.  I am trying to work with it..</li>
    <li> No better than traditional concealer for me. Waste of $$.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an orange color corrector for a long time and couldn&#x27;t seem to find it without it being in a palette with a bunch of other colors I didn&#x27;t need.  My sister introduced me to this brand though some of the lip glosses and the contour and highlight powder.  I&#x27;m still getting used to using this but so far I like it.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to crease under my eye and goes on smoothly.  It also blends out pretty easily.  Since this product seemed to work well I ordered the green one as well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the orange colour, I put this on top of my primer and then the foundation will eliminate the bright orange colour</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to cover my blueish dark undereye cirles and it worked wonders!  Does what the high end concealers do for cheap, 10 stars***********</li>
    <li> I wanted a salmon-based concealer to hide my dark circles, so i thought this would help. NOPE. just made it waaay to orange. When I put my foundation over it, it seeps into random wrinkles and looked worse than I did before. It stays on all day, but the color is not something you want to have stay on all day.</li>
    <li> I tried mixing it with beige concealer but its too orange and doesn´t work for me. I will stick with mac pro long wear concealer</li>
    <li> I like this product! It really helps to remove or lighten my dark circles. Just make sure to put a nude concealer on top of the orange concealer.</li>
    <li> This product does work as far as concealing but I would not use this if you have fine lines or acne. it definitely makes them stand out and will crease. also i would not recommend for those with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this product. This works really well for covering dark circles. I have a pecan complexion and this orange concealer works perfectly for my skin tone. A little goes a long way. I will definitely repurchase this is the future.</li>
    <li> I love it!  it covered my dark eye circles.  There is a lot in the container great price. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good orange corrector cuz I have dark circles.  i use this orange corrector everyday I love it! I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Best color corrector ever. Blends perfect and I dont have to use a lot of product so the jar is over a year old and i am still months from needing a new one.</li>
    <li> Very good for dark circle concealing. I bought the light color one and mix light and orange to get my skin color. It is good for pimple coverage as well.</li>
    <li> Great for dark circles. I use this under my eyes first and then I use a regular light concealer on top and then set with a under eye powder so it stays in place.  It does amazing at keeping my eyes dark circle free. And making me look more awake throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have terrible under eye circles, was a bit hesitant to try this, but im glad i did. coverage is great, it&#x27;s kind of hard to work with but i would try submerging it in a bowl with hot water until product is a bit of a liquid consitency. other than that, i love it. i use it daily</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I have very dark sun damage spots on my skin. I apply this orange concealor then place my skin toned concealor on top and viola, its gone. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am surprised with this canceler , very small but really working, the color is bright orange great for covering dark purple or blue discoloration , just use a brush to blend it and , then use transparent powder over it and after the actual color foundation and works perfect, my foundation was water based but working as well over it .. I like that the color is bright as it work better lighting the dark areas . highly recommended !!!!!! for under foundation canceler</li>
    <li> If you have a lot of &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; spots, this is a good concealer to cancel those out. You get a lot of product in this little jar. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is thick and quite orange. I thought it&#x27;d work good on my veins under my eyes but it just doesn&#x27;t blend well. I find myself mixing it with other concealers and moisturizes and still not getting the look I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is the first concealer I have tried that has really hid my under eye dark circles. It doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job. I will be purchasing this concealer again.</li>
    <li> Great product...with manipulation covered my dark under eye circles...I looked refreshed and well rested...very pleased...a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I have tried many products that promise to conceal or camouflage dark under-eye circles. I have really bad dark circles which are definitely hereditary in my case. This is the only one that completely conceals my dark under-eye circles. (I use it under a concealer to even out the color.) I will be buying this product again and I have recommended it to my sister and to others.</li>
    <li> The color is nice. Hides pretty well. Pretty useful to aid in tattoo coverage too when combining with other products. However, It is not long lasting. If you use this to hide your bags, you will see creases as the day goes by.</li>
    <li> If I could give this no stars I would. Its true you only need a smidge to &#x27;cover&#x27; up or in my case make it look like I spray tanned under my eyes, this color is horrible for under eyes, so I had my circles and an orange tan look! Yucky! Sooo glad only cost five dollars, still a huge waste.</li>
    <li> I use this concealer to help with my color correction before I apply my normal concealer and it works great!! Item arrived as decribed and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> I am editing my review because  i have found this to be the absolute best concealer that&lt;br /&gt;i have ever tried. I corrects my color imperfections and is GREAT under makeup. It is completely undetectable. When placed in my blush area and highlighter areas, it enhances the appearance of the make-up. I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a bunch of other brands and this is definitely the best.</li>
    <li> I couldnt afford mac&#x27;s orange concealer, so i opted for this one. I viewed many orange concealer &#x27;how to&#x27;s&#x27; on youtube first.  i needed something to cover my dark spots around my mouth because of pimples through my beard and mustouche. im of south pacific asian decent.  i splot this on my whole chin and moustash area thin layer all over then heavier amounts on the truly dark spots such as the corners or my mouth and individual pimple scars, let it dry then add my foundation as if the orange wasnt even then, there is no white cast/gray area in the spots that im so dark when i did not have orange concealer underneath.  great buy! thank you.</li>
    <li> I like it, I would love it if it were a little creamier. A little hard to spread, but covers very well.</li>
    <li> I bought the items to conceal dark undereye circles and it does to some degree, but you have to use a bit of it; and it tends to need retouching throughout the day to which I have to constantly wipe away the excess when it settles into my &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; lines.</li>
    <li> I researched concealing dark eye circles and they said to use an orange-tinted base.  Well this is a miracle!  I put this on and then follow with a light concealer.  I am soooooooo pleased with the results.  This will be in my makeup kit forever!</li>
    <li> Orange concealer is hard to find so I was happy when I found this one and the price is right too. The color is exactly what I was looking for, but the consistency is no good. This thing is so hard, it&#x27;s impossible to apply. Especially for the delicate eye area. I can not use it.</li>
    <li> i bought the orange concealer for  dark circles under my eyes... didn&#x27;t like the consistency kinda cakey and didn&#x27;t give much coverage..... thought it a waste of money</li>
    <li> good cover but too dry</li>
    <li> As the reviews previously said that an orange colour would work to cancel out the discolouration under the eyes, it did but was actually orange; what you see is what you get. The only reason I don&#x27;t like the product is due to the colour which I know it completely my fault but the texture is quite drying so you&#x27;ll need to pat it under your eyes and very pigmented.</li>
    <li> I use this instead of a more expensive MAC orange corrector. Works great and lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> i have real bad dark spots and acne scars. I am African American (with dark skin) and the Orange negates the purple ish undertones of the dark marks. This is amazing!</li>
    <li> Bought for a African American female friend, there aren&#x27;t many concealers to cover spots for women of color!  I learned about this from Destiny Godley&#x27;s you tube video!</li>
    <li> Works great! I have really dark circles, and I&#x27;ve tried so many things to help conceal/get rid of them. After reading the reviews for this, I decided to give it a try. It IS super pigmented, so a little goes a long way. But if you use concealer over it, the dark circles disappear! I will definitely be buying more of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Best product I have tried for dark under eye circles.  I was hesitant as I have light to light medium skin tone with neutral undertones.  I have light brown hair.  I figured it would be too dark.  But it is PERFECT.  It works better than high end products I have purchased.  I have started purchasing other products from this make up line and have been extremely impressed by the quality and price.</li>
    <li> Sadly, I find this too dark to blend properly and cover with foundation. It could be my technique or my foundation, but a lighter concealer in a salmon shade works far better for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried SO MANY other products in hopes of getting rid of my (DARK) circles under my eyes.All the OTHER products would end up looking obvious and a couple would Bleed through ending in a look that NO ONE WANTS!&lt;br /&gt; I came across a video on (YOUTUBE) for the (ORANGE NYX CONCEALER) and thought it was worth at least a try.I got my first jar and FELL IN LOVE with everything about this awesome product,It goes on like butter and does just what I wanted it to do.It is the best dark circle concealer I have ever tried.I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this product,it is truly the (BEST) at what it is intended for.&lt;br /&gt; All I can say to anyone reading this is that you owe it to yourself to at least try it.If you like myself struggle with the unwanted drama of under eye DARK circles/bags then this is the product for you...I give this product two thumbs \\&quot;WAY UP\\&quot;!!!</li>
    <li> actually I use it 1 time but it dose not suitable for my . Every spot I put the corrector on it become very dry and peeled I use many product to return my skin normal. But my sister use it nothing happens to her.</li>
    <li> It really does cover your dark circles. I will be purchasing this again! Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I was searching for a corrector that would work for my hyper pigmentation, I love this product! It helps cancel out the darkness around my eyes and mouth. All I do is put this on my problem spots with my finger to warm it up, because this formula is dry (not sure if its just mine), then I blend it out and put my normal concealer on with a brush and blend it out! It works better if you&#x27;re someone with a darker complexion... otherwise the orange can be to harsh.</li>
    <li> I purchased the orange concealer based on a Youtube review.  The woman has purple dark cirlcles under her eyes like me and the concealer appeared to work.  The concealer is super hard to rub in and I guess you have to put half of the jar under your eyes in order for the concealer to conceal.  I don&#x27;t recommend this concealer for purple dark circles even though orange is the color &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; say is best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O.</li>
    <li> I have really dark circles, like TRULY and I wanted a orange corrector so I decided to get this one because the price, mostly and because I was really tired of putting so concealer under my eyes. After using it a couple of times, it did sort of worked but I cannot get the orange tint to blend around my eyes and above my cheeks. I can&#x27;t even cover it with concealer. It is really apparent and I have a medium-olive skintone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sort of sucks about it the most is that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of coverage, alone... maybe about 20% of my dark circles were covered but it&#x27;s not enough when you have really dark circles. With another concealer, it did covered about 70% of my dark circles which is good but the orange tint is so strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I have to try with a more fuller coverage foundation and see if it will covered the orange completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the concealer has a cream-to-powder finish.. so it&#x27;s not really bad but I have dry eyes so it&#x27;s a little noticeable when it&#x27;s by itself but I don&#x27;t notice it when I put another concealer on top.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores. Very affordable. Great for undereye color correction! Highly recommend this to people with severe undereye discoloration. Makes a huge difference! 👍</li>
    <li> This is a great color correcting concealer if you use it right. It covers up dark marks, hyper-pigmentation, acne scarring PIH, etc. For the price it blends pretty decently. It helps if you blend with your fingers as it does need a bit of warming up but I don&#x27;t mind that. This is a great affordable option to more expensive color correcting concealers or big bulky concealer palettes if you only want one color. The orange is better for darker skin tones but it will work on lighter ones as well if used properly. Also, a little bit of this product goes a long way and it is a pretty full coverage concealer.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Bought as a present for my mom and her rating is a 5. Good price and works wonders.</li>
    <li> This is horrible!!!! It does not do the job...you just transform yourself to a monster! It creases a lot!</li>
    <li> it didnt come melted thank goodness because thats what i was afraid of. i got it in the expected amount of time.</li>
    <li> Works okay, but not as I would have liked.  Works as well as any other concealer I already had. I was hoping that the staying power of the coverage would be better, but it&#x27;s not.  I would recommend, it is a good concealer, it just didn&#x27;t provide the coverage I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great color for concealing dark spots.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I will not by it again as I dont use it much because I dont like the color on my skin tone and that it make my pores look bigger than I have ever noticed them before.</li>
    <li> Hides my dark circles so well... I love this under my concealer</li>
    <li> when covering under eye circles, i wanted to go with something with an orange undertone, i didn&#x27;t think it would be quite so orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;none the less, i used it on myself using my same makeup routine and it DID cover my under eye circles - but it was much to orange for my natural skin stone.  I had the right idea though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did however use this on one on a friend who was much darker in skin stone, african american skin toned, and it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product glides on gently and smoothly, it doesn&#x27;t run and IT IS NOT GREASY! having a non greasy product makes for less creasing in the makeup.  love it, im going to try a different shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as per the handler, my product arrived much sooner than anticipated! love it.</li>
    <li> Full coverage... not. It didn&#x27;t work for me, I have dark circles under my eyes and it didn&#x27;t conceal them as I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better.  The product is ok, IF you like a pound of makeup on top of it to cover it so you don&#x27;t look like the Cheetos Tiger</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking at this product for a while. I finally bought it because I had horrible dark circles under my eyes. When I came, I used it for a couple days.. You don&#x27;t need much.. It definitely does its job. I don&#x27;t have a prob with dark circles anymore but if I do I&#x27;ll have this product to use again. You could also use it as a base. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it was really thick.. Hard to get out at first.</li>
    <li> Not full coverage and not a concealer but an awesome color corrector. Love the consistency and very easy to use and blend, love it and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Best value for the price! Hard to find orange or yellow orange concealer  at this price. Somewhat thick and dry. Needs an emollient added for smooth application. I mix orange and yellow together with primer.</li>
    <li> Love this! Conceals well. I wish there was a bigger jar available here for this.</li>
    <li> It is not the quality of the product that caused me to rate it low but rather my expectation was that it would cancel out the darkness under my eyes and it does not do so.  Toooooo orange.</li>
    <li> I think this product is a little too dark for my needs. I am Nars Shade Syracuese and despite blending this still shows through my foundation as orange. I was hoping that it would cancel out some discolouration but perhaps I just need to work with it a little more.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help conceal my dark circles it didn&#x27;t exactly work as I expected but it did help</li>
    <li> This is EXTREMELY orange. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have fairly dark skin</li>
    <li> I read reviews and purchased this item thinking it would be great! well it&#x27;s not! it does not cover the black circles under my eyes.. I was super disappointed when it did not work for me....</li>
    <li> I mix a little of this with a skin color concealer.  The peach hint of color really helps my DARK lines.  Found this idea on YouTube, but with a concealer that is peachy color.  I purchased this and thought of the blending together and really works well.</li>
    <li> The product has a good texture, is creamy and very easy to apply. The coverage for the dark bags under the eyes is acceptable enough; I have a type of skin wich is very difficult to define as any Latin and mixed person, something like \\&quot;light olive\\&quot;, but with well pronounced dark circles...blueish.  I complement it with the corrector in the beige tone and it definitively does the work. For the affordable price that has, I think it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at cancelling out darkness like its suppose to do. It creases under the eyes though, so i wouldnt recommend it for that.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product, would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my husband&#x27;s cousin who is a makeup artist. I have dark spots and did not know how to conceal them. She told me I needed to correct the dark spots before concealing them. A little goes a long way! This was the best money I have ever spent! I get many compliments on my face and how clear it looks!</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my dark eye circles....... I will buy one more jar for the price it&#x27;s a steal ..</li>
    <li> Love it. awesome coverage.</li>
    <li> this stuff is miraculous! to say I love it is an understatement...THIS IS THE BEST CONCEALER I HAVE EVER USED...heard about orange concealer through a friend and it has better coverage than the others and is highly recommended by ME for others....EVERYBODY NEEDS CONCEALER IT GETS RID OF THAT RACCOON EYE...FOR SURE I JUST ORDERED 2 MORE!!!!</li>
