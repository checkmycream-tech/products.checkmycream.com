      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and am extremely satisfied with the results.  </li>
      <li>but i thought a good idea to get him interested</li>
      <li>was great as it was shipped direct.</li>
      <li>Awesome product that works amazingly, not light and watery - not</li>
      <li>then apply some Age Fighter and it rubs in soooo well and feels fantastic.</li>
      <li>Definitely light weight but some what noticable.</li>
      <li>i like the fact that it also as a sunblock which is important.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy at all and goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, without noticeable opaque/white appearance.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena in May 2015 significantly changed the ingredients of this product.</li>
      <li>greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this product for 2 years and get compliments on my skin all the time - hard to find so stock up, but otherwise has been awesome.</li>
      <li>for men need to care for themselves inside and out especially if, they want to look good for the ladies.</li>
      <li>My husband really likes this cream, and has asked for more for his 67th birthday.  </li>
      <li>It is costly as it is a name brand but much cheaper than many others.  </li>
      <li>and it really felt great, and worked just as good as all the ridiculous stuff the doctor gave me.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll quickly understand this one is not that expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how he would react to the product name (Age Fighter Moisturizer) but after making a few jokes, he has been good about using it and has even decided that he likes the way it makes his face feel.</li>
      <li>I hope that it is available again real soon!</li>
      <li>Be aware!</li>
      <li>it worked ok, but then i discovered Neutrogena for Sensitive Skin.</li>
      <li>It is not oily and is easily absorbed by your skin.  </li>
      <li>keeps skin soft and better looking.</li>
      <li>So far, I love this, and it seems to me it is also reducing blemishes I have always had from shaving.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that I sweat a lot if I apply directly out of the shower, but overall is the best I have tried.</li>
      <li>After trying several products, finally found one that I am happy with.</li>
      <li>very much thank you.</li>
      <li>Pay the extra for a better product.</li>
      <li>It is much better than the standard moisturizer one can find in the stores.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3641089/Pictures/IMG_20150328_093623.jpg They even add the words &amp;#34;non greasy&amp;#34; in obvious awareness of needing to counteract the fact that it is now more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
      <li>Thanks god!</li>
      <li>My first reaction still holds up, it&#x27;s greasy and doesn&#x27;t work well as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My first reaction was I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>I purchased locally and was able to get much cheaper through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why all the positive reviews on this.</li>
      <li>First time I used it I thought it was very greasy.</li>
      <li>I was using Aloe Vera, the pure stuff</li>
      <li>Little or no scent, a nice moisturizer</li>
      <li>I really feel that this product helps keep my skin looking youthful and helps protect against sun damage during the summertime here in Houston, TX.</li>
      <li>I decided to use it for a week before I really made a decision.</li>
      <li>Seller was fast, product seems to be working well.</li>
      <li>Whether any of these so called \\&quot;age fighter&#x27; cremes/lotions work who really knows.  </li>
      <li>Leaves a very oily/greasy look&lt;</li>
      <li>Its also priced very well for the quality of this product.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the trick - run the shower on full blast very hot for 5 minutes with the door closed.</li>
      <li>I have tried other men&#x27;s face moisturizers and most have pailed in comparison.</li>
      <li>But my skin feels decent after using this.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My face has cleared up tremendously and i will use this product every day for as long as it exists.</li>
      <li>so when do you think you will order me a new one?</li>
      <li>is a comparison of the changes to this Neutrogena product (left, old / right, new)</li>
      <li>This product is not greasy, easily absorbed, and lasts for a long time.</li>
      <li>She used it like it was facial gold, stating that it was better than all the O/O products that I spent hundreds on!</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and expected results in no time.</li>
      <li>skin is sensitive</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 37 years old and no one thinks I&#x27;m that old.</li>
      <li>Really good item, but comes in a really small package (they need to do a bigger one).Mine was all used in less than a month...</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is essentially a completely different product, and the new formulation is not acceptable in my personal opinion.</li>
      <li>Like the old Neutrogena ads, I recommended having two different (moisturizer) products and alternating between them regularly so your body (skin) can have an occasional holiday...</li>
      <li>A little dab of cream goes a long way, and the product is well worth the investment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, without noticeable opaque/white appearance.  Little or no scent, a nice moisturizer although quite expensive.  Better than Nivea Q10 face lotion.</li>
    <li> Seller was fast, product seems to be working well. Only been using it a couple of weeks. It keeps my skin moist and I haven&#x27;t broken out with acne with it.  My shaving nicks seem to heal faster with little belmish or scar left.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> Use daily - not greasy.  Perfect for me!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. Reduces the signs of pores as well. However, its a lil greasy. Definitely light weight but some what noticable. In any case I will probably be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> It does an ok job.  Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I would hope.  But my skin feels decent after using this.  The SPF is an added bonus too.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good. Unlike other products, I have not had any skin irritation... a small amount goes a long way, it moisturizes well and it lasts for the day -- as should be expected. Like the old Neutrogena ads, I recommended having two different (moisturizer) products and alternating between them regularly so your body (skin) can have an occasional holiday...</li>
    <li> After using L&#x27;Oreal VitaLift for a couple of years I switched to this one for two reasons: (i) It has no smell and (ii) It is not as greasy; with L&#x27;oreal I knew I had to wait at least one hour before going out, otherwise I would risk looking like a grease face on the streets. So far, I love this, and it seems to me it is also reducing blemishes I have always had from shaving. Pricey? A little bit, but come on, it is your face!</li>
    <li> One of the few products I have used that doesn&#x27;t make me breakout on my face.  Whether any of these so called \\&quot;age fighter&#x27; cremes/lotions work who really knows.  It seems to keep the skin softer and looking better.  It is costly as it is a name brand but much cheaper than many others.  It was a little less costly to buy online and many places I shop do not carry this product so online was great as it was shipped direct.</li>
    <li> I see big improvement in my husbands skin, face looks and feels softer, the wrinkles around his eyes are diappearing.</li>
    <li> So i went to the dermatologist about my face - i get really dry skin and have some rosacea (redness). They prescribed 8 different medications - goopy, gloppy stuff that burned, all sorts of combinations that i had to apply morning and night....it worked ok, but then i discovered Neutrogena for Sensitive Skin. I started using it daily and it really felt great, and worked just as good as all the ridiculous stuff the doctor gave me. But then....nirvana....i found the Age Fighter. This is by far and away the best product i&#x27;ve ever used.   Here&#x27;s the trick - run the shower on full blast very hot for 5 minutes with the door closed. Go into the &#x27;steamed up&#x27; bathroom, and let your pores mellow out....then apply some Age Fighter and it rubs in soooo well and feels fantastic. My face has cleared up tremendously and i will use this product every day for as long as it exists. Thanks god!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 37 years old and no one thinks I&#x27;m that old. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years now and think this is the reason. No double-blind study, but I&#x27;m convinced enough that I use it every day. Expensive, but worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and am extremely satisfied with the results.  A little dab of cream goes a long way, and the product is well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> It is too bad this is so hard to find.  It is much better than the standard moisturizer one can find in the stores.  It is great for winter time and eventhough it is 1.4 ounces it lasts me about 3 months.</li>
    <li> I am the husband of account holder and have used this product. I purchased locally and was able to get much cheaper through Amazon. It works well for me and has helped my skin. Better than any mens skin products I have used and can afford.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this cream, and has asked for more for his 67th birthday.  He says it makes it easier for him to shave.  I hope that it is available again real soon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why all the positive reviews on this. This product looks like cottage cheese coming out of the container. It leaves for face greasy. Pay the extra for a better product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001E96NZM Neutrogena Men Age Fighter Face Moisturizer, 1.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)]] I bought this for my husband who is a construction worker and spends most of the day outdoors. Being concerned about what the elements are doing to his skin, I thought it would be a good choice. I wasn&#x27;t sure how he would react to the product name (Age Fighter Moisturizer) but after making a few jokes, he has been good about using it and has even decided that he likes the way it makes his face feel. The only drawback is that now I have to endure the repetitive question/joke \\&quot;Do I look younger now?!!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Men Age Fighter has been my  face moisturizer of choice for the last five years.  It is not oily and is easily absorbed by your skin.  i like the fact that it also as a sunblock which is important.  i use it once in the morning and again in the evening after washing up.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and expected results in no time.</li>
    <li> So this little gem happened to be for my wife...no really...about a year ago she found this product in my medicine cabinet and hijacked it...haven&#x27;t looked back since! She used it like it was facial gold, stating that it was better than all the O/O products that I spent hundreds on! HUNDREDS! I have been out of the country for a while and happened to come home for a visit and in her purse was this empty-squeezed-to-death tube of N.M.A.F.; I asked what gives...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She stated that she kept it in her purse because every place she goes she would try to find it; but to no avail. I said...\\&quot;Did you look online?\\&quot;...and so the story ends here, with a review and 5 stars for such a wonderful product. (By the way, I didn&#x27;t get to use it for more than 2 weeks before it was taken; I did like the way it made my face feel like a million bucks!</li>
    <li> my husband is not into creams or taking care of his skin but i thought a good idea to get him interested so i purchased him a nuetrogena face moisturizer to try out. he ran out the other day and asked me outright hey, im outta cream so when do you think you will order me a new one? great, accomplished my goal. for men need to care for themselves inside and out especially if, they want to look good for the ladies. so now not only women have an array of creams and lotions but men do as well. therefore, if you want your guy to look his best go for it.</li>
    <li> Be aware! Neutrogena in May 2015 significantly changed the ingredients of this product. Instead of 2 sunscreens it now has 4 different ones and the box now says &amp;#34;broad spectrum&amp;#34;. The downside is the product now:&lt;br /&gt;- Stings the skin&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a very oily/greasy look&lt;br /&gt;This is essentially a completely different product, and the new formulation is not acceptable in my personal opinion. The closest match to the ingredients of the original great product is this L&#x27;Oreal product: http://amzn.to/1AOwyCH&lt;br /&gt;Here is a comparison of the changes to this Neutrogena product (left, old / right, new): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3641089/Pictures/IMG_20150328_093623.jpg They even add the words &amp;#34;non greasy&amp;#34; in obvious awareness of needing to counteract the fact that it is now more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame.</li>
    <li> If you look at other solutions from Kiehls, Urth, etc&#x27;.. You&#x27;ll quickly understand this one is not that expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job, long term results? I&#x27;m not sure. But non does..&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive but I didn&#x27;t have any rush or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t rate 5 stars since it&#x27;s top quality, I gave 5 stars since it&#x27;s priced correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I liked better Kiehl&#x27;s \\&quot;Age Combat\\&quot; 75ml.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for me. IF there is hidden protection that I do not know of, now that&#x27;s a different story. I found this a sheer waste of money.</li>
    <li> I use this face moisturizer every day it keeps my face very smooth. I like it very much thank you.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer i&#x27;ve used so far. keeps skin soft and better looking. for the prize, it&#x27;s really a great catch!</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer but do not use if you get acne. It seemed to clog my pores after using for a week. Made my face break out terribly. It is nothing more than an expensive sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Really good item, but comes in a really small package (they need to do a bigger one).Mine was all used in less than a month...</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff thinking it would be a good moisturizer and help with the wrinkles. First time I used it I thought it was very greasy. My first reaction was I didn&#x27;t like it. I decided to use it for a week before I really made a decision. My first reaction still holds up, it&#x27;s greasy and doesn&#x27;t work well as a moisturizer. I was using Aloe Vera, the pure stuff and it works much better for me as a moisturizer and after I shave. I&#x27;s thinking about returning it because it also seems to promote break outs. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> After trying several products, finally found one that I am happy with. This product is not greasy, easily absorbed, and lasts for a long time. I also bought the reviving face wash since I am very happy with Neutrogena products. Its also priced very well for the quality of this product. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product that works amazingly, not light and watery - not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this product for 2 years and get compliments on my skin all the time - hard to find so stock up, but otherwise has been awesome. I have tried other men&#x27;s face moisturizers and most have pailed in comparison.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. I use this as a daily moisturizer in conjunction with my prescription lotion to moisturizer and protect my face from UV.  Not greasy at all and goes on smooth.  The only drawback is that I sweat a lot if I apply directly out of the shower, but overall is the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> I really feel that this product helps keep my skin looking youthful and helps protect against sun damage during the summertime here in Houston, TX. With the vitamins, Retinol and SPF15 that are included, those were the products I wanted in a face moisturizer. Must buy and I recommend the rapid Wrinkle night cream as well, even for men! Its all about prevention when it comes to skin especially on your face.</li>
