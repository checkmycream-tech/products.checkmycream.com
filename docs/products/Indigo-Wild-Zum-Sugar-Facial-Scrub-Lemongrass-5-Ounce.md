### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The price was excellent for the product!</li>
      <li>Since the oils are \\&quot;saponified\\&quot; it acts like a soap, and lathers perfectly.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful too.</li>
      <li>Very happy this product is on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>Good stuff!!</li>
      <li>Smells great, works great!</li>
      <li>This scrub does a great job.</li>
      <li>This feels good,  smells great, and cleans my skin well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First, how good is sugar as a scrub?  </li>
      <li>seems good for about 10 seconds, till it dissolves and no longer is abrasive.  </li>
      <li>Soooo good feeling.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>The smell is really good though.</li>
      <li>Love every bit of it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>It smells and feels amazing and is very enjoyable to use.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t get more notice!</li>
      <li>I use it as a mask sometimes with out any water and love the results!</li>
      <li>I keep it in the shower so its handy.</li>
      <li>However, it was listed honestly.</li>
      <li>It smells nice</li>
      <li>For that point alone, I think the product is lacking, would be nice if they offered a more abrasive scrub that does not dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>Smells great and worked really well!</li>
      <li>It keeps my face very smooth and allows moisturizers to penetrate better.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and it works well for me in the shower.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and  leaves you face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>There are many safe non dissolving abrasives like Walnut shells ground up.  </li>
      <li>Shipping could be better.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>The smell is fantastic and if you ever get some in your mouth it actually tastes great too!</li>
      <li>This is a great scrub, and I accidentally got some on my lips and it tastes good too ;) since it&#x27;s natural</li>
      <li>This product is excellent for a clean feeling in-between daily face washing.</li>
      <li>This scrub feels good on my face but the sugar dissolves too quickly and I have to grab more from the container to get more of the scrubbing action.  </li>
      <li>This is a great facial scrub.  </li>
      <li>I will buy it again, it made my face feels sooo smooth and clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>My face feels clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>LOVE this and the whole Zum line.</li>
      <li>I can just say it scrubs well, and my face feels clean and fresh afterwards.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep paying a little more for the better product!</li>
      <li>A nice smell of essential oil and the brown sugar just melts as you scrub it into your skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a lighter scrub that evaporates in the water pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>I really want to clean out my pores, I end up grabbing the table salt and using that to scrub my face with.  </li>
      <li>No issues with break outs or her skin becoming sensitive.</li>
      <li>I love the actual product, but something needs to be done about the container--it leaks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since purchased more and will continue to use this on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>they featured a sugar scrub like this, and mentioned the HUGE margins on sale price, such as cost x10 to retail...</li>
      <li>I am not expecting much when I get a chance to try it.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any real issues on my face to &amp;#34;clear up&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too gentle, I guess.</li>
      <li>which will make it a bit more appealing as you can use more without going broke :-(</li>
      <li>I still get the occasional zit and during my cycle I&#x27;m more prone to breaking out, but for the most part my skin is super smooth, even, soft, dry (but not overly dry, just not oily anymore), and clear so long as I have this stuff around.</li>
      <li>My thought is, eventually someone will sell these products at a more competitive price point and drive the price down...</li>
      <li>Better to have the jar opening sealed over, not just taping down the lid.</li>
      <li>The scrub was brand new, and arrived unopened with fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Zum Face Sugar Facial Scrub Lemongrass makes my face feel clean and very soft.</li>
      <li>It may be harsh, maybe I&#x27;m not suppose to use it as a face scrub, but it works better for me than this sugar scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am still searching for that magical face scrub that will remove clogged pores but isn&#x27;t too harsh.  </li>
      <li>I should have read the listing more carefully as I expected a larger jar.</li>
      <li>It is a failry small jar of facial scrub but is a really nice product.</li>
      <li>At 27 years old I still had acne issues.</li>
      <li>so the lather surprised me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sad because it has good reviews</li>
      <li>The walnut scrub is much rougher and can really scrub the dead skin off.  </li>
      <li>price is a bit much though, the actual Zum price is only $7.99!</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done scrubbing, my pores still aren&#x27;t clear, especially on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>True, it is not a large amount of product, but you need so little everytime you use it.  </li>

<li> , the price...this is a tiny jar, and regardless of where you order it, with shipping, $15 approx..and the jar doesn&#x27;t last long, the picture is deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;Recently on the network show Shark Tank</li>
<li> but it melts on your face long before it can actually have any exfoliating properties.</li>
<li> The product exfoliates extremely well due to the high amount of sugar granuals in it.</li>
<li> They sell Zum products in my local grocery store in Iowa and I finally decided to buy this scrub because its so hard to find a natural, affordable scrub.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s not fun getting a cup of gritty sugar in the mail.</li>
<li> At first I thought it was mold on the inside of the lid, but since the seal had already been previously broken it was just the ink that had rubbed off the protective seal that says &amp;#34;protective seal&amp;#34; all over it, when it got wet with the face scrub while shipping.</li>
<li> There was product spillage even though the lid was taped down.  </li>
<li> (typically I have to change every month or two).</li>
<li> It was delivered on time but it is a mess.</li>
<li> It looks a sugary mess.</li>
<li> I have natually oily facial skin, so I was concerned that cleaning my face with an oil based product my make the issue worse (this did not happen).</li>
<li> BUT hoping the protective seal isnt already broken next time....</li>
<li> I was going to try Lush&#x27;s \\&quot;ocean salt\\&quot; scrub but the artificial colors, parabens, and ridiculous price always held me back.</li>
<li> Recommendation: once you scoop out a small amount, drizel some water on the scrub before you put it on your face.  </li>
<li> I use it every time I shower, so at least once a day, sometimes twice.</li>
<li> During the summer it my face usually drys out real bad but this has kept the dry skin at bay.</li>
<li> I tried for years to find something for my troubled skin.</li>
<li> there&#x27;s nothing dangerous about it!</li>

    <li> It works well on my face and forehead. Love the smell and it works well for me in the shower.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  No issues with break outs or her skin becoming sensitive.</li>
    <li> LOVE this and the whole Zum line.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like this at all</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time but it is a mess. It looks a sugary mess. I am not expecting much when I get a chance to try it.</li>
    <li> This scrub does a great job. I keep it in the shower so its handy.It keeps my face very smooth and allows moisturizers to penetrate better.</li>
    <li> I will buy it again, it made my face feels sooo smooth and clean afterwards. BUT hoping the protective seal isnt already broken next time....At first I thought it was mold on the inside of the lid, but since the seal had already been previously broken it was just the ink that had rubbed off the protective seal that says &amp;#34;protective seal&amp;#34; all over it, when it got wet with the face scrub while shipping.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but it didn&#x27;t take away all the dirt on my face, especially in the nose area. It&#x27;s too gentle, I guess. The smell is really good though.</li>
    <li> Love every bit of it!</li>
    <li> Soooo good feeling.  This feels good,  smells great, and cleans my skin well.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Zum Face Sugar Facial Scrub Lemongrass makes my face feel clean and very soft. My face looks and feels much younger</li>
    <li> A nice smell of essential oil and the brown sugar just melts as you scrub it into your skin.  Shipping could be better.  There was product spillage even though the lid was taped down.  Better to have the jar opening sealed over, not just taping down the lid.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great!</li>
    <li> This is a great facial scrub.  True, it is not a large amount of product, but you need so little everytime you use it.  Recommendation: once you scoop out a small amount, drizel some water on the scrub before you put it on your face.  It softens the sugar and becomes a softer scrub once you rub it on your face.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for a clean feeling in-between daily face washing. The scrub was brand new, and arrived unopened with fast shipping. I would definitely purchase from this seller again. The price was excellent for the product!</li>
    <li> Smells great and worked really well!</li>
    <li> I am still searching for that magical face scrub that will remove clogged pores but isn&#x27;t too harsh.

It may be harsh, maybe I&#x27;m not suppose to use it as a face scrub, but it works better for me than this sugar scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt that I will purchase this again.  It&#x27;s sad because it has good reviews and I was hoping to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Sugar and essential oil is the basis of this product.&lt;br /&gt;First, how good is sugar as a scrub?  seems good for about 10 seconds, till it dissolves and no longer is abrasive.  So whats the point?  There are many safe non dissolving abrasives like Walnut shells ground up.  For that point alone, I think the product is lacking, would be nice if they offered a more abrasive scrub that does not dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;Then, the price...this is a tiny jar, and regardless of where you order it, with shipping, $15 approx..and the jar doesn&#x27;t last long, the picture is deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;Recently on the network show Shark Tank they featured a sugar scrub like this, and mentioned the HUGE margins on sale price, such as cost x10 to retail...now i see why.  My thought is, eventually someone will sell these products at a more competitive price point and drive the price down...which will make it a bit more appealing as you can use more without going broke :-(</li>
    <li> This is a great scrub, and I accidentally got some on my lips and it tastes good too ;) since it&#x27;s natural there&#x27;s nothing dangerous about it!</li>
    <li> I have natually oily facial skin, so I was concerned that cleaning my face with an oil based product my make the issue worse (this did not happen). The product exfoliates extremely well due to the high amount of sugar granuals in it. The smell is fantastic and if you ever get some in your mouth it actually tastes great too! I didn&#x27;t have any real issues on my face to &amp;#34;clear up&amp;#34; so I can&#x27;t report on that. I can just say it scrubs well, and my face feels clean and fresh afterwards. I&#x27;ve since purchased more and will continue to use this on a daily basis. Good stuff!!</li>
    <li> It smells nice but it melts on your face long before it can actually have any exfoliating properties. It&#x27;s basically just putting nice-smelling sugar on there. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve had problems with my skin since forever and have had to constantly change my face wash to try and help it. I&#x27;ve been using the Zum Face since Dec. 2012 and have not had to use anything else (typically I have to change every month or two). I use it as a mask sometimes with out any water and love the results! My face feels clean and refreshed. During the summer it my face usually drys out real bad but this has kept the dry skin at bay. The only thing I would suggest is to use this with the Zum Face Facial Cleanser, I&#x27;ve noticed it helps when I&#x27;m breaking out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t get more notice! I tried for years to find something for my troubled skin. At 27 years old I still had acne issues. I discovered this product a year ago and since then my acne has diminished dramatically! I still get the occasional zit and during my cycle I&#x27;m more prone to breaking out, but for the most part my skin is super smooth, even, soft, dry (but not overly dry, just not oily anymore), and clear so long as I have this stuff around. I use it every time I shower, so at least once a day, sometimes twice.</li>
    <li> They sell Zum products in my local grocery store in Iowa and I finally decided to buy this scrub because its so hard to find a natural, affordable scrub. I am so glad I did. It smells and feels amazing and is very enjoyable to use. Since the oils are \\&quot;saponified\\&quot; it acts like a soap, and lathers perfectly. I was imagining it to just be sugar suspended in regular oil so the lather surprised me. It smells wonderful too. Your skin will look radiant afterwards. I was going to try Lush&#x27;s \\&quot;ocean salt\\&quot; scrub but the artificial colors, parabens, and ridiculous price always held me back. Very happy this product is on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price is a bit much though, the actual Zum price is only $7.99!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in place of the walnut sugar scrub (also by Zum Face) because that one had gone up in price.  I figured it would be close to the same thing.  It&#x27;s NOT.  The walnut scrub is much rougher and can really scrub the dead skin off.  This is a lighter scrub that evaporates in the water pretty quickly.  It also left a bit of an oily residue that I didn&#x27;t get with the walnut scrub.  I&#x27;ll keep paying a little more for the better product!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I should have read the listing more carefully as I expected a larger jar. However, it was listed honestly. It is a failry small jar of facial scrub but is a really nice product. It has a pleasant smell and  leaves you face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> I love the actual product, but something needs to be done about the container--it leaks. And it&#x27;s not fun getting a cup of gritty sugar in the mail.</li>
