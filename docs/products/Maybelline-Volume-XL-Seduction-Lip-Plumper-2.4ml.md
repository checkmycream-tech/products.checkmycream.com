      <li>but i dont see a difference in my lips which is okay with me since i dont think i need plumper lips</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>This lip gloss has a great color, not too much though.</li>
      <li>everyone asks what im wearing i love</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I should&#x27;ve gotten something with more &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It has a nice taste and smell, as well as a wonderful slight tingling sensation.</li>
      <li>This not only is a great color lip gloss</li>
      <li>It was a cheap experiment.  </li>
      <li>Its a unique applicator tip for me, spongy like.  </li>
      <li>it doesnt quite burn as i expected but it looks great on the lips</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll able to control how much you want to apply.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to use it that much.</li>
      <li>I bought it in &amp;#34;Peach Flush&amp;#34; and it wasn&#x27;t really super special or anything, so</li>
      <li>You must turn the bottom to the right, then product comes out of the top, but too much at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Oh well, not bad at all, but not super great.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was cheap and a pretty spring time color.</li>
      <li>I am not crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>It feels very nice on and give a little tingly feeling</li>
      <li>It looks pretty when applied properly and does not come off easily which is great for long hours at the office.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to say something good about it, maybe nice packaging, but overall don&#x27;t waste your time or money on it.</li>
      <li>i love the peach tint on this, its not sticky at all super smooth and it tingles a little</li>
      <li>I expected this to kind of fill them in, if that makes sense.</li>
      <li>It did pretty well</li>
      <li>I threw it away after my first application.</li>
      <li>However if you are looking for a lip plumper that is really noticeable, this is not the product for you!</li>
      <li>,I applied it to my most boring and lifeless lips and automatically it made my lips look more attractive than I&#x27;ve ever seen them .</li>
      <li>I ordered peachy flush thinking it was going to be more pink; it comes out almost orange.</li>
      <li>The color is more of an orange then a pink.</li>
      <li>but it really does plump up your lips.  </li>
      <li>and it was really sticky.</li>
      <li>the tingling sensation left my lips feeling so soft and sexy</li>
      <li>If you can get past that I suppose it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that it actually plumps my lips, but it gives them an amazing shine and color that isn&#x27;t sticky like other lipglosses.</li>
      <li>I have pretty big lips already, but they have lines or wrinkles in them.</li>
      <li>It gives a little tingle a couple of minutes after you put t on it smells ok and you can feel your lip actually swell a bit.</li>
      <li>There is definitely a tingling feeling you get when you put this on, but I feel it didn&#x27;t really plump my lips.</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful, but it caused an allergic lip reaction :( .</li>
      <li>When you first put it on it is slightly sticky, then the heat from your lips warms it up an</li>

<li> The substance was overall a sticky mess that was a waste of time.</li>
<li> Works well for me as an under layer for other slightly darker colors.</li>
<li> but that is the only negative comment about the product.</li>
<li> It might make my lips ever so slightly bigger, but I have never experienced the tingling feeling that the other reviewers have noticed.</li>
<li> It works slightly to plumb, but it feels waxy after a little while.</li>
<li> It is a little sticky feeling but after a bit it seems to go away</li>
<li> Actually dried out my lips.</li>
<li> It tastes nasty but the color was nice</li>
<li> It is small nasty and l feel my lip ache and it not healthy we have to chose the healthy one</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t taste bad nor does it look bad, The shade is a pretty coral/peach.</li>
<li> ladies don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
<li> This lipgloss is not a great plumper by any means.</li>
<li> now I can strut my stuff knowing that no one is staring at my ugly lips</li>
<li> very disappointed.</li>
<li> boring lips thank you</li>
<li> If you accidently lick your lips you get an awful rubbing alcohol taste in your mouth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It tastes nasty but the color was nice</li>
    <li> It works slightly to plumb, but it feels waxy after a little while.</li>
    <li> When I apply this it makes my lips tingle almost to the point of a burning sensation. It&#x27;s very strange. If you can get past that I suppose it&#x27;s a nice product. I ordered peachy flush thinking it was going to be more pink; it comes out almost orange. When you rub it in it blends, but I was not expecting it to be that color.</li>
    <li> No noticable change in lip size. The color didn&#x27;t show well. Actually dried out my lips. The substance was overall a sticky mess that was a waste of time. I&#x27;d like to say something good about it, maybe nice packaging, but overall don&#x27;t waste your time or money on it.</li>
    <li> The color is to be desired. You can feel your lips tingling and the plumping working. The color is more of an orange then a pink.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheap and a pretty spring time color. The plumping factor was an added bonus. I have pretty big lips already, but they have lines or wrinkles in them. I expected this to kind of fill them in, if that makes sense. It did pretty well and it tingled w/no burn. The taste though! If you accidently lick your lips you get an awful rubbing alcohol taste in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I  completely  loved  this product it was so shiny and beautifully flawless the tingling sensation left my lips feeling so soft and sexy it made my lips look so much bigger in over one minute ,I applied it to my most boring and lifeless lips and automatically it made my lips look more attractive than I&#x27;ve ever seen them . I have to say that I am most fully satisfied by the way this lip gloss made my lips look .bye bye boring lips thank you Maybelline im so happy now I can strut my stuff knowing that no one is staring at my ugly lips they&#x27;ll be staring at how beautiful and kissable they look thx !!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a bunch of plumpers latley and this one so far is the best one. Its hard to trust reviews on here because we never know which to believe and which is real. I assure you this one works. It gives a little tingle a couple of minutes after you put t on it smells ok and you can feel your lip actually swell a bit. Down fall it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well. It smells great and leaves my lips looking nicely plumped. And I&#x27;m loving that tingly feeling.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS LIP GLOSS AND IT WAS A GOOD RESULT</li>
    <li> it doesnt quite burn as i expected but it looks great on the lips everyone asks what im wearing i love</li>
    <li> sticky, didn&#x27;t have any color, no plumping at all...ladies don&#x27;t waste your money!!! very disappointed. I threw it away after my first application.</li>
    <li> There is definitely a tingling feeling you get when you put this on, but I feel it didn&#x27;t really plump my lips. I bought it in &amp;#34;Peach Flush&amp;#34; and it wasn&#x27;t really super special or anything, so maybe it was the color and I should&#x27;ve gotten something with more &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;. Oh well, not bad at all, but not super great.</li>
    <li> This lip gloss has a great color, not too much though. It feels very nice on and give a little tingly feeling so you know it&#x27;s plumping!</li>
    <li> Its glam shine glossy. Its a unique applicator tip for me, spongy like.  You&#x27;ll able to control how much you want to apply.</li>
    <li> Works well for me as an under layer for other slightly darker colors. Not really a stand alone product because it&#x27;s too sheer.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t plump my lip at all.</li>
    <li> This lip stuff was alright. It made my lips feel tingly, but I dont think it did anything and it was really sticky. I dont think I would buy this stuff again</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lip glosses that I own. It gives my lips the perfect amount of color (I have the peachy flush)! However if you are looking for a lip plumper that is really noticeable, this is not the product for you! It might make my lips ever so slightly bigger, but I have never experienced the tingling feeling that the other reviewers have noticed. All that being said, this is still my favorite! When you first put it on it is slightly sticky, then the heat from your lips warms it up an it becomes the perfect consistency! The smell is wonderful, and it even taste good! My go to lip gloss for sure, and I will be ordering more soon :)</li>
    <li> This not only is a great color lip gloss but it really does plump up your lips.  I have suffered with a thin upper lip for years but this makes me look like I have a normal size lip.</li>
    <li> It is small nasty and l feel my lip ache and it not healthy we have to chose the healthy one</li>
    <li> Love it&#x27;s a most have!! It completes my daily look. I will buy more when needed! Love love love try it yourself!</li>
    <li> This lip gloss was okay. When i opened it there seemed to be some old dried up product on the tip. The color payoff isnt all that &#x27;peachy&#x27; which is the reason i wanted this. It tingels but i dont see a difference in my lips which is okay with me since i dont think i need plumper lips</li>
    <li> Bought this &amp;#34; lip plumper &amp;#34; curious to see if it worked.  Nothing tingled on my lip when it was applied, nor did it plump my lips.  It was a cheap experiment.  I also do not like how the tube works.  You must turn the bottom to the right, then product comes out of the top, but too much at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I love this. It has a nice taste and smell, as well as a wonderful slight tingling sensation. I can&#x27;t say that it actually plumps my lips, but it gives them an amazing shine and color that isn&#x27;t sticky like other lipglosses.</li>
    <li> This is a really cool product that I used to buy in the store before they stopped making it, however beware that the color looks a little broken down in this specific shade probably due to the fact that its not really the freshest cosmetic. Still a good price though.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful, but it caused an allergic lip reaction :( . Wasn&#x27;t able to use it that much.</li>
    <li> i love the peach tint on this, its not sticky at all super smooth and it tingles a little when applied feels great love this</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I am not crazy about the smell but that is the only negative comment about the product. It looks pretty when applied properly and does not come off easily which is great for long hours at the office.</li>
    <li> You can feel it plumping your lips. Smells good. The color is nice and shiny. I love it. Sometimes I wear it over my lipstick or alone.</li>
    <li> The color I was a little wirried about when I ordered it; once it arrived wow it is not dark or to peachy. It is a little sticky feeling but after a bit it seems to go away maybe I get use to it but looks great on my lips.</li>
    <li> This lipgloss is not a great plumper by any means. However, it does have some effect. It doesn&#x27;t taste bad nor does it look bad, The shade is a pretty coral/peach. I would buy again.</li>
