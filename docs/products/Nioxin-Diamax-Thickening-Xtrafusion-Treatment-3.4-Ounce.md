      <li>This is a great product.</li>

      <li>Love this product for my fine hair!</li>
      <li>Such an awesome deal!  </li>
      <li>Would have easily paid $40 at a salon and</li>
      <li>It is worth the $10!</li>
      <li>Second time in using the nioxin , but haven&#x27;t seen good results 😞</li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle and it made my hair thicker and fuller and in turn more manageable.  </li>
      <li>Have thinning hair and this product does wonders to spread an even full head,even on those sparse places.</li>
      <li>The fact it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands sticky is a real plus.</li>
      <li>Thanks for offering this.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>

      <li>not for sensitive skin, last time I will purchase nioxin</li>
      <li>I have given it about 4 tries at this point - no better than cheap stuff.</li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t get to try, came damage and almost empty.</li>
<li> Hair loss is minimized, I apply a small amount of the Diamax to my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
<li> It does make my hair look and feel a little thicker.</li>
<li> Hard to use and couldn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
<li> For thin hair, this is the answer</li>
<li> disappointed.  </li>

    <li> I am not noticing any thickening..... disappointed.  I have given it about 4 tries at this point - no better than cheap stuff. Was hoping to rave about it!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get to try, came damage and almost empty.</li>
    <li> I use both these products daily. And they help. Hair loss is minimized, I apply a small amount of the Diamax to my hair when it&#x27;s wet. And my hair does look thicker - no question about it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of thickening products and the salon I went to suggested I try this. They charged me $55 + tax of course saying if I dont like it bring it back.  I used the whole bottle and it made my hair thicker and fuller and in turn more manageable.  It does not gum up your hair and make it sticky like some products say it thickens by freezing your hair in place...It is worth the $10!</li>
    <li> Second time in using the nioxin , but haven&#x27;t seen good results 😞</li>
    <li> Love this product for my fine hair! Just wish it was a bigger bottle and lasted longer!</li>
    <li> Such an awesome deal!  Would have easily paid $40 at a salon and it&#x27;s the same exact stuff!  Thanks for offering this.</li>

    <li> Makes hair look thicker and silkier! A good product, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Used it a couple of times, and I like it.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it promises.  My hair is very thin and Nioxin Diamax works great.</li>
    <li> For thin hair, this is the answer</li>
    <li> I really liked it for volume, tends to be a bit drying.</li>
    <li> By far, it is the best hair treatment products that I have ever used. I recommend it to every one.</li>
    <li> I did NOT get the Advanced one but rather just the previous Nioxin Diamax Thickening serum so feel I was misled.</li>
    <li> has not helped at all</li>
