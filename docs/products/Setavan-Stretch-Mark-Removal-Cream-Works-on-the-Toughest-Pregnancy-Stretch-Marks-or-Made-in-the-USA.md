      <li>I did this not because of the lotion scent but because the oil is my favorite</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to work better as a moisturizer than a cellulite remover.</li>
      <li>I received this product free in exchange  for my  honeSt review.</li>
      <li>This stretch marks cream really works great.</li>
      <li>This cream is made in the USA, which can&#x27;t be said for many products anymore.</li>
      <li>or so i am still using this product to see if i get better results with  longer use.</li>
      <li>The cream is very rich and&lt;br /&gt;absorbs</li>
      <li>but i am happy so far.</li>
      <li>The colors aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; so to speak, and I feel more comfortable in a bikini knowing that my stretch marks aren&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
      <li>I got very lucky that my stomach was spared.</li>
      <li>It is nice and thick and has a great scent!</li>

      <li>I will definitely be buying more!!</li>
      <li>My girl is excited to try this product out</li>

      <li>I take the offer I ordered and recieved quickly</li>
      <li>The whiteness of the scars have faded, into a more skin tone, and the overall smoothness of my legs is a lot better.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply evenly despite being much thicker than lotion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!!</li>
      <li>This product worth the money to buy it.</li>
      <li>I will finish this bottle and decide if I feel like it is worth purchasing again.</li>
      <li>Opened and used right away.</li>
      <li>Omg so let me state right here</li>
      <li>What the hell, right?</li>
      <li>RIGHT</li>
      <li>i like that very much to me</li>
      <li>As soon as I put it on the first time, I could feel my skin tightening.</li>
      <li>more importantly, I could notice a clear improvement on my initial stretch marks.</li>
      <li>and I add to almost all my personal products as I love the smell.  </li>
      <li>I love that this cream comes with a money back</li>
      <li>Beautiful, clean packaging that makes it look much more expensive than it actually</li>
      <li>and i got a few stretch marks, and was glad to see this product available.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for any new mom who doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable in her skin with stretch marks, and even to moms who have had their stretch marks for years.</li>
      <li>we got it because of all the positive reviews will do another review in a couple of weeks</li>
      <li>Almost bikini ready</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for allowing me to review this product.</li>
      <li>I can really see the difference</li>
      <li>so i wasnt expecting much.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
      <li>I CAN REALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE.  </li>
      <li>Fromt he strain of carrying twins to almost full term as well as being a bigger girl I do have some stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I will highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>i think this product works just needs a little more time</li>
      <li>I have used this stretch mark cream for a few days now, It has tightened my skin up somewhat and I love the citrus smell.</li>
      <li>So far i am liking this product my stretch marks are looking a little more softer and</li>
      <li>; my new (post-baby) stretch marks</li>
      <li>I am going to use the remainder of it on my old stretch marks from junior high.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no irritation from the cream</li>
      <li>both dark and light colored stretch marks and both were faded by 2 weeks in.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use this product everyday!</li>
      <li>I have to say this is one of the very few products I&#x27;ve reviewed that I would actually spend my own money to buy.</li>
      <li>I have four year old twins.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>so far ive used it 3 days and already seeing some results</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old.  </li>
      <li>The texture is nice, however it has an unappealing scent i just cant get over.</li>
      <li>I always write just exactly what I think about the products I recieve, good or bad.</li>
      <li>I have white, but very visible and deep stretch marks on the insides of my thighs, about a 4&amp;#34;x6&amp;#34; surface on both legs.</li>
      <li>This cream made a significant difference in their appearance in just a few days!</li>
      <li>so be careful not to apply too much as the smell can become strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Goes on smooth, not oily or greasy.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> I love it! I had my last baby FOUR years ago. I thought the stretch marks were just my &amp;#34;cougar stripes&amp;#34;. This cream made a significant difference in their appearance in just a few days! I will consider buying from them again!</li>
    <li> I got this for the review and I have used it a few time and can all ready see a difference in my stretch marks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion but not a miracle.  My stretch marks are 17 years old, so I don&#x27;t think anything short of surgery will remove them.  However, I got this product free for review so I figured I had nothing to lose!  If my stretch marks fade before this bottle is empty, I will surely buy again!!</li>
    <li> this is a great product my strech marks are from 4 kids so i wasnt expecting much. i did see noticable results in about a week or so i am still using this product to see if i get better results with  longer use. i did recieve this item a discount price in return for my unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I have not seen much for results yet, only been using a few days. I will post another review after I try for longer.</li>
    <li> Omg so let me state right here and now, me and this product are about to best friends. I have four year old twins. Fromt he strain of carrying twins to almost full term as well as being a bigger girl I do have some stretch marks. This cream lightened them noticeably  almost immediately. I cant wait to keep using it and see how it keeps working for me.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few weeks. Although I am not seeing drastic results, I have seen less dimpling, and that&#x27;s really all I can ask for at this point.</li>
    <li> Opened and used right away. Its been a few days and my marks already seem lighter. Skin feels tighter. Am really pleased with this cream. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> We love this cream. For the price. It cant be beat. Came well packaged and they work as described.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for long term effects, but so far it seems to work well. I will finish this bottle and decide if I feel like it is worth purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Loving this product!! its onlu been two weeks and my stretch marks are already fading! Fantastic! Will be buying again as baby shower gift!</li>
    <li> I have white, but very visible and deep stretch marks on the insides of my thighs, about a 4&amp;#34;x6&amp;#34; surface on both legs. Literally, I have used this cream for two days. And my legs look amazing. The whiteness of the scars have faded, into a more skin tone, and the overall smoothness of my legs is a lot better. After two days? Can&#x27;t wait to see what this will do after the bottle is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any kids, and I&#x27;m 20. I&#x27;m just prone to stretch marks I guess? Because I&#x27;m very active and 114 lbs + 5&#x27;7&amp;#34;. (And have never been overweight.)</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I have both dark and light colored stretch marks and both were faded by 2 weeks in. Be sure to use this product everyday! A little goes a long way as the cream is pretty thick. It also has a scent to it so be careful not to apply too much as the smell can become strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. MY OPINIONS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE BASED ON MY OWN HONEST AND UNBIASED EXPERIENCE USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  I LOVE IT.  RIGHT NOW I AM JUST USING IT ON MY LEGS.  I CAN REALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE.  MY STRETCH MARKS ARE FADING.  I HAVE HAD THESE SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.  THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!!</li>
    <li> so far ive used it 3 days and already seeing some results i recently has a baby and i got a few stretch marks, and was glad to see this product available. i have tried other with no success. this cream has an orange creamsicle smell i follow the directions and have seen some marks get lighter. i will be recomemding this to others.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a few days and I can already notice a difference! I like this! I have sensitive skin but there has been no irritation. It is nice and thick and has a great scent!</li>
    <li> This stretch marks cream really works great. I have a dark  red strech mark and I tried a different brand but didnt help no change at all until a friend of mine told me to try this and there was a discounted offer. I take the offer I ordered and recieved quickly I used it the nigth after I recieved  after  3 days of using it I can really see the difference my strecth mark ligthen and almost get even to the color of my skin. This product worth the money to buy it. I will highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> A great Stretch Mark Cream.  A very smooth feel that absorbs nicely into the skin.  No offensive odor as I&#x27;ve found with other products.  I did squeeze some into a small jar and added a few drops of ylang ylang essential oil and the consistency remained intact.  I did this not because of the lotion scent but because the oil is my favorite and I add to almost all my personal products as I love the smell.  I recently had some weight gain and to ensure I don&#x27;t end up with lasting marks I decided to try this as a preventative measure.  Will probably work great for pregnancies as well as for weight lifters or any sport that increases your muscle mass.  I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cream smells! It smells amazing. It has a light orange scent it just smells so nice. I have been using using it on my stomach and it has definitely lighten up my stretch marks. The cream itself is very thin but not watery. It absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. I would definitely recommend. I did receive to review</li>
    <li> So far i am liking this product my stretch marks are looking a little more softer and i like that very much to me i think this product works just needs a little more time but i am happy so far. I have received this product to do a review on it.</li>
    <li> I love this stretch mark cream it is the best! I had a lot of stretch marks on my arms and after 2 weeks they are starting to fade.</li>
    <li> The Stretch mark cream was delivered in protective packaging and&lt;br /&gt;was as described on product page.  We purchased the cream in&lt;br /&gt;a promotion for testing and review.  The cream is very rich and&lt;br /&gt;absorbs nicely.  Premium ingredients, all excellent for skin&lt;br /&gt;nourishment, so feeling very safe using.  Have just began using,&lt;br /&gt;and hoping the cream will be effective on stretch marks occurring&lt;br /&gt;from weight loss.</li>
    <li> I received this product free in exchange  for my  honeSt review. I always write just exactly what I think about the products I recieve, good or bad. I have to say this is one of the very few products I&#x27;ve reviewed that I would actually spend my own money to buy. I gained over 90 pounds during my pregnancy, so needless to say, I had lots of stretch marks on the back of my legs, thighs, butt, and breasts. I got very lucky that my stomach was spared. That&#x27;s been 14 years ago, and during that time I&#x27;ve tried several so-called stretch mark creams and got absolutely no results out of them. I have been using Setavan Best Stretch Mark Cream for 10 days now and am already seeing great results from it. As soon as I put it on the first time, I could feel my skin tightening. After 10 days of use I&#x27;m already seeing a decrease and lightening of the worse stretch marks. I can&#x27;t wait to continue seeing them go away. I have very sensitive skin and have had no irritation from the cream and it has almost no scent. I will definitely be buying more!!</li>
    <li> I have used this stretch mark cream for a few days now, It has tightened my skin up somewhat and I love the citrus smell. Thanks so much for allowing me to review this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past month and im sad to say i haven&#x27;t seen much. The color of my stretch marks has gotten the slightest bit lighter, but other than that, no other results. The texture is nice, however it has an unappealing scent i just cant get over. Hopefully it works for you, but didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> The reviews are true.  I&#x27;m not being paid to say so…  This stuff actually works.  I have only been using it for a couple of weeks and I already see results.  After I &amp;#34;take care of&amp;#34; my new (post-baby) stretch marks I am going to use the remainder of it on my old stretch marks from junior high.  I&#x27;m 33 years old.  What the hell, right?</li>
    <li> Delicious citric scent - but discrete, easily absorbed by the skin and, more importantly, I could notice a clear improvement on my initial stretch marks. I must say that my marks are not really visible, only when I press my skin.</li>
    <li> My girl is excited to try this product out we got it because of all the positive reviews will do another review in a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> I only been using this brand of stretch mark cream for a few days now. I can&#x27;t really see a difference. But my boyfriend said that my stomach feels smoother. Maybe later on down the line I can review again, I did take a before picture. 3 weeks later and I can see the difference.  Yay. Almost bikini ready</li>
    <li> two weeks, once a day, 0 results, I will keep using and update</li>
    <li> Setavan&#x27;s stretch mark removal cream works quite well to diminish the appearance of stretch marks. However, keep in mind that it is not an overnight miracle cure, and will therefore take several applications before yielding visible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Skin is smoother and firmer around my stomach area. The small &amp;#34;tiger stripes&amp;#34; have not completely disappeared (as expected - this is not a miracle cream), but the stretch marks are not as obvious as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;+ Helps my scars fade in color and intensity. The white stretch marks on my stomach were very apparent, but after 2 weeks, they are starting to blend in and not be so obvious.&lt;br /&gt;+ Light fragrance that is not overwhelming like other stretch mark creams (i.e. Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter).&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to apply evenly despite being much thicker than lotion.&lt;br /&gt;+ Subtle but visible results after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;+ Beautiful, clean packaging that makes it look much more expensive than it actually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to work better as a moisturizer than a cellulite remover. It reminds me of an anti-aging serum that works well to hydrate face but does not immediately attack anti-aging signs. This stretch mark cream has done wonders for my skin in terms of moisturizing and smoothing it, but has not immediately attacked stretch marks the way I would have liked it to. The scars are slowly fading, but I don&#x27;t know if they will ever completely go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is great and is of very high quality - it improves, lifts, and firms scarred skin, but I would have liked to see more long-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.</li>
    <li> I have always been on the chunky side and have had stretch marks for years. I can only imagine that it will get worse once I have more kids. I ordered this stretch mark cream in hopes of getting results. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m okay with having stretch marks but there are some I&#x27;d like to make not as visible, especially on my tummy. I like that all of the ingredients are safe and effective to use on my skin. With ingredients such as olive oil, glycerin, jojoba oil, shea butter, cocoa butter, etc., I feel like I&#x27;m getting the best product for my skin. This cream is made in the USA, which can&#x27;t be said for many products anymore. I love that this cream comes with a money back guarantee if you&#x27;re not happy with the product in 90 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks and I can already see the stretch marks on my tummy diminishing. The colors aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; so to speak, and I feel more comfortable in a bikini knowing that my stretch marks aren&#x27;t as noticeable. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the marks on my hips as well. I highly recommend this product for any new mom who doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable in her skin with stretch marks, and even to moms who have had their stretch marks for years. This product works great on both old and new stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS HERE ARE 100% MY OWN.</li>
    <li> Nice cream smell so good I can fell my skin more smoothly</li>
