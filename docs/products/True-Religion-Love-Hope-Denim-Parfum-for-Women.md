<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The smell was great I would love to have some more and other true religion parfumes.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance</li>
    <li> this perfume smells absolutely incredible. i tried it on at a kohl&#x27;s store on a whim, and immediately went on amazon to order a bottle for myself! i got the 3.4 ounce size for $31.50 and at kohl&#x27;s it was about $60 for the small 1 ounce size! i have never fallen in love with a fragrance like i have with this. i will be wearing this forever!!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loves this perfume! It smells really soft and sweet</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Perfect, was sort of expecting flaws for this price but it was standard retail quality for about a third of the price!  Will order from them again!</li>
    <li> Thought Id take a shot at a blind buy with True Religion and that was a mistake, its a real soft sent almost to the point to where it doesn&#x27;t really smell at all, after about five mins its pretty much gone, even so what I do smell I don&#x27;t like, cheap, kinda &amp;#34;old ladyish&amp;#34;. I like Spears Curious, Swifts Wonderstruck, and anything Juicy so if you like those too then I recommend not getting this. Gave two stars cause it got here super quick.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE scent ever! It&#x27;s soft, clean, fresh, and flirty. My boyfriend loves it as well. I can guarantee you it lasts all day; I put it on at 7am and I can still smell it after a day&#x27;s work while I&#x27;m at the gym at 6:30 pm. I highly recommend this! At this price, it&#x27;s definite worth a try!</li>
    <li> This is the most synthetic smelling perfume I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;The notes looked very promising: Caramel, sugar, fruit, vanilla, almond and musk.&lt;br /&gt;Theoretically I should love this. I adore gourmands. But the fragrance makes me want to vomit.&lt;br /&gt;None of the notes stand out. I just get sugar mixed with plastic. Very cheap smell for a 30 dollar perfume. It should be sold at a dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;If you like Bath and Body Works Sensual Amber, you&#x27;ll love this because they are nearly identical. And I hate them both.</li>
    <li> I originally found this scent at Kohls where is smelled like warm sweet caramel. For some reason this didn&#x27;t quite smell the same. More like warm sweet burnt caramel. I do wear it sometimes but usually layered with a light vanilla spray.</li>
    <li> Smells like almond extract and candy had a hippy baby. Cannot get over how good the scent is. I get compliments all the time asking what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. Plus the price is so much cheaper than in any drugstore.</li>
    <li> Great light fragrance.  Not too heavy yet not too subtle.  Great for summer days or summer night wear. Love it!</li>
    <li> i really dont think this deserves any stars..thankfully i purchased at marshalls and it was $17.there is no smell at all..i wonder if it was a mistake? i mean..barely any scent. yuck.</li>
    <li> I love this scent its on of my favorite if not my favorite! I love sweet smooth scents and this is my type of perfume.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Ordered this for my wife, she loves the True Religion perfumes, and got this at a deal. Thanks, recommended A++</li>
    <li> This is an extremely sweet scent so unless you don&#x27;t like those super candy gourmand scents, stay away. I wear this as an evening/going out/party scent. I am always getting compliments from both men and women on how good I smell. This scent lasts for more than 6 hours depending how much you wear of it, I usually spray it in my hair, neck, and chest. And it&#x27;s still in my hair even until the next day :)</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  Sweet, soft fragrance.  You cannot go wrong with it. Paid $25 in the store but the bottle was much smaller.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Soft yet sensual scent for day or evening scent.  i love it my mother loves it! Would buy again. Great summer or winter scent and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
    <li> I found this perfume at a local chain store, then came home and ordered it from Amazon at a much better price.  Scents that are too flowery give me instant headaches, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s fresh and clean, yet feminine.  I now wear it daily, and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Loooooooove this perfume. Found it at kohl&#x27;s and just kept thinking there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m paying 65-70$ for it here when I can go to Dillards and get the gift set. Welp they don&#x27;t carry their perfumes anymore! Went back to Kohls and it was gone. So thankful it was because I now paid half the price for a bigger bottle. It smells like cotton candy and bubble gum plus just a little goes a looooooong way! Love it!</li>
    <li> Price was great, shipped quickly and the product is wonderful!! I use it everyday and people tell me how good I smell!!</li>
    <li> Love this scent and it&#x27;s a great price!!! So happy that I purchased from amazon for a low price and not the retail price</li>
    <li> As someone with allergies sometimes it is hard to find a perfume that doesn&#x27;t irritate my nose.  With that said I kinda wish the scent stayed with you throughout the day!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance hard to find.</li>
    <li> This perfume is truly divine! Scent lasts long and is not too strong but subtly sweet. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this perfume! Amazon was the only place I could find it when everywhere lease was completely sold out. It smells great and the seventh lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem like it was as strong smelling as the one bought at Ulta.</li>
    <li> This was a very big bottle.  I loved the smell, it was not overwhelming.  I also bought the other one Hippy Chick, love it to....</li>
    <li> Love it, never knew a blind buy would get my so many compliment wearing it just once. Fruity to max and not to mention it screams longevity 8-10 hours. Need to buy the gift set next, cause mama got a new Love. Bought it for only $24.95 better than the original to me. Guess you like what you like and me likely. Its the bomb,...</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it lasts all day!!!</li>
    <li> Great value for my favorite fragrance! Bonus cute accessory for my daughter&#x27;s treasures box! :)</li>
    <li> Ladies you must have this perfume in your collection. I love the price and the size.And it came very fast</li>
    <li> I received the perfume right on time, for a price 1/2 of the department stores.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, very light and sweet. I don&#x27;t go for floral fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> great christmas gift for a friend</li>
    <li> Excellent buy, Kohls price for 1.7oz is $56.00, need I say more? Love, love , love the fragrance, will be reordering from this seller!</li>
    <li> Love love love this perfume i wear it everyday all day im so happy to have my new perfume 😃</li>
    <li> daughter loves it and really likes all the neat trinkets hanging around the stopper for décor. made a great gift for Christmas and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Love it, great price! Came super quick!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I love this perfume. Saved a ton ordering it instead of getting at department store. Don&#x27;t hesitate, this is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it it smells good and lasts all day long. Good price here too..definitely recommend this.to any one who likes fruity sweet scent.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent! I wish it smelled stronger however, but I love it.</li>
    <li> smells great! my favorite.</li>
    <li> LOVE this parfum!  Great lasting smell and the bottle is adorable too.  Will certainly ordered this product again!  And it was MUCH CHEAPER here then in the department store!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. My daughter turned me on to this perfume and I am totally in love with it. I could wear it 24/7</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and is long lasting.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing, It last all day and it keeps you smelling sweet and sexy.</li>
    <li> the perfume arrived perfectly safe and sound and smells wonderful :) if there are any people who arnt fans of really stong pefumes this sweet perfume is great!!!</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this in a store prior to purchasing on amazon. I adore it. Its overtones are a strong, sweet cotton candy with a bookish undertone. It&#x27;s long lasting and doesn&#x27;t fade into a sickeningly sweet smell. Is set apart from other cotton candy smells by its complexity.</li>
    <li> Shipped way fast. Arrived perfect. And she loves the smell. Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap , and has a nice bottle with a charm attached to it. Thanks !</li>
    <li> The perfume has a sweet vanilla smell,but it fades away quickly. You will have to reapply at least 2 times a day!</li>
    <li> Other reviewers have been complaining they don&#x27;t smell after 5 hours.  My thought is, these are the ladies in the office that I have to repeatedly ask to dial down the scents.  I am typically sensitive to floral undertone perfumes/lotions &amp; they cause headaches &amp; sneeze attacks.  When we went into a TR store recently and I smelled &amp;#34;cotton candy&amp;#34; I made a comment on how good it smelled and started looking for the kid.  the sales clerk said the JUST sprayed their Love Hope Denim fragrance. I knew I needed it.  I didn&#x27;t create a sneeze attack!  I spray 2x (once on wrist &amp; once on top) &amp; I smell myself all day.  My objective in life isn&#x27;t to make sure everyone knows when I enter/exit a room (although by smelling like cotton candy I&#x27;m sure others will notice!)</li>
    <li> Oh, I love this.  I wish they had a bigger bottle, but I love this.</li>
    <li> I was at Kohl&#x27;s and was trying to find a new scent. I found this totally by accident. It was a lot more expensive there. I came home and checked Amazon and it was much cheaper but SAME product. I am a nurse and have to be careful with scents. I like something clean smelling. This smell is kind of a vanilla/cotton candy clean scent. I had been wearing Clinique Happy but was ready for a change. I tried Philosophy Pure Grace but scent lasted only about 30 minutes. My husband loves it on me too.</li>
    <li> I was really mixed about this at first. I&#x27;ve always worn cotton candy perfume, but found that it doesn&#x27;t last very long being that it is usually a cheap body spray. I bought this based on reviews. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like cotton candy to me, but it is sweet with a spicy element I can&#x27;t really describe. I wore it for a couple weeks and decided to go back to my cotton candy. That only lasted a day. I missed this perfume! I wore it the following day and every day since. It won me over!</li>
    <li> a Christmas gift for my wife.</li>
    <li> Bought this perfume on a whim because I read good reviews. Never will buy a perfume without smelling it first! Smelled like cat-pee-pee. However vendor shipped quickly, was sealed, so its&#x27; not their fault. I just did NOT like this perfumes&#x27; smell at all.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best perfumes ive ever had. If you go to a department store this bottle would cost at least $70 so for the price amazon is selling it for is amazing. The smell lasts all day. I would recommend this to everyone. If you need perfume this is the one you should buy</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Smell good but dont last long but it do really smell great  just need more standing long scent thats all</li>
    <li> I always worry about paying much less for perfume and it not being the real thing.  NOT the case here...great price and perfume is real.  Would but again for sure.</li>
    <li> Great Awesome Long Lasting! Nothing else to say! I bought my first bottle at Khols. It was 60 for a little bottle.When I ran out I looked it up on here and a Big bottle cost only 35!. So not only more but saved money also.</li>
    <li> Yes feel in love with it at kohls but seeing it for half the price here made me fell in love harder . It&#x27;s very sweet . I get a lot of comments from the young men lately because of the fragrance . I&#x27;m happy and sold</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick. Would give product 5 stars but did not like the smell</li>
    <li> The True Religion perfume I bought for my daughter for Christmas was very reasonable and we all love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great deal and shipped quickly.  I bought this for my 20 year old niece for Christmas and I loved it so much, I got one too.</li>
    <li> LOVE This perfume. It came in the original box, wrapped in plastic. WAY cheaper that the price at Dillards and smells exactly the same. I love the way this smells! Its like cotton candy with an edge of sophisticated floral. It suits my age just right. (21 going on 22)</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Get compliments all the time! Great for the price</li>
    <li> I get compliments ever time I wear this!!</li>
    <li> I love, love it. I haven&#x27;t wore any of my other perfume I own, which is a lot by the way, but I will be ordering more really soon!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells nothing like True Religion Love Hope Denim! I ordered 2 bottles and they STINK like alocohol and a fragrance that is not anywhere near the TRUE perfume. Do NOT buy this! What a rip off! Thankfully Amazon refunded me fully for this mess.</li>
    <li> bought as a Christmas present...she LOVES this perfume...it has a perfect fall, winter smell - a little floral with a hint of spice - very clean smell not too strong at all - she and i get headaches from too strong perfumes and we both love this one.</li>
    <li> Great smell has kind of a floral vanilla smell but not old lady at all my only complaint is that the smell did not last all day I would say maybe half the day so because of that I would not buy again but it definitely smells good!!</li>
    <li> Great price, quality product, fast delivery. Doesn&#x27;t get better than that!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, have got many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and great quality. Packed and shipped great</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! I&#x27;ve ordered it several times from this vendor. Ships pretty fast as well. All my friends love the fresh floral scent and compliment me every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> I could just bathe in this stuff. I got my first bottle for Christmas and I just bought a second bottle because I&#x27;m running low already. It smells sweet, but it&#x27;s no overwhelming. I get a lot of compliments and people tell me all the time that I smell like cotton candy. Hands down my favorite perfume</li>
    <li> Loved it. Purchasing more soon.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good, sweet, but not overpowering, and also just a couple sprays lasts all day.  Love it, Thank you</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. By far my favorite! But u can&#x27;t use more than 2 sprays cause it&#x27;s strong</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at a much better price!</li>
    <li> Same as what you buy from the Buckle for three times the amount of money.</li>
    <li> saved 30 bucks ordering from amazon the smell is great on wife cotton candy i would refer it to</li>
