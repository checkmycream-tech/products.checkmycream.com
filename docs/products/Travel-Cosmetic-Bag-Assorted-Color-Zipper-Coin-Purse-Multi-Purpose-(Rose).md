      <li>I love any sort of organizer, make-up case, so</li>
      <li>Love it ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better in person.  </li>
      <li>and I loved them so much I bought 10 more and giving them as Christmas presents.  </li>
      <li>But definitely a great purchase especially for $5.99!!</li>
      <li>It came on time &amp; great as a gift giving present or for yourself.</li>
      <li>Will fit all of my cosmetics, so roomy and cleans well</li>
      <li>Overall, it was a great buy.</li>
      <li>Not only is this bag cute and functional, it is also a very convincing Tory Burch replica.</li>
      <li>It looks true to its picture, but for the price, you have to expect that it will be a bit cheap feeling</li>
      <li>The zipper feels cheap but doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
      <li>Shipping seemed to take forever but was worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t decided if it&#x27;s worth the hassle to return or just give it to a child.</li>
      <li>The latch was very much stuck, like it was molded shut.</li>
      <li>First of all, it took over a month to receive the bag.</li>
      <li>The color is so pretty</li>
      <li>How could you go wrong with a great Tory Burch lookalike cosmetic bag?!</li>
      <li>It shipped fast from China</li>
      <li>but I have to say everyone that has seen it thinks it&#x27;s real.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very convenient and the size</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and the gold really compliments.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the black</li>
      <li>I bought the bright pink which is really &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; and the black...</li>
      <li>(for example, I can&#x27;t get the creases out from where the folds were from shipping), but overall it looks pretty, and I don&#x27;t feel the creases will make my bridesmaid&#x27;s love it any less.</li>
      <li>The zipper doesn&#x27;t seem like it will hold up for very long, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting super high quality for this price.</li>
      <li>the pink came pretty fast but the black has not arrived yet.  </li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t buy knock-off&#x27;s but thought for $5 and change it would be worth it.</li>

<li> This is a relatively small cosmetic bag but can easily hold several eyeliners, mascaras, lipsticks, and a small eyeshadow.  </li>
<li> When i zipper it down to close it would open up in the middle.</li>
<li> Smells like gross packaging, other than that</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t buy poor quality ripped inside first day of use .......</li>
<li> The only down fall is the clip on wristlet wouldn&#x27;t attach.</li>
<li> I got it in pink...</li>
<li> Shipping was faster than expected!</li>
<li> I have never experienced such low quality from Amazon.</li>
<li> I bought a few as stocking stuffers too.</li>
<li> But after a few minutes of carrying my iphone and some money, the strap broke off.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s just a little on the small side.</li>
<li> The zipper can be a little wonky at times</li>
<li> I thought it was small</li>
<li> The material is cheap and I was very disappointed with bag.</li>
<li> My only suggestion is to buy multiples because your friends will go crazy over it!</li>
<li> And to make matters worse, the detachable strap inside the bag does not work.</li>
<li> However, be mindful that you may have a broken zipper issues</li>
<li> Yes, this is a fake...</li>
<li> it looks fake.</li>
<li> bad zipper on bag.</li>
<li> but i hate the smell that it has.  </li>
<li> zipper is horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered them in different colors. My favorite is the black it&#x27;s a tiny cosmetic bag and fits in my big tote bag. I recommend this to everyone. It came on time &amp; great as a gift giving present or for yourself. For the price it is a great quality inside &amp; out.</li>
    <li> I bought two at the same time. Received them towards the latter part of the delivery period. It&#x27;s just as posted. However, be mindful that you may have a broken zipper issues</li>
    <li> The zipper doesn&#x27;t seem like it will hold up for very long, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting super high quality for this price. It&#x27;s cute, it works, and serves my purpose well. I bought a few as stocking stuffers too. I would buy again...</li>
    <li> I thought it was small but it&#x27;s very convenient and the size it&#x27;s perfect for make up. The color is so pretty I got it in pink... Love it ...</li>
    <li> Everything was good, it&#x27;s relatively nice looking for the price. The zipper feels cheap but doesn&#x27;t really bother me. The only thing is the wristlet doesn&#x27;t attach on to anything. There&#x27;s nowhere to attach it &amp; without the wristlet it looks fake.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy poor quality ripped inside first day of use .......I bought merchandise thinking I could use with designer bag. The material is cheap and I was very disappointed with bag.</li>
    <li> Very cute  and functional...great xmas gifts buy all colors.  Will fit all of my cosmetics, so roomy and cleans well</li>
    <li> I love this product enjoy every day loving the color,can&#x27;t complain I am planning to buy more for Christmas :)</li>
    <li> This bag is awesome.  It&#x27;s even better in person.  It shipped fast from China and I loved them so much I bought 10 more and giving them as Christmas presents.  Very nice bag!</li>
    <li> two of my favorite things. fav designer and fav color. what more could one ask for! absolutely love it. thank u</li>
    <li> For the price, I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product.  It looks great, the colors are true to the color that is shown in the picture, and I am gifting them to each of my bridesmaids, so I know they will love it.  I love any sort of organizer, make-up case, so I know they will also.  It looks true to its picture, but for the price, you have to expect that it will be a bit cheap feeling (for example, I can&#x27;t get the creases out from where the folds were from shipping), but overall it looks pretty, and I don&#x27;t feel the creases will make my bridesmaid&#x27;s love it any less.</li>

    <li> Not only is this bag cute and functional, it is also a very convincing Tory Burch replica. For this price you can&#x27;t beat it. I ordered one in every color and each is bright and well made.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is a fake...but it&#x27;s a damn good one!!  I put all my makeup in it and I have plenty of room left over.  It has a cute pattern on the inside.  The zipper can be a little wonky at times but I have to say everyone that has seen it thinks it&#x27;s real.  I bought the bright pink which is really &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; and the black...the pink came pretty fast but the black has not arrived yet.  Both come from China...They are great as gifts!</li>
    <li> This Cosmetic Bag is the perfect size for odds and ends. It is well made and matches a tote of the same color perfectly</li>
    <li> looks just like the picture but i hate the smell that it has.  Smells like gross packaging, other than that its okay.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and all but the day i received it, the zipper had problems. It was not closing all the way. When i zipper it down to close it would open up in the middle. zipper is horrible. bad zipper on bag. Regret buying it</li>
    <li> This cosmetic bag is very cute perfect for any purse size. But it&#x27;s just a little on the small side. But definitely a great purchase especially for $5.99!!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy knock-off&#x27;s but thought for $5 and change it would be worth it. I haven&#x27;t decided if it&#x27;s worth the hassle to return or just give it to a child. First of all, it took over a month to receive the bag. ONE month!! So even if I decided to let that go, the logo was off- centered and crooked! And to make matters worse, the detachable strap inside the bag does not work. I guess the spring in the clasp is not made correctly or glued together but it won&#x27;t open so it&#x27;s totally not functional. I have never experienced such low quality from Amazon. I will never order anything from Hong Kong again.</li>
    <li> How could you go wrong with a great Tory Burch lookalike cosmetic bag?! It&#x27;s the perfect size and color! (I went with Rose) My only suggestion is to buy multiples because your friends will go crazy over it! Shipping was faster than expected!</li>
    <li> Shipping seemed to take forever but was worth the wait.  This is a relatively small cosmetic bag but can easily hold several eyeliners, mascaras, lipsticks, and a small eyeshadow.  Color is great (bought this in Rose.)</li>
    <li> The bag arrived and I was in LOVE! But after a few minutes of carrying my iphone and some money, the strap broke off.</li>
