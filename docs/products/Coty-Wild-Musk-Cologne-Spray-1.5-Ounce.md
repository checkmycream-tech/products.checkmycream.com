      <li>this is my favorite not to strong smelling</li>

      <li>What ever makes the little woman happy make the old man happy too !!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, clean musk scent offering warm, feminine tones.</li>
      <li>the smooth glass is the crappy one.</li>
      <li>i ordered this but got the smooth glass bottle.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the scent and will enjoy ordering again.</li>
      <li>It came quickly and in fine condition.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the original scent-</li>
      <li>the scent is as strong and fresh as I remember....</li>
      <li>My wife loved it she had looked for it in all the local stores &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
      <li>Nice soft sent, not over whelming.</li>
      <li>so all in all not a bad price</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly and was a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Never seems to bother those who are sensitive to most fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Love my Wild Musk cologne.</li>
      <li>Old favorite.  </li>
      <li>Love Cody Wild Musk, have been wearing it for 25+ years.  </li>
      <li>I wore Coty Wild Musk back when it first came out, it smelled GREAT on me, always got compliments when I wore it.  </li>
      <li>Its been years that i last used this love the sent wish it would be just a tad stronger but overall very pleased</li>
      <li>I ordered the first bottle, thinking I was getting what &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; wanted.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Next time I order for myself, I will have to pay attention to detail to make sure I get the one for females.  </li>
      <li>This is SOOO different, I wish along with many others that Coty would go back to the original formula.  </li>
      <li>We both really love the scents and hopefully I will have access to them for a very long time.</li>
      <li>Finally found a fragrance that was not too strong, just a hint.  </li>
      <li>very lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Arrived fast and in the box.</li>
      <li>Really-</li>
      <li>This product is very affordable.</li>
      <li>My baby really enjoys this cologne</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the scent and carefully used my bottle until the very last spritz.</li>
      <li>I guess in my older age I am either just not that picky</li>
      <li>I got these because where I was getting them either were always out of my product or it was to high in price</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to any musk lover.</li>
      <li>stars for the dealer (fast delivery) and for the Coty Wild Musk..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn Coty Wild Musk as my only perfume for years and years, but this latest bottle is different.</li>
      <li>these were the price I was normally spend</li>
      <li>and i normally get compliments all day.</li>
      <li>Not perfect as with the Coty Wild Musk products of the 70&#x27;s but stil smells pretty darn good.</li>
      <li>Any new modifications are incorporated in the development process and may result in an adapted set of chemical constituents.  </li>
      <li>This is NOT the same fragrance of the original scent - there actually is no scent!  </li>
      <li>Never grows old!  </li>
      <li>this is baby powder in cologne form, without any of the positive attributes of actual baby powder.</li>
      <li>I always receive compliments when I wear the wild musk by coty.</li>
      <li>Wish I could still find the Coty Wild Musk Oil.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing Wild Musk by Cody for well over 40 years</li>
      <li>products have been developed, manufactured, and packaged in compliance with the strict guidelines, standards, and regulations set by each country in which they are sold to ensure safety and quality.  </li>
      <li>I really wish they still made the perfume oil as it&#x27;s difficult to get just the right amount from a spray and this can be a bit too sweet if not used</li>
      <li>The scent is the same when I received it, but is already smelling like it is old.</li>

    <li> My all time favorite perfume. My drug store stopped carrying. Easy to get at amazon! Thanks!</li>
    <li> A Mother&#x27;s Day gift that surprised my wife since it is very difficult to find in my country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She does not perceive any change in the scent, because the quality and the fragrance remain the same...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for the dealer (fast delivery) and for the Coty Wild Musk..</li>
    <li> Love Cody Wild Musk, have been wearing it for 25+ years.  It has been getting harder to find.  Wish I could still find the Coty Wild Musk Oil.</li>
    <li> Just what was called for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for many years and love it. It&#x27;s a fresh, clean musk scent offering warm, feminine tones. While I use many other high-cost fragrances purchased at cosmetic counters, this one is a mainstay in my wardrobe because it always elicits wonderful feedback from men and women alike.</li>
    <li> I got these because where I was getting them either were always out of my product or it was to high in price these were the price I was normally spend so all in all not a bad price</li>
    <li> This product is very affordable. I always receive compliments when I wear the wild musk by coty.</li>
    <li> I do love it, but mostly I love it when my wife wears it. It makes her happy, which is what makes me happy!</li>
    <li> I previously gave this one star but it was based on a problem with the shipping carrier, not the seller.  I am very pleased with this product...the scent is as strong and fresh as I remember....thank you</li>
    <li> Its been years that i last used this love the sent wish it would be just a tad stronger but overall very pleased</li>
    <li> Was very happy to locate this scent for my Mom for Christmas!  Nice to know it was available and still fresh smelling. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this scent for years</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles of this and neither one of the bottles have any scent and are sticky when I put it on!</li>
    <li> My favorite....love it</li>
    <li> Been using this cologne spray for years.  Finally found a fragrance that was not too strong, just a hint.  Stays with me for the entire day.  No one ever says it is offensive. Never seems to bother those who are sensitive to most fragrances.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> No happy, different scent, not the same bottle or cologne.  I purchased this because I knew the beveled bottle product was the one I wanted.  Did not receive that, rather a different styled bottle and a completely different smell. Weak</li>
    <li> Sadly, the old wonderful scent is gone :( This new scent smells watered down, with a hit of burning leaves. Really- it&#x27;s that yuck to me now. SO DISAPPOINTED!  I contacted Coty about this &amp; got the following reply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Hi,&lt;br /&gt;Our products have been developed, manufactured, and packaged in compliance with the strict guidelines, standards, and regulations set by each country in which they are sold to ensure safety and quality.  On occasion, these guidelines, standards, and regulations are modified.  Any new modifications are incorporated in the development process and may result in an adapted set of chemical constituents.  Regardless, we take rigorous measures to ensure that the essence or olfactory profile of the product is not affected. However, the most discriminating noses may discern a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best&lt;br /&gt;COTY Facebook Team&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the original scent- this is baby powder in cologne form, without any of the positive attributes of actual baby powder.</li>
    <li> Love my Wild Musk cologne. I use ONLY this fragrance from COTY.</li>
    <li> Love Coty Musk and have for 35 years. It&#x27;s my fragrance. It arrived very quickly and was a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and in the box. Very lovely perfume. I highly recommend this to any musk lover. Nice soft sent, not over whelming. Happy with purchase and will buy more when out :-)</li>
    <li> Old favorite.  Never grows old!  Highly recommend!  I hate when they make you write more words than what you want, so I will fill up the space like this!  Have a good day!</li>
    <li> My wife loved it she had looked for it in all the local stores &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it.  What ever makes the little woman happy make the old man happy too !!</li>
    <li> SOOOOO disappointed!  I wore Coty Wild Musk back when it first came out, it smelled GREAT on me, always got compliments when I wore it.  This is SOOO different, I wish along with many others that Coty would go back to the original formula.  I would wear it everyday again.</li>
    <li> The Coty Wild Musk Cologne spray arrived in great shape. My baby really enjoys this cologne and I think she smells really great when she wears this.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites from years ago.  I really wish they still made the perfume oil as it&#x27;s difficult to get just the right amount from a spray and this can be a bit too sweet if not used very lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find a teensy bottle of the oil for sale here on amazon, for something like a hundred twenty dollars.  That&#x27;s insane.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous fragrance.Its&#x27;s one that can be worn anytime of the day or night and it is always complementing the wearer. It is a beautiful scent. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> i use this cologne for at least ten years and now its suddenly not the same. its like ... no smell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the scent is gone. i only spray my clothes and hair and i normally get compliments all day. now i cant even smell the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;real bummer. this is the 3rd bottle with the same lack of scent? hmmm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*main concern: the pic shows a bumpy glass bottle. i ordered this but got the smooth glass bottle. the smooth glass is the crappy one. wheres the bumpy glass bottles?????? they have the good smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Coty Wild Musk as my only perfume for years and years, but this latest bottle is different. I am pretty disappointed, but I admit it may not be Coty&#x27;s fault per se--maybe they changed it on purpose and I just don&#x27;t like it. :-)</li>
    <li> Not perfect as with the Coty Wild Musk products of the 70&#x27;s but stil smells pretty darn good.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite not to strong smelling</li>
    <li> This is a perfume is like a baby powder smell this smell will stay with you all day and yes oh yes people all ways ask me what do you have on , a couple sprays will last you all day 😃😃😃😃😃😃happy customer</li>
    <li> I am SO disappointed!  I have been wearing Wild Musk by Cody for well over 40 years and I loved it!  Always got lots of compliments.  This is NOT the same fragrance of the original scent - there actually is no scent!  Terribly disappointing.</li>
    <li> Did they change the formula?  The scent is the same when I received it, but is already smelling like it is old.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t spray as well as it should.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent -- not too strong and people often ask me what I am wearing.</li>
    <li> Just be careful as to which you are ordering.  This is for MEN, not women.  THe description does not mention it&#x27;s the MEN&#x27;S cologne, but the picture of the bottle reads it, but it&#x27;s hard to see.  On this review, there is no mention that it&#x27;s for MEN.  Next time I order for myself, I will have to pay attention to detail to make sure I get the one for females.  The smell is great and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> What can I say, if you have tried before you will always love it, I use it more in the winter, a heavier scent, but Coty&#x27;s is a great procduct!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the scent and carefully used my bottle until the very last spritz. I can tell (somewhat) what others where saying about the &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; having been changed ... I guess in my older age I am either just not that picky or I get used to the scent faster. I ordered the first bottle, thinking I was getting what &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; wanted. When it finally got here, discovered it was the &amp;#34;mens&#x27; Coty Musk Cologne Spray instead of the &amp;#34;womens&amp;#34;  ... being so close to Christmas I just decided to keep it, wrap it and give it to my hubby for part of his Christmas  (glad I did)...  I carefully re-ordered and got MINE..  We both really love the scents and hopefully I will have access to them for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product before.  It came quickly and in fine condition.  I really enjoy the scent and will enjoy ordering again.</li>
