      <li>What could be better than that?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed mint flavored toothpaste in the gel form.</li>
      <li>Also, I find some of the pastes more abrasive than I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite and does the job without causing any problems for my teeth sensitivity.</li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite toothpaste, but this flavor is not carried in any of the stores in town.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>when my mother was sure that flouride was good for us (and she was right).</li>
      <li>Good price and large tubes.</li>
      <li>that it slides so easily onto the brush.  </li>
      <li>I use it every day and my mouth is clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>A couple boxes dented, toothpaste is fine though.</li>
      <li>Precisely what I wanted...........</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for ten plus years and am happy with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find the cool mint gel in stores</li>
      <li>More pleasant, less burning taste than so many brands, no gritty feel.</li>
      <li>thanx so much for having it!!</li>
      <li>Very hard to find in stores, and thought it was discontinued, but was so happy to find it on-line....and in a 6-pack!</li>
      <li>I use to be able to fine the smaller size in the store but that started disappearing.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased, and buying the pack of 6 lasts us a very long time....</li>
      <li>and so I am now super sensitive to mint products or things with a strong bite.</li>
      <li>Then I found it hard to find this flavor online, until I got this great deal on this toothpaste from Amazon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crest since it first came out  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Crest regular paste, most of my life.  </li>
      <li>Most of our pharmacy and big box stores no longer carry this variety.  </li>
      <li>but I always come back to my favorite and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of all the new special whitening, tartar control, etc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying to analyze why I like this so much.  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend only likes this brand so thank you for having it available.</li>
      <li>I also think it works better than some of the other brands.  </li>
      <li>I really prefer the Cool Mint Flavor, to Crest&#x27;s regular paste flavor!  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums like most other toothpaste!</li>
      <li>Tastes good, and with my Sonicare toothbrush has made my dentist look for other sources of income such as replacing 35 year old fillings.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Clean teeth for a long time.</li>
      <li>I have been using crest for a long time and I have tryed many different types</li>
      <li>This is more product, less or same cost</li>
      <li>It got harder to find gel Crest at my local stores, so I got this six-pack on Amazon at a reasonable price and quick shipping.</li>
      <li>For the same reason as mentioned before, I would much rather get this on my doorstep than have to drive across town to get it in a store.</li>
      <li>This handles all the basic requirements for toothpaste nicely with no odd, harsh or intense flavors and with no unusual mouth dryness after use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Crest Cavity Protection Cool Mint Flavor toothpaste is hard to find in local stores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Clean teeth for a long time. Great fast shipping</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this toothpaste! I don&#x27;t know why i can&#x27;t find it in any store, but it is the only toothpaste out there that doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth but still freshens. I have burning mouth syndrome (ever heard of it? me neither!) and so I am now super sensitive to mint products or things with a strong bite. I used to have several flare ups a year, and they were torture-couldn&#x27;t eat anything without my mouth feeling like it was one fire. Since switching to this toothpaste a year ago, I haven&#x27;t had ONE. Life is good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the cool mint gel in stores but it seems they have replaced it with the one with scope in it.  My boyfriend only likes this brand so thank you for having it available.</li>
    <li> This is the choice of toothpaste for my husband.  Very hard to find in stores, and thought it was discontinued, but was so happy to find it on-line....and in a 6-pack!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for ten plus years and am happy with it. Good price and large tubes. I&#x27;ll buy here again.</li>
    <li> Precisely what I wanted...........Crest Cavity Protection Cool Mint Flavor toothpaste is hard to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> I love this gel over the paste.  I use to be able to fine the smaller size in the store but that started disappearing.  Started drive to the next town Walmart to get it and stock up and they started to be spotty on supply.  This is more product, less or same cost and I dont need to waste gas driving to next town to find out they do not have it.  I also think it works better than some of the other brands.  I have bonding on my teeth and I can EASILY tell the difference in plaque build up!!!.  Aslo, this doesn&#x27;t have all the extra junk in it.</li>
    <li> my favorite toothpaste ever - I hope they never stop making it</li>
    <li> The cool mint gel seems impossible to find in stores these days, and here it is in quantity and in large size.  I&#x27;m trying to analyze why I like this so much.  Better than paste in that it slides so easily onto the brush.  Tastes great.  Doesn&#x27;t have a lot of strange additives. It makes me happy in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great taste and a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest since it first came out  (I think 1957) when my mother was sure that flouride was good for us (and she was right). I actually had fewer cavities. There haven&#x27;t been than many incarnations of Crest. I think it went from paste to gel to gel with whitener to paste with whitener, but basically Crest is Crest. Tastes good, and with my Sonicare toothbrush has made my dentist look for other sources of income such as replacing 35 year old fillings.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite toothpaste, but this flavor is not carried in any of the stores in town.&lt;br /&gt;Good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest regular paste, most of my life.  I had grabbed the &amp;#34;wrong flavor&amp;#34;, that turned out to be the &amp;#34;right flavor&amp;#34;, when I was grocery shopping, prior to this purchase.  I really prefer the Cool Mint Flavor, to Crest&#x27;s regular paste flavor!  They call it liquid gel, but to me it&#x27;s just a gel toothpaste, nothing liquid about it? Then I found it hard to find this flavor online, until I got this great deal on this toothpaste from Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the description says this is a liquid because it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like plain old gel toothpaste. This is it! Nothing fancy, no stripes or sparkles or foamy stuff. Tastes good. I use it every day and my mouth is clean and healthy. Amazon is the only place I can find it. I hope they never stop making this stuff and I hope Amazon keeps carrying it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of all the new special whitening, tartar control, etc. toothpastes. Also, I find some of the pastes more abrasive than I&#x27;d like. This handles all the basic requirements for toothpaste nicely with no odd, harsh or intense flavors and with no unusual mouth dryness after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lifetime Crest user. I use a rotary head power toothbrush that specifies using a gel toothpaste because the paste type wears out the moving parts of the brush quicker. It got harder to find gel Crest at my local stores, so I got this six-pack on Amazon at a reasonable price and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> When u only want toothpaste to do what toothpaste is suppose to do with mint taste ... Here u go</li>
    <li> This order was delivered promptly and is the only toothpaste my son likes!</li>
    <li> This tastes great, just like the stuff I remember when I was a kid. Ordered through Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great that I can still order the cool mint get toothpaste.  Most of our pharmacy and big box stores no longer carry this variety.  I some times see it stocked at the grocey store but not always.  Nice to know that I can order them on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using crest for a long time and I have tryed many different types but I always come back to my favorite and that is the cool mint jel!!</li>
    <li> A couple boxes dented, toothpaste is fine though.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste my husband will use.  He likes the taste and I use it, too.  We order it in bulk so that it lasts us for a while.</li>
    <li> Used this most of my life.  Very hard to find in stores anymore and I don&#x27;t know why.  More pleasant, less burning taste than so many brands, no gritty feel.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste that will work for me and I believe it is being phased out as it is hard to find in the stores. It&#x27;s my favorite and does the job without causing any problems for my teeth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums like most other toothpaste!</li>
    <li> For the same reason as mentioned before, I would much rather get this on my doorstep than have to drive across town to get it in a store. It&#x27;s the same Crest Gel without the hassle. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of toothpaste that is paste, has crystals, fluoride, magic beans etc. in it but they all make me want to gag when I use them. So I always kept coming back to Crest Gel and now, I&#x27;m here to stay. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Been using for years tried others and always come back. Afraid they will stop making it with all the our brands and flavores on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed mint flavored toothpaste in the gel form. This also does a very good job with cleaning.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste I wish it would be in stock!!</li>
    <li> Our family has always used Crest toothpaste, and the gel is a great product. Very pleased, and buying the pack of 6 lasts us a very long time....we save money. What could be better than that? It&#x27;s a win-win!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got this giant tubes at such a discount! I feel badly for not supporting my brick and mortar stores but the price on this Crest Cavity Protection toothpaste really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> only place i can get it!!  love it!!  thanx so much for having it!!</li>
