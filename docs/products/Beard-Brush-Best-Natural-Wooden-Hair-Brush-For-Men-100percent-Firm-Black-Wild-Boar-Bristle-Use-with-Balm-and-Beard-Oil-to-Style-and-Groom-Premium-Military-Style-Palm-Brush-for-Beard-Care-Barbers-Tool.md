      <li>Extremely quick shipping!</li>
      <li>handle is smooth, and fits well in your hand.</li>
      <li>We bought beard oil and using this brush with the oil helps the hairs grow straighter and is its so smooth.  </li>
      <li>It works great on my short beard.</li>
      <li>Works great.. untangles facial hair...</li>
      <li>Absolutely fantastic brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This would make a great gift for any man in your life with facial hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found this brush very useful in two moments:</li>
      <li>First beard brush, so don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but the bristles are smooth and feel good on my face.</li>
      <li>This comb really poofs the beard and gets into all the hair and makes it look nice and full without pulling the hair.</li>
      <li>Overall, a great product, and pleasure doing business w/ a fast and easy delivery.</li>
      <li>Now if it can convince the mrs that my beard is cool</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>The boar bristles are perfect for brushing out my beard, not too soft but not too firm.</li>
      <li>Soft, great size, definitely a man beard brush!</li>
      <li>It is a perfect balance between stiff and soft.  </li>
      <li>Great brush for everyday use, just the right amount of softness/roughness on the bristles to get the job done.</li>
      <li>This brush is super high quality!</li>
      <li>I bought a beard kit that came with a generic bristle brush, but I bought this one and it is far superior.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>He got into this new trend of growing out his beard, however his beard started to look more messy than trendy.</li>
      <li>Ever since receiving this premium wooden brush his beard looks better than ever.</li>
      <li>Thanks Beardeur!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soothing to use on my beard and gives a good firm comb through.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes in a really nice little box - they really didn&#x27;t skimp on the details!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>am very much looking forward to using this fine product while I grow the new one out starting in a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my beard straight, neat, and presentable.</li>
      <li>Yet I still wanted a quality boar bristle brush at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>This Beardeur Boar Bristle Brush keeps his beard very well manicured.</li>
      <li>I have thinning white hair that does not require a brush of extraordinary stiffness.  </li>
      <li>The brush has boar bristles which helps with maintaining and mostly polishing his facial hair (this is something he repeats daily to me as he admires and brushes his beard in the morning!).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend they try this brush.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this brush to any of my bearded brothers reading this review.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The packaging is much higher quality than a similar brush I bought from Duluth Trading Co.</li>
      <li>I suspect that there are many other men and women of my age who no longer have a luxuriant head of hair, and don&#x27;t want to abraid their scalp with the stiffness of some of the other high quality brushes.  </li>
      <li>Having sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It helps move your natural oils through your beard and soften the coarseness of the hair.</li>
      <li>My husband has this wild manly beard and loves this brush.</li>
      <li>So far this has done everything I want it to.</li>
      <li>It is stiff enough to easily brush my hair into place, but without leaving scratches in my scalp.  </li>
      <li>Though, it works just fine for shorter, thinner, and less facial hair (i.e. short goatee, mustache).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a major improvement to the look of my beard</li>
      <li>Used with a little beard oil, this helps maintain that fresh from the barber look.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are sturdy, and long enough to brush through large beards.</li>
      <li>This soft brush was the last item I added to the collection of essentials for beard grooming.</li>
      <li>The bristles are just right, not too firm, not too shot.</li>
      <li>Being my first beard brush, at the beginning it felt a little strange, I thought it wasn&#x27;t that soft, after all.</li>

    <li> This brush is super high quality! It works great on my short beard. It helps move your natural oils through your beard and soften the coarseness of the hair. It&#x27;s also great for working beard oils through evenly. This comb really poofs the beard and gets into all the hair and makes it look nice and full without pulling the hair. Also if you use it with the beard oil, the brush soaks up the smell and it smells amazing. Awesome brush! Great price! Soft, great size, definitely a man beard brush!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this beard brush for my fiancé. He got into this new trend of growing out his beard, however his beard started to look more messy than trendy. This Beardeur Boar Bristle Brush keeps his beard very well manicured. Ever since receiving this premium wooden brush his beard looks better than ever. I recommend this for any guy growing out his beard and for keeping their lady happy!!!</li>
    <li> This brush just feels like it was made well, as if it were handmade. The boar bristles are perfect for brushing out my beard, not too soft but not too firm. It&#x27;s very soothing to use on my beard and gives a good firm comb through. It helps keep my beard straight, neat, and presentable. Very happy with this beard brush.  I would happily recommend this product to anyone looking to keep a clean, gentleman like beard appearance. Thanks Beardeur!</li>

    <li> My husband has this wild manly beard and loves this brush. He uses it to spread beard balm through some of the rough parts and it works well with the balm to condition and hydrate his beard. The brush has boar bristles which helps with maintaining and mostly polishing his facial hair (this is something he repeats daily to me as he admires and brushes his beard in the morning!). My husband is very happy with it so I would recommend to anyone growing or maintaining a beard! This brush rocks! 10+ points to Beardeur for making my life simple!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the brush not for my beard, but for my hair.  I have thinning white hair that does not require a brush of extraordinary stiffness.  Yet I still wanted a quality boar bristle brush at a reasonable price.  This brush fits my needs perfectly.  It is stiff enough to easily brush my hair into place, but without leaving scratches in my scalp.  It is a perfect balance between stiff and soft.

    <li> Absolutely fantastic brush. I bought a beard kit that came with a generic bristle brush, but I bought this one and it is far superior. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> First beard brush, so don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but the bristles are smooth and feel good on my face. Great size, and is well made.</li>
    <li> This soft brush was the last item I added to the collection of essentials for beard grooming. Being my first beard brush, at the beginning it felt a little strange, I thought it wasn&#x27;t that soft, after all. It was just a matter of practice. Now I love it and I can&#x27;t wait to get home and massage my beard. I found this brush very useful in two moments: when I dry my beard with a hairdryer (low heat) and after applying oil or balm. It&#x27;s been a major improvement to the look of my beard, now it looks stylish and well groomed.</li>
    <li> I have really thick beard this Brush was able to Style it and make me go from homeless looking to Gentleman. Touch&#x27;s skin under the beard puts Beard oil in perfectly</li>
    <li> Very nice uncurls my beard very well</li>
    <li> This looks to be a great brush and was very much looking forward to using it. Alas, I have been forced to wait a bit before testing its magic. Between the time I placed the order and it arrived, I failed an annual cardiac stress test and now going in for a double bypass. Doc made me shave the beard and mustache (along with other places I won&#x27;t go into) as an infection precaution.&lt;br /&gt;I am very much looking forward to using this fine product while I grow the new one out starting in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> My finance LOVES this brush.  We bought beard oil and using this brush with the oil helps the hairs grow straighter and is its so smooth.  Also helps from having the hairs poke the sides of his lip.  Best purchase ever!  You have to order this brush.</li>
    <li> The bristles are just right, not too firm, not too shot. Really helps keep the beard looking and feeling great!</li>
    <li> This beard brush works well for my hubby&#x27;s facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is smooth, and fits well in your hand. The bristles are sturdy, and long enough to brush through large beards. Though, it works just fine for shorter, thinner, and less facial hair (i.e. short goatee, mustache). He even tried it on his eyebrows :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said it felt great, and his beard was soft after use, and has used it every day since we got it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a really nice little box - they really didn&#x27;t skimp on the details!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great gift for any man in your life with facial hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review*</li>
    <li> Great brush with real boar hairs. So far this has done everything I want it to. Now if it can convince the mrs that my beard is cool it&#x27;ll be the greatest brush of all time!</li>
    <li> I used to occasionally use a random brush or comb to freshen up my beard. Now I use this, and if I lost it, I would immediately replace it. It does a great job of wrangling in wild hairs somehow just making my face feel happy and refreshed. Also, the presentation/packaging of the product is quite nice and makes me feel like this is a special product - even though it goes in the garbage.</li>
    <li> This is a great high quality product for an amazing price! Extremely quick shipping! Thank you very much! I am definately going to spread the word to all of our friends!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great.. untangles facial hair...</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my head hair not my face hair. I like it very much. The packaging is much higher quality than a similar brush I bought from Duluth Trading Co. a few years ago</li>
    <li> The Beardeur Beard Brush is the perfect size and has the perfect bristle texture to smooth out beard and distributes beard oil perfectly.  Having sensitive skin this does not irritate my skin under my beard and does not pull hairs either.  I would highly recommend this brush to any of my bearded brothers reading this review.</li>
    <li> Perfect! My boyfriend uses it for his hair since he doesn&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
