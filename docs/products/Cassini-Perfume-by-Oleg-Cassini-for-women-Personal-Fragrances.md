      <li>Love this Stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;they ok&#x27;d my return, and yes, the customer service rep did indicate they saw TASSINI...</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it and took to sniffing the lid of the bottle when I had used it all up.</li>
      <li>So easy to get through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It used to be a fantastic perfume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m familiar with the perfume</li>
      <li>This is not the original Cassini.</li>
      <li>I really do love it so much</li>

      <li>i have been using Cassini perfume since the early 90s&#x27; when it first came out.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>More of a evening type fragrance, much to heavy for daytime, I think.</li>
      <li>stuff - the new formulation &amp; bottle - ain&#x27;t even close.</li>
      <li>I even called New York and told them so.</li>
      <li>I feel completely ripped off!</li>
      <li>but it smells like the lid of the original and seems to last as long.</li>
      <li>I miss the old Oleg Cassini.</li>
      <li>knock-off or old.  </li>
      <li>It makes the statement that this is a mature woman who is not to be trfelled with.  </li>
      <li>It smells ten years old!</li>
      <li>The new bottle did not have cellophane wrapping and the gold lid is loose (like its a second)</li>

    <li> Awful.  Not as I remembered it.  I think this product was past its shelf life.</li>
    <li> I miss the old Oleg Cassini. Square frosted bottle, mauve color, gold detail. Such a shame what was done to this brand. The old stuff, the good stuff, from 1978 is in the mold of others released by top American designers of the time, such as Halston, Vanderbilt, &amp; Blass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff - the new formulation &amp; bottle - ain&#x27;t even close.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and packaged very well.  Love Cassini! Smells wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I think this is a terrible smelling fragrance. But it does teach me not to buy fragrance online.</li>
    <li> I was terribly disappointed,p.  I have always loved Cassini before ,purchasing it from  another source.  This was much cheaper and must be a &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34; !  So sad, I can&#x27; t stand it! It is back in the box and I can&#x27;t return it because there is no return address.</li>
    <li> i have been using Cassini perfume since the early 90s&#x27; when it first came out.  i&#x27;m VERY aware of the strength of the fragrance, the bottle it comes in, and most importantly HOW LONG IT LASTS ON MY PERSON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i received the Cassini from amazon.com, of course it was in the cassini box, with the cassini wrapping paper, BUT it did not have the words \\&quot;CASSINI\\&quot; on the bottle!  i still had my bottle from my last on-line order from another company, and pulled it out to compare.  Guess WHAT???  the bottle from them had the name on the bottle...hint number 1!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the main issue i noticed was when i first took the perfume out of the box, i smelled the top where the perfume comes out (BEFORE i sprayed it), and it did NOT have the same strong smell...i then sprayed it on myself, and noticed the smell didn&#x27;t last...NOR did i receive any compliments on the scent like i ALWAYS do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i gave it another chance on a different day, same thing...smell didn&#x27;t last.  that did it!  i was returning it.  bad thing was...when i went on the amazon.com website to do the return, amazon said returns were within 30 days...they didn&#x27;t say \\&quot;NOT on perfume\\&quot; though!!!  there was NO box to check on my multiple item list, nor a phone number for amazon to call and ask HOW to return the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i then started snooping around on the website, and low and behold...what did i find out???  CASSINI is NOT CASSINI, but is from a company called TASSINI!!!  i was livid!!!  then i saw i could email questions to amazon, which i promptly did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they ok&#x27;d my return, and yes, the customer service rep did indicate they saw TASSINI...to which i was credited back my amount i paid.  i responded back and asked WHY they didn&#x27;t mention in their advertisement that it is a cassini KNOCK-OFF...i got no response...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;never again...i will always use other companies to order my perfume.  the return was done, however, i feel i had to earn my money back though...</li>
    <li> I first smelt this perfume about 6 years ago. I purchased a tester bottle from a Perfume Connection shop (I think )at my local shopping mall for about $10.00 (as it was not full and had no box). I fell in love with it and took to sniffing the lid of the bottle when I had used it all up. After deciphering the tiny Cassini sticker on the bottom I trawled the internet and found one.  Mine too came without gold writing on the bottle however the bottle I originally purchased did not have any writing on it either, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was the real thing(I kept it until I found another).  The new bottle did not have cellophane wrapping and the gold lid is loose (like its a second) but it smells like the lid of the original and seems to last as long.</li>
    <li> This has been my signature scent for many years.  It makes the statement that this is a mature woman who is not to be trfelled with.  The delivery of a perfect package was prompt and very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This Eau De Parfum is strong, yet very sexy, a little will go a long way.  More of a evening type fragrance, much to heavy for daytime, I think.</li>
    <li> This is not the original Cassini. I even called New York and told them so. They did not care. So I stopped trying to find the real thing. I used Cassini since it came out and this has been changed. It is a shame. It used to be a fantastic perfume. Now it smells like Raid.</li>
    <li> love it. very refreshing fragrance</li>
    <li> Love the scent. It&#x27;s an everyday perfume. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not even a one star, but you don&#x27;t have an option for a negative rating. It smells ten years old! Nothing like what it smells like in the store. If I could have returned it, I would have. I feel completely ripped off!</li>
    <li> best valuei I ve .found</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for years. I really do love it so much sometimes I think I may use too much!</li>
    <li> Thank you, my 86 years old auntie could not believe I found her favorite perfume, I&#x27;ll try again in the future!!! Matilde</li>
    <li> This perfume is rancid. The date on the Unwrapped box says 1990. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually that old, but it has definitely gone bad. I&#x27;m familiar with the perfume and I know what it should smell like and it&#x27;s absolutely not this. Am going to attempt to return it.</li>
    <li> This product* actually stinks*. Returning! Note to self and others: there is no name printed on the bottle and it&#x27;s missing it&#x27;s tassel...</li>
    <li> Love this Stuff. I always have someone tell me how wonderful I smell when I wear it. I will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my niece, she loves the stuff.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores.  So easy to get through Amazon.  Love Cassini  and have been using it for many years.  Happy to know I can get it through Amazon!</li>
    <li> knock-off or old.  did not smell good.</li>
