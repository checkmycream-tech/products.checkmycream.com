      <li>I recommend Tarte BB Cream for anyone looking for a great cream -</li>
      <li>great product</li>
      <li>Great makeup, seems to match any type.</li>
      <li>Great all in one product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>Be prepared that it comes out of tube grey-ish in color, but magically blends to skin tone perfectly!!!</li>
      <li>It has a good spf, and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup when I wear it.</li>
      <li>Aside from it being my foundation, it does good things for my skin</li>
      <li>Good product</li>
      <li>This foundation has good coverage but the oil separates from the foundation and you have to shake it before you use</li>
      <li>I bought this item for my mother in law and she loved it.</li>
      <li>I find this product blends perfectly and gives my skin a light glow.</li>
      <li>Just tried Dr. Brandt this morning and it turned my fair skin</li>
      <li>So, if you have fair skin you want to rub it in a lot</li>
      <li>Sometimes I use a light finishing powder over I&#x27;m wearing it at night because it does leave my skin glowing and a bit shiny (but not too much - perfect for a daytime look).  </li>
      <li>but I saw good reviews....</li>
      <li>but it does blend in nicely and looks good.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Love it and ordered a bottle for my mother!</li>
      <li>Favorite cosmetic product!</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>my makeup artist kept assuring me to trust him, so glad I did!</li>
      <li>what more could you want in a foundation!</li>
      <li>This product as advertised is good for most skin types.</li>
      <li>I am a new convert to BB cream, and this is the one I like best of the 3 I have tried.  </li>
      <li>This product, even applied very lightly, has a conspicuous orange tone.</li>
      <li>Aside from that, I&#x27;m a HUGE fan!</li>
      <li>I LOVE DR.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product many times.  </li>
      <li>but I really do love it.  </li>
      <li>The price I paid was much better than going rate though I will probably purchase more</li>
      <li>It does give a nice light coverage without looking like I have makeup on.  </li>
      <li>I have some under eye circles and it covered them for the most apart.</li>
      <li>This may work better on lighter skin.  </li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t give any hint of a healthy glow whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Smashbox works better on darker skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin but not so fair that I do not find other products with fair skin options that are transparent.</li>
      <li>The result is beautiful color that is very natural.</li>
      <li>Becoming more and more a fan of this brand.</li>
      <li>What I love about this product is how easily it blends with your skin tone.</li>
      <li>I expect this brand would have a very good quality BB cream especially considering the price.</li>
      <li>I take very good care of my skin, you know, sunblock, gentle skin soap, moisturizers day and night, hats when I&#x27;m out in the sun, so I can&#x27;t really tell if my skin is better for using this product.</li>
      <li>It did make my skin feel good and look radiant, perhaps even with too much of a glow</li>
      <li>This cream gives great natural looking coverage that is fine for both every day use as well as evening</li>
      <li>It covers well and blends easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and quite particular about the quality of my beauty products.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this makes my skin look creamy and smooth but the best is not having to buy foundation for different season;).</li>
      <li>.it&#x27;s the first bb cream I have tried because I&#x27;ve heard amazing things about bb</li>
      <li>Works fine for me.</li>
      <li>Also,it arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great that it has SPF 30 in it, I really do enjoy that part, but the sunscreen smell is why I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even work as well at covering blemishes as cheap cover up.</li>
      <li>Looks like those cheap tanning products on my skin.</li>
      <li>so it will smoothly go on.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s about the only thing I find truly great about this product.</li>
      <li>It really is self adjusting which was the amazing part to me.  </li>
      <li>It takes about 10 minutes for it to really settle nicely onto my skin after I apply it.</li>
      <li>And I didn&#x27;t see any significant difference in the look of my face make-up free vs. this.</li>
      <li>I am 20, so I still have acne prone skin and this BB cream does an awesome job covering it up and any uneven spots!</li>
      <li>I love, love the way this foundation leaves my skin so natural looking.  </li>
      <li>it has full coverage, a built in primer and 30 spf.  </li>
      <li>I just really like that my pores look much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 59 years old and haven&#x27;t always worn foundation and when I did, it didn&#x27;t look all that nice.  </li>
      <li>(I have fair skin with yellow undertones)</li>
      <li>It goes on grayish but adjusts quickly to your complexion.</li>
      <li>It also makes your skin look super greezy.</li>
      <li>Great product, took my skin a few days to get use to it, broke out a bit but now no problems.</li>
      <li>I find BB cream totally amazing, especially flattering to my ageing skin.  </li>
      <li>This cream is worth the investment and has now become a staple for me.</li>
      <li>As far as make-up goes, this stuff is as easy as it gets.</li>
      <li>Was really surprised how well the color matches my skin tone(fair and burns easily).  </li>
      <li>I squeezed an amount out on the top of my left hand and used my right index finger to apply.  </li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied!</li>
      <li>again, because of Dr. Brandt reputation, thought i would try a higher end BB cream.</li>
      <li>This is my first try at a BB cream..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a problem, but the first time it happened I was convinced I was bleeding from my pores.</li>
      <li>This tube is pretty speedy.</li>
      <li>It does a good job to cover up my imperfections without feeling heavy or looking caked on.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t shake it up really well, you may get a very fine red streak on your face.</li>
      <li>Quite honestly, the Garnier BB creme I bought at the drugstore for less than half of the price is just as good.</li>
      <li>I prefer the Smashbox bb creme as it offers a more natural look for my tone and a glow.</li>
      <li>Not only is it gentle but it works 10x better than any anti aging cream she has used.</li>
      <li>I take it with me pretty much anywhere</li>
      <li>That is the whole point of products like this anyway.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use too much and can&#x27;t be blamed for not blending it well</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my absolute, must have beauty item. I take it with me pretty much anywhere I go. It works wonderfully as a moisturizer and a foundation to make my skin even with a glowing, dewy, look to it. I am 20, so I still have acne prone skin and this BB cream does an awesome job covering it up and any uneven spots! It takes about 10 minutes for it to really settle nicely onto my skin after I apply it. Multiple people have written bad reviews about this product, saying that it looks too much like a fake tan or too dark..you really only need a tiny little bit and it starts out as a dark shade, but as you rub it in, it becomes lighter. So, if you have fair skin you want to rub it in a lot so it doesn&#x27;t look obvious. I have medium to tan skin and it really doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get it to match, so don&#x27;t go crazy!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It comes out this weird color and then OH MY it matches my skin perfectly! I LOVE DR. BRANDT! Seriously everything from this company amazes me! I didn&#x27;t believe it would truly match my skin and my makeup artist kept assuring me to trust him, so glad I did! I&#x27;ve gotten three compliments on it. &amp;#34;what foundation are you wearing? it&#x27;s excellent!&amp;#34; Buy buy buy</li>
    <li> This product was totally disappointing. It is greasy, heavily scented, and despite its claim to match your skin tone, it is a dark brown. My skin burned when I put it on.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin on my cheeks, chin &amp; nose. My cheeks are also very red. What I love about this product is how easily it blends with your skin tone. It does a good job to cover up my imperfections without feeling heavy or looking caked on. I use it as my only foundation &amp; go over it with a translucent powder on my forehead &amp; oilier areas. Great all in one product.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and rub it in really well. The result is beautiful color that is very natural.</li>
    <li> This cream gives great natural looking coverage that is fine for both every day use as well as evening (I am 45 years old).  It really is self adjusting which was the amazing part to me.  I definitely recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my mother in law and she loved it. She buys all kinds of creams for her face that hadls harsh chemicals in them so I introduced her to Dr. Brandt&#x27;s bb cream. It worked within minutes. It covered her dark areas around her eyes and mixed in with her skin tone. Not only is it gentle but it works 10x better than any anti aging cream she has used. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I tend to not want to wear foundation in the summer. This is e first tinted moisturizer that actually works! I have some under eye circles and it covered them for the most apart. This tube is pretty speedy. But, it lasts a long, long time! I bought it at the beginning of summer and I still have a ton left. A ton!  I will say that it it best to put this on when. Ou get out of the shower when you face is still moist. Sometimes when I put it on, my face feels too dry to get this stuff to even go on your face. Sometimes, I will rub a little moisturizer (a tiny, tiny amount!) so it will smoothly go on. Also, when you put this on,  Give your face a few minutes to dry before you put on the rest of our make-up. I read some reviews tha said it seemed a little gray on their face, but I think if they put it on too thick, or maybe didn&#x27;t let it dry, I could see how they would maybe think that. I think they say this is for all shades of skin colors, I am not sure how a fair skinned person could wear this, but I could be wrong.</li>
    <li> again, because of Dr. Brandt reputation, thought i would try a higher end BB cream. The texture is very heavy and does not go on smoothly, nor does it provide the result that i expected, and that was advertised. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I ordered a sample size of this bb cream, I&#x27;m very impressed.  My skin look flawless, not cakey.  Its a must buy product for those who hate foundation.</li>
    <li> Great makeup, seems to match any type.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this is the one foundation I&#x27;ve found (dept store quality) that doesn&#x27;t cake up and actually goes on smooth and blends into my skin.  it goes on slightly darker than i need but it seems to adjust over time. Aside from that, I&#x27;m a HUGE fan!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many BB Creams, this was the worst.  It&#x27;s thin, smells like suncreen and is way too dark! (I have fair skin with yellow undertones) I recommend Tarte BB Cream for anyone looking for a great cream - it has full coverage, a built in primer and 30 spf.  The BEST there is!  Everytime I try something new, I go back to Tarte.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this BB cream.</li>
    <li> This may work better on lighter skin.  It almost had a gray finish on my olive toned skin.  Smashbox works better on darker skin.</li>
    <li> I was unsure about this stuff but I really do love it.  It covers extremely well and gives my face a glowing look.  I&#x27;m 59 years old and haven&#x27;t always worn foundation and when I did, it didn&#x27;t look all that nice.  I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> It covers well and blends easily. Not too greasy. Last for me at work. I did notice this one it tinted darker than the orginal one i bought from sephora. I dont notice anything else different. Works fine for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times.  I like it because I can put it on not worry about reapplying all day.  The issue is it is really hard to blend.  I often feel like my face has stage make-up or the wrong shade.</li>
    <li> When my friends saw me for the first time, with no makeup, except for my Flexitone BB Cream from Dr. Brandt, first one told me I was glowing, then when the others showed up, they all said the same thing! They complimented me on how beautiful my skin was with &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34;! They couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing it. I did not correct them, I just told them I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Brandt skincare products lately. :)</li>
    <li> Becoming more and more a fan of this brand. It really does blend in well with your skin without looking obvious. That is the whole point of products like this anyway. You want an improvement in looks without looking like you did anything to improve it. This does just that!</li>
    <li> although this product is supposed to blend into any skin tone, it is too light for my medium skin and leaves my skin looking too pale to wear alone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I am not too impressed by the way it feels on my face but it does blend in nicely and looks good.</li>
    <li> I would have given this cream 5 stars if it were a little more moisturizing.  I only apply it over a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely stays on well and has decent coverage but it doesn&#x27;t give any hint of a healthy glow whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This foundation has good coverage but the oil separates from the foundation and you have to shake it before you use it don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s made that way or if the product is just old..</li>
    <li> Favorite cosmetic product! I can use as little or as much as I want to get different effects. My skin has also improved since using this product!</li>
    <li> I had never worn a BBC cream tried this as seen in \\&quot; O\\&quot; for the color have been using this for a year and a half my husband of 43 years said I was glowing .family and friends who had not seen  me for awhile asked,if I had something done to my face. My face no longer looks cakey from the high priced foundations I was using  color matches my skin perfectly  great product</li>
    <li> Terrible color for my skin and terrible FOR my skin.  I found it oily and it made me break out badly.  Not good :(</li>
    <li> I love, love the way this foundation leaves my skin so natural looking.  Sometimes I use a light finishing powder over I&#x27;m wearing it at night because it does leave my skin glowing and a bit shiny (but not too much - perfect for a daytime look).  It has sun protection and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores so I&#x27;ve continued using for over three years.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> This is the first coverup that actually hides the pores on my nose.  With a  little help from face powder, my pores are virtually invisible. Very light weight, so you&#x27;ll need concealer for blemishes or spots, but I&#x27;ve always used concealer in combination with the other foundations. I take very good care of my skin, you know, sunblock, gentle skin soap, moisturizers day and night, hats when I&#x27;m out in the sun, so I can&#x27;t really tell if my skin is better for using this product. I just really like that my pores look much better. Kinda pricey.</li>
    <li> Great product, took my skin a few days to get use to it, broke out a bit but now no problems. Love it and ordered a bottle for my mother! Will reorder again!</li>
    <li> This product as advertised is good for most skin types. That is absolutely not true. I have fair skin but not so fair that I do not find other products with fair skin options that are transparent. This product, even applied very lightly, has a conspicuous orange tone. Looks like those cheap tanning products on my skin. Very unsatisfied!</li>
    <li> This came really fast (4 days earlier than the expected delivery date) .it&#x27;s the first bb cream I have tried because I&#x27;ve heard amazing things about bb and this one had great reviews. First of all the tube is minuscule, and appears to be about 1/3 empty straight out of the package. This factor alone makes the price a ripoff. And I didn&#x27;t see any significant difference in the look of my face make-up free vs. this. Didn&#x27;t even work as well at covering blemishes as cheap cover up. It does self adjust like it claims but that&#x27;s about the only thing I find truly great about this product.</li>
    <li> Good product but doesn&#x27;t last long! The price I paid was much better than going rate though I will probably purchase more</li>
    <li> The product looks grey on my skin. I&#x27;m light/med olive Hispanic.  I prefer the Smashbox bb creme as it offers a more natural look for my tone and a glow. I&#x27;ll keep this for days that I need the extra spf 30.</li>
    <li> Apparently I am not &amp;#34;most skins&amp;#34;. I can&#x27;t be the palest person on Earth, so I don&#x27;t know how &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; people could use this, unless Oompa Loompas have taken over. It doesn&#x27;t matter how thin a layer I apply, it turns orange on my skin and leaves a HORRIBLE dark demarcation line on my jaw no matter how much I blend. I have used dozens of different BB Creams and this one that claims to be self adjusting is the least adjusting one I&#x27;ve ever used. I was downright shocked since Dr Brandt has never done me wrong before. I&#x27;ll stick to his normal skincare line but give this one a wide berth. It looks like I&#x27;ve applied an instant tan lotion to my skin. I hate to waste products so I mix it with other BBs to tone it down and only use it around the house. It also makes your skin look super greezy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find coverage that looks natural so I keep trying different products.  Now with the BB creams in the market, I decided to try this and I like it a lot. Aside from it being my foundation, it does good things for my skin (as I understand), it also photographs well (meaning it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing cake makeup in photos.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second tube and I still like it.</li>
    <li> I am a new convert to BB cream, and this is the one I like best of the 3 I have tried.  The color actually does blend with whatever skin tone you have, and even when carelessly applied does not leave a makeup line.  I find BB cream totally amazing, especially flattering to my ageing skin.  Gives a youthfull &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look to counter that powdery look older skin sometimes gets.</li>
    <li> Was really surprised how well the color matches my skin tone(fair and burns easily).  I also like the coverage.</li>
    <li> I was quite surprised to find that a Dr. Brandt product would be so disappointing compared to products I have bought at CVS!  This is supposed to adjust to one&#x27;s skin tone but it does not as it results in a very dark coverage of my skin -- about 3 shades darker than my natural tone.  I would not buy this again and have resorted to mixing it with another BB cream to achieve a lighter shade and not waste this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Korean BB creams and will stick with those. Just tried Dr. Brandt this morning and it turned my fair skin 3 shades darker - I had to put on my neck and chest so I didn&#x27;t look crazy with a white neck and orange face, but in the end still ended up looking like an Oompa-Loompa!</li>
    <li> This cream is fairly thick and when it goes on it does not glide very smoothly so you get a high concentration of orangey looking skin wherever you try to spread it around</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin look creamy and smooth but the best is not having to buy foundation for different season;). When I&#x27;m tan it blends as well as when I am pale and protects my skin what more could you want in a foundation!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Dr. Brandt&#x27;s skin care line, so when this cream came out, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.  Sadly, I&#x27;m returning it for a full refund.  It does NOT \\&quot;blend\\&quot; with my skin tone, it doesn&#x27;t even come close.  It has an orange tinge to it that dried and made me look like a clown.  I didn&#x27;t use too much and can&#x27;t be blamed for not blending it well, I assure you I know how to apply it.  It did make my skin feel good and look radiant, perhaps even with too much of a glow (I prefer a matte finish), but it did not cause any blemishes, just another return/refund headache.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and quite particular about the quality of my beauty products.  Unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t even get one star, can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t recommend!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend. Now that I have used it, I&#x27;m not sure how I ever lived with out it!!! I have also tried other brands of BB Cream, none of them compare to Dr. Brandt&#x27;s. Be prepared that it comes out of tube grey-ish in color, but magically blends to skin tone perfectly!!! This cream is worth the investment and has now become a staple for me.</li>
    <li> i dont even give it a one its a 0 this product is so bad it does not cover anything your face looks so grecy its sad and it stings going on the skin and taking it off !!!!!!!!!!!ong  i hate trial and error i work so hard for my money this stuff should be a dollor so bad dont buy it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have olive skin and have had trouble finding a natural light weight BB crream. This is it! I wasn&#x27;t sure because it is a little expensive but I saw good reviews....I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s very natural, light weight but enough coverage too! I&#x27;m very happy! Also,it arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> I have yellow undertones to my skin and a light-medium complexion. I find this product blends perfectly and gives my skin a light glow. It provides medium coverage. I am very happy with it</li>
    <li> As far as make-up goes, this stuff is as easy as it gets. It has a good spf, and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup when I wear it. In comparison,  if I&#x27;m not wearing it, I look like I haven&#x27;t slept in a month and I have been living on vodka gimlets. Since I do sleep and I don&#x27;t live on vodka, I&#x27;d say this stuff does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that&#x27;s a bit weird about it... there seem to be colored mineral grains of some sort in there. If you don&#x27;t shake it up really well, you may get a very fine red streak on your face. You just rub it in and it blends well. It&#x27;s not a problem, but the first time it happened I was convinced I was bleeding from my pores.</li>
    <li> I expect this brand would have a very good quality BB cream especially considering the price. Quite honestly, the Garnier BB creme I bought at the drugstore for less than half of the price is just as good.</li>
    <li> Goes on well and stays - very beautiful finish. It goes on grayish but adjusts quickly to your complexion. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I am not a wearer of foundation, so I thought I would give this a try for a little something when my moisturizer isn&#x27;t quite enough.  I have dry skin with yellow/pink undertones.  I shook this up well, and applied a very small amount as suggested by other reviewers.  It does give a nice light coverage without looking like I have makeup on.  I don&#x27;t know how much I would trust the SPF though, as I have to apply so little of the product to get the look I&#x27;m after.  This cream sells for $39 in Sephora, so why they are saying list price is $65?!</li>
    <li> This is my first try at a BB cream..I got it as a sample. I like how it spreads and covers, but what I can&#x27;t get past is the sunscreen smell. It&#x27;s great that it has SPF 30 in it, I really do enjoy that part, but the sunscreen smell is why I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> If you have used Asian BB creams before, these western BB creams don&#x27;t even compare.  If you are looking for a tad bit coverage, I don&#x27;t think this one really does much.  I squeezed an amount out on the top of my left hand and used my right index finger to apply.  The product comes out ashy gray but as you dip your finger to pick up some cream, you can see the immediate change of color.  It looked orangey with streaks of red (I guess it&#x27;s processing the color changing) and when applied to your skin, give it some time and you&#x27;ll see it blend to your skin.  I have oily combination skin so the product seemed to make my face a bit shiny throughout the day.  After a few hours, I feel yucky and want to take it off.  I&#x27;ll pass on this product and use something else.</li>
