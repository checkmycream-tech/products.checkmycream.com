<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love them!!!! They curl very good and don&#x27;t take that long to heat up.</li>
    <li> The iron itself works fine. But the power cord is &amp;#34;pre-twisted&amp;#34; and it kinks up on itself and I am constantly having to stop and untangle the cord from itself.</li>
    <li> It broke after 2nd use.</li>
    <li> very nice, i love my buckles</li>
    <li> I like that it has a clamp to hold your hair, all other curling irons that are like this do not have a clamp, you have to use a glove and hold your hands in a awkward way, this is so much better. Please don&#x27;t stop making them with a clamp!</li>
    <li> The handle broke within a few days, thus it makes it hard or almost impossible to use anymore. It was a bad buy.</li>
    <li> Holds hair in place, easy to use and works on hard to curl hair. No need to use a glove</li>
    <li> I used this for a few weeks and loved it. Never set the temp very high. Used it this morning, almost to the lowest setting. Not only did it start smoking but it burnt my hair off. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for a trip to London. It works but does not heat up enough to hold a curl. My hair was straight about an hour after using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron twice so far and they have both broken. First the clamp broke off and now it won&#x27;t heat up. I love this curler but hate that I have to keep replacing it.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this curling iron so badly. I looked everywhere under the sun and online and finally got to Amazon and there it was. They shipped quickly and she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Curls like no other - and I have no other iron that keeps the curl like this.  even leaves a nice wave the day after.</li>
    <li> I love this wand it works fast and I don&#x27;t have to hold the hot wand to hold hair in place. It has a little handle to hold the very tip of hair in place. I give it 5 stars for quick curls. In a crazy hurried up morning for work, it gets the job done for me . It was very hard to find. But Amazon had it!!</li>
    <li> this is cheap don&#x27;t buy it. The clip broke only after the second use and was impossible to repair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THISS WAND THE BEST.. GOT IT ON TIME I DO MY HAIR EVERYDAYY WITH THIS IS THE BEST</li>
    <li> I really like this iron and the partial clip BUT it breaks constantly. I went through 3 in a year under the warranty.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light weight, easy to use, fast and the curl holds all day. Another great hair tool from Revlon! Great Value</li>
    <li> Really make you think,we should change the outdated laws.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package, the box that the curling iron came in was damaged and it had appeared that it had been opened.  When I took it out, there was hair in the box as well as in the clamp of the iron.  Very unsanitary and disgusting.  Needless to say, it&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> I have always been a little leery of curling tongs. Lots of stories of singed and burnt hair. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my daughter requested this curling tong, and I purchased it for her. She loves it. She has medium LNG thick hair, and her hair does curl easily. She uses thist on dry hair after she has blown her hair dry. She tells me it heats is quickly, it dies not burn, she laces some hair around the tong and it curls. It takes her about 10 mins to get all of her hair. The hair brushes out somewhat curly, and it stays that way all day. She us very pleased, and so am I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-22-14</li>
    <li> Barrell was smaller than I expected. This goes from about a 1/2&amp;#34; to a 3/4&amp;#34; barrel.</li>
    <li> This is a deformed curling iron with just an inch hair holder, it would cost me more to send back than it is worth, I am really disappointed and it arrived a day after promised.</li>
    <li> If this barrel was a bit wider I think i could get kore use out of it, also next time I would get one with a clamp.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s easy to use and gives me a great curl. It is not an expensive curling iron so don&#x27;t expect the quality of an expensive iron. For less than $20 I&#x27;m a happy girl with curly hair!!</li>
    <li> It curled as it should but the clamp broke after one week of use. Honestly, I feel it was a waste of money. I barely used it but somehow one of the few times I did, it just popped off. I didn&#x27;t press or twist at the clamp, it just popped off. I couldn&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> This is a good curling iron, especially for the price.  It makes beautiful curls.  It gets really hot really fast.  The only reason for the four stars is the clip to hold your hair in place is a little too short.</li>
    <li> I like the way this iron curls, but the spring has popped out 3 times, and after tightening the screws so many times, putting it back together, the insides, where the screw goes in, got stripped! I can&#x27;t use it because I can&#x27;t re-tighten the screw in place. Not sure what, or if there is a warranty on it.</li>
    <li> It was a little tough to get used to the short clamp though when used to a regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> I do not like this tool! its always traps my hair under the clip and it is never a smooth glide. Has a cheesy feel to it which is why it is lightweight. They should have put more effort and quality materials into the construction of this iron. I would not recommend this to no one else. spend the extra money and get something worthwhile. I dont like the type of curls the barrel produced.. which were more on the tighter side. Not what I want. Also the length was pretty short compared to most cone styling irons I have had. Not to mention how tight the cord would end up... did not like!</li>
    <li> Great concept and easy to use unlike the ones without a clip but not well made. I don&#x27;t abuse my things I have curling irons from 15 years ago that still work but these...... I&#x27;ve been through 3 since October of last year. That&#x27;s 9 months so on average they last about 3 months. The first the cord went. Second just stopped turning on. Third I&#x27;m not sure what happened it won&#x27;t power on at all. The issue for all 3 could very well be the cord which i would think is a fire hazard and worthy of a recall.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail and it was not good at all, it was broken and it didn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughters, as they have a regular iron - but wanted a wand. This items does precisely what it says - easy beautiful curls that are unique to this iron style. I am very satisfied with the quality and price of this product, and the color is perfect for a girl. I researched wands on other retail websites, and this one is truly the best price (especially with Prime and free shipping)! Although this is certainly not a professional iron, it does a great job!</li>
    <li> this is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair.  I love that it hods your hair in without having to use both hands.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I had one of the these and it stopped working so I had to buy another one. Love the clip I struggle with the new clipless irons and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Heats up quickly and gets very hot.</li>
    <li> Wonderful wand, it&#x27;s everything they claim it is. Heats up quickly, styles very well! Would recommend it for any hair type.Thanks for a great Amazon product.</li>
    <li> If you want the new ceramic wands but hate the idea of wearing an over-sized oven mitt to wrap your hair, this is for you!  It has the clip as well as the tourmaline ceramic wand, and it&#x27;s tapered which is better for more hairstyles once you learn how to use it.  Wonderful tool!</li>
    <li> works perfectly love it,</li>
    <li> Cheap, does not work the best for fine hair:(</li>
    <li> Exactly as it looks. It works really well! Heats up fast and easy to use! It works better when you use it on other people but it gets the job done for the price!</li>
    <li> It works, but it is hard for my daughter to figure out how to use it. Overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love how it have different temp options and I love the pink color its not as dark as the pi show it but I have long really thick hair and it gave me really nice curls just what I was looking for love this wand</li>
    <li> I love the clip at the bottom. I don&#x27;t burn my hands and this iron is very easy to use. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is I keep hitting the off button when I turn the iron to curl my hair. The button is very sensitive. I have never owned a cone style iron before and I love this one!</li>
    <li> Nice iron. A little small for how much hair I have. Puts a little too much curl in my hair. Good product otherwise</li>
    <li> Broke 1st time i used it, the clip snapped and cant use at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wish i knew how to return.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not long enough but the clip helps. I&#x27;m not good at using it seems like the clip is on the wrong side.</li>
    <li> The on button did not stay lit and the curling iron did not warm.  I returned this after one day and did not repurchase it.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever....im hespanic and i have very thick long straight hair and its really hard to curl and keep curled....i mean i could curl it of course but my hair is so thick that by the time im finish, the other half of my hair is half straightened curls..i dont use hairspray with my curling iron either because it makes my hair crispy and ruins my curling iron so thats my last step of curling my hair...and this curling iron curls my hair beautiful...i curled my hair and it last all night till the next day. And also i burned and ! Mark on my arm wich sucked so be careful can burn very easily</li>
    <li> This was a great curling iron, but then it just STOPPING WORKING after a few weeks. Wouldn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
    <li> Love it !!!! Very easy to use</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a curling iron with a short clamp. I found this one at a drug store but it was more than I wanted to spend. So I checked Amazon. The same curling iron for $15 less!  It makes beautiful curls!  My husband calls my curly hair my \\&quot;fun\\&quot; hair!</li>
    <li> I love that it has the clasp!</li>
    <li> I loved it when I got it. It heats up super fast and works great! However after less than a year of almost daily use it just stopped heating up. Apparently not made for heavy long-term use.</li>
    <li> This was a piece of junk, it didnt even make it a month and it just stopped heating up. In frustration i just tossed it in the garbage.. i should i sent it back... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> Wand was just as described. Love the hold clip part. It makes it so much easier. Love this thing...</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get the Revlon Cone Stlying Iron because I use the Revlon curling irons and they are the best! But when I received this product (on time, of course) the gray part to curl your hair seemed pretty short and it wasn&#x27;t long enough to curl my long hair. My favorite part is the clip, it makes it easy to keep your hair in place so it doesn&#x27;t slide down. I was looking for a curling wand that would give me loose, beachy waves but this one gives tighter curls. If you are going for old Taylor Swift type curls, this is for you! It&#x27;s a great curling wand with the adjustable heat and clip, I just wanted looser curls and this product just wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Good deal for the price. If you are used a curling iron, this is a nice way to transition to this type of curl.</li>
    <li> Gets caught and pulls on your hair!!! I have hair stuck on the wand from it taring out my hair. I&#x27;m so upset the last one I had was amazing!!! I was hoping for the same with this one! I&#x27;m very disappointed  &amp;#34;(</li>
    <li> Gave this to my My daughter for Christmas.  She got to use this iron once and made some really pretty spiral type curls in her hair, however the next time she went to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t heat up, at all.  So, she only got one use out of it before it quit working.</li>
    <li> It is harder to use then I thought it would be.  And my hair is thicker so it&#x27;s harder to curl and doesn&#x27;t like to stay curled.  I only bought to use up my points on a credit card before I closed the account so it wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;I need this&amp;#34; kind of thing, just something to play around w/.  As I get use to it I am sure it&#x27;ll get easier.</li>
    <li> I LOVE how hot it gets, I love how it curls... But mine don&#x27;t last long... Something inside stops working, so it won&#x27;t turn on anymore... I&#x27;m now going to order a 3rd one!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this curling iron for about six months. And I loved it. I loved how hot it could get, that I could curl my hair two different ways, it was longer than my old curling iron I felt that it was perfect (except that it was pink. I don&#x27;t really love pink enough). However two weeks ago the spring on the lever stopped working and then came out altogether. I tried to put it back together with a screwdriver but the screw wouldn&#x27;t tighten enough to keep the spring in place. So i took the lever off altogether. Now the rod is flimsy, i feel like it&#x27;s going to come apart on me as I curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Now a year later I tried putting it back together again and turning it on-- nothing. The curling iron is dead. I hope you guys have better luck than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really sad that a curling iron I loved could break so easily. Usually I&#x27;ve been proud of revlon ( my old curling iron is a revlon and i&#x27;ve had it for more than ten years) but this was just disappointing.  2 stars and I would buy it again if it wouldn&#x27;t fall apart on me.</li>
    <li> I loved this curling iron, but it survived all of two months before it simply stopped heating up. Now it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair tool!  I have another hair wand, but it didn&#x27;t have the clip at the bottom so I was never able to master it.  This has a clip and holds the hair.  I can use this and my hair will stay curled for 2 days!</li>
    <li> I had to buy another in case my first went out or broke!  I love what this iron does with my hair.  I get tons of compliments every time I use it and the best part is the curl STAYS IN!!!  I have even went 4 days without doing anything to my hair because it still looked so good!  8 of my colleagues and friends have also purchased one.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It was good while it worked.. It stopped working after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand. It heats up really fast and curls my hair really well. I have no complaints and the price point was perfect for my budget!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is the best curling iron I have ever had. I have thick and coarse hair, so it takes a certain curling iron to do the job. This curling iron is the one, the curls last from morning to night. The customer service is great and they are very nice. I highly recommend it, it makes beautiful curls and I have never gotten so many compliments.</li>
    <li> My daughter needed an iron and everything out there right now has a &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34; to help you get the hair on the iron.  This one has a clip to hold the hair in place.  It makes a great curl and is a great price.  I highly recommend it.  Also the girls won&#x27;t burn their hands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very easy to wrap around you hair. I would rather it have a chrome finish like a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. Mine was bought first, and my daughter borrowed it so much that I bought her one when she went to college.  I like the graduated cone on the barrel so all your curls aren&#x27;t identical, for a more natural look.  The ceramic finish also leaves the hair shiny.  And pink is fun...</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully. I have had this for several months now and I have no problems with it at all, it&#x27;s easy to use and I love it.</li>
    <li> my favorite curler I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. It&#x27;s cheap but gets the job done. I would definitely buy it!</li>
    <li> The first time I tried to use it it short-circuited and heated up suddenly, burning off a chunk of my hair. Then it went cold and would not heat up again. I am returning the product for a refund.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I first purchased the styling iron but dissapointed when it arrived.  Only because my hair is so long and the wand is not too long, also it did not come with a glove therefore it is a bit too difficult for me to hold my hair on wand with out getting slightly burned.  I&#x27;ve only used once since I purchased.  It will be good for women whose hair does not come down past your waist.</li>
    <li> The curls stay for a long time, it heats up fast, very good price.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Curls look natural</li>
    <li> I love that these have a little clip at the end to hold the hair, just wish the clip held tighter.  I&#x27;ve had multiple of this version, and they don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like, but I can&#x27;t find another company that has this size barrel and the clip to hold the hair.  I have to replace about once a year, most of them stop warming up.</li>
    <li> Quit heating after using it 5 times.  Does not get very hot.</li>
    <li> Probably the best curling iron I&#x27;ve used.  The curls this makes enhance my already naturally wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this styling iron it has the look and feel of a curling iron and curling wand in one. I love that it has a attacthment to hold the hair in place unlike traditional curling wands where you have to hold the hair in place  with you hands and risk burning your fingers. This styling iron makes the most beautiful curls. My last one I owned I purchased it at walmart and unfortunately they dont sell it anymore so I was happy to find it on amazon. Sadly my previous iron reached the end of its life one day and wouldnt power on anymore thats why I gave this product 4 stars. Over all its a great styling iron.</li>
    <li> It was too thin for me.</li>
    <li> Either I don&#x27;t know how to use this, or my hair is just not cut out (no pun intended) for this type of iron. Heats up quickly, no problem there. Usually, I burn my fingers.</li>
    <li> Love this curling Stick! I bought the first one from Walmart and used it for 5+ years before it quit working. Loved it so much that I searched the model number to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Third purchase, love the curls it makes. Only lasts a year but worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Doubles as a regular curling iron and a curling wand. . .only downside is it comes with no glove which can be difficult if you&#x27;re not use to using a curling wand.</li>
    <li> Broke after a few months</li>
    <li> works great. Hot enough for my 4a/b thick hair. i thought having a mini clip might make it difficult to use but it actually helped me get a tighter curl without burning myself</li>
    <li> Would have loved to give it 5 stars. It worked great the 6 times I used it, then the 7th, the clamp broke. Now I am looking for a quality made product. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I used this curling iron one time and then it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore!! I plugged it in the on light was on but it wouldn&#x27;t get hot! Not worth the money for only one use!!!!</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that its so easy to hit the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button.</li>
    <li> The multi temp control is a very nice feature! It is the perfect size to vary the diameter of your curls</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. Revlon is a good brand and I would buy this again,.</li>
