      <li>I tip the bottle onto the very top of my index finger, and pinch the end of my shoulder-length hair to apply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the perfect solution, but it does keep my normally straight hair from getting frizzy.</li>
      <li>I read about the Ojon in a People magazine, some celebrities swear by it as the results are great, but I cannot say that is true..</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel amazing and healthy</li>
      <li>If you have very fine and/or oily hair this may not be the product for you.  </li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and obviously I love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Morocan oil :)</li>
      <li>the product is def a grerat investment and works great on real hair and weaves.</li>
      <li>Love you this -</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful when you need some extra shine in your hair and</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Love the way it also makes my hair smell.</li>
      <li>So much better than just Moroccan oil.  </li>
      <li>I love this blend.  </li>
      <li>all of which I easily give 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I have really fine hair and use this sparingly.</li>
      <li>then I just LIGHTLY go over the rest of my hair.  </li>
      <li>The rare oil blend is a much heavier oil and even though I used it sparingly, my hair did not feel good to the touch after.  </li>
      <li>I then comb my hair, and it looks better and shinier right away.</li>
      <li>First of all, most people leaving reviews used too much of this product and their hair ended up oily.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was expecting!</li>
      <li>I apply about a quarter size amount to my hands and rub my palms together, the important step is to bend over at the waist and START applying at the very ends of your hair first!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a long time user of Morocan oil, and thought this might be a nice product to try.</li>
      <li>I am a true skeptic and did not expect much of anything from using this the first time.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, healthily looking after only a couple of drops.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not convinced, get the 0.5 oz container first.  </li>
      <li>my hair feel hydrated and not oily and smells pretty</li>
      <li>DO NOT add to your part line, however, or you will get really greasy looking hair!</li>
      <li>All of a sudden your hair is smooth, frizz free, soft, and shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair is so much healthier since I started using Ojon oil.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use too much or it will look oily.</li>
      <li>How you use this product and how much you use will determine the outcome.  </li>
      <li>Just remember to shake the product well to mix the three oils and to use VERY sparingly.  </li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, though I probably use more than most people.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with either curly or dry/damaged hair.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Mythic Oil or any Moroccan Oil in place of this.</li>
      <li>The good thing is that you only need to add the tiniest bit to see improvement, so one bottle will last a very long time.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing on naturally curly ethnic hair</li>
      <li>But Ojon Oil has my hair feel SO SOFT!</li>
      <li>My natural hair color is white!-so</li>
      <li>has helped returned my natural curls.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have used Ojon Damage Reverse Instant Restorative Hair Serum before  which leaves your hair silky, shiny and light, but is quite a bit more expensive as well.  </li>
      <li>The Ojon Rare Oil Therapy helps reduce dry ends and actually extends the time between hair cuts.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and thin so that may contribute to the greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I live in Florida and this is the only thing that works on my frizz.</li>
      <li>I have tried it several times and my hair really dont look any different</li>
      <li>This is my third bottle, I have very dry hair due to highlights and dying, I use this when my hair is washed I apply it prior to setting my hair, yes I still use rollers as the blow dryer will dry out my hair even more.  </li>

<li> I could barely get my comb through it and it took forever to dry my hair.</li>
<li> You really do use such a small amount that 0.5oz can last you a very long time.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a tad pricey, but it should last a long time.  </li>
<li> Second, blow dry your hair and maybe use flat iron.</li>
<li> I have tried it on damp hair and on dry hair and the result is similar.</li>
<li> My hair is very dry and curly and this is simply a miracle..</li>
<li> You really do not need but a &amp;#34;drop&amp;#34; and not a big drop.</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll be surprised, a little goes a very long way.</li>
<li> My hair is dry and damaged from over processing.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s really only meant to use a drop and concentrate on your ends otherwise your hair will be weighed down.</li>
<li> If you have very dry hair as I do, I recommend you try this oil.</li>
<li> The bottle is very small, and while a little goes a long way - even the smallest amount of this is too much.</li>
<li> just a little makes a big difference..</li>
<li> This product is not quite what I had expected.  </li>
<li> It also smells odd, like a spice shop or strange musk.  </li>
<li> When this oil is applied to damp hair the moisture is trapped into the hair and its not as dry.  </li>
<li> I have long (medium thick) hair that is very dry at the ends with a tendency towards an oilier scalp.  </li>
<li> not worth the money</li>
<li> I used a small amount on my hair and it made my hair a very strange, gummy, sticky consistency.</li>
<li> , I have black relaxed hair.  </li>
<li> It leaves a heavy, slightly tacky feel to your hair.  </li>
<li> A little is suppose to help make hair shiny and smooth&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
<li> Then slowly work your hands up to about the half way point.  </li>
<li> You just use a very little.</li>
<li> Even using a small drop.</li>
<li> I use all kinds of oils on my dark, coarse hair, and this is by far the worst one I have ever used.</li>
<li> At least for me.</li>
<li> The appearance of the hair after using the oil is of a dirty and heavy hair.</li>
<li> I hate having greasy hair, but my hair gets so dry in the winter I need to do something.</li>
<li> The problem is that it FEELS dirty.</li>
<li> Boy was I ever wrong!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product! Makes my hair feel amazing and healthy</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this along with an order I placed. I have only used it twice, and I am hooked!  My natural hair color is white!-so It is very coarse. I color it,and this only adds to the problem. But Ojon Oil has my hair feel SO SOFT! I knew I wanted to keep using it-I still have some of the sample, but I got more. This stuff is GREAT!</li>
    <li> I love this.makes my hair feel hydrated and not oily and smells pretty</li>
    <li> I hate having greasy hair, but my hair gets so dry in the winter I need to do something. This oil helps. I tip the bottle onto the very top of my index finger, and pinch the end of my shoulder-length hair to apply. I do this twice, once on each side. I then comb my hair, and it looks better and shinier right away. The problem is that it FEELS dirty. I think I would feel this way about any oil in my hair at all, however. I wash my hair every day, and enough of this hangs around that I only need to apply it every three days or so. It&#x27;s not the perfect solution, but it does keep my normally straight hair from getting frizzy. The good thing is that you only need to add the tiniest bit to see improvement, so one bottle will last a very long time. DO NOT add to your part line, however, or you will get really greasy looking hair! I used to use Moroccanoil, and a hairdresser taught me the trick of applying it to the ends, and then combing. Also, start with the tiniest amount. You can always add more. It smells nice, too!</li>
    <li> I use all kinds of oils on my dark, coarse hair, and this is by far the worst one I have ever used. I don&#x27;t understand how people like it at all. I used a small amount on my hair and it made my hair a very strange, gummy, sticky consistency. I could barely get my comb through it and it took forever to dry my hair. It also smells odd, like a spice shop or strange musk.  I would highly recommend L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Mythic Oil or any Moroccan Oil in place of this. I threw the bottle away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on reviews on another website. I&#x27;m a long time user of Morocan oil, and thought this might be a nice product to try. Boy was I ever wrong! The bottle is very small, and while a little goes a long way - even the smallest amount of this is too much. It left my hair greasy beyond belief.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Morocan oil :)</li>
    <li> this product was recommended by glamour magazine and then i saw an informercial for it so i caved in and brought it. the product is def a grerat investment and works great on real hair and weaves.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle, I have very dry hair due to highlights and dying, I use this when my hair is washed I apply it prior to setting my hair, yes I still use rollers as the blow dryer will dry out my hair even more.  When this oil is applied to damp hair the moisture is trapped into the hair and its not as dry.  I love it, I have black relaxed hair.  If you have very dry hair as I do, I recommend you try this oil.</li>
    <li> So much better than just Moroccan oil.  I love this blend.  A little goes a long way, though I probably use more than most people.  If you have very fine and/or oily hair this may not be the product for you.  I have long (medium thick) hair that is very dry at the ends with a tendency towards an oilier scalp.  How you use this product and how much you use will determine the outcome.  I apply about a quarter size amount to my hands and rub my palms together, the important step is to bend over at the waist and START applying at the very ends of your hair first!  Then slowly work your hands up to about the half way point.  This is probably all the product that you need.  If there is a tiny bit left on my hands then I just LIGHTLY go over the rest of my hair.  Don&#x27;t put this close to your roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the reviews I read were complaints about there not being a dropper on this bottle.  I think that is because you do have to shake the bottle to blend the oils together.  Can not say enough about the shine, silkiness and frizz fighting that this product provides.  I live in Florida and this is the only thing that works on my frizz.</li>
    <li> This product is not quite what I had expected.  It leaves a heavy, slightly tacky feel to your hair.  I have used Ojon Damage Reverse Instant Restorative Hair Serum before  which leaves your hair silky, shiny and light, but is quite a bit more expensive as well.

I have tried it on damp hair and on dry hair and the result is similar.</li>
    <li> Love you this - It has my hair looking very healthy</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it very much. The appearance of the hair after using the oil is of a dirty and heavy hair. Even using a small drop.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist starting using oil on my hair and wanted that &amp;#34;just out of the hair salon&amp;#34; feel at home. The Ojon Rare Oil Therapy helps reduce dry ends and actually extends the time between hair cuts. It also gives me that extra nourishment my hair needs. I have really fine hair and use this sparingly. It&#x27;s really only meant to use a drop and concentrate on your ends otherwise your hair will be weighed down.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with either curly or dry/damaged hair. I use it as a styling product, and occasionally as a deep conditions treatment, I douse my hair in it and leave it on for a few hours before washing, and my hair is so much smoother and easier to manage afterwards. And it smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> This is my fourth bottle if this and obviously I love it. Now I buy from Amazon and I don&#x27;t have to search for it!! Yay! My hair is very dry and curly and this is simply a miracle.. At least for me. My hair is shiny, healthily looking after only a couple of drops. Thank goodness for Amazon!!! You sell everything!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and damaged from over processing.  This product leaves you hair looking restored, shiny and not frizzy.  Just remember to shake the product well to mix the three oils and to use VERY sparingly.  You&#x27;ll be surprised, a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> this product is simply the bomb!  My hair is so much healthier since I started using Ojon oil.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair and I still use this sparingly!  Great for frizz and conditions your hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting! Great product - I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Again, I bought because of another Ojon hair treatment that I use and LOVE. My biggest issue with this product though is your hair looks oily and dirty after you put it in, even though its supposed to be a use and go kind of hair treatment. So, just be prepared to wash it out before you have to go anywhere&lt;br /&gt;-Jeanene</li>
    <li> Love it. Very moisturizing on naturally curly ethnic hair</li>
    <li> First of all, most people leaving reviews used too much of this product and their hair ended up oily.  You just use a very little. It shouldn&#x27;t even feel like you have any in your hair. Second, blow dry your hair and maybe use flat iron. As the heat starts working through your hair, this oil does miraculous things.  All of a sudden your hair is smooth, frizz free, soft, and shiny. It smells amazing, looks gorgeous. If you&#x27;re not convinced, get the 0.5 oz container first.  You really do use such a small amount that 0.5oz can last you a very long time.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft and shiny. Love the way it also makes my hair smell. has helped returned my natural curls.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful when you need some extra shine in your hair and just a little makes a big difference..don&#x27;t use too much or it will look oily.</li>
    <li> Did not see any results in this product. A little is suppose to help make hair shiny and smooth&lt;br /&gt;but not worth the money</li>
    <li> I am a true skeptic and did not expect much of anything from using this the first time.  I was amazed!  I can&#x27;t remember when I have seen my hair shine like it does.  It&#x27;s a tad pricey, but it should last a long time.  You really do not need but a &amp;#34;drop&amp;#34; and not a big drop.</li>
    <li> It smells good but it is just too greasy. My hair is very fine and thin so that may contribute to the greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;I use many Ojon products....shampoo/conditioner/volumizing spray/restorative hair treatment...all of which I easily give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> We love this product.</li>
    <li> I read about the Ojon in a People magazine, some celebrities swear by it as the results are great, but I cannot say that is true..I have tried it several times and my hair really dont look any different</li>
