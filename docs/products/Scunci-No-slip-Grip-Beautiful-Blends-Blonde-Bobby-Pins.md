### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was impressed with this product.  </li>
      <li>They blend in perfectly.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever been truly impressed.</li>
      <li>these are great bobby pins!</li>
      <li>good deal!</li>
      <li>Great quality.</li>
      <li>These are great if you have brown hair with highlights.</li>
      <li>The marble-y look on these is great.</li>
      <li>These are great bobbie pins if you have brown or streaked brown blond hair.  </li>
      <li>Great pins.....</li>
      <li>But they never tear my hair out and make my hair look great when I put them in.</li>
      <li>Work great at holding hear in place for about three hours</li>
      <li>do work great b/c</li>
      <li>These pins work great and match my medium brown hair color fairly well.  </li>
      <li>These bobby pins do a good job of holding my hair in place.  </li>
      <li>I loved them.</li>
      <li>They are of a good quality too.</li>
      <li>I love these no-slip grip bobby pins and have been using them for years!</li>
      <li>i especially love the 2 color options and they feel very durable!</li>
      <li>They are an amazing, timeless invention, brought about by the nuns of Pope Antoine IV.</li>
      <li>They also blend on nicely with my brown and auburn hair.</li>
      <li>but they come in handy for working out</li>
      <li>particular package is perfect for us both.</li>
      <li>I should preface this review with a warning that my hair is very fine, and most bobby pins do not work that well in it.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>now I have to use about 7 or more and my bun will still come undone.</li>
      <li>I think these work excellent and would definitely recommend these!</li>
      <li>By Thursday, I can&#x27;t find more than one.</li>
      <li>And I love scunci.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>They might work better for someone with thicker hair, or if you&#x27;re okay with one-time-use bobby pins.</li>
      <li>Love how they slide without pulling hair.</li>
      <li>These are better than Goody</li>
      <li>I love the color of these b/c they fit in well with my hair.</li>
      <li>The good things about these is that they dont pull your hair at all and the colors really mix with your hair if you are brunette.</li>
      <li>This shipped pretty fast, which was a good thing because I was running out of bobby pins!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought other brands before, and tried out some dollar store options and these are the best I can find, but I still find myself having to re-set bobby pins on the side or bottom of my head.</li>
      <li>Easily to put in and pull out of hair without snagging or pulling.</li>
      <li>My hair was dark brown into caramel ombre when I purchased these and the two tone pins blended in perfectly when I wore milkmaid braids.</li>
      <li>the darker pins look fine.  </li>
      <li>these are lined with something that provides light friction.</li>
      <li>I added these to my cart to get free shipping</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know how I can submit a decent review of bobby pins, but these were great.</li>
      <li>The original Scunci No-Slip Grip Bobby Pins were fabulous.</li>
      <li>Even when the pins went go in cleanly my updo falls apart.</li>
      <li>These are great for brunettes and look sooooo much better than their gold and black counterparts!</li>
      <li>However, I wish they were available in one single color, as the blended kind is more visible in my hair and the point of these pins is to keep them discrete.</li>
      <li>I love them very much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Otherwise, these last a long time and are a great value for money!</li>
      <li>do exactly what they are supposed to do...hold your hair in place!</li>
      <li>BUT, works exactly as bobby pins should!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say it was totally worth the price</li>
      <li>They have a sort of striping design to the color making them really shade friendly.</li>
      <li>I originally bought these in store, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As far as the functionality of these goes, they&#x27;re fine.  </li>
      <li>these definitely aren&#x27;t my favorite hairpins.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what i was looking for, product came just as advertised.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>These do not stay in my hair any better than regular bobby pins.  </li>
      <li>They bend and twist after the first use.  </li>
      <li>I love these because they match your hair well because of the pattern and different shades.</li>
      <li>Wish there was a more MIDDLE of the road tone.</li>
      <li>If you do not hold open the bobby pin when removing them &#x27;you will&#x27; rip out strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;These actually hold more hair and stay better than the Goody Snap Clips I purchased...</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are amazing and they always work extremely well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These bobby pins worked perfectly the first time, the second time I used them they slid down my hair as the day went on, and they didn&#x27;t do the job the third time.  </li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t actually need it, the pins are so flimsy they are easily opened.</li>
      <li>Enough to hold our hair in place, but not to strong that it rips it</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and a flirty design for somebody with Brunette hair (with or without highlights)</li>
      <li>they really do seem to just disappear from my head.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>She has blonde hair and mine is light brown.</li>
      <li>As a redhead, I really prefer the variegated.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using a different kind the skinny black pins which work far, far better.</li>
      <li>They also work incredibly well and don&#x27;t make you look juvenile like a lot of other bobby pins I&#x27;ve seen @</li>
      <li>gave 4 stars because I wish the entire card was full of these brown bobby pins.</li>
      <li>These are nice small hairpins.  </li>
      <li>These are your typical run-of-the-mill bobby pins, but revamped with colors that blend better with brunette hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight black hair and these really match quite well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i would highly suggest these to anyone</li>
      <li>They are the common shorter size of hairpins, not the longer kind.  </li>
      <li>More than half of the pins twist open sideways during the first use.</li>
      <li>They blend in really well, making them look a lot less cheap.  </li>
      <li>and I like how the bobby pins are not completely black but a dark and light brown.  </li>
      <li>My 6 year old daughter</li>
      <li>Conair / Scunci and any other company should be ashamed to put out such a cheap, inferior product.</li>
      <li>These bobby pins have made this heatwave stylishly bearable with French Rolls and Chignons instead of the usual ponytail.</li>
      <li>I love the coloring on these - much better than other brands that claim they are for brunettes or blonds, but are simply either flatly colored or metallic (which is worse, in my opinion.)</li>
      <li>If you have hair in general, don&#x27;t get these.</li>
      <li>SOMETHING had to hold his wild wings back.</li>
      <li>After using these I will not go back to the old bobby pins.</li>
      <li>You can barely see them.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a lot from these bobby pins, because they have good reviews, but wow, they are just poor quality, I wear them and when I get them out, even when Im subtle, they are a bit deformed</li>
      <li>and I both have fine thin hair and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> these definitely aren&#x27;t my favorite hairpins.  i have brown hair with some lighter natural highlights, so the blond pins look really weird in my hair.  the darker pins look fine.  i just have a slight problem with opening the pins, sometimes the tension is so tight and the wire so thin that the two wires actually crisscross, which is just a little bit annoying.  nothing i can&#x27;t work around though.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints with these. My hair was dark brown into caramel ombre when I purchased these and the two tone pins blended in perfectly when I wore milkmaid braids.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins do a good job of holding my hair in place.  I have fine, straight black hair and these really match quite well.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I should preface this review with a warning that my hair is very fine, and most bobby pins do not work that well in it.  These bobby pins worked perfectly the first time, the second time I used them they slid down my hair as the day went on, and they didn&#x27;t do the job the third time.  They might work better for someone with thicker hair, or if you&#x27;re okay with one-time-use bobby pins.</li>
    <li> This shipped pretty fast, which was a good thing because I was running out of bobby pins! And I love scunci. I think these work excellent and would definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a lot from these bobby pins, because they have good reviews, but wow, they are just poor quality, I wear them and when I get them out, even when Im subtle, they are a bit deformed and I find very hard to use them again, so it is like Im wearing something disposable. The good things about these is that they dont pull your hair at all and the colors really mix with your hair if you are brunette.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say it was totally worth the price BUT, works exactly as bobby pins should! I like the colors, like that the ridges make for gret grip!</li>
    <li> Work great at holding hear in place for about three hours and then one by one they slowly disappear. I have to reorder these periodically bc they really do seem to just disappear from my head. But they never tear my hair out and make my hair look great when I put them in. They also blend on nicely with my brown and auburn hair.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the quality of these pins.  They bend and twist after the first use.  I will not buy these again nor would I recommend them.</li>
    <li> I like these pins and would recommend buying as they do not hurt your head or your hair. They are of a good quality too.</li>
    <li> these are great bobby pins! i especially love the 2 color options and they feel very durable! you also can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> These are better than Goody but there is something different they don&#x27;t hold as well as they used to.  I have thick hair and I used to use 2 or 3 to hold up a bun now I have to use about 7 or more and my bun will still come undone.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old daughter and I both have fine thin hair and these are lined with something that provides light friction. Enough to hold our hair in place, but not to strong that it rips it (we don&#x27;t have any too lose!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular package is perfect for us both. The camouflage works neat. She has blonde hair and mine is light brown.</li>
    <li> These pins work great and match my medium brown hair color fairly well.  The price was acceptable.  I keep the set in my desk at work, to catch the strays that occur from time to time.</li>
    <li> These are great if you have brown hair with highlights.</li>
    <li> I love these no-slip grip bobby pins and have been using them for years! However, I wish they were available in one single color, as the blended kind is more visible in my hair and the point of these pins is to keep them discrete. Otherwise, these last a long time and are a great value for money!</li>
    <li> These are horrible. The original Scunci No-Slip Grip Bobby Pins were fabulous. These are disposable junk. What a disappointment. They bend open after one use and become useless. They are hardly \\&quot;no-slip\\&quot; and they pull and damage the hair. Conair / Scunci and any other company should be ashamed to put out such a cheap, inferior product.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> As far as the functionality of these goes, they&#x27;re fine.  But I was disappointed to see that the blended color is only on one side, and if you insert the pin in your hair the correct way (with the bent up end facing down), it&#x27;s just a black pin in your hair.</li>
    <li> Worst bobby pins I&#x27;ve ever used. More than half of the pins twist open sideways during the first use. Even when the pins went go in cleanly my updo falls apart. The package comes with a little plastic bit to open the bobby pin but you don&#x27;t actually need it, the pins are so flimsy they are easily opened.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know how I can submit a decent review of bobby pins, but these were great. I loved them. The only problem I have with bobby pins is Monday I buy a package of 60. By Thursday, I can&#x27;t find more than one. :) But I think a lot of ladies know what I mean.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with this product.  While it&#x27;s called NO Slip, it still slips back eventually, but not like&lt;br /&gt;traditional pins. After using these I will not go back to the old bobby pins.</li>
    <li> Great pins.....do exactly what they are supposed to do...hold your hair in place!</li>
    <li> These are great bobbie pins if you have brown or streaked brown blond hair.  They blend in perfectly. Hold well</li>
    <li> Weird color blend going on here... Wish there was a more MIDDLE of the road tone.</li>
    <li> I love these because they match your hair well because of the pattern and different shades.</li>
    <li> I give these a 4 because of the price and they worked okay. I&#x27;m not sure what else to say.</li>
    <li> NOT VERY STURDY NOT LIKE THE ONES MUM ALWAYS USED....DONATING NOT GOING TO WORK</li>
    <li> I added these to my cart to get free shipping but they come in handy for working out and when I&#x27;m putting my hair up.  I have dark brown hair and I like how the bobby pins are not completely black but a dark and light brown.  I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length wavy/curly/frizzy hair depending on the weather and humidity. These bobby pins have made this heatwave stylishly bearable with French Rolls and Chignons instead of the usual ponytail. They hold well and blend well, just as I expected.</li>
    <li> These were completely useless in my hair.  I&#x27;m using a different kind the skinny black pins which work far, far better.</li>
    <li> a lot of pins! good deal!</li>
    <li> These ripped my scalp, and ripped my hair!  They HURT like H!!!!</li>
    <li> Love how they slide without pulling hair.</li>
    <li> They work well and are discreet with my hair color. You can barely see them. I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> These are nice small hairpins.  They are the common shorter size of hairpins, not the longer kind.  They seem to stay in well to keep small amounts of hair in place.  I have medium long, medium thick hair and I don&#x27;t think they would work in my hair alone--I use an assortment of different kinds of pins, and use these smaller ones to hold down little loops that pop out or for general finishing touches.</li>
    <li> These are great for brunettes and look sooooo much better than their gold and black counterparts! They have a sort of striping design to the color making them really shade friendly. They blend in really well, making them look a lot less cheap.  They also work incredibly well and don&#x27;t make you look juvenile like a lot of other bobby pins I&#x27;ve seen @ stores lately. Very simply a must have!</li>
    <li> These are your typical run-of-the-mill bobby pins, but revamped with colors that blend better with brunette hair. I have thin / medium hair, and I use these everyday to hold back my bangs or little flyaways. I love the coloring on these - much better than other brands that claim they are for brunettes or blonds, but are simply either flatly colored or metallic (which is worse, in my opinion.) The marble-y look on these is great. I originally bought these in store, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because I wish the entire card was full of these brown bobby pins. I never use the black ones which, sadly, take up half the card.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing Bobby Pins. They are an amazing, timeless invention, brought about by the nuns of Pope Antoine IV. He had long luxurious hair that was seen as heresy. SOMETHING had to hold his wild wings back.</li>
    <li> My hair is a solid medium-thickness and I&#x27;ve always purchased Scunci bobby pins but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever been truly impressed. I&#x27;ve bought other brands before, and tried out some dollar store options and these are the best I can find, but I still find myself having to re-set bobby pins on the side or bottom of my head. Years ago I felt like I purchased some with some silicon on the inside but haven&#x27;t found them since. I love the color of these b/c they fit in well with my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with these.  I was hoping perhaps that they would have a thin layer of rubber on the inside of each pin to act as a &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; but they do not.  There is a texture engraved on the inside but that does NOTHING to grip.  These do not stay in my hair any better than regular bobby pins.  My hair is thick, long &amp; curly.  If you have the same type of hair, don&#x27;t get these.  If you have hair in general, don&#x27;t get these.</li>
    <li> Only 1/2 the bobby pins are variegated and the other 1/2 are dark brown. As a redhead, I really prefer the variegated. Didn&#x27;t know these would be made of plastic, no where did it state that on the package. (Yes, I know I haven&#x27;t purchased bobby pins in about 20 years.) When I took the variegated off the card, to move them to the other side of the package, I found over 1/2 of ALL of them were stuck together and had to be broken apart.&lt;br /&gt;These do work great b/c they have rippled the inside plastic to grab your hair. If you do not hold open the bobby pin when removing them &#x27;you will&#x27; rip out strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;These actually hold more hair and stay better than the Goody Snap Clips I purchased...</li>
    <li> This is exactly what i was looking for, product came just as advertised. I recommend this to anyone who needs bobby pins.</li>
    <li> I love them very much.&lt;br /&gt;They are amazing and they always work extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;i would highly suggest these to anyone</li>
