<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this products once, turned it off, immediately turned it back on as I needed it once more, and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I tried a different outlet I left it alone for a bit to see if I turned it on a little later maybe it would work, NO!!!! It will NOT turn on. I paid $110 for this product and now I&#x27;m stuck with it, because since I bought it a while back and just now opened it, it&#x27;s too late to return. I would tell anyone who is thinking of buying this, not to. Way too much money and now for it to work once and never again, it&#x27;s BS.</li>
    <li> My new flat iron from Onassis style is great. It makes my hair feel so soft and it also heats up fast.</li>
    <li> This is the third iron that i buy and definitely the last one, the difference is huge it straights your hair leaving it soft and handy...this product is worthy to spend money on..</li>
    <li> I love this straightener,  it is everything I was hoping for. It makes my hair look amazing and shiny and it heats up super fast :)</li>
    <li> Wife and daughter love it.  The ceramic plates do not snag their hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 19 year old daughter as a gift. She is a little particular about flat irons but loves this one and gives it a thumbs up because it heats up fast and does a great job of leaving her hair super straight and silky. Also, it does not have any little rubber strips anywhere at the edge of the heated part like some do, which is good because they tend to flake off after repeated exposure to heat. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Works great, but not as good as the original CHI. I can use the original CHI on dry hair. This one feels like it slides right off dry hair. It needs argan oil to work nicely. Hence giving it a 4 star instead of 5.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is poorly designed. Where the base, the silver hinge, meets the flat iron wands is the issue. It pinches your fingers and hands if they are in that area.  I use the iron to curl my ends, and any twisting motion will put one at danger of getting pinched.    The iron also didn&#x27;t work that well to straighten my hair.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Thanks a lot! I have received it and really enjoy it. I am amazed at how fast it gets hot. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I wish it clapped harder</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron, I love the digital capability, it sound off once it reaches it heating point very cool!</li>
    <li> I just received my Professional Premium Ceramic Tourmaline Onassis flat iron for Christmas  and I&#x27;m really thrilled with its user friendly features and extremely comfortable feel.  The digital range  in heat temperatures allows me to use the iron for quick touch ups when the weather is humid  or for perfect straightening of my very thick, wavy, chemically treated hair especially after washing it.  I am extremely impressed with the quality of this flat iron and I look forward to many years of using  it.  It&#x27;s also reassuring knowing it has a ten year warranty.     Carol</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron, I&#x27;ve ever purchased! It&#x27;s worth the cost</li>
    <li> Amazing, beautiful, sleek, heats up in seconds! My favorite!!!♡♡♡</li>
    <li> My girl friend said they are the best she ever had.</li>
    <li> Loving this straightener.  Heats up immediately, less than a minute. Easy to use,  they thought of everything with this one.</li>
    <li> This is by far, the best flat iron I have used and I have tried many.  I even purchased one for my sister and I&#x27;m usually not that generous but she&#x27;s always had difficulty with her hair, and I just couldn&#x27;t let her continue to use the cheap, drug store irons.  You get what you pay for doesn&#x27;t always apply, but it does for hair irons.  The customer service is unbelievably great and this company responded immediately when I had some questions.  I would buy this iron again and trust me when I say I did try many of the higher end models and so thankful that I settled on this one.  Wait until you see how quickly it heats up.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> Just an okay flatiron. Worked well for a couple of months, but then it started to get way too hot and now it&#x27;s not heating up at all. I&#x27;m really bummed...I naively thought that such a good warranty would mean better reliability. Guess I have to go back to Chi.</li>
    <li> Hello. I bought this product on February 15th. Since I received the iron, it did not work correctly. It wouldnt turn on if you didnt play twisting the cable around and around. I am not able to return it because I leave about 2 hours away from the nearest post office. I sent it to an expert about 15 days ago and he told me it was more expensive to buy it again than to fix it. I feel I was literally beeing robbed.</li>
    <li> Let me make this short and straight to the point. these were one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever owned. They have a chic and sleek design and are way over qualified in my book. This is the smartphone of phone history. A great innovation to flat irons and curling rods. The flat irons can be set to different temperatures. It has an on and off button to slide. And safe guard, no more burning of the hands. It&#x27;s also as smart as to where it protects from fire in flames. If you forget to turn them off and fall asleep after a hard day of flat ironing and somehow fall asleep, they turn themselves off after a certain amount of time. This is something I needed because I&#x27;ve personally burnt my bathroom counter a few times. Unlike the $20 pair from the cvs these don&#x27;t.leave your hair feeling crunchy or flakey like and are perfect size to grab all of my short hairs in the back. My last pair had a barrel too large for short length hair. I absolutely love these! I was given a discount for my opinion and I wouldn&#x27;t let that alter my opinion because I&#x27;ve bought plenty of others full price that have costed way more. I wish I would have found these first! Decent sized, sleek design, smart technology, safety approved, and a great hair manipulator! I can actually get to all the hairs on my head!</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife and she loved it. Its got on/off, heats up in a few seconds, has different temp settings for different kind of hair. Since wife is happy, I am too!</li>
    <li> For years I tried to get away with using a cheap straigntener and it never did the job....finally invested in this one and I love it.  It makes my hair look SO good and I actually enjoy doing my hair now.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! I have extremely thick hair, and it also has some wave to it which mean it can get WILD at times especially if I go to bed with it wet which happens from time to time. I have used flat irons everyday for years, and not all are &amp;#34;up to par&amp;#34; with what I need for my hair. I have tried many different brands from $10 - $200 brands and what I have found is you definitely get what you pay for. With that being said, I am thoroughly impressed by this flat iron. First off it came in a nice professionally packed box. Right out of the box I knew I was going to love this iron. I have used CHI brand for years, but the main thing I do not like about them as no temperature change option. It&#x27;s just ON or OFF, now although I love my CHI, I have found a new love in this iron. This iron has a sleek look, has temperature setting you can control, and works magnificently. Where before it would take me about 30 minutes to flat iron my hair, I can get it done in half the time. I don&#x27;t have to go over the WILD strand as often as I did before, and it make my hair feel and look AWESOME! I am impressed with this iron AND recommend this without a doubt. A GOOD BUY!!!</li>
    <li> I love my new Aphrodite Flat Iron.  It heats quickly.  I like that one can choose a temperature to suit their needs.  It glides nicely and is easy to handle.  Its assuring that Onassis stands behind their product with a 10 yr warranty.  I am quite pleased with my purchase so far.</li>
    <li> Purchased  for friend; she is a beautician and she said it&#x27;s the best one she has ever used in her ten years in her profession.</li>
    <li> works very well ....may be the best flat iron I have ever had..I have difficult hair waves and very thick</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  I have very thick coarse hair and the temp control works wonderful.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and my hair looks silky with only one pass.</li>

    <li> I have had curly hair all my life and I&#x27;m afraid that I have passed it down to my children, and grandchildren both girls and boys.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, curly hair can be beautiful but sometimes it just goes anyway that it decides it wants to and that can just bring you to tears. So all in my family know the joy of having a good Flat Iron, so I was excited to test this product.  Right now in Florida the weather is making my hair curl every way except the way I want it. The test is on. Understand I have used a lot of Flat Irons, some were horror stories, some did pretty good, so on with the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that I appreciated their video on the product because it helped a lot to use it correctly. It has temperature control, auto shut off, and it really does heat up fast and really does keep the temperature I decided to use. I sectioned my hair and did one at a time. This Iron actually glided through it and to my amazement I had straight hair. What? With hardly any effort or time. I didn&#x27;t have to go back over it time and time again to get the result I wanted. I let my daughter and granddaughter try it as well. My Granddaughter was the most excited since she is 16 and her hair is of the upmost importance to her. She looked beautiful, as did I. *smile*...I also felt a lot safer using this product than many of the other ones that have come into my home.  I&#x27;m happy to recommend it, this is from a household of &#x27;curly&#x27; people, who now have the option of straight or curls, and that&#x27;s nice to have.  Product received for a honest review</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s a great straightener. It works fine for that, but I specifically wanted a new flat iron to curl my hair (because I can curl my hair way faster with a flat iron than a curling iron, yes that&#x27;s ironic). The one I&#x27;ve been using is rather old and it has a velvety coating on the outside that gets dirty too easily. I researched forever and finally chose this one because people said you could curl with it as well, and I liked the other features. Upon opening mine, it almost looks like it may have been used. The paint for the temp control looked slightly worn off and the plastic plate over the temp numbers looked a little scratched, so maybe I got a dud. Turning it up to the highest temperature still didn&#x27;t seem nearly as hot as my other flat iron. It will make curls, but they don&#x27;t hold very long at all, and I mean maybe for a few minutes. With my old flat iron, the curls are more shaped and last for days. I am attributing this to the thinness of the plates on the Onassis. They are just too thin to create nicely shaped curls, and it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, so when I do manage to get a decent curl, it falls out within a few minutes. So disappointed that I have to return this because I really had high hopes for it. I did try it out as a straightener and it did do that job well, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that does both, keep looking unless you want incredibly soft waves rather than curls.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this flat iron due to the cost, but knew that Amazon always stands behind it&#x27;s product and I could return it, However, I really like this iron, I have a lot of wave and it does a great job styling my hair.  I took it to my last hair appointment and let my hair dresser use it and she also really liked it, which really sold me!</li>
    <li> Arrrived fully intact in attractive box.  IT Does Not Turn On ! Completely defective. Returning.</li>
    <li> recd when promised and well packaged- gift for daughter she is very happy with product!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used. It heats up in a few seconds, and glides loike silk!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now and I still love it. It gets hot really super fast and the paddles fit together perfectly. I really like the feel of it and the design. My last straightener was a CHI, which I loved, but I stepped on it and broke it and had to replace it. This straightener is really VERY close to being as good as the CHI. The only thing that is not quite as good is the way the straightener glides through my hair. The CHI just glided in a lovely way. The Onassis does not stick or pull my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t glide quite as easily, either.</li>
    <li> Bought this 7 months ago and it worked fine up until yesterday. Took excellent care of it the entire time. The blue LED&#x27;s went out mid use and it stopped working all together. For the price I fully expected this to last much longer than it did. It replaced a cheap $30 straightener which lasted years; making the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; ideology absolutely not applicable for this unfortunately. Save your money and stay away...</li>
    <li> Great I wasn&#x27;t sure at first but it gets really hot good for short or long hair</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, and she loves it. The &#x27;quick heatup&#x27; is no exaggeration; this this reaches full temps QUICK. We&#x27;re talking less than 5 seconds. Very, very nice. The material didn&#x27;t pull her hair, which was a common complaint with the others we&#x27;ve tried. An added bonus this was not stolen by TSA agents when flying with it.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!  I was a faithful CHI owner but when I replaced my broken one with another, it didn&#x27;t get as hot as my old one.  I searched for a different brand and saw this one.  I decided to take a chance and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  This iron makes my hair so smooth and silky.  It also arrived on a Sunday which was an awesome surprise!</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I just got mine and its good so far!</li>
    <li> I love the temperature settings that I can choose from as I switch back and forth between my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair. It also heats up extremely quickly which is great when I&#x27;m in a hurry. I also love the way my hair glides smoothly through it without getting caught as it has with other flat irons. Well, about three months after my purchase the iron began to reset its own temperature. I didn&#x27;t notice the iron was changing its temperature from a low setting to the highest setting. This resulted in the severe burning of a section of my hair. I&#x27;ve continued to turn it on to see if it still resets its own temperature and sure enough, it does! You can physically watch the temperature lights and the heat go up to the highest setting. I turn it back to the low setting and it moves back up again after a couple of minutes. Several haircuts later I have bought a different flatiron. Unfortunately, it was too late to return this product when it began to fail.</li>
    <li> First of all, I think this flat iron will be a great buy for someone with the right type of hair. The price and 10 year warranty are more than enough reason to buy and try this flatiron, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, this flat iron did really work on my very coarse, thick, and wavy-curly hair. I had to make so many passes on each small section of hair just to get it straight and this was on the highest degree setting. I believe this flat iron will work great for someone with the right type of hair.I think this iron would have worked great on my hair if it were normal or fine, thick, and wavy-curly.  I have always had a problem finding a flat iron that works wonders on my hair, mainly because of how coarse it is more so than how thick and wavy-curly it is. Maybe someone will finally develop a flat iron that will glide across coarse hair and straighten it in no more than two passes (one pass would be awesome!).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok -- pricey -- I liked the Jose Eber one I had before better.  This one just doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> Omg it works amazing it heats up fully in like 10 secs! I have ethnic hair so it&#x27;s normally pretty hard to straiten without product but with this straitner I didn&#x27;t need anything I&#x27;m so impressed!!!!</li>
    <li> Quit Working after 6 mos!!!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is amazing. It heats up quick, gets my hair super straight, and leaves it unbelievably soft. Best hair straightener I&#x27;ve used to date. It might differ for whatever your hair type is, but with mine being really thick Indian hair this straightener has become it&#x27;s new best friend. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have thick shoulder-length Indian type hair and some of the flat irons I have used take forever (45-60 mins.) to get my hair straightened. With this Aphrodite flat iron straightener, I can get my hair straightened in about 20-25 mins. My hair also feels sleek and glossy after being straightened without any of that burning smell one can get with some straighteners. Here is some info and my feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an on/off switch&lt;br /&gt;• Easy to select your temperature (higher for thicker hair, lower for thinner hair): 200 degrees to 450 degrees which can be adjusted using a + and - scale&lt;br /&gt;• The bright blue L.E.D. display lights up to show how hot you have your flat iron set on&lt;br /&gt;• The plates measure 1 inch wide and about 3.5 inches long (caution: it gets hot very quickly and takes a while to cool down as well, so needs to be used and stored VERY carefully, especially if there are kids running around)&lt;br /&gt;• The whole iron measures about 2.37&amp;#34;x12.6&amp;#34;x4.33&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;• The voltage is 120V&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feedback&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;• Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;• The instructions are clear and easy to follow&lt;br /&gt;• Heats up quickly: red light indicates unit is on and when the target temp. setting is reached, the red light goes out&lt;br /&gt;• Was able to get my hair straightened in about 25 mins compared to some other straighteners I own which can take up to an hour&lt;br /&gt;• I did not need to use any product on my hair before straightening it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;• I had to use my glasses to read the temperature setting as it is indicated on the inside of the straightener in small size&lt;br /&gt;• Hair needs to be completely dry before using the iron to style hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the Aphrodite Flat Iron Hair Straightener. As a busy professional, it helps me save time on styling my hair and I am satisfied with the results: sleek and glossy straight hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased the flat iron after researching on the internet.  I had my daughter try it first because her hair is very thick and curly.  I figured if it works for her it will work for my fine, baby thin hair.  I like the weight and the style.  It is easy to use.  I&#x27;ve only had it a week and so far so good.</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist absolutely love it it&#x27;s slick heats up very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on the hair</li>
    <li> This product was great for two months then slowly started not rising to the high heat. It just gets warm now.  And it&#x27;s sadly out of the return period.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of a new straighter and decided yo give this one a try. Its awesome! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a Great value for the money and I would recommend this to a friend. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This straighter is fantastic!! It makes my hair so soft!! It takes like 3 seconds to heat up. It is a great product</li>
    <li> I just got this iron and I really love it....it heats up within 2 mins or less and I have it set on the highest temperature.  I have long, thick wavy hair and it works wonderful.  I do not regret buying this product and hope to buy more of their products in the future.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product.  It is easy to use and works very well.</li>
    <li> My initial review was one star because the iron failed after two uses.  I replaced the unit with an Izunami.  After using the Izunami one time my wife told me that the Onassis did a much better job.      Onassis customer service contacted me and asked if I would accept a complimentary unit to re-evaluate.  I received the unit three weeks ago and I am happy to report that it has performed flawlessly.  My wife is in love with this iron.  She has told me several times that it does the job in half the time and she has very thick, slightly curly hair.    I highly recommend this product and I&#x27;m very impressed with the above and beyond customer service I received.</li>
    <li> have had only month and started beeping constantly and stopped working!!!</li>
    <li> I just used this straightener and I love it! My hair takes forever to straighten and it only took 20 mins to straighten all of it and it is still super straight and shiny!!! Amazing straightener!</li>
    <li> This is a true professional flat iron, so far superior to the &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; one I had been using.  There are 5 settings and it does what it says it will do;&lt;br /&gt;it actually heats up in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller has been very professional and responsive.</li>
    <li> I am happy to say that this product actually works perfect for my hair. I get compliment and my hair stays flat all the time. I can also curl my hair with this flat iron. I definitely recommend this product even though it is a little pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent iron, heats fast and I can do my hair in less time.  Sometimes it&#x27;s better to pay more for quality.</li>
    <li> This iron does not even compare to a CHI. I have been a avid CHI user and I purchase this because of the reviews. Well it is not all it&#x27;s claimed to be. I have very, very curly hair, yes it did to some point pull out the curls but it did not make my hair straight like the CHI. In the video that the gentleman put up, I noticed that her hair still had wave to it. I just thought it was because she did it in a hurry. That is not the case. This iron for the price is over priced compared to the CHI which you can get much cheaper. I used it this morning and had to go behind with my CHI to straighten my hair.  Sending it back. HUGE disappointment. People don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Works really well and fast.  I hate having to use it but if you&#x27;ve got to use a flatiron, this one is great.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!  It does well with heating up fast and not burning my ends! It was the fastest I&#x27;ve ever done my hair in the morning!! I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Amazing hair straightener! I was in the market for a new one and this one stopped my search! Heats up fast, has good tempature options, and most important doesn&#x27;t burn my ends! It&#x27;s so sleek, easy to hold and put up since it doesn&#x27;t take to much space! Another great thing is the 360 cord so it never gets tangled!</li>
    <li> Purchased for the wife,,she advises that she likes it and feels it was a good value for the cost but still can&#x27;t use it as easily as the guy in the Mall. I told her practice makes perfect. Will update in the future.</li>
    <li> This was for my wife who has the following comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this is the best flat iron I have used and I have tried many. I&lt;br /&gt;sent back all of them because they burned out or simply stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;For example the &amp;#34;Bio-Ionic - RTX-450- I went through two of them (the&lt;br /&gt;second one broke after 2 times use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your unit is light and easy to hold. Also, your warranty was a big selling&lt;br /&gt;point</li>
    <li> I just got into a more professional position at work, and my hairdresser suggested I try straightening my hair. I got this one. The packaging was beautiful, and it works very nicely.</li>
    <li> I have super curly hair and I have used so many different flat irons it is unreal. I have went from the cheaper to the more expensive and this flat iron is by far the best I have used. When it was first received it it came in nicely packaged in a sturdy box for safe transport. I pulled it out of the box and quickly used it. The iron quickly heated up and you can even control the heat setting so you do not get to much heat on your hair, trust me I did that once and burned my hair off. So this feature is great and gives me peace of mind when I am using it. The heating plates are made from a new technology and are scratch and bacteria resistant. The iron also come with a 10 year warranty all you have to do is register your iron when its received. So if you want a great flat iron this is the one to get it will not disappoint!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Love the customer service more!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my daughter. When it arrived, my wife checked it out and decided she would like to have it. What I can tell, she fell in love with it. She had actually wanted a Hia pro. We were told that it and a Paul Mitchell were the best ones. After I did the research on the Onassis, I convinced her that it might be the one to get. She was reluctant, for change, but seems to be so very happy with it. Oh, my daughter ended up with the other one. It will be comparing time I am sure.</li>
    <li> SO disappointed.  A lot of money for a completely ineffective hair styling tool.  The plates don&#x27;t&#x27; meet and I have fairly thick hair but this straightener doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; anything, just slides right through even a decent chunk of hair...if the plates don&#x27;t meet then it&#x27;s useless.  Way too expensive, you&#x27;re better off at the drugstore with a $20 styling tool because this one is no better.</li>
    <li> This flat iron hair is really nice, easy to use, my wife like it, she enjoy this item so i recomended.</li>
    <li> I think the Iron lives up to everything I&#x27;ve read in reviews on this site.  I’m not one to use many things to fuss with my hair but this is a great tool and I’m happy to have it.  Plus I&#x27;d like to add that it is always good to see a company that cares about its product with a good warranty.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this does a great job of not pulling and making it look very smooth and sleek.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the hair iron. It worked very well and quickly to make my&lt;br /&gt;hair straight. I was very happy with the results. I would definitely recommend it to&lt;br /&gt;a friend.</li>
    <li> the Flat Iron I got it for my mother and she loved it. She told me it works well and heats up quick and doesn&#x27;t burn her unlike the last one she had. And though not as important she also liked the color. So she is definitely enjoying the product</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant in purchasing this item because I was always loyal to the CHI flat iron, however my last CHI stopped working less than a year after purchase so I decided to try something new. Well I was pleasantly surprised by this flat iron. It heats very quickly and it does a great job straightening the hair. I love it. Well worth the money. Now, hopefully it will last a while and won&#x27;t break quickly like the CHI.</li>
    <li> Fell apart after two months</li>
    <li> Really great flat iron. Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this flat iron, it heats up fast. My only complaint is my hair is thin &amp; fine, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to grasp my hair well</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, nice that your able to adjust temperature and not just a high or low button.</li>
    <li> My ONLY complaint is that it did not come with a cooling bag. I have very long, thick hair and this does not lose heat before I am done with a strand, as others had. Additionally, it heats up in less than a minute (and reheats by the time I&#x27;m ready for the next strand) and does not leave that signature straightener smell. I got so much more than I bargained for!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had and I can&#x27;t believe how silky smooth and soft my hair feels after straightening! I feel like a million bucks after straightening!</li>
    <li> This was a gift to a friend who has very thick curly hair. She tells me at least once per week how much she loves this flat iron. She said it&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> I have been through numerous flat irons over the years and the Aphrodite by Onassis is by far the best I have owned thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background about my hair-I have very thick, very frizzy, very curly hair that has taken me years of practice and product to tame (I really think I was born in the wrong decade-my hair would have been awesome in the 80&#x27;s!).  I have gone to the salon on a rainy day and even with a professional styling my hair straight on a rainy day one step outside and my hair goes right back to curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the Aphrodite:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Various Temperature Settings-this is a must for me.  I&#x27;ve found that flat irons without this feature, such as Chi, tend to get too hot and really damages my hair.  Not only does it damage my hair, but it leaves my usually voluminous hair flat (who wants that?).  I like to be able to use more heat when I need it and less on days I don&#x27;t and this flat irons offers that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Heats Up Quickly-this flat iron heats up in less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Maintains Heat Well-Ever notice after 10 minutes of using your flat iron that it seems to not be straightening so well and you have to stop and let it heat up again?  This flat iron doesn&#x27;t do that.  I went from dry and bushy today to straight and sleek in about 10 minutes today without loss of heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  I Don&#x27;t Have to Blow Dry My Hair Straight To Get Desired Results-nothing worse then getting all clean in the shower and coming out to sweat while blow drying your hair.  I was able to take my dry bushy mane and flat iron it straight with the same results I could only get with my old flat iron by blow drying my hair straight too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Results Are Fast-I don&#x27;t have to spend 15-30 minutes (depending on the weather) flat ironing my hair anymore.  10 minutes or less and I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an amazing product and I am seeing results I have never been able to get with a flat iron alone.  I would recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
    <li> present for my fiancée.  She loves it...says she can straighten her hair in half the time and puts CHI straighteners to shame</li>
    <li> Really good&lt;br /&gt;it straightens the hair while leaving it shiny and natural looking</li>
    <li> I have received it.  It&#x27;s fantastic and gets really hot quickly.  I use it at the medium heat.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my hair.  I use it on a low setting and it straightens perfectly without drying out my hair.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have color-treated blonde hair cut in a chin-length inverted bob. My hair also has a slight natural curl to it. I always dried it with a round brush, but with the natural curl it ended up looking like either Roseanne Roseannadanna from Saturday Night Live or Cleopatra hair--really wide at the bottom, narrowing towards the top of my head. So I was excited to try this flat iron. It’s the only one I’ve used so I can’t compare it to others but my friend uses a Chi and it’s very similar. It heats up fast – less than 15 seconds from plugging it in. It takes me about 5 minutes to do a quick styling and I’m out the door. The plates slide smoothly and they don’t damage my color-treated hair. I love the swivel cord, making it easier to maneuver.  review sample</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my daughter. She has extremely thick and curly hair and this flat iron works fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Extremely satisfied with the product, the service and the warranty.</li>
    <li> This Onassis straightener is absolutely amazing! It has cut my style time down because it truely takes only 1 pass through my thick wavy hair. It heats up so fast and stays heated. I do not have to wait for it to heat up between passes, like I did with my old straightener. I live in Florida and it has been constantly raining, my originally thick wavy hair has gotten damp but it has not frizzed after using this product either. My hair lools so shiny and healthy. My co-workers have commented that it looks like I had it styled at a salon. I would definetly recommend this product with its 10 year warranty.</li>
    <li> It is very nicely made.  The cord is protected at the end and swivels.  It has an extra long cord and different heat settings which is great.  I also really liked the customer service.  I was e mailed even before I received the product to see how I liked it.  They are very happy and passionate about their product.  It works! I love it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this flat iron.  She had another more expensive brand and likes this one better.</li>
    <li> I received my Aphrodite Flat Iron last week and I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE IT!! I have always used a Chi (for the past 11 years and have been very happy with my Chi flat irons and have never thought about buying a different brand) but after looking at different reviews online, I decided to try the Aphrodite and I am so pleased with it! It heats up so quickly! And it straightens my hair in half the time that my Chi did and my hair stays straight all day long! It also leaves my hair very soft</li>
    <li> The iron is terrific! I have a thick hair with a lot of volume and the iron is able to leave my hair very silky and shiny. The material of the flat iron doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re making any damage to your hair or burning it at all. They actually pass very softly to it, which make you feel more comfortable about using it. I&#x27;ve been using with for about 4 weeks and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The client service they have is also great, that&#x27;s one of the best parts. From the moment you buy the iron they&#x27;re constantly checking if you received the product on time, and what you think about it. And they also answer any questions you may have in a very short time. In all senses this iron is just great.</li>
    <li> The first one I got didn&#x27;t work, so I emailed support and they sent me a new one that worked. Very friendly help, great flat iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron in December of 2014 and on Saturday, August 22, 2015 it stopped working when I was in the middle of straightening my hair.  It just went dead.  Prior to this incident, it worked okay.  I have long, curly/wavy, thick, coarse hair and it took me about 40 - 45 minutes to straighten.  I honestly just thought that this was the best it was going to get without spending a fortune on a professional iron.  It wouldn&#x27;t stand up to humidity very well regardless of the product I used.  It was very easy to maneuver and I liked the auto shut off.  I will be seeking a refund from the company for this purchase.  I will update my review once I experience the service level of the company and their 1 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I have quite a bit of hair, so it&#x27;s pretty thick and I use flat irons each day to help tame it. I have a medium-short hair style right now, where the back of my hair is shorter than the front. And I have a ton of layers in it. With this style, if I don&#x27;t use a iron on it each day to style it, all the ends of my hair flip outward and the layers look choppy. The better the quality of flat iron I use, the easier I can get my hair styled the way I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own and have used a lot of flat irons over the last couple of years. Some have been great, some have been serious duds. This Aphrodite iron is one of the good ones. It gets to a high temperature and does so pretty quickly.  Inside the handle of the iron you can actually watch the temperature as it rises through the different settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using it, I am able to straighten the sections of my hair I want flattened and I&#x27;m able to curl under the sections of my hair at the bottom that naturally flips outward. After using it, all my layers blend perfectly into one another and I&#x27;m even able to get to the difficult section at the back of my head. It&#x27;s great iron and works just like some flat irons I&#x27;ve used that are priced even more. The Aphrodite is a great iron for thick hair, hair with layers and when you want to be able to also curl the ends of your hair either under or outward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo16EQ64CHZJGH8]]My wife uses a flat iron on her hair as she likes the way it looks when straight.  She then may add in some curl.  This flat iron is very nice and it has some features that she really liked.  First of all it gets hot very quickly.  Within 10 to 15 seconds it is ready to go.  I even show this by measuring the temperature with a non-contact temperature measuring device to verify their heating claims and they are accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron also has a digital method of displaying the iron&#x27;s heat setting that makes it easy to use.  Inside of the iron the temperatures of the settings are shown and they light up when they are selected for the temperature you want to use.  A rocker switch allows you to easily change the temperature settings.  They are 200, 260, 320, 360, 400, 430 and 450 degrees F.  They light up in blue as the target temperature you have set.  If the temperature is actually higher than the setting then both the set temperature and the actual temperature are highlighted so you know to be careful as the iron may be too hot.  I checked the temperatures with the same digital measuring device and the settings were reasonably accurate. You should use higher settings if you have normal to thick hair and lower settings for thin to normal hair.  If you are in doubt you should ask your hair dresser what temperature they use on your hair.  My wife used 360 degrees F as the setting for her hair.  She also used a small amount of Argan oil as it helps protect her hair, soften it and it adds a very slight pleasant fragrance to her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use and she got professional results doing it herself. I have included a video on the product and show the before and after results on her hair. (Please don&#x27;t make fun of her before hair photo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has some very good features and it really is a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you plug in the flat iron there is an on switch in the inside of the unit you have to slide on.  You can tell the unit is on based on whether the temperature setting is lit up in a blue LED light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The unit does have an automatic shut off timer.  In about one hour of being left on it will turn off itself.  If you have children I would unplug it and store it properly away after it was cooled off.  Please note that even after 30 minutes or more the iron was still very hot and you can burn yourself if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take the time to watch the video and I hope it is of benefit to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat iron included accessories:&lt;br /&gt;* Flat iron&lt;br /&gt;* User instruction manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main Features:&lt;br /&gt;* Adjustable temperature from 200° to 450° F to suit your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;* Smooth ceramic plates that easily slide through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Ultra-smooth ceramic 1 inch wide plates that are 3 ½ inches long to work with any hair type and style and also allow you to straighten your bangs.&lt;br /&gt;* Power cord is 8 1/2 feet long&lt;br /&gt;* On/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;* Fast and easy to use with professional results.&lt;br /&gt;* Swivel power cord to eliminate the power cord from twisting.&lt;br /&gt;* Operates on 110 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz&lt;br /&gt;* The unit is double insulated for safety&lt;br /&gt;* The unit is fused for your protection per the manual&lt;br /&gt;* The unit is stated to have a 10 year manufacturer&#x27;s warranty on the Amazon web site when you register the product on the product manufacturer&#x27;s web site.

    <li> Since I have a neighbor that has naturally curly hair, I brought it next door to test this on her hair. It straightened her hair wonderfully and was not too hot for her to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried it on my straight hair (medium length) and was able to curl my hair and love this combo unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really it is easier to straighten than to curl, but it works for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this easy to use and high quality straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provided to me for testing and review purposes.</li>
    <li> I have always used the chi straightener and I wanted to find something better. I love my new straightener! It just glides down my hair without tugging or pulling. You can change the heat settings so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair and I get my hair straight in minutes. I have wavy / curly fine hair and it&#x27;s perfect!!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Heats up instantly, makes hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener.  It leaves my hair feeling soft.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I feel its a little bulky.  I like the longer sleek straighteners. However, as far as it working on my (long) hair, I love it.</li>
    <li> I am very conflicted because I am sooooo determined to love this flat iron, although for ME it does have crucial downsides. I am African American with extremely thick frizz-prone hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: This flat iron has a beautiful appearance and I love that it has automatic shut-off and is very light and portable. It also does a god job at straightening my hair and leaving it soft and shiny. I find that my hair never feels dry or damaged afterwards which is a huge plus since I do a lot of heat styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: Because this flat iron never dries out my hair and leaves it feeling moisturized, that&#x27;s where my issues with frizz come in. I usually have the temperature turned up to 430 degrees and i have to make MULTIPLE passes through my hair to fully straighten it. Even when I get one section straight, it occasionally frizzes up a couple minutes later as I make my way through the rest of my head. It gets repetitive and I am very wary of going back and putting heat on a section I already finished. Also, I find that it does not keep my hair frizz-free after I straighten it and it is completely dry. Even the slightest hint of humidity in the air will cause my straightened hair to frizz up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this flat iron to my old Remington one, I found that the Remington got my hair perfectly straight at 400 degrees (NOT 430) and kept it straight even through sweating and my workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who is not concerned about frizz, has thin hair, or hair that is very easy to straighten this flat iron is perfect! For others like myself, you may be better off getting a cheaper alternative with the same features, as it would be a better return on investment.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron in July 2014 and as of March 2015 I am having problems with it. It keeps turning on and off as I do my hair; very annoying. I read the product guide before using and noticed it said not to roll up the cord to prevent the wires from breaking however I have never rolled my cord. This flat iron has a permanent home in my bathroom and never moves so it can&#x27;t be me not taking care of it correctly. I said this flat iron was okay because it was great when I first had it but disappointed in spending all the money for it to not even last a year. My old Chi worked for a lot longer and was around the same price. Looks like I am going back to them.</li>
    <li> I half heartedly blew dry my hair to see how well your iron would do. I have very wavy hair and normally can&#x27;t flat iron it very well if I don&#x27;t blow it completely straight first. I&#x27;m happy to say your iron rocks! I love what it can do. I get tired of having to spend so much time blow drying my wavy hair. So thank you. It&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
    <li> By far one of the best hair striaghtners I have ever used and I have tried a lot of different ones out and this one is my favorite. I have super frizzy curly hair and once I&#x27;m done using this my hair is silky and smooth . I would buy another one and recommend this to anyone to try</li>
    <li> So as soon as i received this I just had to try it and to my surprise it did an amazing job on my hair! I didn&#x27;t wash my hair just to test it and see if it would revive my hair and as soon as I used it my hair seemed so shiny and like I had just washed it.. I love the outcome of this iron! Thank you so much for this awesome iron this is definitely going to replace my old one ;)</li>
    <li> Love it. Does the job on my coarse hair leaving it smooth and silky</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light, easy to use and results are fantastic</li>
    <li> Not a good quality straightener. I had to return it.  I have thick hair and it just didn&#x27;t perform well.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this flat iron! She says it heats very quickly and not only straightens but curls beautifully!</li>
    <li> Love the new flat iron! Very easy to use, heats up QUICKLY! Smooth and silky on my hair :)</li>
    <li> This straightener is phenomenal - when it works.  I purchased it in December and it began malfunctioning about a week ago.  This is ridiculous. I&#x27;m so annoyed I will never purchase an item from this brand again.</li>
    <li> A little over five months purchased, used frequently I wouldn&#x27;t say daily but close. It over heats nearly instantly regardless of the lower temperatures. It alarms and the only way to reset this is to un plug it. Today it stopped working after it over heated and melted the ends. Before it&#x27;s last day, I had the setting on 380, and it overheated on a swipe of hair and burned/sheared 3&#x27;&#x27; of length and singed the top layers. It also Nevers turns off like the safety claim if left on it turns off after an hour. This is an unsafe and sucky product I didn&#x27;t get six months infrequent use of. I&#x27;m here today looking for another flat iron.</li>
    <li> Very good hair styler. heats up fast and does a great job</li>
