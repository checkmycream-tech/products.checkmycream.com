<li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> I should have spent the extra $20 and purchsed the dept. store product.</li>

    <li> Bought it for my wife for Christmas. She&#x27;s been a long time user of Boucheron and says that the fragrance is right for her body chemistry, but the scent is very faint and does not last long. It&#x27;s made in Spain instead of France. Price and delivery was right</li>

    <li> I love this fragerance, I bougfht it for myself  for Christmas, fresh clean scent, my daughter in law wanted me to trade for one she  got</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for my wife. It was delivered and packaged as promised. She said that the fragrance was very nice. But she prefers the older version, Prada Amber, alot more. I must admit that I like the way the \\&quot;Amber\\&quot; smells on her better than the \\&quot;Ambree\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It was exaclty what I wanted.  I am not like flowery smell kinda girl.  I like the strong smell it was really beautiful</li>
    <li> It is my scent of choice! Wonderful! I have looked for a replacement for &amp;#34;K&amp;#34; for years. This is it!</li>
    <li> Whwn I first smelled it in my cousin I loved it but now that I bought I like it but don&#x60;t love it. Its good for who likes wooded smells. Its good for winter time.</li>
    <li> This Parfume is not full strength - it is not near as strong as the bottle I purchased from Nordstrom! I do NOT trust this seller.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE NICEST PERFUME I HAVE EVER OWNED.  LIGHT AND NOT OVERPOWERING.  I GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS AND IT SEEMS TO LAST ALL DAY BECAUSE PEOPLE STILL COMMENT ON IT IN THE EARLY EVENING AFTER I HAVE WORN IT ALL DAY.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> wonderful blend. I never thought i would like woodsy/musky fragrances until this one. Will continue to buy as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This scent is not too strong; just right! I received many compliments. Its warm and alluring. Smells expensive! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Was what I wanted and at a good price! Would order this again. Purchased this parfum several years ago. Could not find it at local department stores.</li>
    <li> This was okay but wasn&#x27;t up to my standard</li>
    <li> If you like Amber will may hate this scent.  I purchased this thinking it was Amber and was sooooo wrong.</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume in a dept. store and loved it. One spray lasted all day. However, the product I purchased online may be old/out of date or it&#x27;s watered down...all I know is that I will spray it 7-8 times, and the scent fades within a few minutes. No one can even tell I&#x27;m wearing perfume. I should have spent the extra $20 and purchsed the dept. store product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and has been for quite some time.  People are always commenting on how good it smells.  I agree!</li>
    <li> Smells really good, nice soft smelling perfume, and a really good price it was 80 at the mall for the same one! good deal!</li>
