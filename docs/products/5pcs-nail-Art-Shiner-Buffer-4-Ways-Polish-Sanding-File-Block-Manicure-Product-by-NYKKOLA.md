      <li>love the way my nails look after use</li>
      <li>Love these buffers....</li>
      <li>Not as good as others but the price is right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Quality is as good or better than the ones I have been buying from drug stores, big name stores; these blocks give dazzling shine, plus</li>
      <li>I am able to file, smooth, buffer and shine my nail with one item.</li>
      <li>The grit is also way to fine</li>
      <li>They really smooth the edges.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re cheap, and look it.  </li>
      <li>Cheap and do not work at all.</li>
      <li>these are amazing thanks</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>These are fun and they work!  </li>
      <li>I originally wrote I had a problem with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They make my nails so shiny &amp; clean</li>
      <li>The nail edge file is not course enough to really do a good job.</li>
      <li>However the price and the quality are good enough for me.</li>
      <li>it comes in a bag and each block comes wrapped individually , this product is really good and is worth it .</li>
      <li>glad to have so many as they&#x27;ll last awhile.</li>
      <li>but otherwise they worked very well!!</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it claims!</li>
      <li>But the ridge, smooth, and shine sides work very well.</li>
      <li>Great price for a few things I can give to my girl friends.</li>
      <li>They really clean and easily shine up nails into super-glow, as if we&#x27;ve used a clear polish.</li>
      <li>They arrived pretty quick, too.</li>
      <li>The Amazon description was very clear and accurate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they will get the job done, but I don&#x27;t expect them to last</li>
      <li>It works very well, my nails have never been shinier!</li>
      <li>I got my order fast!</li>
      <li>Pretty much what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>quick shipping, simple yet useful product.</li>
      <li>very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they wear out fast</li>
      <li>These work really well...</li>
      <li>I wish I could give this product zero stars, it is absolute garbage</li>
      <li>Fast shipment too.</li>
      <li>so they do not really clean up much like more legit ones do.</li>
      <li>only con I can see is that the files looks like it might run down more quickly than I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
      <li>These buffers are also affordable and their grades are of high quality.</li>
      <li>The price is great; you can go wrong with this deal.</li>
      <li>I tried to use them the last 2 times I clipped my nails and it burned right thru one of them.</li>
      <li>Its so flimsy and all 4 sides are the exact same</li>
      <li>Average nothing special</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m splitting hairs here, b/c I&#x27;m still using the first one and it looks like it still has a long life</li>
      <li>Although this isn&#x27;t an item that is necessarily &amp;#34;breakable&amp;#34; or that would need much padding, it was delivered in an envelope and some of the blocks were misshapen upon opening.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll never waste my money at the drug store again.</li>
      <li>Each block has four way methods (sanding, removing ridges, file nail edges &amp; buffing) and in a matter of minutes you&#x27;ll get professional looking nails.</li>
      <li>I think I would have rather purchased 1 good buffing block for $2.99 than have 5 mediocre buffing blocks for the same price.  </li>
      <li>These are not heavy duty enough for acrylics or gels.  </li>
      <li>natural nails only.  </li>
      <li>These are great for buffing and shining, but not for sanding down artificial nails.</li>

<li> These are so awful do not, repeat, DO NOT waste your money!!!  </li>
<li> this was absolutely horrible and such a waste of money!</li>
<li> Useless after one try.</li>
<li> Too difficult to make nail shine...</li>
<li> terrible, 4 sides of buffing, no difference in grit, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> I am so angry and disappointed!!!</li>
<li> Terrible if using on on acrylic nails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are okay. I bought the JAYLIE TM 4-way as well as these on same day, I prefer jaylies. I left a review for them if you would see that. This is an ok buffer, but go with JAYLIE</li>
    <li> Wears out after 1-2 uses</li>
    <li> These are fun and they work!  I appreciate the directions on each side - makes it a no-brainer to use.  So good, I shared with a friend.</li>
    <li> The nail edge file is not course enough to really do a good job. But the ridge, smooth, and shine sides work very well. One of these files at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply is $4.99 just for one.</li>
    <li> not as well made as the ones i buy at my grocery store but work better!</li>
    <li> So happy I purchased the 5pcs. of nail art buffers and polishing. These will last me for along time. Just what I expected them to be. The package wasn&#x27;t damaged and received in a few days. I will recommend. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These work but the shine only lasts a few days. Not as good as others but the price is right.</li>
    <li> Great price, good buffers for the price, they take a while to ship but they arrived in good shape.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves them, gave two to her friends.</li>
    <li> Absolute waste of money.  Flimsy and each of the four sides are the same.  The emery board side does not file the nail; the buffer does not work.  Useless after one try.</li>
    <li> I got my order fast! These are great for buffing and shining, but not for sanding down artificial nails. All four sides feel the same. If you only need buffers then this product is for you. Otherwise, order your emery boards separate.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, don&#x27;t really like how they don&#x27;t work well on nails.</li>
    <li> These things work great and five for what you&#x27;d pay for one elsewhere.  It&#x27;s nice to have them around the house to do a  nail touchup whenever I think of it.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as another brand I use. The shining side wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price ,will order many  more.&lt;br /&gt;Family loves product.</li>
    <li> they wear out fast but otherwise they worked very well!!</li>
    <li> So happy I made a wise decision of purchasing these buffers. They make my nails so shiny &amp; clean I swear they look as though a manicurist has done them in a salon. Each block has four way methods (sanding, removing ridges, file nail edges &amp; buffing) and in a matter of minutes you&#x27;ll get professional looking nails. These buffers are also affordable and their grades are of high quality. I will definitely purchase these buffers again in the future at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Too difficult to make nail shine...</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Fast shipment too. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> A little cheaper quality than one you might buy from Drugstore. However the price and the quality are good enough for me. I would buy again and would recommend to framily and friends.</li>
    <li> This is a good set of nail buffers. My wife likes to put one in her purse to smooth a broken nail. They really smooth the edges. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The Amazon customer reviews were helpful. It was well packaged and arrived on schedule.</li>
    <li> this was absolutely horrible and such a waste of money! You cant even file paper with these! Its so flimsy and all 4 sides are the exact same</li>
    <li> love the way my nails look after use</li>
    <li> They took 3 weeks to arrive and came in an envelope so the ones on the ends were dented in. The grit is also way to fine so they do not really clean up much like more legit ones do. I will not buy again. I tried to use them the last 2 times I clipped my nails and it burned right thru one of them.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cheap, and look it.  Pretty much what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Excellent and have instructions on the sides</li>
    <li> These will do. I opened my product and some of the lettering on the buffers were already coming off, without using them.</li>
    <li> These are so awful do not, repeat, DO NOT waste your money!!!  They have no file edge, they are flimsy, and the buffer doesn&#x27;t even buff.  Total waste of money and time to order it and go get it from the post office.  I am so angry and disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible if using on on acrylic nails. These are chinsy and last for one use per fill. Bummed.</li>
    <li> Great price for a few things I can give to my girl friends. The remove ridges side is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Love these buffers....glad to have so many as they&#x27;ll last awhile.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is as good or better than the ones I have been buying from drug stores, big name stores; these blocks give dazzling shine, plus *WOWSA* the price can&#x27;t be beat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only con I can see is that the files looks like it might run down more quickly than I&#x27;d hoped.  Wish they made the file surface thicker, but then again, for the price, you can just pitch it and go on to the next block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m splitting hairs here, b/c I&#x27;m still using the first one and it looks like it still has a long life ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course!  five blocked for the price of one and they are quality!  I&#x27;ll never waste my money at the drug store again.</li>
    <li> these nail files are great...my nails are nice and shiny like i oiled them when i didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Cheap. But you do get many.</li>
    <li> very good product . it comes in a bag and each block comes wrapped individually , this product is really good and is worth it .</li>
    <li> Me and my daughter-in-law love these buffers. They really clean and easily shine up nails into super-glow, as if we&#x27;ve used a clear polish. They arrived pretty quick, too. I do recommend them!</li>
    <li> These are cheeply made</li>
    <li> Works well...nothing else to say about this product other than it took awhile for delivery</li>
    <li> Works great. Smooths out ridges and split nails so they don&#x27;t snag on clothes or hair. great for at-home manicures.</li>
    <li> The only difference between the sides was the color. It&#x27;s like trying to file your nails with plastic wrap.</li>
    <li> It works very well, my nails have never been shinier! The only downside is that the blocks don&#x27;t seem to last as long as i would like, they only go for 3-4 buffs each.</li>
    <li> Average nothing special</li>
    <li> $2.99 for 5 - I guess you get what you pay for.  I would say these buffers are good for buffing, shining etc. natural nails only.  These are not heavy duty enough for acrylics or gels.  I think I would have rather purchased 1 good buffing block for $2.99 than have 5 mediocre buffing blocks for the same price.  I&#x27;m sure they will get the job done, but I don&#x27;t expect them to last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the edges are squished and some of the sides are coming untaped from the block itself (see pics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Hrhyme&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Hrhyme&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 17 days after order date&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:  Not sure if item was deformed/squished prior to packaging or if  something heavy was placed on it while it was being shipped.  Although this isn&#x27;t an item that is necessarily &amp;#34;breakable&amp;#34; or that would need much padding, it was delivered in an envelope and some of the blocks were misshapen upon opening.</li>
    <li> terrible, 4 sides of buffing, no difference in grit, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> These work really well... they are really great if you have a lot of ridges in your nails as three sides are more filing and the 4th side is the buffer/shiner.</li>
    <li> I originally wrote I had a problem with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately heard back from Gaga looking to make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;These people are terrific.  They bent over backwards to satisfy me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend them and am revising my review to 5 Stars</li>
    <li> Nice nail kit. I am able to file, smooth, buffer and shine my nail with one item. The finished nail looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend. The price is great; you can go wrong with this deal.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product zero stars, it is absolute garbage they are a total waste of money they DO NOT file even the softest nails.</li>
    <li> For the price they do a great job. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it claims! Great value</li>
    <li> Received  the buffers today. Earlier than stated time for delivery. Just finished using one. I love it as great as the ones that cost more got one than I paid for 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda Colvin</li>
    <li> quick shipping, simple yet useful product.</li>
    <li> Cheap and do not work at all. I do not recommend</li>
    <li> these are amazing thanks</li>
    <li> As a man wanting to take care of my nails so that I&#x27;m not snagging my ties, I wanted something other than the thin boards used by women. Something bigger I could grab a hold of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: the size and shape feel good.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: the surfaces do not last very long.</li>
    <li> Perfect for polishing nail,gives nice shine</li>
</ol>
