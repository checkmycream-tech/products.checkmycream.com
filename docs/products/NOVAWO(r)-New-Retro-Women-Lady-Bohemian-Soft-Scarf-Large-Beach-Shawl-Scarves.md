<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got the red but the color was too dark, nothing like the one shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SCARF SO MUCH. Its big and a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and versatile, thank you!</li>
    <li> awesome scarf. my wife loved it and it arrived much faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Nice scarf for the price.</li>
    <li> Great...wife loved it</li>
    <li> Okay- So I love scarves...this is light and airy but beautiful colors that translate easily from spring and summer into fall and winter. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments...I love it.</li>
    <li> Light weight and nice colors.</li>
    <li> Awesome but came months late!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely beautiful, and was the perfect gift for scarf lovers!</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Lightweight and pretty. Love it.</li>
    <li> It is a stunning scarf... luxurius. With all the wonderful colors it goes with just about everthing.</li>
    <li> This scarf doesn&#x27;t look nearly as vibrant or voluminous as the picture shows. The colors are super dingey and you can see in the picture it&#x27;s much smaller. Kind of a bummer. :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot shorter than I expected so I probably won&#x27;t ever wear it but it came on time and it was good quality and pretty and stuff. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it as a gift</li>
    <li> I received today (12Jan) it is a nice scarf but doesn&#x27;t match what is pictured.  The colors are much, much darker.  I keep wondering if the wrong pattern was sent.  It is not as full as the photo shows, thing and narrow but I can still use it for the price I got it for.  The photo looks like a cheerful pattern and that is what I was expecting.  ohhhh well</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a silk scarf..not really what I thought I was getting in the picture...But okay</li>
    <li> This came almost a month before it was supposed to. It&#x27;s beatiful and well priced!</li>
    <li> get so many comments on this large scarf. It is exactly the color I needed.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this is product if you want the one in the photo. This is a dark red, standard length scarf. There is no cream/white in it at all and it looks like an Aztec print. It&#x27;s not flowey (?) at all.  Bohemian is not a word that I would use to describe the scarf I got. I now see another photo that looks similar to what I received, but it is nowhere even close to as cute as the one in this photo. I am very disappointed and would not recommend buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> not as long as pictured but cute nonetheless, and it looks great with so many outfits</li>
    <li> Actual item is not a full or long as the one pictured. I thought it was an oversized scarf, but it is normal size.</li>
    <li> Love this scarf it is so versatile from scarf to over shoulder wrap to a bathing suit wrap to walk around in.</li>
    <li> When I received this, it didn&#x27;t look anything like it looked in the picture.  It was much smaller than it appears in the picture and the design is much more Southwestern than it appears to be.  It is also VERY thin.  I thought I was getting a large bohemian scarf and instead I received a thin, southwestern handkerchief.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured in photo.  More of a Southwest design.  Colors not vibrant----but will be a nice FALL touch.</li>
    <li> Longer, fuller and better constructed than I originally thought.</li>
    <li> Nice but so not the colors shown</li>
    <li> Nice material but not what it looks like in the picture. It&#x27;s not as big &amp; fluffy. More thin &amp; small.</li>
    <li> It a good scarf. It doesn&#x27;t keep you very warm so it&#x27;s more of a fall scarf.</li>
    <li> Came timely and as described. I wear it as a headscarf for chemo and as a regular scarf as well. It&#x27;s beautiful and versatile.</li>
    <li> This scarf is not as pretty in real life and feels a little cheap, which it was.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Niece loves it</li>
    <li> Not a full/fluffy scarf</li>
    <li> This scarf is my absolute favorite new accessory! its perfect,Just like the picture! The colors are just absolutely beautiful !!!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my stepmother and she LOVED it.  Very nice feel and quality to it.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s even cuter person. Great quality and it got here within a reasonable amount of time. :)</li>
    <li> I love this! I wear it as a turban</li>
    <li> Bright colors are so attractive in this scarf and it is long enough to use many different tying methods.  Great for any season too!</li>
    <li> This scarf is adorable!  I love wearing it; it has become a staple in my wardrobe. This is the second I&#x27;ve bought from this company!</li>
    <li> I ordered these scarf (red &amp; blue) on 16th of APR and I received on 24th of APR.  Shipping was pretty faster then I thought because they came from China.  They charged shipping fee for each scarf even though I ordered two at the same time which is doesn&#x27;t make sense. Also, they are in one package.  They are not a big like picture at all.  Very thin so I can wear it in spring even summer here in WA State.</li>
    <li> Scarf I received in the mail looks nothing like the picture but was still nice looking. Just wish I had gotten what was pictured.</li>
    <li> I love it. Super cute summer or fall scarf. The colors in it are amazing and i have 0 regrets about this.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughters birthday and it was a bit different than the photo as many others claimed, but it was well within the same color tones, and she loved it. Great price and pretty nice quality.</li>
    <li> absolutely beautiful &amp; great quality!  I would buy another one in an instant, very good quality, easy to use and super stylish!</li>
    <li> Beautiful! But a little shorter than the picture.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than it appears in this picture.</li>
    <li> Just received it and i Absolutely am obsessed with it.</li>
    <li> Great scarf much prettier than the pics. Quality is outstanding happy I got this scarf goes with so much!!</li>
    <li> Pretty and really colorful. The shipping was quick too. The reason why I only gave it three stars was becuase it is not as large and fluffy as it appears in the picture.</li>
    <li> Soft beautiful scarf; colors are vibrant and it is large enough to wear as a sarong. It will add versatility and style to any  basic wardrobe.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than appears. Not the same colors.</li>
    <li> beautiful, and what a bargain</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than picture, but colors are beautiful!</li>
    <li> I bought this scarf for my Aunt, who says the colors are bright, very pretty and the scarf itself is soft. She like the fact that she can wear it either as a scarf or a light weight shawl. She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy. Thank you.</li>
    <li> just arrived today 12-2-14, kinda thin. but all in all pretty</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as long and fluffy as I expected, but it&#x27;s still cute. I really wanted it to be longer.</li>
    <li> colors are much more in the orange and black spectrum than I thought.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and soft. Plan on getting the same scarf in different colors. Shipping took awhile to receive.</li>
    <li> So cute. Worn several times.</li>
    <li> Look nothing like the picture size wise.</li>
    <li> it is darker than the photo and the colors are not as vibrant....but it&#x27;s a nice size and it&#x27;s still pretty.</li>
    <li> nice large, colorful scarf!! good price</li>
    <li> The fabric is very soft sheer like and flows</li>
    <li> Love that but it is darker than shown</li>
    <li> I would first like to talk about the scarf itself. It is adorable and exactly what I wanted, which explains the ratings. What I did not know was that it was shipping from CHINA! I have this awful habit of everything that I buy comes from china. Anyhow, it came in a plastic bag and shipping was the same price as the scarf. Because of the shipping thing I wouldnt recomend it.</li>
    <li> Mine looks nothing like the picture in terms of fullness and pattern. I&#x27;ve worn it twice, and the thread is already coming loose. It&#x27;s not silky, it&#x27;s just loosely threaded making it appear soft.</li>
    <li> It looks EXACTLY like the picture. I love it because it&#x27;s warm and huge. I even wore it as a skirt. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made so far!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and soft.  One of my favorite scarfs.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed. The seller should really remove the first photo because it looks nothing like it. A lot smaller and not as bright looking.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the same color as pictured.</li>
    <li> Material is nice.  The colors in the picture looks a lot lighter than the scarf I got.</li>
    <li> Excellent choice I love my scarf</li>
    <li> Loved scarf. Large in size and true to color.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty scarf, but I don&#x27;t think it is silk, as stated, but rather a cotton voile.  You shouldn&#x27;t say silk if it isn&#x27;t silk.</li>
    <li> I love this scarf! It&#x27;s a little smaller than the picture makes it seem but none the less, it&#x27;s a light and fluffy spring scarf. It adds a great pop of color, is soft, and is large enough to be wrapped in a bunch of different ways. I get so many compliments on this bad boy. I might order the blue one soon.</li>
    <li> Not as full as the picture makes it seem..still cute though.</li>
    <li> A positive thing I can say about my purchase is that it arrived much earlier than expected. However, it looked nothing like the picture. Very dark, mostly grey with black and very little contrasting white. And the size? Well, I suppose if you&#x27;re a toddler it will fit perfect. I ordered it specifically because it looked so huge and lush, gorgeous like a flowing long shawl almost. Well, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and 135lbs. and this scarf just wraps around my neck with just about the two ends reaching my shoulders when you hold them out straight. I really don&#x27;t know what else to say. Maybe I got one of the &amp;#34;irregulars&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that this scarf was ugly or anything, it was just a matter of it not meeting my expectations and, unfortunately, wasn&#x27;t what it looked like in the picture. Of course, that should have been expected. Overall, when I got the scarf, I wasn&#x27;t pleased with it, but I still kept it and I figured I would wear it anyway. It wasn&#x27;t bad, it just could have been a lot better.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what you see in the picture. Nice and long so you can wear it flowy or tie it as an infinity scarf.  I am in love. And it was so cheap!</li>
    <li> Great colors. Fast shipping. Looks great.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than pictured.  I ordered it for the size primarily.  Otherwise it is a nice scarf and color is as shown.</li>
    <li> Scarf was beautiful. The material is not very heavy. This scarf could be worn in winter or spring. The pattern was better than expected. This item was a great gift.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Granddaughter and she loves it very nuch.</li>
    <li> Its pretty thin material, but a cute scarf none-the-less</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous scarf but it took so long to get here my daughter didn&#x27;t get it by Christmas. I didn&#x27;t know it was coming from China or I would never have ordered it.</li>
    <li> I liked it, very nice material and stylish!</li>
    <li> Looks absolutely nothing like what&#x27;s in the picture.... it&#x27;s WAY smaller than the pic where the girl has it on..... TERRIBLE!!!! Very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE the scarf!  Great bargin and good quality.</li>
    <li> Wow!! I wore this scarf to an evening play and received so many compliments it made me blush.  Now I love my scarfs and shawls but didnt expect such rave reviews from total strangers...I guess this product speaks for itsself...purchase one for that special lady in your life or add to any outift in your wardrobe and be ready to blush from all the compliments.</li>
    <li> This needs a bit of pressing after washing, which i find tedious to do. Plus, the material is very thin and light weight. I really love the colors of this scarf though. Also it feels very soft. It is very colorful and can be worn with most of my outdoor get ups.</li>
    <li> The colors are not as shown, but, very pretty anyway.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised! The price is right and the print is gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Alittle thinner than I expected. But nice</li>
    <li> Lightweight and unique. Love this!</li>
    <li> The scarf essentially looks, pattern and color wise, just like the picture. What&#x27;s deceiving about this picture is how large the scarf actually is. Its fairly thin and medium length, the picture makes it seem wider and longer. I do still wear the scarf, but was very disappointed by the actual size.</li>
    <li> I ordered blue and red. both beautiful, but not as long as the picture suggested it. still a good buy for the price!!</li>
    <li> Pretty, soft, long and full. But I have an obsession with scarves!</li>
    <li> I am very, very with the scarves.  I will order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> My new favorite!!! Long and super easy to dress up with anything really!!! Had fun just dressing up with it. :)</li>
    <li> This scarf doesn&#x27;t look anything at all like the picture.  The color is completely different.  It is bright and loud and tacky looking even though it is soft.  I would never buy anything from these people again.</li>
    <li> I love the scarf! The colors are vibrant although it&#x27;s not as long and full as in the picture.</li>
    <li> It definitely looks nothing like the picture. The one in the picture looks much more full, big and flowing and rich in colour. I wont be able to wrap this one around my neck, otherwise it will be tooo short. I’ll just hang it on my shoulders without wrapping it.</li>
    <li> Wow, for the price you pay this is an awesome find!  The colors are just perfect, go so nicely with a few solid colors.  I wore the scarf with a sheath dress and it was perfect.  It is great for the cooler offices yet quite light.  It is long enough so you can tie it in a number of ways, but it does not bulk up.  I will probably get a few more scarves in this style.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful scarf -- a bit cheaply made but very inexpensive.  The seller is one that I would use again.</li>
    <li> Super cute and very fashionable</li>
    <li> A lot shorter than expected</li>
    <li> great color but material seemed cheap.</li>
    <li> Deceptive add, nothing like the photo . Poor quality .</li>
    <li> Like it. It isn&#x27;t nearly as big as the pic though, so it&#x27;s kinda misleading. But I love the colors</li>
    <li> When it came it had a few threads already loose and pulled. I can&#x27;t really tell, though, when it&#x27;s on. And it&#x27;s pretty. You get what you pay for, so no complaints.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but it&#x27;s a lot smaller than it looks in the picture.</li>
</ol>
