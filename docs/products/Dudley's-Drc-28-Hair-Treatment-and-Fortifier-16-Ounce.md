      <li>so far so good</li>
      <li>This is good stuff, but right after you use it you have to bring the PH back to your hair by using a moisturizer conditioner because this is some powerful protein.</li>
      <li>DRC 28 is a great hair treatment for damage, thin, split ends , breakage &amp; more  .</li>
      <li>DRC28 is the best, I recommend anyone that wants healthy strong hair use this protein treatment at least once a month and after your first treatment your going to notice a big difference in your hair.</li>

      <li>I gave it 3 stars because my stylist used on me for deep treatments and it grew my hair so fast, thick, and healthy, Research!!!!</li>

      <li>My old hairdresser used this product on my hair years ago....</li>

      <li>In July of 2011 my hair came out, I&#x27;m talking completely to the scalp.</li>
      <li>Even with it being cut short I&#x27;m still asked if it&#x27;s my real hair because it&#x27;s so full and thick, Thanks to my stylist knowing what I needed to stop my hair from coming out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have always loved this product. It truly stands behind its word. It builds the hair to the point of no return. If you use this product the correct way and followup every four to six weeks it will strengthen your hair. Knowing that I can get it from a reputable place such as Amazon is a five star.</li>
    <li> Idk if it&#x27;s me, but if you&#x27;re not a professional or don&#x27;t no how to dilute products this could really Roo your hair out...used once, never looked back. I gave it 3 stars because my stylist used on me for deep treatments and it grew my hair so fast, thick, and healthy, Research!!!!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it twice, haven&#x27;t noticed broken hair, so far so good I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> In July of 2011 my hair came out, I&#x27;m talking completely to the scalp. It was like having a forehead all the way around you head. I was told that the only thing that would help save my hair was a protein product called DRC28. I went online I found it and within 5 days I was getting my protein treatment. I had to do two treatments a week for about one month and once my hair stopped falling out I started getting a treatment once every two weeks and I did this for five months and now I have my thick hair back. I had to cut it down low to get it all even but in that time of using DRC28 my hair grew from scalp bald to about 5 1/2 or 6 inches long and it is still continuing to grow. Even with it being cut short I&#x27;m still asked if it&#x27;s my real hair because it&#x27;s so full and thick, Thanks to my stylist knowing what I needed to stop my hair from coming out. During the time I used the DRC28 I was not putting any chemicals on my hair, I was wearing weave to fill in the blanks where the hair was gone. I am now able to get my hair relaxed,styled and even combed without it breaking off at the roots. DRC28 is the best, I recommend anyone that wants healthy strong hair use this protein treatment at least once a month and after your first treatment your going to notice a big difference in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years when I worked in a salon. I call this liquid hair in a bottle. I have seen the miracles that DRC 28 has performed or damage hair. This time the miracle will be performed on me.</li>
    <li> Have only used this one time and it has stopped my hair breakage! This is the best hair product that I have ever used. This is a little pricey but you pay for what will work for your hair breakage.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and expected</li>
    <li> If you have hair that is breaking or falling out this the product for you.  This is good stuff, but right after you use it you have to bring the PH back to your hair by using a moisturizer conditioner because this is some powerful protein.</li>
    <li> used drc for the first time  and i must admit there was very  little shedding. Will continue to use as directed.  I do recommend  a moisterzing conditioner as stated on the bottle. I have ordered the moisturzing shampoo and  hair rebuilder.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will certainly purchase this product again. My hair is really improving. www.createmine.com</li>
    <li> Love this stuff ,,,,My hair is shedding less....I use this once a week.  I just hope they reduce the price... What I don&#x27;t like about the Dudley company that they know something work good the raise the prices.. for me that being greedy.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and stopped hair breakage as promised. My stylist used it when I go to the shop every 3 to 4 months, but she told me that I could use it myself inbetween salon visits. She was right. Price was much better than beauty supply stores in my city.</li>
    <li> My old hairdresser used this product on my hair years ago....and it worked fine then and works fine now.  I put color on my hair and the wrong type of perm....hair came out in the back and was breaking very bad.  I used DRC 28, hair stopped breaking immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be treating my hair with this product, two weeks after I put a perm on my hair.  My current hairdresser put a perm on my and cut it this Saturday and she mentioned that she did not see any hair on the comb when she was putting the perm on it or when combing through it......my hair is very strong.....thanks to DRC 28.  She was  amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair strong, thick and long....I have no plans to stop using it this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Nairobi therapeutic shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use DRC 28, two weeks after a perm - cap on head under dryer 20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;-very thick and will run..make sure does not sit on your skin while under dryer....cause skin irritation....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Nairobi moisturizing conditioner - cap on head under dryer again 10 minutes</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair strong and the breakage has stopped within two uses.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping packaged very well, product just as I remembered as far as quality...</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that my hair is frail, breaking and falling. I have only three weeks using this product, and I must say it is AMAZING!!!! I have tried everything in the past for my hair, and nothing seems to help...... I was recommended to use this product by my hair stylist, and believe me when I say I THANK HER sooooo much!  I will continue to use this product until I have reconstructed my hair completely!</li>
    <li> Stops shedding cold!  My hairstylist years ago used this when I complained of more noticeable shedding.  I started doing my own treatments at home, and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am still waiting on results i only used it twice in i know it takes a while to get results,i am not expecting a miracles,so i am giving it time to work itself in my hair ,i only use it once a month in since i just recently purchased this item ...my hair dresser suggested it  so hopefully my hair grows back ,especially in the center were it is super short could be from my medicine ,if it works no matter what the cost i wll continue to use,hopefully i can post back later with good results!</li>
    <li> I plan to use this once every 6 weeks. so far, I&#x27;ve only used once. I like what it says it will do. however, I haven&#x27;t seen the results. but again, I&#x27;ve only used once. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because the smell is very strong.</li>
    <li> Everyone like it and it was a good product people talk good about it and I will  tell my friends</li>
    <li> Thank you so much.! I am so satisfied.</li>
    <li> DRC 28 is a great hair treatment for damage, thin, split ends , breakage &amp; more  . It works well with all different type of hair. I have being using this treatment for 10 years and it has done wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is the BOMB!!! It Left my hair soft and full of bounce. I am of mixed race and have thick coarse hair and this product is by far the best i have tried! Expensive yes; but you only have to use a small amount so it should last you a long time! ENJOY!!</li>
