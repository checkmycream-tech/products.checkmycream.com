    <li> Probably the softest my hands have ever felt after using a lotion/cream.  I used in tandem with the Seacret Milk and Honey Salt Scrub and yes indeed, I am a fan.  I&#x27;ve moved my other lotions back and put this puppy up front.  The scent is fresh and perfect for summer...It&#x27;s my new go to.  Gorgeous You! delivered as promised...won&#x27;t hesitate to shop there again.</li>
    <li> The smell is glorious. Think sweet ocean breeze, and a whiff of honey~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A translated ingredient list looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;Water, shea butter, skin softeners, beeswax, emulsifiers, cocoa butter, milk sugar *gluconolactone*, olive fruit extract, dead sea salt, essential oils and fruit extracts, honey, and finally a few chemicals that add scent, emulsify, and protect the skin from UV rays. The actual ingredient is pretty long, and has chemicals. If the ingredients doesn&#x27;t scare you, give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long, LONG way, and this product is also paraben free!</li>
    <li> This product works great along with the seacret oil and salt scrub! Doing this once a week helps keep your skin looking and feeling soft and silky smooth!</li>

    <li> I purchased this product in a store once and absolutely loved it! The very mild scent was amazing. This product is very similar in the way it soaks into my skin, but the scent doesn&#x27;t match. It is in a different container, they must have changed the formula. It smells OK, whereas the old formula smelled amazing - not perfumey - natural and light. Oh well.</li>
