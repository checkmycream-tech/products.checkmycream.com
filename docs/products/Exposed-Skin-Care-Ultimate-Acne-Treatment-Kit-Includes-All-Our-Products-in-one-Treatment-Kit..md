<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product; I will only use this from now on. I wish I could post the before and after of my Cheeks (face, lol)...it&#x27;s been years and I was going to seek a new dermatologist but this product when used exactly as it says works and lasts about 4-6 months when used as recommended. I also bought the probiotic pills and they are helping I believe.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with acne until I was 20. I have since tried every major acne cleanser out there with no success. I have a dermatologist that has given me different meds and still nothing worked. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I am already seeing a huge difference. Almost all my acne has cleared up and my acne scars are beginning to fade. I am absolutely in love with this product and I will continue to use it forever! Best money I have spent in a long time. Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne for many years, and I have also tried many different products and treatments. Nothing ever seemed to work until I found Exposed. I love every piece in this kit. Each of them work together to fight acne and help the skin to look and feel healthier. I won&#x27;t use anything else, and I definitely recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> I am 35 years old and have had acne problems my whole life.  I used proactiv for about a decade and it recently stopped working for me.  I have been using exposed for the last 2 months and I love it.  It is not just an acne product it is also a skin product.  My skin is rejuvanated, glowing and acne free.  I recommend buying the ultimate kit to start so you can try all of the products and decide what products you like.  My favorite is the mask and the clear pore serum.  The probiotic complex is also a great way to fight the acne internally instead of the prescription anti-biotics my dermatologist prescribed.</li>
    <li> I struggled with acne as a teen and again as an adult in my 40&#x27;s it came back with just as much ferocity and stigma that it had when I was a teen. I tried every over-the-counter product, kits, gadgets and spa facials and peels. Nothing worked for more than 4-6 weeks at a time. Prescription medications didn&#x27;t help, much or they had intolerable side effects like gastric upset, overdry skin, peeling, or significant redness. I have very sensitive skin that reacts strongly to products with heavy fragrance and it overdries quickly which backfires and just causes more oil production and acne.  I&#x27;m nearing the end of my second month of Exposed Skin Care. Every time I look in the mirror, I smile now! My skin looks and feels healthy. It is not over dry, it feels smooth and soft. There is virtually no acne and even during a cycle, there may be only a small breakout that is immediately corrected with the clearing pore serum. My skin now has a healthy glow it never had before in my entire life. I do not experience that tight-skin feeling that I would have after washing with other products. My face feels clean even hours after I wash.  Best of all...after 30 years of wearing make-up to cover up acne and acne marks, for the last 2 weeks, I proudly wear no liquid face make up or powder at all!! This is the first time I can say this is true since I was a young teen.  Thank you Exposed Skin for creating this product for people with sensitive and acne-prone skin for people like me!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything under the planet for my face. I have suffered cystic acne for years!!!!!!!!!! I tried Proactive, Clinique, dermatologists, you name it, I tried it. Nothing worked.  I was online searching for the next miracle (typed while rolling eyes) and stumbled across Exposed Skin Care. I was in the middle of such a huge acne flair I was willing to try anything. I anxiously awaited the highly anticipated package and when it came to my house I ran to the bathroom with speed that would give serious competition to a cheeta.  I kid you not after 2 days of use ( I GOT THE PIECE KIT) for the night regimine, facewash, tonic, acne treatment, moisturizer and my day regimine facewash, tonic, clear pore treatment, moisturizer, my co workers, family, and friends could tell a difference.  Not just in the spots themselves but the surounding skin.  My pores were smaller, my skin was tighter and smoother ( LOVE THE MICRODERM ABRAISON SCRUB!!! I use it once a week or more).  I am breaking out less and less. Best part, when I do break out they last significantly shorter and they aren&#x27;t so painful!  I might get one a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be set if they would come out with make up!!!!</li>
    <li> If your acne is due purely to topical issues, I think this product would probably be great for you. However the location and type of acne I have points to hormonal issues. I am currently in treatment by a naturopath for this with some probiotics and vitamins, so I still needed a topical treatment. I spent years doing the harsh prescription treatments that only worked for a while, and found the most success with the oil cleansing method (google it) in combination with hormonal birth control methods. Since coming off the pill, the acne has gotten worse for the last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that you understand the context, it may be easier to understand why this product just isn&#x27;t working for me, and why it may not work for you. if your issue is hormones, a topical treatment just isn&#x27;t going to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do like the products. They are gentle but effective, and the kit has a full lineup of products you need to keep things in check. I also like that the line is free of a lot of chemical ingredients I object to. And as someone who spent a lot of time making her own skincare products, I appreciate the elements of nature used to compliment the chemical ingredients. It really does seem like the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying this product directly through the website. You get a discount by starting a membership with them, but after ordering your first kit, you will need to change the settings so it doesn&#x27;t autodraft your account every other month. I found that the products lasted me 3 months with use 2x daily. If you go directly through the company, you will receive much better service than if you use an intermediary like Amazon. When I had my account autodrafted, I was able to have the transaction canceled the same day and received both a phone call and an email within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to conclude, I do believe in the products, but you can&#x27;t expect them to work miracles if your real issue lies beneath the surface.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 13, and she started having acne issues about a year ago.  We tried several products, but she has sensitive skin and they were too harsh.  I researched and discovered Exposed Skincare products, and they have really helped her complexion tremendously.  Her two favorite Exposed Skincare products are the \\&quot;Clarifying Mask\\&quot; and \\&quot;Probiotic Complex\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This product really helps my daughter and doesn&#x27;t break the bank and is easy to get. I think you need the whole set though.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. I broke out like never before after a few days of bliss. I WILL NEVER EVER EVER BUY AGAIB</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004R6TMUM Exposed Acne Treatment - Ultimate Kit]]  After almost two years of using ProActiv and getting repeatedly aggravated as my skin wouldn&#x27;t stay clear, the Exposed system feels like a miracle.  Switching to Exposed has made all the difference in the world with my skin. Its never felt or looked as good as it does now. And it works fast too! The clear skin in less then 30 days is really true (minus any previously existing dark spots/scars, but those are fading, hopefully to be gone for good with continued usage of the micro-derm scrub and the mask). I highly recommend the Exposed system!</li>
    <li> i got the ultimate kit, and i think thats the best way to do it. you wont need to replenish a majority of it each time. if you get a bad breakout you can use the mask more or the scrub..i noticed a difference in my pores within a few weeks. spending so much money also makes you take better care of yourself as well. like a diet, you can&#x27;t expect major change without work, using it as appropriated, paying attention to the tips (drinking water, washing pillow cases, eating healthy) ... you wont see amazing results unless you take care of yourself along with these products. this is the first line ive ever purchased and its worth a try. i have dryer skin w/oily t-zone and i rarely need to use the moisturizer which is pretty amazing to me.</li>
    <li> I found this product because I was looking for proactive for my daughter and found an online article that compared the 4 top acne products.  I decided on Exposed products based on that article.  My daughter is a 14 yr old tomboy, and while her acne bothers her, she can&#x27;t be bothered with skincare routines.  I bought the complete pkg hoping that it would work well enough to motivate my daugher to actually use this product properly. I was amazed at the results we saw as soon as the next day.  All the redness was gone and her blemishes were shrinking already.  She had some issues with irritation the first week, but, she just uses a little less now and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem. She is still a little hit-or-miss with her skincare routine, and the acne comes back when she isn&#x27;t using it properly, but, as soon as she gets her act together it always works for her.  I am also very happy with how healthy her skin looks even when she doesn&#x27;t use it consistently.  I am very glad to have found this product because Jr. High girls have enough \\&quot;drama\\&quot; without the out-of-control acne complicating things :)</li>
    <li> The base kit works well but this a very thorough kit and works faster. It makes your skin feel much better using everything. The microderm scrub and clarifying mask are very worth it. The scrub clears away dead skins cells and the mask has charcoal that absorbs excess oil. The probiotic complex also helps you get the necessary vitamins and minerals for a healthy complexion if you are lacking. After using many other products that were too harsh or just didn&#x27;t work i couldn&#x27;t recommend this more. For the reviews saying they broke out after using it, this is normal. The timeline thing even says it will get worse before it gets better, as the impurities deep in your skin come out. My advice is to use this as instructed and eat a clean diet and your skin will be glowing.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. Love it and arrived 4 days after purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is really effective against acne.  However, I have really oily skin and the moisturizer isn&#x27;t enough to help control the oil production so I use additional products to help control the oil.</li>
    <li> (I posted this review on the other kits, not trying to spam, just wanna help) I&#x27;m 30, a dude, and have been fighting with my skin since i was about 14. I&#x27;ve gone through cheapo in store products (too many to name) and some of the more expensive products: Murad, clinique, etc. No matter what i always had blackheads, a few random pimples, and about 1 to 2 times a month i would get a lovely breakout. my skin wasnt THAT bad but i always always always had problems. I found Exposed by accident. I went online looking for alternative ways to get my skin to stop screwing with me and i got a link for the exposed \\&quot;lifestyle tips\\&quot; page. That led me to looking into the actual product. I skeptically pulled the trigger and got the uber kit with all the goodies. First week was not that rough, i got a few new pimples but i noticed my blackheads were getting a little smaller. Most skin care programs will warn you that it usually gets worse before it gets better. It got better. Weeks 2 and 3 showed steady improvement, few new minor pimples and my skin started looking healthier. I&#x27;m on the middle of week 4 and my skin looks better than it has in longer than i can remember. I KNOW my skin is healthier too. I used to get up early so i could give my face time to calm down before i went to work. Even washing it gently with my hands would leave it red, patchy, and swollen. Lotion was also a daily requirement. Definitely not the case now, i scrub and scrub and no irritation. I also know it&#x27;s healthier cause of the comments i get at work. People complain about the tonic. It DOES hurt at first. get over it, your skin is jacked up. I started using it once every other day there was certainly a little discomfort. Now i use it 1 to 2 times a day and there is absolutely no discomfort. Actually, all of the products in this kit have a much shorter and extreme \\&quot;getting used to\\&quot; period than other stuff i have tried. I recommend geting the kit with everything on your first buy. Some stuff works better for certain people. I live with my sister and we both use the products a little differently. Try them all and then you can re-buy the ones you really like. Lastly, i like that this program addresses scarring. I&#x27;ve definitely got a few red marks from all the years of torment and like exposed claims, the marks are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the other reviews, definitely a few fakes, it&#x27;s kind of off putting but whatever. If you leave a comment i&#x27;ll try to respond. I know how awful it is to worry about your skin all the time and if my input can help another exhausted acne victim i will be glad to give it. No skin care program works for everyone, just make sure give whatever you try a fair chance. Nothing is going to happen overnight. I strongly recommend giving Exposed a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, wash your pillow cases... a lot. people always forget to do that.or certain people. I live with my sister and we both use the products a little differently. Try them all and then you can re-buy the ones you really like. Lastly, i like that this program addresses scarring. I&#x27;ve definitely got a few red marks from all the years of torment and like exposed claims, the marks are fading.    I looked at the other reviews, definitely a few fakes, it&#x27;s kind of off putting but whatever. If you leave a comment i&#x27;ll try to respond.

    <li> I have battled acne since I was 14 and now 23 I had tried everything for my face and was just over products that don&#x27;t work! I was on prescription strength medicine but that wasn&#x27;t even working. In fact I think it was irritating my face even more. So I did a lot of internet research for a product that packed a punch but had an herbal aspect and came across Exposed Skincare Acne Treatment. I thought why not try it- I have nothing to lose. I have been using Exposed for the past 2 months and I am so unbelievably happy with it. All my friends and family members are noticing a difference and that means everything. I have been getting a lot of compliments on my face. My face is incredibly clear and breakout free but I have also been getting compliments on my actual complexion which has never happened before. I love the ultimate package because then you are able to try all of the products. I really feel like the probiotic complex (the oral supplement) makes a big difference. I also really enjoy the clarifying mask and microderm scrub that they have to offer too. The whole line is amazing. I give it 2 thumbs up and really encourage you to try it. It is the best thing that I have come across in a long time.  Overall, I am just so relived that I have finally found something that works. Thank you Exposed!!</li>
    <li> When I started using exposed, I struggled with cystic acne and the scars that it left. In 4 weeks most of the acne was cleared up. In 5 weeks, the scars are visibly fading. The product is gentle enough to not irritate my skin but strong enough to be effective. I really love the combination of salylic acid and natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son who&#x27;s skin actually got burnt, all red and irritated. He may have over applied but claims not. Just be careful.</li>
    <li> I bought the whole kit and kaboodle based on reviews. My skin was in a bad state and this sounded like it might work. I&#x27;ve used almost everything in an attempt to cure my acne - Minocine, Proactive, topical treatments from my dermatologist, Lever 2000 bar soap, you name it - so I had nothing to loose except $ by giving this a try.  I used Exposed as directed for 5 weeks and waited for results, but my skin actually GOT WORSE! The only things I liked were the smell and texture of the products. Exposed did help heal some of my acne scars, but did not cure my acne or prevent breakouts.</li>
    <li> The ultimate kit from Exposed Acne Treatment is excellent.  It provides a wide variety of products that all have specific chemical and plant based ingredients for treating acne and supporting healthy skin.  Unlike Proactive, Exposed has not irritated or dried out my very sensitive skin.  I especially like the moisturizer, because it feels like it is actually hydrating my skin, not stripping it. Five stars to Exposed!</li>
    <li> You have to follow the directions and be diligent, twice a day, every day. It&#x27;s made an incredible difference in reducing blackheads and deep cysts in my skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It really does clear up my skin so well, and the best part is it feels so healthy. Believe me when I say I have tried everything from Proactive to dermatologists. This product beats them all! Finally, something that really works!</li>
    <li> First one I ordered worked fantastic. But I&#x27;m disappointed with my second order of this product it stopped working and it ain&#x27;t cheap! Bummer....</li>
    <li> Love it, great for those of us that are getting large pores as we age.  Pricing was good. Only down side was the facial cleaner cap would not stay on tight.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!! I had really bad acne at my age of 46. I couldn&#x27;t use proactive because it was to harsh. I tried other products but nothing worked. I tried Exposed, I liked that I can actually try it without a subscription, and it worked. With in a week my skin was acne free!!! It even cleared up acne scars that I had. I have not had ANY allergic reaction, considering that I have the MOST sensitive skin ever, just soft clear skin!! I love, love, love it!!! All I can say is try it. It came on time like they said. I can not get enough of this product. A little goes a long way. Thank you Exposed for giving me back my clear complexion!!&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> I tried this product about 2 months ago. I am still using it and have found my skin to be the most clear that it has been in a long time. I only have mild acne but it is still just a devasting to get when you are used to clear skin. None of the expensive products worked to me. But the simple natural ingredients in this product works the absolute best! I never write reviews... But I had to this time! It&#x27;s an amazing product and it works within the first week of use. I have not any substantial breakout since using it. U will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I found myself experiencing adult acne during my early 30&#x27;s, much to my surprise and dismay. I prefer to use products that are naturally based and avoid harsh chemicals because my skin is also very sensitive. I had tried Neutragena Naturals and really didn&#x27;t have any significant improvements. From there I went on to use YesTo brand products, which I do love, but only saw some minimal improvement that ended up being temporary. Finally, after some research, I stumbled upon Exposed Skincare and I am so glad that I did. I can honestly say that in the 4 months since I began using the system my face has never looked better. I will still get an occasional tiny blemish, but nothing like what I was experiencing. My T-zone is significantly less oily and the general appearance of my skin is just healthier. The products smell great too, which is a bonus. I highly recommend these products if you&#x27;ve tried and failed with other brands.</li>
    <li> I have tried most of all acne products, prescription and over the counter products. This is the only product that works for me. I am an 38 year old female with PCOS. So my hormones are unbalanced. When I first started using this product I was desperate and discouraged, It started working immediately. 2 months ago I had as many as 15 or more very painful cystic pimples on my face at one time.Within about 3 weeks my acne was almost cleared up. I no longer get cystic acne and if I do get a pimple here and there they don&#x27;t appear all the way and disappear within days .Do change your pillow case often, keep dirty hands off your face ,tie your hair up, and try not to pop pimples if you do..like I do.. I wipe the pimple with alcohol ,l use an pimple extractor and I wipe it again with alcohol then I apply salicylic acid of your choice as an spot treatment and it goes down without a scar. I don&#x27;t use the scrub that often maybe once a week it seems to irritate my skin. I use the mask 3 days a week and works miracles. I also have started doing chemical peels now since my skin is cleared without irritation.before using this product anything I did to my face irritated it..Now I&#x27;m able to do more with my skin without breaking... out I cant live without this product. I know this product is kind of costly but it is well worth it, just stick to it and you will see results in no time. I would say this kit will last me 2 and a half months or more. I&#x27;m buying my next kit now so I wont run out I cant take the chance. There is no need to try any other product if this cleared up my bad skin it will work for others,, goodluck!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product worked to clear my skin up, and the results lasted longer than Proactiv. If I look at my skin wrong I will have a breakout and as a result there is some unevenness to my skin tone and if I have a blemish there is redness. I stopped having new blemishes after about a week of using this product, and these results lasted with continued use but I didn&#x27;t really see the overall texture of my skin looking better, even with the charcoal/sulfur mask and the microderm scrub. I started experimenting with different products and found a combination that works better for much cheaper. I wash my face in the mornings with an exfoliant that has 3% glycolic acid and then I follow that with a vitamin containing moisturizer. Doing this twice a day and periodically doing a sulfur or charcoal mask has made my skin look better than it ever has! When I first starting doing this I would rub a very small amount of the exfoliant gently onto my dry face and then without washing it off apply the moisturizing cream and leave that on while I was doing things around the house, I think that is why it worked so quickly to improve the appearance of my skin. The products I used are Aveeno&#x27;s Positively Radiant Targeted Tone Corrector with vitamin A and Nip+Fab Glycolic Scrub Fix. These two products together cost about $17 at Ulta and I finally have clear skin.</li>
    <li> The order arrived within 3-5 days of when It was purchased- I was pleased with the shipping speed. So far I love the kit. I do not have severe acne but I persistently get breakouts all over. I also mess with them which proves to make them worse so I lose twice! So far the kit has helped heal my existing acne and is starting to clear my skin! My husband even noticed. There are no harsh chemical smells and no stinging has occured for me. I have used the products for about 1 week, following the directions exactly &amp; am happy with the results so far. For the kit and all the products, the $100 is worth it because each item separately would cost more anyway. Plus since I use all the products as directed there is no way to determine which one is helping the most. Good luck and God bless.</li>
    <li> It helped clear up my skin very well as promised. No irritation or discomfort. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll Make this short with just a few words. This product is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used!! from hundreds of over the counter products to prescribed medications nothing ever really worked! After 3 -4 days of using Exposed I started noticing a big change on my skin and other people started to notice as well. If you have sensitive skin this is the product for you!!!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with moderate acne since my late teens. I have been on lots of prescribed topical creams, oral and topical antibiotics, and I even took Accutane. I was clear for several years after Accutane and then my acne slowly started to resurface. However, it was mild and I was able to keep it under control with topical benzoyl peroxide and topical antibiotics for the past few years. Unfortunately, it recently started to worsen. My dermatologist offered me spironolactone and birth control pills because he thought my acne was hormonal. I had taken both in the past prior to Accutane without any positive effect on my acne. So I declined both, but agreed to go on oral doxycycline. The course of doxycycline was brief as I developed esophagitis from it within a few weeks. I then continued on my same regimen that was no longer working: topical Benzamycin (benzoyl peroxide with erythromycin) and a glycolic wash. I continued to break out and was about to make an appointment to go back to the dermatologist. Before I made my appointment, I decided to google &amp;#34;Acne Treatment&amp;#34; one last time. Somehow I stumbled onto Exposed. It has been one week and my mild-moderate acne is gone with ZERO irritation by the way. Within a few days, my face was clear! Exposed is amazing and I am so happy with this product! Anyone who has suffered from acne knows how it affects your self esteem. Thank you Exposed! So thrilled that this worked for me! Give it a try-you have nothing to lose! PS. This is a legit review. I read a lot about fake Exposed reviews and I am glad I ignored those claims :)</li>
    <li> I started getting acne as I got into my late 20&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s.  I tried several different products that helped some but none completely. I heard about Exposed about a year and a half ago, tried it, and never looked back. Easy to use, smells better than a lot of other acne products. And I haven&#x27;t had one pimple since I started using it. I have very sensitive skin, and none of the products have irritated my skin at all. You&#x27;ll run out of some product before others, so after a while I order extra toners, facial cleansers and acne treatment serums and slow down the automatic pack shipment.</li>
    <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t bad at all in high school or the early college years but began to get worse as I got older. My pores were clogged and would create small pimples, along with really large painful under the skin pimples that I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of. No matter what face washes I tried, I couldn&#x27;t quite get control of the acne or dryness, it seemed to just get worse. I tried proactive at one point but it really didn&#x27;t make a difference and dried my skin out. After a few weeks of really bad breakouts I decided to try this, as I didn&#x27;t want to go back to proactive again. I was surprised by how well it has worked. I began using the Ultimate system in late June 2013 (August 2013 now) and my face is completely clear of breakouts. I recommend getting the Ultimate system first because it allows you to try all of the products and get a feel for what your skin needs and what it doesn&#x27;t. For example, I always seemed to have dry skin so I wanted the moisturizer but it turns out that I didn&#x27;t really need it. My face isn&#x27;t dry anymore and I don&#x27;t need the moisturizer. I also ended up not using the pills. Its also nice having the scrub and mask for occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect drastic results right away - It took a month and a half for all of my breakouts to go away and stay away. I haven&#x27;t had a large, painful pimple since I started using the system and if I do get a pimple, they&#x27;re really small and go away quickly. Just remember to be patient, DON&#x27;T pick at your skin (I used to be a picker, it makes it all worse), and use the system every day, don&#x27;t skip a day. This is really the first thing that has worked for me and I don&#x27;t intend to stop using it.</li>
    <li> This product prevents my skin from breaking out, It also help my skin to feel very clean. This product gives my skin a glow. this product last me almost 3 months .I am very please.</li>
    <li> Definite results where other products failed.  Finally I can see results after after 3-4 weeks and love waking up in the morning seeing a clearer me!</li>
    <li> its the only acne product that has cleared my face up. It takes a while but I love it. I was disappointed that they didn&#x27;t send the bottle with the pills. Only problem I had.</li>
    <li> I do not use this product myself, but my grandson swears by it!  I agreed to buy it for him, so he&#x27;s satisfied on many levels.</li>
    <li> I guess alot of people have not been getting the results that they expected. but I mean everybody&#x27;s skin is different and there will never be a \\&quot;MIRACLE\\&quot; product for ALL types of skins. I never really had crazy or severe acne. Just breakout here and there but nothing insane. I never had scars and or \\&quot;craters\\&quot;. If anything Exposed really made my skin glow and got rid of my whiteheads, as well as keep my skin feeling young and not so oily. I have really oily skin so this product really helped maintain my oilyness, plus it doesnt have a scent to it which i like. i hate products with over arching scents. yuck. the only con that i could think of is the soap. its not very effective in my opinion. but nonetheless as a package its amazing!</li>
    <li> I cannot speak highly enough about this product. My 17 year old son was suffering from chronic cystic type acne, which was actually physically painful and had already caused some scarring.  After researching on the net to compare Proactive, I came across Exposed Skincare and we decided this sounded the best way to go and ordered the complete kit.  We live in Western Australia and I have had a bad experience ordered online from overseas, so was a bit worried about the order arriving and being locked in to automatic re-ordering that I would not be able to alter. The product has worked amazingly well, after some initial dryness, which was corrected by using less cleanser, his skin has cleared up 90%, the redness had gone, the scarring greatly reduced and he rarely even gets pimples any more and if he does, they are just pimples, not the red mountainous cystic acne.  They also gave us some tips early on, like washing your pillow case regularly, cutting out/reducing sugar and dairy intake, which I believe has helped.  For a 17 yearold to cut out junk food and eat less sugar, you know his skin was greatly bothering him. The ordering system has been great, very prompt email response to a request to amend an order, whether it be needing extra product or bringing a delivery forward. Very impressed with the company and its products!!</li>
    <li> So far so good! I have a lot of blackheads on my nose and made them less visible...this skincare product made my skin smooth which makes my foundation a lot easier to put on...no need for face primers anymore!</li>
    <li> Since my mid-teens, I&#x27;ve had acne problems. I&#x27;ve always had severe cystic acne and infections in certain areas of my face and nothing seemed to work to cure the infections. I tried erythromycin, tetracycline, and various other antibiotics and nothing has worked quite like exposed to keep my acne count low and regulate new formation. I recommend this product to anyone with acne as it works marvelously.</li>
    <li> sadly this was a huge waste of money!  I used exactly as directed and it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate of the ultimate. As you get older, for some that is 18 or even 25, your acne will eventually subside or diminish. These can always be breakout, although uncommon, it is not unheard of either. Anyhoo, this kit should have everything to help you beat acne. Breakdown!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. This is my second time using the kit, with the basic one being my first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;. There is always the risk of your acne worsening or returning upon not using as directed or eating foods that contribute to it&lt;br /&gt;. Like anything, it will work for some at an early time than another. There WILL ALWAYS be some improvement upon use for a reasonable time&lt;br /&gt;. If this does not work for you, consult a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;. The pills are healthy and natural, so teenage bagels can take them and won&#x27;t grow them an arm or a leg.&lt;br /&gt;. Don&#x27;t wash your face too much, only once or twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;.Personally, not washing my face for a whole day was healthier than exfoliating on a daily basis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the kit is worth the money (not actually being that expensive for all the items included). It is the perfect starter kit.</li>
    <li> I have tried many acne products over the years with little or temporary success.  I and my daughter have been using Exposed for approximately three months now and we very pleased with the results.  She is seeing faster improvement than I am but I still like the product and think I need to give it more time.  I think the issue I am having is the moisturizer and another company&#x27;s sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I should probably be more consistent with this product than I have been. But I take the pills and already seeing results with no new acne, and the old red ones fading away!  I&#x27;m happy with this product and definitely buying a new set once this one is done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love how they use natural products and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, b/c I have very sensitive skin, especially to anything that has alcohol in it.  I&#x27;d have to say my favorite product is the the black mask, and I love their cleanser and clearing tonic. So easy to use and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you all enjoy, I can guarantee you it will not make you break out, especially if you&#x27;re always using their moisturizer!</li>
    <li> i have an oily and dry combination skin type i stayed faithful to it for weeks and nothing changed, i actually got these weired little bumps around the corners of my mouth. it didnt seem to hault my acne or stop the current ones. The acne clearing gel is super sticky and the toner smells really weired, i did like the microdermabrasion scrub and the clarifying mask is alright</li>
    <li> I have used many different products over the past 10 years for acne. All over the counter products you can buy at the store and I even used proactive for many years. I searched for a long time and read many reviews before deciding to use this product. I have had the basic kit and the ultimate kit. The ultimate kit is the best way to go as it includes moisturizer and probiotic pills. Takes less then a month to adjust and you will start seeing results in only a few months.</li>
    <li> Exposed skin care cleared my face within a week, and has kept it clear for a year so far! I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I know, everyone said I&#x27;ve tried every product out there and nothing has worked for me. Well I can say the same thing, I&#x27;ve tried products all around the world, washes, scrubs, moisturizes, BB creams, organic cleansers, oil cleansers, the oil treatment, even washing with nothing but water. I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand out there, from the cheapest stuff to some of the most expensive stuff money can buy hoping that something would eventually work for my face. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say that I have sever acne, but it is pretty noticeable; there are much more worse cases there but I have persistant acne that does bother me a lot and of course at times it does affect my self confidence. Whenever I look at pictures I can see bumps all over my face while my friends are blessed to have clear skin. I hate it when they complain about one zit - and in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a Groupon deal for a Tanda Acne Clearing light thing and I really wanted to try it out, but I don&#x27;t know. The whole gentle heat thing doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. If the heat isn&#x27;t hot enough to kill bacteria, you&#x27;re just creating a better environment for them to reproduce. I&#x27;m a biologist, but I haven&#x27;t read any research articles about certain wavelengths of light having the ability to kill the bacteria that causes acne. I know that salicylic acid is used to help slough off dead skin cells and bring new ones to the surface (essentially drying out the skin so that it can come off) while benzoyl peroxide is used to help kill the bacteria that clog pores and cause acne to form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was close to purchasing the Tanda Acne light thing, but I decided to just search for \\&quot;Acne Treatments\\&quot; on Amazon and read the reviews on the highest rated items. I looked at the reviews for other products like Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, Murad, ProActiv, etc, but I found that Exposed had the highest overal rating. I went onto their website and it looks like every other \\&quot;Get clear skin now!\\&quot; website; kind of cheesy and almost unprofessional looking. But I looked at the active and inactive ingredients and I liked what I saw. Every product that you put on your face is a combination of both science and nature - two things that I trust in (I am a biologist after all). Each individual product has a combination of some chemical to help with the acne and more importantly (at least to me) a natural agent to help soothe the skin and make it so it doesn&#x27;t flare up. A lot of the line has Green Tea in it to help detoxify the skin and sooth it, while others have natural ingredients that help improve cell turnover or help improve circulation to the skin, of course depending on which product it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, the old montage is that your skin has to get worse before it gets better, especially when using a new product. Almost every past product I have used has done this to me, the first stage is entirely worse - lots of reddening of my skin, inflammation and new cysts. It clears up for a little bit, but then it comes back and I have to change up my routine. Keep in mind that I don&#x27;t switch products often. I try to use them for at least two months before I come to a conclusions. I know some of you reading this may think two months is too short, but I found that using Exposed was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a last resort to treating my acne, I went all out and bought the Ultimate Kit which includes everything the company sells. The cleanser, toner, acne treatment, pore treatment, moisturizer, scrub, clay mask, multivitamin/digestive supplement and rinsing cloth. I started using this about a month ago and I can say that I have absolutely pleased with the results. I had absolutely no initial flare up, but I was wise to follow the directions and using the products pretty sparingly at first. I haven&#x27;t changed the amount of product I&#x27;ve used but I still see consistent results. I will admit, I have had a few bumps here and there but most go away in a day or two. The products do have a scent to them,not to say they smell bad, but some of the things I&#x27;m not very fond of, but I don&#x27;t shy away from using them because they work! One of them is the clear pore serum which has licorice extract so it kind of smells bad to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the morning and night routine they recommend. In the morning I cleanse, wipe down with the toner, and before my skin dries completely put on the acne treatment, wait to dry and then use the moisture complex. At night, I cleanse again, sometimes with a Clarisonic if I feel that I&#x27;ve been exposed to a lot of dirt and grime throughout the day, pat dry, and again before my face is completely dry, apply the clear pore serum, wait to dry, then spot treat with the acne clearing serum. Following all of that I moisturize. I know, it sounds like a lot of steps and it can be kind of confusing because all the tubes look the same, but after a couple weeks of doing it its a breeze and takes like 5 minutes. I use the scrub every once in a while and I like it because it will condition my skin because of the grape seed oil that it has. And I know, OIL? Why would you put more oil on your face?! To me, it makes sense because if you&#x27;re gonna be scraping the dead skin off of it, you should moisturize immediately. If you moisturize properly, your face will be less likely to produce oil - your face produces oil when it gets too dry, so that might be the reason why some of those products that are made for oily prone skin inadvertently make your skin more oily. As for the clay mask, I can&#x27;t really say I like it or not, I just slap it on when I feel like I it, but I can tell you, a little of  this products goes a long way. As for the products as a whole, it&#x27;s been about a month and I feel like I&#x27;ve gone through the products half-way so it really does last for 60 days, or I&#x27;m hoping it does. The good thing is unlike some other systems, like Neutrogena skinID, you can order individual products as you need. I hated that about skinID, I found that I would run out of two products before the cleanser. I think the supplement has been good to my digestive system (interestingly enough) because of the probiotics that they put into it. I don&#x27;t mind the extra dose of vitamins either, since I most likely don&#x27;t intake enough of them in the first place. I will admit that the capsule tastes absolutely disgusting and I try to hold my breath whenever I take it. I always try to take it super fast so that it doesn&#x27;t touch my tongue at all, ahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since starting using Exposed, I can say that my skin has never been more clear. The texture is much more even, the dark spots are starting to fade a way, I have noticeably much more clear skin and I smile every morning when I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this thing called my &#x27;harsh light&#x27; test. Most bathroom lights are very soft and don&#x27;t really reveal the texture of the skin that well. I don&#x27;t know why, but my bathroom has a big, three floodlight fixture and this thing will show you every nook and cranny of your face. I HATE using this light because I HATE looking at my skin because before I started Exposed, when I look in the mirror with the regular light, everything would just reveal itself. I&#x27;m not going to lie, my skin is not the smoothest (YET!), but it has improved incredibly and I&#x27;m not afraid to use that &#x27;harsh light&#x27; anymore. I love the direction my skin is heading and I would absolutely recommend this for anyone! This stuff is definitely worth the price. I just wish Amazon stocked it so I could get it with free Prime shipping!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the cloth, this is not to be used as a cleansing cloth. Microfiber is a much more abrasive material than regular cotton and can be too harsh on your skin if you use it as a wash cloth. They recommend washing your face with your hands, and using it as a cloth to help rinse your face. It&#x27;s an interesting concept, but I&#x27;m following every step they make and I&#x27;m loving the results.not to say they smell bad, but some of the things I&#x27;m not very fond of, but I don&#x27;t shy away from using them because they work! One of them is the clear pore serum which has licorice extract so it kind of smells bad to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the morning and night routine they recommend.

If you moisturize properly, your face will be less likely to produce oil - your face produces oil when it gets too dry, so that might be the reason why some of those products that are made for oily prone skin inadvertently make your skin more oily. As for the clay mask, I can&#x27;t really say I like it or not, I just slap it on when I feel like I it, but I can tell you, a little of  this products goes a long way. As for the products as a whole, it&#x27;s been about a month and I feel like I&#x27;ve gone through the products half-way so it really does last for 60 days, or I&#x27;m hoping it does. The good thing is unlike some other systems, like Neutrogena skinID, you can order individual products as you need. I hated that about skinID, I found that I wouldrun out of two products before the cleanser. I think the supplement has been good to my digestive system (interestingly enough) because of the probiotics that they put into it. I don&#x27;t mind the extra dose of vitamins either, since I most likely don&#x27;t intake enough of them in the first place. I will admit that the capsule tastes absolutely disgusting and I try to hold my breath whenever I take it. I always try to take it super fast so that it doesn&#x27;t touch my tongue at all, ahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since starting using Exposed, I can say that my skin has never been more clear. The texture is much more even, the dark spots are starting to fade a way, I have noticeably much more clear skin and I smile every morning when I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this thing called my &#x27;harsh light&#x27; test. Most bathroom lights are very soft and don&#x27;t really reveal the texture of the skin that well. I don&#x27;t know why, but my bathroom has a big, three floodlight fixture and this thing will show you every nook and cranny of your face. I HATE using this light because I HATE looking at my skin because before I started Exposed, when I look in the mirror with the regular light, everything would just reveal itself. I&#x27;m not going to lie, my skin is not the smoothest (YET!), but it has improved incredibly and I&#x27;m not afraid to use that &#x27;harsh light&#x27; anymore. I love the direction my skin is heading and I would absolutely recommend this for anyone! This stuff is definitely worth the price. I just wish Amazon stocked it so I could get it with free Prime shipping!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the cloth, this is not to be used as a cleansing cloth. Microfiber is a much more abrasive material than regular cotton and can be too harsh on your skin if you use it as a wash cloth. They recommend washing your face with your hands, and using it as a cloth to help rinse your face. It&#x27;s an interesting concept, but I&#x27;m following every step they make and I&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products in the past, but this works the best by far. You need to stick to the instructions exactly though.</li>
    <li> It is a little more expensive than the Basic Kit and Expanded Kit, but believe me it&#x27;s worth it, in my opinion! I love all of the products, but my favorite isn&#x27;t offered in the other kits and that is the Clarifying Mask! I used to use it only once a week, but I&#x27;ve recently started using the mask twice a week and WOW i can REALLY see a difference in the blackheads on and around my nose. I used to have pretty bad cystic acne, the big painful ones, and they mostly broke out on my cheeks, but thanks to FINALLY finding these products all I really have to worry about are the scars left behind, which the kit is fading, but now i&#x27;m figuring out how to tackle those stubborn blackheads! Also i love the Derm X Cloth, there is nothing really special about it and im sure you could find an exfoliating cloth somewhere else, but it comes in all of the kits and i really enjoy using it. It really gets all the dead skin off and my face feels SO smooth afterwards! Overall, GREAT, AMAZING, WONDERFUL products! I just wish i would have found the Exposed Skincare Kit&#x27;s years ago!</li>
    <li> Guys, firstly, One word AMAZING!. I will definitely recommend to anyone looking for good acne products. First month of use was a major improvement on decreased acne, off course complimented by improved diet. Stayed away from Dairy for a little which helped. I don&#x27;t eat meat nor fried foods. My problem was water intake. This Product works great as whole not single use of each whenever you feel like it. The moisturizer application after all the other steps tingled a bit, so barely used it. Better than their competitor proa****. Tried and Tested! Love it and will continue to use it. On my second set.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  I developed adult acne and my skin  has always been extremely oily.  I tried many different products that helped somewhat but it was after a 60-day cycle of Exposed products that people started noticing a change in my complexion.  My skin is much clearer and my pores are smaller.  There are a lot of steps to this so I don&#x27;t know how long I will continue to use it daily but I think I will keep it around in case I need it again.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this product through amazon, however, the prices seem comparable. Suspicious? That&#x27;s fine. I swear I am a real person so try not to depict this message or analyze my grammar too closely. I began using this regime about two weeks ago and my face is flawless. As a teacher, my hands are exposed to germs and I noticed that many breakouts were in the areas (cheeks) where I rest my head on my hands. As a married adult, I became  humiliated by the fact that my students acknowledged my situation. I purchased a wide range of products and they all seemed to fail, including Proactive which worked in my teens. As the time goes on I will update my review accordingly if necessary. Until then, my only warning is for you to make sure not to overuse or over-exfoliate. Sometimes skin irritation may appear like acne and could be the cause of some of these poor reviews!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18, and have had relatively mild to moderate acne most of my teenage years. When I first started getting acne, I was using Proactiv. Proactiv was time consuming, hurt my skin, and I would still get breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;For the past year or so, I&#x27;ve been using Exposed, and it (for me) has been extremely effective! I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously (sometimes once a day, sometimes skipping days) and it has still worked great. I don&#x27;t have perfect skin, but my blemishes are few and far between. I think this is my fourth kit now. Would like to give a quick example of how effective Exposed is for me. After I ran out my last kit a couple of weeks ago, I was lazy with ordering a new one, and I&#x27;ve payed for it with a large cystic outbreak on my cheek. I have pretty decent skin except for one large, severe spot. Hopped online and ordered this kit (first time getting the big one) and after using it for two days, just two mornings and two nights, I have already seen a huge reduction in the size of my cyst. I can already tell it will be mostly cured by the weekend (and this thing was probably bigger than a dime !!). If I follow the routine to a T, I have no doubt I would have almost flawless skin.&lt;br /&gt;Everybody&#x27;s skin is different... it&#x27;s not going to work for everyone. My skin type is very dry, I have pretty mild acne (except for the occasional cystic outbreak a couple of times a year) and my skin reacts to Exposed very well. I&#x27;m blessed to have never had to deal with very severe acne. My acne is just bad enough where it can get very noticeable and troublesome for me if left untreated, and Exposed does the trick for me. I chose Exposed over other treatment systems because of the natural ingredients. It feels so much better when putting it on compared to other treatments I&#x27;ve used like proactiv and over-the-counter creams. If you&#x27;ve never used acne treatment like this before, than expect some burning and irritation as your skin gets used to some of the harsher ingredients like the Benzoyl Peroxide. The irritation from Exposed was far less severe for me than it was with Proactiv, and all of the other treatments I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s also so easy to use. You only need to use water for a couple of products in the line... the rest are just rub on serums. I honestly love how quick and convenient the routine is.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for how effective Exposed is for more severe forms of acne, but I know for my mild to moderate acne, it has been absolutely perfect! I haven&#x27;t used the probiotic complex long enough to really notice any effects yet, but doing a quick search on the ingredients will reveal that it should be a great addition to any acne-fighting regimen!</li>
    <li> Did a lot better Proactive and dermatologist. Already ordered more and won&#x27;t be going back to dermatologist. Kit costs less than office visit.</li>
    <li> The product works as expected and I would recommend it to any one looking for this type of product. recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have fought acne my entire life.  Not at 50 I finally have clear skin thanks to Exposed Skin.  It can be slightly drying if you don&#x27;t use the moisturizer....other than that worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Too expensive and does not work.  This actually made my daughter&#x27;s acne worse!!!  She developed huge pimples all over her face which she only had a fraction of before starting Exposed.  After reading other reviews on some of the other kits, I truly believe that most of the 5 star reviews are fake and most likely posted by the manufacturer.  Product definitely doesn&#x27;t work and customer service is just as bad.  Buyer Beware!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son because he has bad acne. I set up a regimen for him to gradually use so it wouldn&#x27;t dry and crack his skin and so far so good. This is the best his skin has looked in a long time. Time will tell however it has been a month now but as with many treatments he uses them, they work and suddenly stop. He has thanked me many times for getting this for him so he seems to be very pleased and he feels so much better about himself. He really like the face wash, tonic and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne for years and this product changed all that. After 2 months of daily use my face is clear, smooth and brighter. I have used so many products and this by far is the world&#x27;s best. Am so glad I stumbled into it on Google search.</li>
    <li> I had beautiful skin until I was a senior in high school. Then, I begin to have really bad acne and tried every product on the market. I visited a dermatologist and tried over the counter medicine as well. I have VERY sensitive skin so I always had to be careful what I chose. I happened upon Exposed Skin Care after Googling the best reviews and decided to give it a try. I bought the starter kit with the cleanser, toner, acne treatment, clear pore serum, and moisturizer. I also started taking the probiotic and WOW!! The results I have from this product are better than I have ever seen before. The price is kind of high but they last a good amount of time, they offer coupons and special deals, and you can buy any product individually if you use one faster than the others. I recommend this product to anyone that knows me because they know how much I struggled before and now I have the pretty skin that I used to have.</li>
    <li> I have had the worst acne since my teen and was so embarrassed by it. I have tried many products, they are either dry out my skin or the breakout comes again after some time. When I first bought this ultimate kit, I have to admit that I was skeptical. But After two weeks of using this kit, I noticed a significant difference in the size and redness of my breakouts. It definitely helps to keep them under control. Now my skin is very clean than ever. I would recommend Exposed products to anyone whom has been fighting acne especially to who shouldn&#x27;t have it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004R6TMUM Exposed Acne Treatment - Ultimate Kit]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stuff. I have mild to bad acne it really depends on my diet and what I drink that will cause a serious issue. However this stuff is amazing. If you follow the directions and use it daily you will see results fast. 3 days I noticed drastic results. I don&#x27;t know if this will do the same for everybody this is just my experience. I will also suggest cycling &amp;#34;Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay&amp;#34; and mix it with some organic apple cider vinegar. That facial clay is the best stuff I swear by it. If you experience red rash after using I won&#x27;t think of it to much I get it every time I use it and it goes away after 30 minutes or so. Just follow the directions on how often to use and when mixing with apple cider use equal parts. Try using a small amount first you&#x27;ll be amazed how little you actually need to cover your face and neck. Its not as much as you would think. So mix a little like a tablespoon first and add more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. But definitely not hype like other big name brands out there.</li>
    <li> This expanded kit was not available when I first started using exposed.  I would always have to buy the extra products in addition to the kit.  These items really enhance the great benefits of the exposed system and are now a part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I purchased the ultimate kit from exposed, not Amazon. So not sure if the policies are different.. But ultimately I am giving this 4 stars because there is 3 really really good products in this line. Plus  exposed has a 1 year return policy on your first kit! So if you don&#x27;t like.. Send it back. I was only pleased with 3 products though.. I have moderate acne and am in my 20&#x27;s and trying to clear it up! It didn&#x27;t.. But those 3 products alone did.. Here is my honest review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial Cleanser: this cleanser is wonderful! No smell and gentle on your skin. Your skin will feel super clean.. Just still isn&#x27;t worth the $15/month a piece just to get this one cleanser. I am going back to my purpose gentle cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearing Tonic: this didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. At all. I&#x27;m not sure what the point of this is. My skin actually got better after stopping use of this product. Big thumbs down to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne Treatment Serum: wonderful! I am actually thinking about replacing my acne.org BP lotion with this.. As it is gentle, doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to my eyes or skin.. Completely clears me up! And I mean this completely clears me up..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Pore Serum: this if God awful! This made every single pore clogged and to have blackheads. My skin looked HORRID. Completely clogged pores. A big boo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisture Complex: so wonderful wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.. Completely calms the skin and gives moisture all over like I&#x27;ve never seen before! I am thinking about replacing my Moisturizer with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microderm Scrub: no.. Doesn&#x27;t scrub anything and just burns my skin. Completely pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarifying Mask: this doesn&#x27;t do anything for me but leave my pores looking black.. No way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probiotic Complex: this upset my stomach. Didn&#x27;t do anything. So no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed everything just right. I started eliminating products after two weeks because I started getting tons of cystic acne and my pores were just filled with black gunk. So I had blackheads everywhere! My skin looked green like I had been sick with the flu. It was so awful.. I was upset at this point but tried to give it another shot.. So to summarize it up - if they just sold a kit with their cleanser, their BP serum and their moisturizer - I would buy it! Completely cleared my skin up better than my last regimen.. I mean I would buy it if if was at least  decent priced and good sized because the sizes they give you that are supposed to last 60 days - would barely last a month. No matter how &amp;#34;little you use&amp;#34; there&#x27;s no way!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company gets four stars because they have a good return policy and they some of their products worked better for me than the ones I had been using for years before this! I would suggest trying their BP lotion and moisturizer if anyone is looking at this!</li>
    <li> I feel like I threw away over $100.  It may work with some people, but made no difference to my daughter - and she followed directions very carefully..  Very disappointing and tough to see a 14 year old get her hopes up and then have no results.  I inquired about returning the product for the &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34; but finally just gave up and took the loss.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I ever tried it.</li>
    <li> (I posted this on the basic package review section, but since this kit includes the supplemental pills, I thought it would be appropriate to post here as well). I&#x27;ve tried for a long time to find a product that clears up acne and keeps acne away. I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv and Skin ID, I&#x27;ve even dabbled with so called home remedies, but none of these items could keep acne away. Proactiv would clear up my skin but sure enough acne would come back up - not to mention this product bleached everything I owned, more or less. Skin ID, I don&#x27;t know why I even bothered - it was a good sales pitch but there wasn&#x27;t even a single positive result from using this product. I heard about Exposed and decided to give it a whirl since I really had nothing to lose at this point. Ever since I started, I haven&#x27;t looked back. This system not only gets rid of acne in a couple weeks but actually keeps them away. I&#x27;ve found that taking the supplemental pills really help - not only do I use the facial wash system, but regulating my hormones/facial oil from the inside has shown great results. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s desperate for a system that works, or is in the market for the first time.</li>
    <li> I started having acne for some reason a year ago and It was really really bad. And I was very sad and lost all my confidents. Having acne was such a nightmare. But one time I was surfing and looking for a therapy that hopefully worked. And I came across Exposed Skin Care that was ranked higher than any other skin care products for acne. And I have used 3 Ultimate Kits and all of my friends have been saying: OMG your skin looks so good now. I am very thankful and I feel so much more confident now. You should really give it a try!</li>
