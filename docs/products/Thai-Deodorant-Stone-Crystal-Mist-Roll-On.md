### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This works great!</li>
      <li>Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This brand is so wonderful that my husband switched to them but uses the spray version.</li>
      <li>Truly the best.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant is THE BEST I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>very good and zero smell!</li>
      <li>This works great too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a happy user of this product for years.  </li>
      <li>Worked great for.</li>
      <li>This product works great, stops odors, doesn&#x27;t stink and doesn&#x27;t itch.  </li>
      <li>Amazing!  </li>
      <li>Amazing product!  </li>
      <li>Most effective!</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay!  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m getting another one  which is my own fault.</li>
      <li>So, after purchasing this, right after I shower I apply this and put on a beautiful perfume/spray</li>
      <li>Best natural deodorant I have used!</li>
      <li>Best deodorant I have tried so far.</li>
      <li>This is also good as a toner for breakouts or to clean cuts.</li>
      <li>but I noticed more wetness.</li>
      <li>I have been using Thai Deodorant Crystal Spray for more than year</li>
      <li>and I love it, just started using this</li>
      <li>Very happy with their entire line of products.</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it would be better to just get the stone so it can be washed between uses.</li>
      <li>but I sure do about THAI Deodorants</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this. :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve also purchased the spray version, which works ok, but not as well as the roll-on; it&#x27;s more for times when I run out of this and need something to hold me over until I order more)</li>
      <li>I love this roll-on rendition of a great line of natural, effective hygiene care.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Really glad I can get it online.</li>
      <li>Have many allergies and sensitivities.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it.</li>
      <li>What made this product even more ineffective is the roll-on factor: after 3 or 4 applications on a very clean skin, the tip of the bottle would give off this foul odor.</li>
      <li>great and natural for kids!!</li>
      <li>If you need to apply mid-day then use some hand soap to thoroughly clean and then use the Thai Crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
      <li>The problem is that after about a week the roll on deodorant began smelling like body order really strongly, so when I put on the deodorant I would then smell.</li>
      <li>I suffered significant itching using the anti perspire deodorants, and don&#x27;t like the strong perfume odors of others.  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time which makes it a great value.</li>
      <li>Most deodorants have magnesium which darkens the underarm, this is why I made the change to a more natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>trick with this product is that you must apply to clean skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it most effective when applied after a night shower - not sure if letting it absorb overnight is more helpful than putting it to use immediately in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t smell at ALL and didn&#x27;t sweat more than normal.</li>
      <li>I put this on the first time I got it at the end of the day when I wasn&#x27;t clean.</li>
      <li>I use this as my daily deodorant since I am not a heavy sweater; it works great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural (no chemicals) and safe and will keep you smelling neutral all day (it won&#x27;t get in the way of your perfume or cologne).</li>
      <li>Much much more effective than any commercial brand available in your local drug store.  </li>
      <li>I rarely rave about a product</li>
      <li>IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried I don&#x27;t know how many big name brand deodorants and antiperspirants.</li>
      <li>The spray version of this product if phenominally effective, but the nozzle becomes jammed and then you have to splash yourself with it.</li>
      <li>Just be aware that this stuff is very watery.</li>
      <li>If I am going to a wedding or job interview where I am wearing a suit and may be in the heat, I will wear a regular antiperspirant, but I suspect this product would be fine.  </li>
      <li>but this product really does work.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work, I still stink.</li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;m embarrassed to say this, but ever since my hormones started changing I started smelling like a man who came out of a gym even when I was not being active.</li>
      <li>This works well, and much better than a similar product from a different brand.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product for women going through hormonal changes in their life.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I really like this natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>Everythig I read from other users is true, it really works and does what it states it will.</li>
      <li>The only downside to this is that you REALLY need to follow the advice on the bottle and only use on CLEAN skin.</li>
      <li>For a deodorant, weirdly enough this stuff has its own funky smell--a little sulphuric.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater!  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve tried them ALL in the natural deodorant department.</li>
      <li>Natural and non scented.</li>
      <li>I have literally tried everything before this and nothing else worked nearly as well.  </li>
      <li>This 100% natural deodorant is for people who do not perspire at all.</li>
      <li>It gives me protection while not subjecting me to potentially harmful chemicals which are present in most other regular deodorants and antiperspirants.  </li>
      <li>This product really keeps me dry during all kinds of situations Dennis</li>
      <li>This is my favorite deodorant because it smells neutral, and works for at least 48 hours!</li>
      <li>My daughter says this really works, when none of the other natural deoderants have.</li>
      <li>This deo, especially with this particular application bottle, traps stink in, seemingly introducing bacteria into the bottle, then reapplying it the next time.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a natural deodorant that can stop the odor and contribute to my underarm journey of getting my underarm back to their silky appearance.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I don&#x27;t know what I would do at work/school if I started stinking right after small stressful moment and stinking up the place.</li>

    <li> This works great! Best natural deodorant I have used! Spent several hours out in sun and still didn&#x27;t stink!</li>
    <li> This 100% natural deodorant is for people who do not perspire at all. What made this product even more ineffective is the roll-on factor: after 3 or 4 applications on a very clean skin, the tip of the bottle would give off this foul odor.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical...but this product really does work.  Even works on my stinky husband, too!  Which makes him not a stinky person anymore. :)  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was the same company that produced Sprouts crystal deodorant, as Sprouts discontinued theirs, but this does not seem to work as well.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I have tried so far. Everythig I read from other users is true, it really works and does what it states it will.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical. But it actually works. This will be my staple. I have been looking for a natural deodorant that can stop the odor and contribute to my underarm journey of getting my underarm back to their silky appearance. Most deodorants have magnesium which darkens the underarm, this is why I made the change to a more natural deodorant.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s all natural (no chemicals) and safe and will keep you smelling neutral all day (it won&#x27;t get in the way of your perfume or cologne). I&#x27;ve tried I don&#x27;t know how many big name brand deodorants and antiperspirants. They work for a few hours and then you stink by the end of the day and get build up in your pores which is gross. The only downside to this is that you REALLY need to follow the advice on the bottle and only use on CLEAN skin. I put this on the first time I got it at the end of the day when I wasn&#x27;t clean. The bacteria stays on the roller ball and will ruin the bottle. So I&#x27;m getting another one  which is my own fault. This brand is so wonderful that my husband switched to them but uses the spray version.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work, I still stink. Neither do any of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; stick deodorants either, though. Still looking.</li>
    <li> I have been using Thai Deodorant Crystal Spray for more than year and I love it, just started using this and it works just as well as the spray but it seems to stay/stick longer too. Very happy with their entire line of products.</li>
    <li> SMELT LIKE BODY ODOR HORRIBLE LEAKY PRODUCT</li>
    <li> My daughter says this really works, when none of the other natural deoderants have. Not an antiperspirant, but controls odor, according to her.</li>
    <li> I really like this natural deodorant. It works well but I do have to alternate between this and Kiss My Face Liquid Rock. It seems that your body gets used to it after a while. It still works but I noticed more wetness. This is also good as a toner for breakouts or to clean cuts. I always keep this on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a happy user of this product for years.  I like the fact that it comes in a standard roll-on applicator.</li>
    <li> For a deodorant, weirdly enough this stuff has its own funky smell--a little sulphuric.</li>
    <li> The spray version of this product if phenominally effective, but the nozzle becomes jammed and then you have to splash yourself with it. This works well too, but not nearly as efficiently. The upside is, it doesn&#x27;t jam.</li>
    <li> It works for me but I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater!  Just be aware that this stuff is very watery.</li>
    <li> Works for us majority of the time!</li>
    <li> IT REALLY WORKS! These THAI products work! I recommend the solid, the spray, powder AND roll-on. I rarely rave about a product but I sure do about THAI Deodorants</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it. This product really keeps me dry during all kinds of situations Dennis</li>
    <li> This deo, especially with this particular application bottle, traps stink in, seemingly introducing bacteria into the bottle, then reapplying it the next time. Disgusting. I had to start washing the bottle off after every use. Even so, it did not work.</li>
    <li> I use this as my daily deodorant since I am not a heavy sweater; it works great. It gives me protection while not subjecting me to potentially harmful chemicals which are present in most other regular deodorants and antiperspirants.  If I am going to a wedding or job interview where I am wearing a suit and may be in the heat, I will wear a regular antiperspirant, but I suspect this product would be fine.  I just don&#x27;t like to take chances.</li>
    <li> This works well, and much better than a similar product from a different brand. Too bad I can&#x27;t find it at a store....the shipping cost is unreal! But, I&#x27;ll pay it because it works and I&#x27;m not allergic to it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant because it smells neutral, and works for at least 48 hours! So if I forget to shower it is no big deal! It lasts a long time which makes it a great value. I like the spray as well, and in the summer you can spray your feet for no smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick with this product is that you must apply to clean skin. If you apply to sweaty armpits it won&#x27;t work, because the bacteria has already started to be stinky. If you need to apply mid-day then use some hand soap to thoroughly clean and then use the Thai Crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product for women going through hormonal changes in their life. Where others have failed, this product really delivered.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I put it to quite a rugged test too.  Never a hint of odor, and it truly lasts ALL day!  I prefer the stone as it seems to dry quicker, but nonetheless... Amazing!  And I&#x27;ve tried them ALL in the natural deodorant department.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work so badly. I take a shower in the morning, scrub my pits with soap and a rag, dry off, then apply this deodorant. I start to stink within a few hours. I don&#x27;t sweat profusely, I just STINK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m open to anyone&#x27;s comments or suggestions because I STILL want this to work!</li>
    <li> I suffered significant itching using the anti perspire deodorants, and don&#x27;t like the strong perfume odors of others.  This product works great, stops odors, doesn&#x27;t stink and doesn&#x27;t itch.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> very good and zero smell! great and natural for kids!! it is soft but protects from bad smells just fine!</li>
    <li> I love this roll-on rendition of a great line of natural, effective hygiene care.  Recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all, it was like i didnt even put deoderant on.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is THE BEST I&#x27;ve ever used.  Much much more effective than any commercial brand available in your local drug store.  If you use as directed, you will have no issue.  I&#x27;ve found it most effective when applied after a night shower - not sure if letting it absorb overnight is more helpful than putting it to use immediately in the morning.  I have literally tried everything before this and nothing else worked nearly as well.  You will still sweat - but that&#x27;s okay!  This eliminates any odor from forming or sticking around.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for close a year and don&#x27;t see myself ever needing to try anything else ever.  You will not be sorry.  Truly the best.  (I&#x27;ve also purchased the spray version, which works ok, but not as well as the roll-on; it&#x27;s more for times when I run out of this and need something to hold me over until I order more)</li>
    <li> I have used the Thai Crystal Stone before. Worked great for. This time I wanted to try the Roll-On for convenience. This works great too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; applying, not like regular deodorant, but you get used to it. It works well.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Have many allergies and sensitivities.  Used to find this in Whole Foods but no more.  Really glad I can get it online.</li>
    <li> I wore this deodorant for about a week with no problems whatsoever. I didn&#x27;t smell at ALL and didn&#x27;t sweat more than normal. The problem is that after about a week the roll on deodorant began smelling like body order really strongly, so when I put on the deodorant I would then smell. I ended up throwing it away. I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s due to bacteria getting trapped in the roll on. Maybe it would be better to just get the stone so it can be washed between uses.</li>
    <li> Natural and non scented. Every man&#x27;s dream.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m embarrassed to say this, but ever since my hormones started changing I started smelling like a man who came out of a gym even when I was not being active. I hated it so much, I couldn&#x27;t stand myself. So, after purchasing this, right after I shower I apply this and put on a beautiful perfume/spray and that&#x27;s it... There&#x27;s no smell of anything even after I exercise and stress like crazy for days. Thank God for this.. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t know what I would do at work/school if I started stinking right after small stressful moment and stinking up the place. I would really never step out side of my home again. no joke... I&#x27;m so glad I found this. :)</li>
    <li> Like. Will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> Most effective! No chemicals and no smell to interfere with my perfume!</li>
</ol>
