    <li> I like the smell and the skin is very smooth after. Definetelly this works I would definetely recomend to a friend</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping it would on the bikini area. Works great on arms and legs.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Hoping this will make a difference with the appearance of bumps from waxing. I liked the look and feel of the scrub. I followed the instructions and used the scrub within 8 hours of my wax and the area looks and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> Very, very good product.  No post-waxing itching or bumps - typically associated after 10 days.  I&#x27;ll continue using this product moving forward.  (Still need to review again after 3-4 weeks for in-grown hair prevention effectiveness.)  Otherwise, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this scrub. I had dark spots and many ingrown hairs ( I wax ). After this product I have been noticing a difference: I will continue to order it!!</li>
    <li> This stuff just made me itchy and didn&#x27;t work well.</li>

    <li> Best body scrub for before and after your waxing, definitely reduces hair bumps. It contains Shea butter, and other moisterizing agents. I also use this for my legs before shaving. Keep skin soft.</li>
    <li> This is gross! It didn&#x27;t make any difference for my skin and it feels like jelly. STAY AWAY. It stinks so bad. Will NOT repurchase this item</li>
