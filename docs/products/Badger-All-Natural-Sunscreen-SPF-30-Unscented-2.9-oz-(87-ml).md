### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>i think it&#x27;s best to use a cream zinc, protection should come 1st.</li>
      <li>and it worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t think it works the best.</li>
      <li>Badger sunscreen is the BEST!!</li>
      <li>VERY HAPPY WITH THIS.</li>
      <li>best becuase</li>
      <li>- it got an excellent safety rating from EWG, \\&quot;Evironmental Working Group\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>unscented 30 is excellent.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s excellent EWS rating.  </li>
      <li>and the ones that have tried it that I&#x27;ve told in person have all been very happy with it and repeat buyers as well.</li>
      <li>We have used this all summer and it worked out wonderfully for us...</li>
      <li>Very nice stuff!</li>
      <li>Also, it smelled like olive oil (one of the components), which I didn&#x27;t find very pleasant.</li>
      <li>skin &amp; my kids are very fair, so</li>
      <li>I purchased this sunblock because it was one of the best rated sunscreens (great protection against UVA and UVB + lack of components that may be harmful) on the EWG website.</li>
      <li>and we all got incredibly sunburned.  </li>
      <li>It also smells really good!</li>
      <li>this is a very good sunblock that is recommended by EWG and fairly inexpensive when compared to the pricing of&lt;br /&gt;California</li>
      <li>So for us this is great for those times when we are in the sun and works well in the water.</li>
      <li>So, this works great for us for about an hour of swimming (and we reapply for longer).  </li>
      <li>We spend about an hour outdoors swimming, and this has been great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Works great and</li>
      <li>I thought it would be great for my daughter who is a life guard.  </li>
      <li>The protection is great</li>
      <li>Great lotion.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job of blocking the suns rays without being overly greasy.</li>
      <li>Thoroughly happy with the product</li>
      <li>This would be a great sunscreen if they took out some of the oils.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great sunscreen and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to hang out for about an hour in the water with it on.</li>
      <li>The oils just make it water and sweat resistant which did a great job in my 4 hour ride.</li>
      <li>Although it does leave a greasy residue, it does a great job</li>
      <li>but beyond that, between all the options this has been a great back-up.</li>
      <li>I bought the Badger based on great review in EWG.</li>
      <li>Sunscreen can be great, but we try not to get overconfident about it.  </li>
      <li>My kids are white-streaked but safe, so I&#x27;m a happy mom!</li>
      <li>For me it has also worked quite well, giving good sun protection all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But my daughter and I have incredibly fair skin, and have never burned while using this product.</li>
      <li>I needed an all purpose sunscreen that won&#x27;t poison my great grandchildren with hazardous eco-system-killing toxins.  </li>
      <li>I rubbed this in for a good three or four minutes</li>
      <li>so it isn&#x27;t quite a fair test</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a good product for the job, but a bit pricy for</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve given this sunscreen a fair shot and have used it 4 times.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I guess it works fairly well.</li>
      <li>and I feel good putting it on myself and my children.</li>
      <li>Guess it&#x27;s time to just bite the bullet and get the good stuff instead of wasting my time.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>Then I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>so i switched to Badger to test it because i heard good things about it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product and will buy again and again.</li>
      <li>I am an outdoor girl with a good tan.</li>
      <li>It does work well and knowing it is not harmful to my body is good, but the effort of rubbing it in makes this a chore to apply, sometimes I skip it for that reason- which defeats the purpose.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping to find a safer product for my family and this seemed like a good choice.  </li>
      <li>EASY TO SPREAD AND PROVIDE GOOD PROTECTION ALSO!  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the service.</li>
      <li>However, we were very pleased with this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>But now that I have a toddler with great skin, I have to be alot more prudent with my decisions..</li>
      <li>Its a great sunscreen and has been very useful here in Texas!</li>
      <li>I am so glad I decided to try it out on my own!</li>
      <li>I love everything about this sunscreen!</li>
      <li>We love this sunscreen but you must reapply A LOT!  </li>
      <li>and they will NEVER be as easy to use as the toxic ones, you will be happy with this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s NOT unscented), but to each his own.</li>
      <li>Being honest, I prefer California Baby</li>
      <li>For me, this was kind of an experiment, so here are my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a nice size tube and fits in my cosmetic purse..</li>
      <li>I am always looking for a good natural sunscreen, this one is the best I found until now.</li>
      <li>Enjoy your summer SAFELY with Badger!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on the skin and absorbs good.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re buying for your kids the Badger \\&quot;Kids\\&quot; sunscreen spreads very easily.</li>
      <li>Very impressed so far!</li>
      <li>BEST NATURAL SUNSCREEN</li>
      <li>The product is extremely safe and effective, as claimed.</li>
      <li>I give this three stars for being a safe, effective sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Overall a very good sunscreen - good at protection.  </li>
      <li>Despite being \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;, it has a mild odor of olive oil, relatively pleasant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the best rated sun screens for nontoxic broad spectrum protection and it has come through for my baby.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for 4 years for a safe, effective, non-greasy and non-whitening alternative to my chemical sunblock, trying many from the EWG&#x27;s top sunscreen lists each year.  </li>
      <li>Interestingly the cream one i stopped using on my face</li>
      <li>&amp; it makes me feel more protected.</li>
      <li>i read some people try to rub it in to death, makes no sense because its meant to sit on top &amp; block.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>It is safe to use</li>
      <li>I also feel better using this product knowing that the ingredients are natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love this sunscreen</li>
      <li>Great product, really works well.  </li>
      <li>EWG has rated this as a top sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it because this is supposed to be such great stuff!</li>
      <li>We figure we expose the kids to so many toxins that we cannot help, we might as well try to avoid them where we can.</li>
      <li>Lovely</li>
      <li>so it was okay.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS...</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did not use it on my face!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s unscented, keeps the kids from squirming when applying to their faces.  </li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t imagine that you&#x27;d have too many issues with this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s SAFE.</li>
      <li>I guess this stuff could be okay for walking out of the house to your car</li>
      <li>For the most part I use an umbrella to keep her out of the sun -</li>
      <li>Sometimes I get my way. :)</li>
      <li>We used this and California Baby and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Get this to help keep your baby healthy from the sun and from chemicals.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> too thick.  try livestrong</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, but ended up with three burned kids plus me.  It worked on their legs, but not face and shoulders or arms.  I reapplied frequently and made sure there was enough on their skin, but it just didn&#x27;t do as well as a titanium dioxide sunscreen.  We were not even in \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; sun, just the upper peninsula of Michigan, so I can&#x27;t imagine how burned they would have been elsewhere.  Will try something else next year.</li>
    <li> So after reading the reviews on here I was at Whole Foods really debating whether I should buy it or not. I am so glad I decided to try it out on my own! Its a great sunscreen and has been very useful here in Texas! It is a bit thick but hello it has zinc oxide in it! I rub it in one good time and then 30 minutes later I&#x27;ll rub the inside of my arms where some of it will accumulate. Then I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good, natural sunscreen for my 8 month old daughter and I ordered this one even after reading that the other Badger sunscreens left baby&#x27;s face all white. This is not true! I even use it on my face and I do not look like a mime! It actually rubs in really well and does not leave my face all greasy. It is easy to apply on my baby and seems to protect her very well from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this sunscreen again.</li>
    <li> works well and was rated safe. on the pricy side but i will pay for a better sunscreen especially since i need to avoid it as much as possible</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and it seems to work well in terms of keeping the sun off. It also smells really good! I started using it after I realized that the whiteness rubs in and isn&#x27;t as white as some of the other zinc-oxide sunscreens - and it works longer and better than my other sunscreen. This is also very highly rated on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website, which is the reason we tried it in the first place. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> I also heard about this from EWG and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot! Yes, it goes on white at first but after spreading it out and it&#x27;s just fine. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all; in fact, it smells like CHOCOLATE!!! I thought I was imagining things but my boyfriend tried some and HE TOO noticed the chocolaty smell. I looked at the ingredients and there&#x27;s actually cocoa in it.</li>
    <li> We tried this and California Baby sunscreen, and I definitely liked the other one better as far as coverage.  I had this one on and was out for about 1.5 hours and got pretty burnt on my back, but then I saw that this was only rated for 40 min in the water.  I had gotten wet but my back was only in the water for a few minutes of that time.  My kids seemed to have an allergic reation to the California Baby sunscreen, which is why we tried this one.  I didn&#x27;t use this one enough to see if they reacted to this one as well.</li>
    <li> My 4 and 6 year old sons have quite sensitive skin and it&#x27;s been impossible to find a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn them worse than the sun, until now! The ingredients are excellent quality and there is no alcohol or extra chemicals to cause problems.  It is thick, and kind of makes them water repellent (think water beading up on the skin), but in a way that is good because I can tell when it is wearing off.  They&#x27;ve never had a burn after using this.  Also, it smells HEAVENLY! Because of the cocoa butter, the boys smell like chocolate.  It&#x27;s expensive, but a little goes a long way.  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works well, but it is VERY thick and can be hard to spread.  I do like that it is PABA- and paraben-free.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is rated #1, and lives up to its ratings.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have sensitive skin and wanted to stick with a zinc oxide sunscreen formula. It was also highly rated on the Environmental Working Group sunscreen reviews. I am sure it is fine in terms of being gentle and effective. However, be forewarned that it is very oily. It recommends you knead the tube because some separation can occur. Very hard to knead in a tube so it still came out as pure oil and then globs of cream colored paste. For the body the shiny nature of this cream is not that bad but I will not put this on my face. Going back to California Baby.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen based upon the Environmental Wellness Group&#x27;s recommendation found @ [...]. The product is extremely safe and effective, as claimed. The only drawback I could find is that it tends to wash into my eyes while swimming and stings. In spite of washing off to some degree, the product still offered all the protection that was promised. However, it is rather a small tube for the price, especially when you consider how much of the product you need to apply for full body coverage in a two-piece swimsuit (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7\\&quot; and used almost 1/4 of the tube). In spite of the lack of safety, I still prefer a spray for ease and speed of application. Maybe Badger could work on that. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve gone on to purchase a separate sunscreen specially formulated for facial use.</li>
    <li> very small bottle for the price but a little amount goes a long way. i got it because it was number one sunscreen...with alot of rubbin the white disappears..no sunburn and it doesnt smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with freckles.  I&#x27;ve been searching for 4 years for a safe, effective, non-greasy and non-whitening alternative to my chemical sunblock, trying many from the EWG&#x27;s top sunscreen lists each year.  I had tried the badger sunblock in the purple tube 2 years ago and found it too greasy and too whitening.  for some reason I gave this tan-colored tube of badger a try to see if they had improved the formula.  yay!  they have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is not perfect, but is pretty good in many of my requirements:&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t burn me (A+)&lt;br /&gt;non-toxic (A+)&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t turn me white (A-)&lt;br /&gt;not greasy (B+)&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t turn my clothes or furniture white (B-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you rub it in well it&#x27;s neither too greasy nor too white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cons:&lt;br /&gt;-after some time I do find that white lines accumulate around my inner elbows, but I just rub that back in.&lt;br /&gt;-some of my clothes get light white lines on them, but it seems to come out in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;-i am still a bit conscious of sitting on a friend&#x27;s couch or car, knowing that it will get greasy and maybe a little white.  so I do have to consider at what point in the day I am putting it on and where I will be sitting.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - really resistent to water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - very thick and difficult to spread&lt;br /&gt; - objectionable smell&lt;br /&gt; - not only water-resistent, but can&#x27;t be washed off with soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern is that it is extremely difficult to spread.  You can&#x27;t spread it with normal wide motions, and have to rub it in into every square inch of your body.  Not only that takes a lot of time, but you can easily miss an inch or two, and get severe burns in those places.  I have never had such problems with any other product in my life.  Making sunscreen so think really creates a danger of getting sunburns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are concerned about health (and environment), and wish to get a mineral sunscreen lotion, I strongly recommend [[ASIN:B001FVIRHQ Mexitan SPF 30 All Natural Biodegradable Water Resistant Sunscreen-# MEX-30-8]] instead, which is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t have any offensive smell.</li>
    <li> Pros: I&#x27;ve spent a long time investigating the relative safety of various products at the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s online Skin Deep Cosmetics database, and this is far and away the safest sunscreen I&#x27;ve found. While a number of sunscreens contain chemicals that are hormone disruptors &amp; cancer risks, Badger really lives up to its \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; name: only a handful of ingredients, all relatively safe.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You have to really rub it in, or it leaves you looking white and ghostly. Olive oil base is good for your skin if you have good skin, but can make your complexion worse if you&#x27;re prone to acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m giving it a 5 because safety is so important to me. Despite being \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;, it has a mild odor of olive oil, relatively pleasant.</li>
    <li> Has NANO particles even tho claims it doesn&#x27;t - search on  \\&quot;consumer reports sunscreen nano\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll see the independent test results which show Nano. The only one that doesn&#x27;t have nano in Zinka.</li>
    <li> This product does what it is indented to do.  I would give it five stars,but it is hard to wash off even after showering.  Most other sunscreens cause a rash on my skin.  Badger does not.</li>
    <li> this is a very good sunblock that is recommended by EWG and fairly inexpensive when compared to the pricing of&lt;br /&gt;California Baby which is also very good but expensive. EWG is an environmental group that discusses the latest info on different products that are tested as bottled water, cell phones(you&#x27;re going to be very surprised)etc. Info is free.</li>
    <li> This is my first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen I tried but so far so good! My true test was when I went cycling for a few hours. Yes, it does go on a bit pasty white but not as much as others, commented from a friend who tried other natural sunscreens. I actually like that it shows so I know it is still there. I got mine from REI for $14. A little does go a long way in applying the product. Remember that the zinc is not supposed to absorb but stay on top of your skin to protect you. The oils just make it water and sweat resistant which did a great job in my 4 hour ride. After my ride, I noticed the sunscreen \\&quot;bunch up\\&quot; in the crevices of my skin but no biggie - I can live with that. When using previous non-natural sunscreens, I felt I was not protected much after a couple of hours of sweating so would have to re-apply but not this stuff. It stays! The only other product I will try is the Loving Naturals and see which one is best. I thank my friend for turning me on to this stuff which was recommended highly on [...].</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as an everyday sunscreen on my face and arms.  I live in Phoenix and burn easily.  Unscented variety has nice nutty smell from the oils, not strong chemically odor like other unscented products.  Very thick but spreads evenly.  Leaves a slight whitish sheen, somewhat similar to some of the facial moisturizers that you can buy with \\&quot;light diffusers\\&quot; in them.  This doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, in fact I think it makes my skin look nice (but I am very pale). Greasy at first, but soaks into your skin and does not leave a tacky or other irritating residue like other products do. Feels like a heavy moisturizer typically does.  Very impressed so far!</li>
    <li> I try to buy as all natural things as possible. I do not want to slather myself in chemicals. I went to a campground this weekend and sat by the pool today. I put this on myself and my fiance. I hung out by the pool for three hours. I swam for 80% of the time. I reapplied this all over three times. I am completely sunburned. I am in a lot of pain and bright red and this is about 8 hours later. My aunt who spent the same amount of time with me who wore 50+ spf chemical sunscreen meanwhile is fine. Makes me frustrated. I guess this stuff could be okay for walking out of the house to your car haha. I mean, I&#x27;m cooked!</li>
    <li> I quickly ordered this product after reading the high rating from the Environmental Working Group.  However, after using this product twice and both times getting burned- I will not longer use it.  I applied prior to going out in the sun, and I did try to reapply while in the sun.  It was very hard to spread out and leaves a white film all over your body.  I tried to rub in so the white film would not show, but possibly the white film is necessary in order to avoid the burn?  Both times I was very blotchy and very red because of the lack of coverage from this product.  I have never gotten burned when using SPF 30 before, so I was very disappointed to see that I was burned after using this highly rated product.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the thickness of the sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve bought other organic type sunscreens and they tended to be too runny for my taste.  Also, it gives you less of a white/ghost like hue after you apply the sunscreen than most organics.  It has a sesame oil smell, which is appealing but it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are applying food on your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other Badger products and am still looking for one that does not have a scent. While this one clearly says \\&quot;UNSCENTED\\&quot; it is not. It is also very heavy and very oily. I hate putting this on my face.  Being honest, I prefer California Baby but it&#x27;s so gosh awful expensive. Guess it&#x27;s time to just bite the bullet and get the good stuff instead of wasting my time.</li>
    <li> OK, so it&#x27;s not just me as I see other reviews stating the same thing. I&#x27;ve given this sunscreen a fair shot and have used it 4 times. All 4 times....I burned in all the places I applied it. And I RARELY burn...the only times I might get a tad pink are if I&#x27;m in the sun for HOURS at a time and didn&#x27;t apply sunscreen. So imagine my confusion when, after using this product on my chest, shoulders and back.....I got fried. I noticed myself getting burned about an hour into it so I reapplied. Liberally. And the burn was so bad!!!!! This happened 4 times. Yesterday I applied it to my chest and shoulders and was only out in the sun for an hour and am cooked. SO disappointed in this product - thankfully I didn&#x27;t use it on my young children and give them horrible burns!!! Back to California Baby!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this sunscreen! Natural product. Doesn&#x27;t cause my daughter&#x27;s skin to break out like most sunscreens. Most of all, it works really well! I read the reviews that said people got sunburned using it. I will say that when you&#x27;re using a barrier sunscreen like this, you need to reapply it more often. I tend to go with every 2 hours when out in the direct sun. But my daughter and I have incredibly fair skin, and have never burned while using this product. Fantastic stuff!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is super thick and left my face looking white! I really tried to rub it in, but it just wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s funny the reviews that say the product smells bad. People want natural products but want them to smell or taste like the unnatural stuff. It&#x27;s a natural sunscreen and is UNSCENTED, so ya, fragrance isn&#x27;t pleasant, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. Once its on smeall goes away. This is a thick and greasy sunscreen, not good for face but MAN does it work well! I am in the sun all summer long and this product works better than the Coppertone and Neutregena crap - and the price is great I think.</li>
    <li> My other moisturizer reviews are based on a personal system that evolved based on the tiering of the California days throughout the year. The days of wearing a simple Oil of Olay product are long gone, especially after realizing the chemicals most of those products contain. Now, I apply sunscreen for the day and it&#x27;s helped quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer mineral sunscreens, but that means drying. Although I have naturally oily skin, I always apply EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) first thing in the morning. The oil counters the oil and provides moisture before the mineral screen is applied. The olive oil is given time to sink in (at least 30 mins), then I apply the sunscreen. Badger contains 18.75% zinc oxide, non-nano. It goes on white, but just take the time to massage in well. This is my 5th Level moisturizer and it works well for the hot days. If I&#x27;m out hiking in the desert or by the sea with sun and saltwater assaults, I also carry the Badger Face Stick, which is the same product but in an easy portable form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st Level &#x3D; rainy, heavy overcast, staying inside (Wholly Hemp Moisturizing Cream)&lt;br /&gt;2nd Level &#x3D; some clouds, regular day, up to 72 degrees (Avalon Essential Lift SPF 15 Moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;3rd Level &#x3D; sunny, no clouds, outside or driving, mid 70s (Wholly Hemp SPF 20 Sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;4th Level &#x3D; bright sun, warm, water activities or athletics, low 80s (Burnout Sunscreen SPF 30)&lt;br /&gt;5th Level &#x3D; hot, desert dry, ocean activities, 84+ (Badger SPF 30+ Sunscreen)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years because of it&#x27;s excellent EWS rating.  However, it has to be rubbed i well or my face looks very white due to the zinc.  Also, there are little clumps that also need to be rubbed in.  Each time I reorder I search the EWS for a better product, but have been unable to find one.  All of the zinc based suncreens share the characteristics of leaving a whitish color and being difficult to rub in.</li>
    <li> Not good for active outdoor stuff, particularly surfing.  I&#x27;ve caked it on a few times - turned myself into a mime (or clown) - and I&#x27;m getting splotchy burns anyway.  It&#x27;s just not well suited for sweating and/or the ocean.  If you just sit around in the sun and you&#x27;re not very active, it&#x27;s probably pretty good.  I need something that doesn&#x27;t clump as much and has a bit more staying power.</li>
    <li> I was on the beach yesterday for 3 hours. I&#x27;m really light skinned and put this on pretty heavily, except for my feet and lower legs. It rubs in and leaves a barely detectable shiny film, but it&#x27;s not unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;I only applied it once but didn&#x27;t swim and barely sweat because it was a nice cool day. I got a light splotchy burn on the places I applied the sunscreen, and completely burned on the places I didn&#x27;t use it (my feet are so burned they&#x27;re swollen). So the sunscreen was better than nothing for me, but it didn&#x27;t prevent a light burn.&lt;br /&gt;It may work better if it&#x27;s applied a little thicker.</li>
    <li> Our whole family applied this sunscreen before an morning at the beach. Some of us are more prone to burning than others and have used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; sunscreen for years. We all got burned to some degree after not much time in the sun. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was the equivalent to wearing no sunscreen at all but not what I&#x27;d expect from SPF 30. The smell I found pleasant (like oats) but the kids hated it. Tried Loving Naturals Sunscreen as well and was again, not impressed for the same reasons. Ordered TruKid Sunny Days (reviewed well by others)but haven&#x27;t tried it yet. I would not buy this Badger product again.</li>
    <li> This is the second natural sunscreen I have tried and so far they dont work well. They go on thick and stay on the skin white.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this sunscreen because it is more natural then most. However, I don&#x27;t think it works the best. It turns you white when you apply it, so you look really pasty. It is very thick and hard to spread. And I don&#x27;t think it protects from the sun as well as other not-so-natural products. You would have to reapply often to avoid getting burnt.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after researching the Environmental Working Groups 2009 findings.  It goes on white but after you rub it in for a while the \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; appearance goes away.  If I sweat at all the sunblock builds up in any natural crevaces or wrinkles in my skin and is noticable. I work outside all day and I only apply once in the morning and it does perform all day for me without re-applying. I live in a humid warm/hot climate (SC) during the summer and this sunblock does feel oily and will rub off if you tend to scratch or rub where the sunblock is applied. Overall this sunblock performs well. It is worth the peace of mind knowing that I am doing what I can to not use harmful chemicals or at least reduce them.</li>
    <li> I am into buying everything organic, found this sunblock at Wholefoods Market and thought it must be worth the money. I am an outdoor girl with a good tan. I applied the badger sunblock before a two hour bike ride on Sunday and git burned really bad. My skin is fire red, swollen, and painfull.&lt;br /&gt;I just increased my cancer risk ! Can not recommend this product for an active outdoor person.</li>
    <li> The Badger SPF mositure resistant, unscented 30 is excellent. My husband and I will continue to use it.  Thank you.  Marleta Crim</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen. It does a great job without the long list of harmful chemicals that some other sunscreens contain.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has great, all natural, non-toxic ingredients and I feel much safer using it than anything you will find on a \\&quot;box-store\\&quot; shelf. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it really, just that I&#x27;ve found other natural sunscreens that I like better. My favorite so far is \\&quot;Loving Naturals\\&quot;. You get WAY more for the money and it smells better (without any fragrance added). Loving Naturals also has a bit less of the whitening effect. I&#x27;ll finish out the Badger but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sunscreen, and one of the few (8 out of 500) recommended by the Environmental Working Group as actually doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It also does not contain toxic or harmful (i.e. carcinogenic) chemicals, which is important on your skin and particularly important in a body cream (larger area). It also smells absolutely yummy.  It comes out super-thick but spreads well.  The only caution I have is that once it&#x27;s on, it is ON - you have to wash it off with soap to remove it. It&#x27;s also not inexpensive.  But think about what you&#x27;re putting into your body (through your skin) and especially your children&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very thick and will leave a white coating on your skin unless you do a lot of rubbing. The smell is not my cup of tea (it&#x27;s NOT unscented), but to each his own. It is definitely not waterproof, which I found out the hard way after only 15 min. in the water. Otherwise, I guess it works fairly well. I can&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen on my 2 year and 4 months old on a vacation in Mexico and neither get sunburned or had any rash. I also use it for my face where all other sunscreens, even the special \\&quot;face\\&quot; ones, would burn on my skin. It&#x27;s easy to put on the skin and absorbs good. Very good sunscreen without any bad chemicals. A bit on the expensive side but you only need a little bit each time.</li>
    <li> The original package was empty.  I notified the company and they promptly refilled the order.  I was very pleased with the service.</li>
    <li> After doing some research about the chemical composition of most sunscreens I bought three different products that essentially use Zinc oxide or Titanium dioxide as the primary components of their protection.  I like this one best becuase it does have some water resistance, feels moisturizing and while thick, still spreads easily enough that you can get the white to blend in better than others I have tried.  I will buy this again despite the higher price.</li>
    <li> Sorry but natural doesn&#x27;t work this time! There&#x27;s no comparison between Neutrogena Ultra Sheer with helioplex SPF 100 that we&#x27;ve been using and this. We&#x27;ve been in the Ocean and beach for hours with this Neutrogena and the skin never got red, I applied Badger to test on the arms and I did get redness. I am so glad I did not use it on my face!&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s a matter of choosing the lesser evil... get the chemicals in your skin/ vs getting burned?!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway if avoiding getting sunburned is your aim, I tested the Neutrogena long enough to stand by it. It actually protects even if you&#x27;re in the water the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste the money on this Badger concoction especially if you have the kids&#x27; safety in mind,it won&#x27;t do any good! Get them a swim shirt and stay indoors 11-4!</li>
    <li> I also bought this after looking over the EWG website. I was trying to protect my children and instead they got sunburned for the first time ever. I used it the same way I have used every other sunscreen - applying very liberally. Made me very angry after reading how wonderful it was supposed to be. I would say definitely do NOT use this product.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen is sticky and smells bad.  I would never want to wipe this all over my body, no matter how natural it is.  I wasted my money!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best i have used in a long time! It doesn&#x27;t smell terrible and it blends nicely! Very nice stuff!</li>
    <li> Overall a very good sunscreen - good at protection.  There are, in my opinion, too many oils and make it really hard to wash off and cause some irritation.  This would be a great sunscreen if they took out some of the oils.</li>
    <li> The product has done its job in protecting my skin. it is a very thick cream, though, so you need to rub in well to avoid looking like a vampire. Also, make sure that you moisturize your skin regularly otherwise it can make your skin peel a bit! I am very happy with this purchase and will likely use this sunscreen permanently. An added plus: the fewer ingredients in a sunscreen, the better. And there are VERY few in this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to find a zinc-based sunscreen that was also &#x27;natural&#x27;. It is highly rated by the  Environmental Working Group. Like most zinc-based sunscreens, it goes on kind of thick with a white residue. Massaging it in will reduce the whiteness. Somewhat oily, but tolerable. I also cover up (hat, long sleeve shirt, pants. I got a terrible case of sun poisoning on the back of my hands and neck. I had never heard of sun poisoning before. No sunburn though. My dermatologist recommended a different product specifically for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the Environmental Work Groups&#x27; #1 rating.  Unfortunately, after using the product on a sunny spring day, I got the worst sunburn I have gotten in years!  I could live with the thickness and smell of the product (it&#x27;s supposedly unscented) but not the burn.</li>
    <li> Picked this up at my local Whole Foods Market in the Unscented variety for $16.00 for this size, which is a few dollars more then what Amazon has it advertised for! But honestly, I do love this item. It does go on thick but I was prepared for that based on others reviews, so I just squeeze out a tiny dab and just rub it in more. So, it does seem more cost effective cause you are using less!. The unscented one I got locally is not gritty at all.  Just thick and smooth. It is also kid friendly, which is good, cause I am pregnant and am looking for double duty here.&lt;br /&gt;Works great and I am thrilled its nice and natural. I use it in the morning and I keep it in my purse and reapply it on my hands and neck and arms whenever I go back out before lunch and before driving home. It is a nice size tube and fits in my cosmetic purse..</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  I mix it with my makeup so I have protection at all times.</li>
    <li> My family and I have been using this sunscreen since the beginning of the out door season which is most of the year.  I think that overall it is a  good sunscreen - good at protection. It is a bit oily though so if that bothers you then you might want a different sunscreen but I think that helps with it being effective and your skin doesnt dry out.  This would be a great sunscreen if they could make it with less oil.</li>
    <li> We read the same expert opinions that everyone else read and were excited to receive 4 tubes for our family vacation.  Well, 1 day into into vacation and applying this stuff thick and consistent, everyone else in our crowd who used other sunscreen is fine and all 3 of us, including one who rarely burns, are burned.  I am very frustrated because we did all the right things, tried a natural product, lathered it on, and hours later are paying dearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot see how this product is marketed as sunscreen - it does not screen the sun well at all.  BE CAREFUL before you put this on your children and go out to the beach.  It does not work well at all.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried Badger twice in strong sun and on both occasions ended up badly burned, including my young daughter. We followed the directions, including reapplication. It is not a good product because it does not protect you from the sun.  We&#x27;ve used many other sunscreens without problem. We purchased Badger because it uses fewer chemicals, but that is irrelevant if it does not prevent sunburn. I&#x27;m surprised to see that it has positive reviews here on Amazon.  I would not recommend it to anyone. The Environmental Working Group and others should stop promoting this product.</li>
    <li> It does go on thick and white, but it blends pretty fast. this definitely protects better than other sunscreens and I think it&#x27;s the high % of zinc oxide. other sunscreens have much lower percent and my 9 month old has gotten a little pink from others. I&#x27;ll be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after researching for a \\&quot;safer\\&quot; sunscreen for my children.  I pretty much looked at all the sunscreens that the EWG (Skin Deep) rated as most safe and figured out which one would give me the most product for my money.  At 2.9 ounces and about $14, this seemed worth trying out.  (I was previously using a brand that I could get at Xmas Tree Shops for under $4 a bottle; however, the ingredients concerned me and the company didn&#x27;t seem as environmentally aware as others).  Anyway, the Badger SPF 30 is VERY THICK which means I have to use A LOT to get full skin coverage.  I do want a safe product that works; however, this one may not be cost effective if I use half the tube in just one trip to the beach.  There&#x27;s no way to use this sparingly.  I&#x27;ll be trying some other comparable brands before I consider buying this one again - I&#x27;ll be looking for a lotion that is thinner, but still provides coverage, effectively blocks out the sun&#x27;s rays, and doesn&#x27;t have a long list of questionable ingredients.</li>
    <li> I needed an all purpose sunscreen that won&#x27;t poison my great grandchildren with hazardous eco-system-killing toxins.  For me, this was kind of an experiment, so here are my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Ingredients that I can take seriously.&lt;br /&gt;2. Soaks in quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3. No icky smell (It smells like the oils that are in it. I smell the olive oil.)&lt;br /&gt;4. Water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Kind of oily at first, but like I said, it soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;2. I paid like $13.50 for the whole thing.  I knew it would be small, but in a month when I use it all up, that feeling of \\&quot;OMG that&#x27;s a little bottle\\&quot; will be even worse.  A bigger bottle would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, IT DID NOT COME OUT WITH WHITE CHUNKS.  I guess people who had that problem got older bottles of the product.  I mean, it&#x27;s a natural product with no obvious emulsifiers, so you would need to shake it a bit just to be sure, but I experienced nothing crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the Sun with natural sunscreen.</li>
    <li> We love this sunscreen but you must reapply A LOT!  We were down in NC where the sun is extremely strong and we still got burned even when reapplying.  I would say if you go in the water you must reapply again each time.</li>
    <li> I purchased Badger after carefully shopping around for different natural sunscreens and reading different customer reviews. I had high expectations for this product, but I hated it from the second I put it on. It&#x27;s very, VERY oily, much more so than standard sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews that mentioned it takes a while to rub in, to get the whiteness off your skin, but it never went away. I rubbed this in for a good three or four minutes and I still looked like a ghost. It&#x27;s also extremely difficult to wash off--it took me three or four washings to get it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a strong nutty smell, which is not appealing. This product is supposed to be unscented! Certainly not worth the money. Too bad!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a review from the ewg.org (aka Environmental Working Group) website, apparently they have third-party reviewed over 1,400 sunscreens and rated them based on ingredient effects on humans (e.g. allergies, estrogen leeching...etc.) to UVA and UVB spectrum protection as well. This received a solid rating, and to it&#x27;s credit it does a great job of protecting your skin; although it is thick, more expensive than typical consumer sunscreens, and as far as the ingredient effects on humans - I noticed no substantial difference. All in all, it&#x27;s a definite solid UVA and UVB sunscreen, with minimal(?) ingredient effects. So it&#x27;s a good product for the job, but a bit pricy for only 2.9 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: solid UVA and UVB protection, no ingredient allergies/side effects,&lt;br /&gt;Cons: smells like some of those energy PowerBars, thick and oily that requires \\&quot;kneading\\&quot; prior to application, more difficult than most to rub in, pricier than typical consumer sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Great product, but waaaaaaaaaay too expensive!!!!  It&#x27;s the only thing for my daughters&#x27; sensitive skin, no rash &#x3D; excellent sunscreen!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want all of the nasty chemicals &amp; artificial hormones that are in most of the main commercial brands of sunscreen going on you &amp; especially your children, then buy the Badger sunscreen! This brand is truly the way to go! Yes, it is white &amp; pasty, but honestly, that&#x27;s hard to avoid to get a truly quality &amp; truly HEALTHY sunscreen. It works &amp; works well! Don&#x27;t let the high SPF numbers in other sunscreens fool you! It&#x27;s just a sales gimmick &amp; the research proves that sunscreen can&#x27;t last that long. You are much safer sticking with a lower number &amp; re-applying at regular intervals while out in the sun. I feel so much better putting this on my children than anything else out there. Trust me, I&#x27;ve done the research. ;) Enjoy your summer SAFELY with Badger!!</li>
    <li> I give this three stars for being a safe, effective sunscreen. (As far as the EWG is concerned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this sunscreen was very white, made my skin itch, felt very, very greasy and I broke out whenever I used the product. I am always on the look out for safe more natural cosmetic products and really wanted this to be my every day sunscreen. I sill have it on my shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many other sunscreens and blocks and they do not all make me itch and break out- but they often have other nasty chemicals in them. I do wish there was a natural product with zinc oxide that did not contain so many oils. They don&#x27;t seem necessary! Most of us just want to be protected from the harmful rays of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, hope this works for you and your children. I am still on the look out. :-)</li>
    <li> I have used this sunscreen on my 3-year old son since he was less than a year old, and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. Yes, it does make him look a bit mime-like, but he has always been well protected (even while splashing in the ocean), and does not fuss when I put Badger on as it doesn&#x27;t smell or feel \\&quot;yucky\\&quot; to him. I have used both the lightly scented and this one (the unscented) and prefer the unscented. I appreciate that it does not have added scent, but also find that it spreads more easily that the scented version (though I can&#x27;t imagine why that is). And yes, my husband and I do use Badger as well, though admittedly we prefer hats to protect our faces since Badger is a bit clown-like for vain adults!</li>
    <li> Nice sunscreen but a little to heavy to use under make-up on the face. At least for me. But just fine by itself.&lt;br /&gt;Great Seller - Nice safe product - does not irritate skin - but may be a little thick feeling on the face.</li>
    <li> Great ingredients, Feel much better about my kids using this opposed to the chemical bath of ingredients in commercial products. It still has a major white cast as all zinc sunscreens do. It&#x27;s also a bit pricey but I am willing to pay for good ingredients. It is perfect for a day at the beach when coverage is most crucial.</li>
    <li> I am super into natural skin care, so when I found out that this product existed I was SUPER EXCITED. It smelled great, it wasn&#x27;t horribly expensive and it rubbed in well. The first time I used it, I went to the beach and re-applicated regularly and I got horribly sunburned as if I was not wearing sunscreen at all. It may have been because this was my first venture into full sunshine during the year and I am porcelain pale but I won&#x27;t be buying it again because it was sadly ineffective.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is actually labeled SPF 34 on our tube.. not sure why there is a difference.  Everything else about this product is as listed on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as well as 3 other people on a kayaking trip over last weekend.  We had great weather, a little breeze and it wasn&#x27;t constant sun because of the big puffy clouds.  I applied sunscreen every 40 minutes as the bottle said if sweating or getting wet you should reapply that frequently.  I wasn&#x27;t really getting wet or sweating but I don&#x27;t like getting burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone but myself has large areas of their body that are burnt and painful.  They applied every hour and a half while I applied more frequently.  What I have found is that even though this sunscreen is extremely thick at room temperature (its thin like normal sunscreen when it&#x27;s been in your pocket all day) you need to apply a decent amount.  If you don&#x27;t have an evenly white application then your going to get burnt in the lighter areas.  I was burnt on the inside of my elbows to the point where it hurts and burnt enough to turn red most everywhere but that will just turn into a tan and isn&#x27;t painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to apply and little and work it around until it seemed to look even.  I just recommend applying enough that you look like a ghost then rubbing it in so your not so white.  It does do it&#x27;s job and it probably lasts longer than how I used it for my situation but if your in a pool I would really recommend the 30-40min reapplications.  If you need something to last longer I would buy something else.  You&#x27;ll see a lot of negative experiences for this stuff but mostly I think it is because of the reapplication timeframe and the amount of it being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again and I will use the rest of what we have.  It does work, it takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Badger kids spf 30 vanilla tangerine..it&#x27;s the only sunscreen my 4 year old let&#x27;s me put on without holding him down. He LOVES the scent! Unfortunately, he has gotten a sunburn on his face every time I use it! I am SUPEr sun concious and reapply often. I kept making excuses as to what I did wrong to make it not work. I REALLY wanted it to work for him. It&#x27;s not me. The sunscreen is not effective. Very dissapointed.  Especially with the price and all the HYPE of what a great product it is on other reviews. (Checked the expiration date. Not expired) 1 star only for its scent.</li>
    <li> We have a lot of sun here in Key West, so we use sunscreen almost every day.  I don&#x27;t want to be rubbing chemicals in my skin, and I definitely don&#x27;t want to be exposing my child to them (childrens&#x27; skin can absorb toxins much more easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why I checked the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of chemical-free sunscreen and found Badger at (or near) the top of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff goes on thick, but stays well on my 2 year-old as she plays in and out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this to help keep your baby healthy from the sun and from chemicals.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers pointed out, this product is sticky and greasy.  It stays oily on your skin for hours.  After sitting on the shelf for a few weeks, oil comes out first when you open the cap.  I will not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this at the beach when I knew I&#x27;d be out for awhile.  I did not get a burn and i&#x27;ll tell you why.  This stuff is THICK.  You can rub and rub till your hands cramp up but it pretty much stays on the surface.  The real treat was I had to soap up 3 or 4 times to just feel like it was starting to come off.  I think it&#x27;s a good product but unless you are afraid of the sun being out for 5 minuutes, I suggest using this product when one needs real protection</li>
    <li> We of the pasty white clan have used badger for years and it&#x27;s great.  Yes it can be gooey (minus one star), but it&#x27;s the least chemical-laced I have found. I am not worried about putting it on my child.  And I&#x27;m a bit of an organic nut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Explanation of the nano content (used to be, but it&#x27;s not now, and why):&lt;br /&gt;[..]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no other brand I feel as comfortable with (open to suggestions, but not holding my breath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it works.  I&#x27;ve not had a sunburn when it was properly applied, nor has the pasty white child.  Having said that I always lobby for a long sleeve rash guard and hat so we only need badger on the legs.  Sometimes I get my way. :)</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was rated #1 in terms of safety regarding toxic ingredients. 5 stars for that reason.  However, it is not possible to wear this daily on the face because you will look like a clown in white face.  It does not absorb into the skin.  When you wipe it off in an attempt to wear it daily, it leaves the skin looking greasy.  For daily use, I opted for DeVita Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30 +.  I paid $25.99 at Whole Foods but will buy it next time through Amazon, much cheaper.  It is rated #1 in terms of safety and does not leave white residue on the face.</li>
    <li> This is my little one&#x27;s first summer, which is quite nerve racking. For the most part I use an umbrella to keep her out of the sun - but when that isn&#x27;t an option (like on long car rides)... this stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s SAFE. It&#x27;s one of the best rated sun screens for nontoxic broad spectrum protection and it has come through for my baby. No tanning, no burns, just lovely pale skin. She gets about 20 minutes of sun a day in any given week - don&#x27;t forget babies need their sun for vitamin D! - but beyond that, between all the options this has been a great back-up. It spreads smooth, looks clear, has no distinctive smell that I can pick up on, and (I really can&#x27;t say this enough) has no harsh or questionable chemicals in it. Lovely :) I still didn&#x27;t use it on her before she was 6 months old, but that&#x27;s mummy being a little over protective - even young babies should be safe with this (still, don&#x27;t leave them out in the sun too long ;) it&#x27;s hot!).</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this product. The smell is weird, like a kind of fake chocolate. But worse is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t rub in at all. I know natural sunscreens have trouble with this, but I was ghostly white even just using a bit on my face.</li>
    <li> I started using this when we went to Aruba with our 10 month old, and not a single burn in the 2 years since. It is thick and there is a little whitish left even after a good bit of rubbing, but that fades, and to me if that&#x27;s the ONLY downside to a sunscreen that is safe, effective and all natural, then this is a winner. It&#x27;s also gotten better over the past 2 years in terms of the white factor, so that says to me that the company is still working on improvements which makes me feel good about buying from them. I highly recommend this to all mommies- and the ones that have tried it that I&#x27;ve told in person have all been very happy with it and repeat buyers as well.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS...EASY TO SPREAD AND PROVIDE GOOD PROTECTION ALSO!  BEST NATURAL SUNSCREEN I HAVE EVER USED.  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a great sunscreen, but it is a little greasy and hard to rub in. I use it daily and recommend it for a natural sunscreen</li>
    <li> EWG has rated this as a top sunscreen. After using it on a trip to a very sunny and warm climate, I understand why. It does a great job of blocking the suns rays without being overly greasy. It does require a little extra rubbing to get it fully absorbed, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Thoroughly happy with the product</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel irritated if I leave it on for long periods of time.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 summers now and haven&#x27;t gotten burned yet.</li>
    <li> My husband is not allergic to soy, so he can use it.  I was disappointed .  California baby sensitive has no soy</li>
    <li> This product is really hard to rub into your skin. It works really well but does not let you look normal. The smell is kind of weird as well. This is a better product that actually rubs in: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B9RGVU/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8</li>
    <li> works well no problems for sensitive skins</li>
    <li> A ginger friend of mine used this on our last vacation and he never got burnt, I was sold. It&#x27;s a great sunscreen and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to hang out for about an hour in the water with it on. Plus it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I really want to love this sunscreen because it&#x27;s so much safer than other brands! I do like it, but it sure does go on thick. Keep in mind, this is my first natural sunscreen. I use it on my bi-racial son and it does well on him. It goes on pretty white, but rubs in to almost clear. The main thing I don&#x27;t like about it is how greasy it feels, even after rubbing it in. I take him on stroller rides in the morning, and I feel like I need to give him a bath when we get home to get the greasy sunscreen off. I&#x27;m going to keep using this until we run out. But I think I&#x27;ll try something else next time...</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this sunscreen but I don&#x27;t! It is so thick and heavy and so greasy! It stays greasy all day. Gets on the furniture, in my hair and on my clothes. I can&#x27;t live with that! I am back to looking for something better.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love this product. Last summer I had a horrible allergic reaction to regular sunscreen and developed a temporary sensitivity to sunlight. Basically, direct exposure to sunlight would give me hives. I was on a road trip when it happened and this product saved the day! The zinc and cocoa butter were very soothing to my skin and the rash was gone in 1 week. The only problem is: I didn&#x27;t get the product that is advertised! They are listing this product as having jojoba oil, cocoa butter and Shea butter but What I received in the mail doesn&#x27;t have any of those ingredients listed. What I got has a sunflower oil base. I am a little disappointed because sunflower oil is a very cheap ingredient that in my opinion pales in comparison to Shea butter and cocoa butter. Pros?? It&#x27;s less oily, less white and has no smell. Cons: It is less nourishing to the skin and I crave the smell of cocoa butter of my old badger sunscreen). I will update my review when I see if this really protect my skin from the sun. I know the one with Shea butter was a hit... I&#x27;m hoping this one will not be too bad. Amazon needs to update their website information.</li>
    <li> I recently found out zinc is superior to titanium(what i had been using) so i switched to Badger to test it because i heard good things about it. I bought 2 different types so far. 1st one only had 5 ingredients but gave me acne! I never even get pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of listening to some who say it must be the zinc that clogged pores so they never use physical blocks or even want to experiment with it again, i didn&#x27;t give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the lotion version &amp; it&#x27;s a bit drying but it did not break me out. Problem is if its a lotion i expected it  to dribble off my face with water but it didn&#x27;t! It won&#x27;t budge.&lt;br /&gt;It completely soaked into my face. &amp; yet all water resistant kinds that i have tried start to come loose with water...&lt;br /&gt;This disappointed/confuses me because i got it thinking finally one that will come off easier for those days I just take  quick trips out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway i hear some people complain about smells, grease, color... well what do they want a miracle?!&lt;br /&gt;Everything in this world i know of has some sort of smell. If it&#x27;s that bothersome then burn!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I don&#x27;t mind smells, or grease as long as it doesn&#x27;t break me out,that requires testing because no other greasy block has ever caused me a breakout. Greasy doesn&#x27;t equal breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the white cast. i read some people try to rub it in to death, makes no sense because its meant to sit on top &amp; block.&lt;br /&gt;Some people who are new to physical blocks are the ones i hear complaining, everyone else including surfers i&#x27;ve heard expects &amp; is used to the slight white cast.&lt;br /&gt;I read some people like to see the white to know where it is(so do i)  &amp; it makes me feel more protected. Interestingly the cream one i stopped using on my face but still use on my body doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any white &amp; it bothers me. I I feel like i rubbed it off or it disappeared. It&#x27;s unnerving.&lt;br /&gt;I only like sunscreens that leave some white cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this one on my hands &amp; they have gotten darker in a very short time. This is bad because I have only been getting incidental exposure lately &amp; if zinc is superior then...? This has never happened to me with the kind that leave a white cast.&lt;br /&gt;The titanium i used all last year while spending sometimes hours outside did not tan or burn me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a sunscreen that is hard to rub in. This baffles me because I read it alot. Unless those are the same people that try to rub away the white &amp; that&#x27;s their definition of hard to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway if you are out in alot of sun like going to the beach  i think it&#x27;s best to use a cream zinc, protection should come 1st. Maybe some prefer the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;A lotion for everyday use would be PERFECT for  just what it says like if you&#x27;re just going to work and back &amp; quick  trips to the store etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some impossible to please people with unrealistic expectations complain so much that companies have ruined products that used to work well.&lt;br /&gt;If a block is greasy throw some powder on. If it&#x27;s drying moisturize your face later. Smells? everything smells. Whitecast? alot of people match that color &amp; love it, alot of people like to see the white for extra peace of mind, others are just used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Since the beach is usually not an everyday thing I wonder why some people are so picky about oiliness &amp; color &amp; smell instead of protecting themselves. Physical blocks are still the best.&lt;br /&gt;I  give 1 star to the cream one because of the tan so fast &amp; 2 to the lotion for the idea &amp; effort. I plan to keep trying different ones.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m being picky about the lotion one because i&#x27;m finding it impossible to get it off compared to the water resistant kind and that kinda defeats the purpose of an everyday one. The one I used on my hands gave me a tan....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to remove physical blocks is the tricky part I&#x27;m still trying to figure out. I don&#x27;t even care if it comes off completely. My titanium one never completely came off but still budged and never gave break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE/WARNING: I did start to burn after i tried it then developed a rash &amp; my face dried up thoroughly &amp; my face got weird wrinkles &amp; 19 days later my oily face has never returned, Now even water is burning it. I think I am allergic to something in it. I waited for days &amp; tried it again, big mistake. It did it again. my face got a rash, started peeling, burning, itching &amp; more crinkles &amp; severe dryness. I cannot use the lotion period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to warn people do a test patch with natural sunscreens too because I&#x27;ve never heard anyone say this or even knew this could happen. I will test patch all sunscreens from now on.ly came off but still budged and never gave break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE/WARNING: I did start to burn after i tried it then developed a rash &amp; my face dried up thoroughly &amp; my face got weird wrinkles &amp; 19 days later my oily face has never returned, Now even water is burning it.

    <li> Bager is great for preventing burn, works better than any other sunscreen I have used, but it smells bad :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick, so you have to use quite a bit to get any coverage. It works well enough, but it would be better if it spread easier. If you&#x27;re buying for your kids the Badger \\&quot;Kids\\&quot; sunscreen spreads very easily.</li>
    <li> Applied as directed and reapplied. On beach in HI less than 2 hours and we&#x27;re badly burned.  Sorry I can&#x27;t post pics - I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Made my skin white even when I distributed it evenly.</li>
    <li> My family and I go on vacation to a beachouse for an entire week, so naturally my skin is super exposed to the sun. I have eczema so my skin is sensitive to eevveerrything. Especially when it comes to aerosol sunblocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the first beach day I tried to use this sun block and it was just so thick and white and I felt it took so long to cover my entire body in it considering the thickness of it. The next day or two I got lazy and used the spray junk instead and my skin broke out. I decided the next day to just set aside the time to rub all of this sunblock in and my skin was actually much better off. I almost feel like it healed my breakout. My skin is so sensitive so for the fact that I reacted well with it means that this brand is safe and high quality. It&#x27;s just the thickness of it that takes a bit of time to get on and rub in. But it&#x27;s worth it if you dont want any break outs!</li>
    <li> I ordered two yellow tubes a couple of months ago. Both contained chunky pieces of white stuff which were difficult to rub in. Willing to try the white tube to see if it is any different because it is rated so high in protection. Has anyone else had this experience with their Badger sunscreens?</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t believe the negative hype - I am guessing most complainers are people putting it on too lightly or too heavily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is not a cream, it is a thick paste that is reminiscent of life-guard nose protection - you need to apply enough to get the white/blue zombie effect then rub it in well, some places (like stubbly cheeks) will require a little extra effort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, as a driver who spends 10 hours a day with my left side in the sun, I can say it does work, it works well, and works better than most  - more importantly, far from being merely &#x27;natural,&#x27; this block does not contain the vitamin additives that are almost universal in the usual suspects (Vitamin A derivatives, etc) that are very popular but may in fact increase UV damage to your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Difficult to rub in, leaves a white residue</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunblock because it was one of the best rated sunscreens (great protection against UVA and UVB + lack of components that may be harmful) on the EWG website. It did protect me from getting any sunburn while on a beach vacation in Dominican Republic. However it was quite thick and difficult to apply and no matter how long I rubbed it on my skin (it took me forever to apply it!), I was always left with whitish residues all over. And even after going for a swim, it was still there. The advantage of that is that I only applied it twice a day and it still protected me very efficiently from the sun. The disadvantage is that you really don&#x27;t get much of a tan with such a thick white layer of sunblock on your skin. Also, it smelled like olive oil (one of the components), which I didn&#x27;t find very pleasant. Overall it is a good safe protective sunscreen but I prefer others from the EWG list (such as \\&quot;Alba Botanical\\&quot; and maybe \\&quot;Hara Sports\\&quot;), for being easier and quicker to apply.</li>
    <li> This product is way too thick and doesn&#x27;t apply well to the skin. I tried to apply it and was so put off by it that I tried to wash it off with soap and water and had to scrub it to get it off. It leaves a white/yellow color on your skin. I was very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen because of a story I saw on the local news.  I thought it would be great for my daughter who is a life guard.  She tried it, but didn&#x27;t like it because it felt \\&quot;gross\\&quot; and smelled \\&quot;weird\\&quot;.  Not wanting to waste  the $16.00 I spent, I decided I would use it.  It came out of the tube separating.  When I applied it, it felt very greasy like vaseline.  It tried to wait to let it absord, but I just couldn&#x27;t stand the greasy feel on my skin.  I was afraid to get this stuff on my furniture and clothes. I had to step into the shower with soap to get it off.  Very nasty stuff.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work well, the only negative is the feel and the slightly higher than nuetral odor.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few natural/organic sunscreens on my kids &amp; this is by far my favorite.  Neither have my kids have ever gotten burned or even slightly red &amp; no tan lines! Lots of sunscreens can prevent a burn, but they still allow the skin to get too dark. Tanned skin is damaged skin &amp; my kids are very fair, so I dont like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product is a sunBLOCK, not a sunSCREEEN - so nothing absorbs into my kids&#x27; skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yea its a little thick so it takes some time to rub in (not convienent as some of the &#x27;sprays&#x27; - but the sprays are filled with chemicals that i dont want my kids exposed to).  It can be a little greasy feeling, but it doesnt stain swimsuits &amp; always washes right out of my clothes as well.  It works so well that I dont even mind those two factors.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading its safety on EWG website.  Not only is it a safe sunscreen, this stuff really, really works.  I used it on both myself and my 3 year old daughter.  We both can spend a full day at the pool without getting burned and without re-applying.  It is a little more difficult to apply than chemical sunscreen&#x27;s but worth the extra effort.  Just need to spend a little more time rubbing in the white cream.  And it does turn my swimmsuit white, but washes right out.  Used Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s sunscreen in the past for its safety rating, but it didn&#x27;t work at all -- got badly sunburned.  Don&#x27;t think they even make the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s anymore.  I&#x27;m a loyal Badger&#x27;s sunscreen buyer from now on.</li>
    <li> too much zinc, makes you skin very white, but it is odorless and does work.</li>
    <li> While I was glad to see this sunscreen was free of any known harmful chemicals, I still would not recommend. The sunscreen goes on super thick, is hard to fully rub in so that no white residue is visible, and it makes you feel slimy and in need of a shower. Furthermore, I got a tiny amount of it on my brightly colored shorts which I assumed would come off in the wash—however, it bleached that spot and the shorts are now ruined. This is a great product in theory, however, when actually using it, it falls short.</li>
    <li> I like this product but am very disappointed with this seller, Etailz. The sunblock expires in April, 2014, 3 months from now. That&#x27;s way too soon for me to be able to use it up. I know from experience that Badger products do not last well beyond their expiration date. In my opinion shipping a product that&#x27;s about to expire is pretty unethical. Shame on you, Etailz.</li>
    <li> We have moved to only using Zinc oxide or Titanium Dioxide-based sunscreens due to concerns with toxicity in other sunscreens. As long as you realize that these sunscreens are NEVER going to be totally clear and they will NEVER be as easy to use as the toxic ones, you will be happy with this sunscreen. We used this and California Baby and this is my favorite. Although it does leave a greasy residue, it does a great job and I feel good putting it on myself and my children. I have very sensitive skin and it has never caused any issues at all.</li>
    <li> We have used Badger sunscreen before, but the bottle looked different. Maybe because this is unscented and we used scented before. However, we were very pleased with this. Note that this is not a chemical sunscreen but a mineral one, so it will go on quite thick. The benefit is that you aren&#x27;t rubbing chemicals into your children&#x27;s skin, and rather blocking the sun with the minerals which do not harm children. It is ranked very low in the safe cosmetics database which ranks toxicity and safety. Particularly for things we rub into the kids&#x27; skin a lot, we like to try to get the safest possible. You do need to reapply this every 30-40 minutes, which I know can be a hassle, but once it is part of your summer pool or beach routine, you don&#x27;t really notice it much. We find it to be very effective when applied in the right dosage and frequently enough. This is the kind of sunscreen I used when I was little, so I guess I am just accustomed to it and with a lot of things if you just get used to it, it works quite well. It is different from chemical sunscreens but we found that it was worth it to avoid the toxicity of the chemical ones. We figure we expose the kids to so many toxins that we cannot help, we might as well try to avoid them where we can. I understand why that is not possible for everyone, but if you can do it, it works well for us and I thought this was good and effective sunscreen to use for the whole summer. We were at the the pool a lot.</li>
    <li> Goes on VERY thick , stays White on your skin. Very hard to spread on your skin .</li>
    <li> Great product, really works well.  It coats on thick and \\&quot;oatmeal-like\\&quot; but that is whats expected of an organic (non-chemical) product.  I trust it on my kids.</li>
    <li> We purchased this sunscreen for our six month old daughter for when we spent a week on a sailboat. The sun was particularly harsh and we didn&#x27;t want her to get burned. We also didn&#x27;t want to expose her delicate skin to a sunscreen with harsher chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love this sunscreen and it worked perfectly. Our daughter didn&#x27;t get any sunburn--or even a tan--while wearing it. It takes a few minutes to rub it in completely, but once it&#x27;s rubbed in, it works wonders!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this sunscreen based on the EWG ratings.  It is very thick, not easy to apply (I would not recommend for your face) and tends to \\&quot;coagulate\\&quot; (clump together) on the surface of your skin if you sweat a lot during sports, etc.  My kids think it has an unpleasant odor.  I think it smells nutty and much like its natural ingredients.  There are other highly rated EWG sunscreens I prefer over this one (Solbar, for example).</li>
    <li> Not poisonous according to Skindeep.org.  That&#x27;s saying a lot in the Sunscreen world.</li>
    <li> I bought the Badger based on great review in EWG. I used it and burned BADLY within one hour. I thought I did something wrong, so the second time I put more and rubbed more carefully. Even worse sunburn than before - my skin peeled twice on some spots. Third time used it for kayaking but fortunately had a T-shirt. My arms burned again very badly!&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen provided ZERO protection, I burned in the same time, as I would not have used any sunscreen! After three sunburns I threw it out!</li>
    <li> need unscented items.  This is think and hard to spread.  It&#x27;s got a clay-like color and texture.  Used a couple times, very disappointed.  Would not reorder, did not use the full tube due to texture.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find a safer product for my family and this seemed like a good choice.  Unfortunately, the first day of our trip to Florida, we were all mildly burned despite a thorough even application and multiple repeat applications.  I felt so bad for the kids (4 and 6) as they complained about their sunburn.  The product seems to work better if you already have a base tan or have olive or darker skin.  It is somewhat difficult to apply and does leave some whiteness, but not too bad.  Just use caution if it&#x27;s your first time in the sun or are fair skinned and apply liberally and often.</li>
    <li> If I want to \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; on a snow covered hill all I need to do is take off my clothes and close my pale blue eyes--I&#x27;m that white. And still, for someone like me this stuff leaves the \\&quot;white residue of doom\\&quot; on my skin. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, so much so that when people ask me, \\&quot;What&#x27;s that white stuff all over--\\&quot; I just cut them off and say, \\&quot;sunscreen,\\&quot; and go about my business. It does work well, but if you&#x27;re the self-conscious type keep in mind that everyone is going to know you have it on.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product for my family.  We are out of doors a lot...and in general...we do not sunburn.  After learning about unhealthy chemicals in most store bought sunblocks, I decided to buy Badger based on its claims of organic ingrediants and high quality sun protection.  We used this product for a 2 hour day at the beach and we all got incredibly sunburned.  Terribly sunburned...as if we had no sunscreen on at all. I strongly discourage you from buying this product if you are looking for protection from the sun.  I am unsure how they can even make a claim of sun protection with this product.</li>
    <li> We have bought this sunscreen before so I was just stocking up for our upcoming family trip to the beach.  We used our new tube the first day and we all got bad sunburns!  We couldn&#x27;t even go back to the beach for 3 days!  We used it in the same way we always had.  I think we may have got a bad batch but we won&#x27;t be taking any chances with this brand again.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen after reading the EWG recommendations.  It is thick, but not too bad.  I personally like the light lavender scent.  My 7 year old daughter does not like the smell and thinks it&#x27;s too thick.  That being said, yesterday we applied ONCE.. and she swam in direct sun for 3.5 hours.  We never reapplied the sunscreen and she did NOT get burned!  Overall, I think it is a good sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine, It is difficult to rub in, and does leave a pasty white look- but the white look doesn&#x27;t bother me. I just want my family to be protected from the sun. My only worry is when the white gets rubbed off onto something are we still protected?</li>
    <li> yes it is natural...but unfortunately sooo annonying to apply....and leaves a lot of white residue.....i really whish it was better :(</li>
    <li> My son and I are burned terribly. Badger sunscreen spf 30 was applied every hour and was applied thickly and rubbed in well! We are fried. I have a few white spots here and there that are not burned (either where I missed applying, or where a few particles of zinc landed, I don&#x27;t know). We have used California Baby sunblock under the same conditions- pool/ sun and have never burned. I wish I didn&#x27;t by this. I believe the company is responsible, my son is so terribly sun burned, he may become ill.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my kids for the first time today at a waterpark and was not pleased with the results.  I knew it wasn&#x27;t advertised specifically as waterproof, but since the label reads \\&quot;reapply after swimming\\&quot; I thought it would be okay.  Besides, it&#x27;s so thick!  Learn from me and know it&#x27;s not good if the user is spending a lot of time in the water.  We did reapply once, but it wasn&#x27;t enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had chosen Badger based on the EVG ratings.  Essentially I coated their faces and arms with this brand (so much so that another kid asked why their faces were so white) and their legs with another, more commercial brand.  They burned their faces and arms and not their legs.  Since we did spend 5 hours in the waterpark so it isn&#x27;t quite a fair test and I will try it again but this is NOT waterproof, at least not on two small swimming boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/12 - I forgot this didn&#x27;t work for us and bought more and tried it again this summer.  It still doesn&#x27;t work and I and my kids got very sunburned.  And I COATED it on, esp. on their faces.  I&#x27;m returning this product immediately.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the first time last summer. I love this it, its soft, top rated among the sunscreen safe rakings. I would only wish that it spread a little bit easier, its really thick. This means it takes me a bit to put it on my son (5 years old) and he gets all impacient. But its a very small detail. :D</li>
    <li> Badger Balm is a responsible company that makes safe products.  This sunscreen works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t contain all the toxic stuff most sunscreens have.  Wish they&#x27;d come out with a coconut version.</li>
    <li> We have used this all summer and it worked out wonderfully for us... no burns and my toddler (a boy) loves to be outside.  Of course, our Sunday Afternoons play hat helped immensely as well.  I ran out of this sunscreen recently and had to use Alba Mineral sunscreen for kids... it is irritating my son&#x27;s skin and actually causing him to break out a little.  Even though the Badger is made with olive oil, it has never caused my son to have any skin problems.  The protection is great and I feel so much better using a physical barrier sunscreen as opposed to a chemical one.</li>
    <li> My kids and I used this for our first beach outing of the year in Florida and we all got sunburned. This never happened to us with other sunscreens. Do not recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Love that I can afford a sun protection product for the whole family that skips the chemicals.  A little goes a long way and be sure to knead it before opening or you get a lot of the oils leaking out.  Love that it&#x27;s unscented, keeps the kids from squirming when applying to their faces.  Very water repellant, makes your skin feel really soft.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a good natural sunscreen, this one is the best I found until now. It absorbs really well, and the smell is ok.</li>
    <li> I realized that I should really start putting sunscreen on my children daily.  Both their playgrounds are sadly in full sun.  So I wanted something more organic with less chemicals and Badger was recommended by many.  There were two things that were disappointing;&lt;br /&gt;1) it does go on really heavy and is really greasy - so much so that even after washing my hands with soap, I still felt it was on my hands.  Also, my children weren&#x27;t thrilled with how heavy it was&lt;br /&gt;2) this particular unscented choice really isn&#x27;t unscented - it had this faint almost petroleum smell that both my children and me could pick up.  And they will not wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping to exchange it for an actual scented version and hope that it is more pleasant.  While I am expecting it to still be greasy and heavy, I plan to accept that in light of it having less chemicals.</li>
    <li> My fridt time using all natural sunscreen and I have to say that it&#x27;s been hard. It had an odor to it and it&#x27;s also very tick and hard to apply.</li>
    <li> I spent over an hour reviewing safe sunscreens and decided on Badger.  I applied to my 1 year old and was very careful.  Turns out, she has a slight burn on both her arms, clearly where i would not have missed applying it!  I am very disappointed and will not use this product again.  It was expensive and did not work!  I did like how it went on but my little one did burn!</li>
    <li> Bought this sunscreen after looking for natural sunscreens.  We were at the beach for about 4 hours.  We put on sunscreen before we left the condo, and reapplied multiple times.  We all got burned.  In addition, it never completely rubbed in and we all looked like we were covered in toothpaste.  Super disappointed and won&#x27;t buy Badger products again!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works very well for our needs.  We spend about an hour outdoors swimming, and this has been great.  No sunburns or redness, and it works on my child&#x27;s sensitive skin without any problems.  It does have a slight white tint to it when we put it on, but it rubs in fine and isn&#x27;t too thick or greasy.  I use it on my face with no problems! Besides, as long as it works, I don&#x27;t really care about a slight whiteness.  I also feel better using this product knowing that the ingredients are natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think some things to consider when reading reviews about sunscreen is how much time people spend in the direct sun and what they do (i.e. sitting and sunning, swimming, etc.).  We try not to spend too much time in the direct sun, but we needed a sunscreen for swimming. So, this works great for us for about an hour of swimming (and we reapply for longer).  We don&#x27;t tend to sit and sun.  We tend to cover up when not in the pool.  So for us this is great for those times when we are in the sun and works well in the water. Sunscreen can be great, but we try not to get overconfident about it.  Nothing protects against the sun like clothing.</li>
    <li> This product is basically a mix of beeswax, olive oil, and zinc oxide powder. It&#x27;s greasy, thick, and when properly applied it leaves the skin with a zombie-like whitish pallor. For me it has also worked quite well, giving good sun protection all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it while swimming, only for outdoor work (landscaping,) so I can&#x27;t speak to its water-resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advisory: I&#x27;ve found that this product tends to permanently stain light-colored cotton fabrics. Turns them a mungy shade of gray. Because it&#x27;s greasy, it spreads easily to any surface it touches, so be careful when putting clothes on (or taking off.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a separate clean rag in my bag to use at the end of the day for wiping off most of the excess sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----UPDATE 2013-05-21 -----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept a tube of this around from last summer. Over the winter, in cool-temperature storage (40 degrees average,) the product developed small waxy chunks (the size of ground pepper flakes) that made applying it a messy, ugly process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, after storing on a warm sunny window sill (~90 degrees F) for a few days, and massaging the tube a little, the chunks seems to have dissolved and the product has returned to its usual smooth, uniform consistency. I continue to use the same tube, this season, and it continues to be effective. (Makes sense -- the active ingredient, zinc oxide, is basically inert.)</li>
    <li> I just bought this sunscreen the other day after dreading another summer of dealing with the Kiss My Face stuff that we had last year. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It goes on MUCH more easily and rubs in better. Really, there was no white residue after I was done putting it on my toddler. I also kept a washcloth nearby for wiping my hands afterward. As others have said, as long as your expectations about these safer sunscreens are realistic and you understand that they will never go on as cleanly as the stuff with more chemicals, I can&#x27;t imagine that you&#x27;d have too many issues with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback I noticed was that it was a bit greasy on my son&#x27;s skin even after a few minutes, which was kind of annoying as it rubbed off on my work clothes. Fortunately, I was wearing white so it was okay. I&#x27;ll have to be more careful about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just bought 4 of these for camp, and my kids won&#x27;t wear it because it smells so bad. They like the regular one much much better. If you haven&#x27;t made the purchase, get the regular Badger.</li>
    <li> We love the natural Badger products. They are a thick cream that goes a long way. I feel better putting something on my skin less harmful and is more natural.costs a little more but you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s a good product and will buy again and again. Easy no hassle transactions.</li>
    <li> LIke it because it&#x27;s natural.  It is thick but that&#x27;s what happens with zinc.  I wish there was a product not so thick.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was just what I was looking for.  It is safe to use - it got an excellent safety rating from EWG, \\&quot;Evironmental Working Group\\&quot;.  This site tests and rates products for consumer safety.  There are many sunscreens out there that use harmful chemicals which can cause all kinds of problems, including cancer, but Badger sunscreen is rated one of the top for safety. Many of the \\&quot;safer sunscreens are difficult to apply and do not absorb well into the skin, but this one has a creamy texture, smells good and goes on very nicely. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I wanted a sunscreen that would be kinder to my skin as I really only intended to use it primarily on my face, neck and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of outdoor running. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and so far so good. It is great for small applications. I think that if you want to use it for bigger areas look at other products. It is really thick and tough to rub in. That&#x27;s ok when all you want is to apply to nose, cheeks and ears etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for another reviewer complaining about the smell. It doesn&#x27;t really smell of anything. Certainly not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does the job. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s natural and like most natural SPFs, it&#x27;s super white and hard to rub in. This one is SO white that is is almost purple, that sounds strange but that was my experience. It does work well and knowing it is not harmful to my body is good, but the effort of rubbing it in makes this a chore to apply, sometimes I skip it for that reason- which defeats the purpose.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with the baby natural SPF products.</li>
    <li> Badger sunscreen is the BEST!! My kids have super sensitive skin so we spend a lot of time vetting our products that we use in their skin. This one is highly righted by EWG and despite the skin issues we have (very severe eczema), this has always been not only non-irritating, but actually helpful. Zinc oxide is a main ingredient and great for eczema, so I never worry about slathering this stuff on. We&#x27;ve had one burn in the six years we&#x27;ve used this stuff, which is a good enough track record for me. Yes, it&#x27;s thick and takes a lot to smear in until the white color disappears, but who cares?! I think that&#x27;s a silly complaint for kids. My kids are white-streaked but safe, so I&#x27;m a happy mom!</li>
    <li> Too pasty..goes on think. Hard to rub in and leaves a white film. No aroma..which I like. But, just to thick.</li>
    <li> I know this is a high-quality sun screen, with a high percentage zinc oxide for the physical block; however, it is very thick and pasty.  Doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and leaves a very distinctive white film on my skin.  Can&#x27;t use it for every day use, but I&#x27;ll use it for casual or sports, when I don&#x27;t care so much that my already pale skin looks even whiter.  If you&#x27;re looking for a sun screen with a high percentage physical block, I&#x27;d recommend Burn Out, SPF 30 Clean &amp; Clear.  It&#x27;s got the same +18% zinc oxide as the Badger, plus it goes on smooth and leaves your skin with a flat matte finish (note: it does feel a little tacky, but the appearance is a nice matte finish).</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t understand why people gave such good ratings for this product when it&#x27;s so greasy and thick you can&#x27;t even smear it on your face. Even tough it&#x27;s more natural, I rather stick to other brands that is easier to apply and for sure won&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> This product is suppose to be one of the best quality out there, but it was so think and white that I won&#x27;t wear it. It doesn&#x27;t rub in.</li>
    <li> I normally use TruKid, but had bought this on clearance, and now I know why. It was super slimy, and both of my kids and my husband burned, even though I had reapplied as directed. I had used our regular sunscreen on their faces, and neither of them burned there, but all of them burned where I&#x27;d applied the Badger sunscreen. I could actually see my daughter turning more and more pink even though she was still coated with the sunscreen and I kept putting it on over and over. I couldn&#x27;t believe it because this is supposed to be such great stuff!</li>
    <li> Very thick and pasty.  Hard to apply.  Leaves thick white marks everywhere.  My kids hate putting them on.  We went back to our tried and true neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about using organic and all natural products, but unfortunately this one just doesn&#x27;t work. First of all it does not absorb into your skin at all. Its the consistency of like a clay face mask. I have dark skin and my husband has very light skin. He looked like a white ghost and my skin turned a bluish hue no matter how long we tried to rub it in. We dealt with that but it doesn&#x27;t even work! My husband got burnt and I was three shades darker. It didn&#x27;t protect our skin at all. Very disappointed especially since I spent $30 on 2 tubes and didn&#x27;t bring any other kind of sunscreen with us on vacation.</li>
    <li> this is a very thick lotion, and very difficult to get to rub into skin without a white glow.  I semi-expected that although was somewhat disappointed with how difficult this was to spread/rub in, but the biggest problem was that after one hour out in the sun after a liberal application, I was completely sunburnt.  I would NOT recommend this product at all.  I was shocked at how dangerously ineffective this product was.</li>
    <li> I actually burned and got sun blisters on my feet while using this product...it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I am fair-skinned so I am super religious with sunscreen application and reapplying but that did not matter with this sunscreen. I have never had an issue like that with other more natural brands and commercial/more chemical brands. It was also super greasy and difficult to rub in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m another person who switched to Badger after reading the EWG&#x27;s reports. I ditched my previous sunscreen, as it was one of the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ones, and replaced it with Badger unscented 30 spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was zinc-based and would be oily and make me pasty-white like a juggalo at the beach, so that&#x27;s not the issue I have with it. And I read the instructions and kneaded the tube before squeezing the product out and applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue I have with it is that after swimming in the ocean, it wears off unevenly. After around 45 minutes of swimming and raft-riding in the ocean, I now have a horrible sunburn on the left side of my chest and upper left arm, and almost no sunburn on the right side of my chest and right arm. Parts of my upper thighs are burned, and there are a few splotchy bits of sunburn on my forearms. It stayed on my face like a champ, though, and my shins and feet are as pale as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, later in the day when I took a shower to try and remove what remained, it didn&#x27;t want to come off at all, even with industrial strength sea salt scrub and vigorous application of force. A few days later, I think there&#x27;s still some patches of the white stuff stuck between my toes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably fine if you&#x27;re not getting in the water or not getting sweaty at all. But if you&#x27;re planning to swim, just be aware that this stuff will abandon you in a weird pattern, leaving your skin looking like some sort of organic Rorschach blot.</li>
    <li> I read about how great this sunscreen is as I was reviewing EWG for the last couple years. I have to admit that, before I had a child I would&#x27;ve NEVER spend over $10 on sunscreen.. But now that I have a toddler with great skin, I have to be alot more prudent with my decisions.. Nevertheless, I bought this last year and it worked wonderfully. Especially out on the Florida beaches and in the Georgia Sun.  It has a strange smell to it, almost smells like Vitamin E or something, that WILL stay on your clothes (the smell), so hopefully you won&#x27;t be too scent-sensitive like me.  It worked wonders, it goes on VERY white and thick but disappears just as fast.  I opened it this year and lo and behold, its all chunky and needs to be replaced.  Because its so natural, it doesnt have preservatives in it to keep it from clumping up AND it also has an expiration date that is true, so, with that said, I will be buying it again this year to take the beach :)</li>
