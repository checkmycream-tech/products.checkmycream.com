      <li>Great brush for blending highlights and shadows.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good quality brush for makeup</li>
      <li>The logo was also not even a good copy of MAC&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Good value for the money.</li>
      <li>works good, looks nice, does the trick&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this brush!</li>
      <li>It has soft bristles and a perfectly tapered edge.  </li>
      <li>These brushes has good quality hair, but the stick fell apart quickly and it wasn&#x27;t authentic.</li>
      <li>As a former finger applier of makeup, I can&#x27;t believe how flawless my foundation looks when using this brush!</li>
      <li>I thought for the cost the seller was reselling an authentic brush because she did not like it.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>This is a great brush made by M.A.C. and although a little longer than my Px brush, it gives great application for when I use liquid foundation, concealer or just touching up my makeup without adding more to my face.  </li>
      <li>When it arrived, I compared it to my genuine MAC brush.</li>
      <li>I was so excited for this brush</li>
      <li>Love this &amp; highly recommend!</li>

      <li>I ordered this brush and quickly learned knockoffs were being sold.</li>
      <li>If it sounds to good to be true, it&#x27;s not true.    </li>
      <li>I discovered it was not the real thing when I compared the Mac lettering from the lettering that was on my original Mac brushes and also when all the hairs/bristles came off by the chunks when I was feeling for the texture of bristles (by the way the bristles felt like straw).</li>
      <li>I personally think it should be against the law to sell and pass off something as authentic.</li>
      <li>the plus side its pretty durable</li>
      <li>My first foundation brush was made by Prescriptives</li>
      <li>The fake&lt;br /&gt; had about half as many bristles, the handle was about an inch shorter, the ferrule was cheaply made, and even the plastic sleeve in which it came was coming apart.</li>
      <li>I use less makeup &amp; it looks so much better!  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I am very upset.</li>
      <li>Its better then  my other department store brush.</li>
      <li>Take note that there&#x27;s no thin plastic sleeve that surrounds that whole brush like a real one, and that the ferrule is flat rather than curved like a real one.</li>
      <li>Shipping was normal receive this product in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>The mac one is waaaaay better DON&#x27;T waste your money on this product just splurge on the brush and go to the counter.</li>
      <li>It is very well made and will last for years.</li>
      <li>As an owner of an authentic 190 I can clearly tell that this is an obvious fake.</li>
      <li>its not that the quality is bad its nice and soft, but its NOT a mac brush they sent me a sigma f60 brush and it seemed on the packaging i would get a mac brush because it says MAC 190 FOUNDATION BRUSH!</li>

    <li> This is awesome &amp; I wish I had purchased one years ago. I would definately recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I am not sure of the authenticity of this product, however it gets the job done. Before cleaning it, it shed a lot but after not so anymore. Good value for the money. Shipping was normal receive this product in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> [...]    If you bought one already, look at this link. Clearly it&#x27;s a fake. The logo is wrong, the crimp on the fibers is wrong among a number of other things that scream \\&quot;fake!\\&quot; I&#x27;m currently in the process of trying to get my money back. Don&#x27;t buy this brush. You won&#x27;t get what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
    <li> When ordering the brush I really thought the brush I was ordering was an authentic Mac brush. Second, I received the item three weeks after ordering it. When I received the brush it turned out to be a knockoff, phoney make-up brush. I thought for the cost the seller was reselling an authentic brush because she did not like it. I bought the brush listed as a \\&quot;new\\&quot; brush. I discovered it was not the real thing when I compared the Mac lettering from the lettering that was on my original Mac brushes and also when all the hairs/bristles came off by the chunks when I was feeling for the texture of bristles (by the way the bristles felt like straw). I just trashed the brush. It&#x27;s a lesson learned! If it sounds to good to be true, it&#x27;s not true.    I personally think it should be against the law to sell and pass off something as authentic. If not, have \\&quot;not authentic\\&quot; listed on the description by the seller.</li>
    <li> its not that the quality is bad its nice and soft, but its NOT a mac brush they sent me a sigma f60 brush and it seemed on the packaging i would get a mac brush because it says MAC 190 FOUNDATION BRUSH! BUT its a freaking sigma! im returning it and just going to the MAC counter to get it. The mac one is waaaaay better DON&#x27;T waste your money on this product just splurge on the brush and go to the counter. Huge DISAPPOINTMENT!! :(((</li>
    <li> This is not a real authentic MAC brush. I compared it to my other MAC brushes that I actually bought in stores and they were nothing alike. These brushes has good quality hair, but the stick fell apart quickly and it wasn&#x27;t authentic.</li>
    <li> This foundation is brush is the best you can buy.  It has soft bristles and a perfectly tapered edge.  It is very well made and will last for years.</li>
    <li> Written by the wife- As a former finger applier of makeup, I can&#x27;t believe how flawless my foundation looks when using this brush! I use less makeup &amp; it looks so much better!  I&#x27;ve not had any bristles fall out or any clumping of makeup in the brush.  I have already recommended it to all my friends!  I would definitely buy this again, and plan to when I wear my current one out.</li>
    <li> My first foundation brush was made by Prescriptives and I had it for almost 15 years!  This is a great brush made by M.A.C. and although a little longer than my Px brush, it gives great application for when I use liquid foundation, concealer or just touching up my makeup without adding more to my face.  Love this &amp; highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this brush before and it lasted me a long time. It&#x27;s definitely a good quality brush for makeup</li>
    <li> I am very upset. I bought a MAC brush that was a fake. It makes me mad that people go outta their way to make fake products and sell them to people. I was so excited for this brush and now I screwed outta my money. Let&#x27;s just saw I am not happy at all!!</li>
    <li> works good, looks nice, does the trick&lt;br /&gt;not as heavy and different bristles than real one but it works as a back up&lt;br /&gt;on the plus side its pretty durable</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. This is the best foundation brush you will ever have.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush and quickly learned knockoffs were being sold. I then cancelled my order within minutes of having placed it but the seller sent the item anyway. When it arrived, I compared it to my genuine MAC brush. The fake&lt;br /&gt; had about half as many bristles, the handle was about an inch shorter, the ferrule was cheaply made, and even the plastic sleeve in which it came was coming apart. The logo was also not even a good copy of MAC&#x27;s. The only good news -- after sending three follow up emails to the seller, this person wrote to tell me I would receive a full refund. Caveat emptor!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It works. Its better then  my other department store brush.</li>
    <li> As an owner of an authentic 190 I can clearly tell that this is an obvious fake. Take note that there&#x27;s no thin plastic sleeve that surrounds that whole brush like a real one, and that the ferrule is flat rather than curved like a real one. Don&#x27;t take any chances.</li>
    <li> Well, maybe, in men&#x27;s eyes, it&#x27;s just a painting brush. Zzzz</li>
    <li> Needed for a theatre make up class. It was the perfect brush. Great brush for blending highlights and shadows. I would definitely recommend plus its cheaper than in store but same quality.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush! It makes my makeup go on evenly and FLAWLESS! I wish I had discovered it sooner!</li>
