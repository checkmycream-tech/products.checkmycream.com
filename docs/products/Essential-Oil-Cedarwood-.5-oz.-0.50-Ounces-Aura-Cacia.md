      <li>The exquisite aroma of true Cedar.  </li>
      <li>Smells wonderful and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>company is very reputable.  </li>
      <li>Better yet, rub some into piece of wood and sniff it.</li>
      <li>a darker aroma of cedarwood , not my favorite .</li>
      <li>The smell was so overwhelming that I had to turn off the diffuser.</li>
      <li>It is ok.</li>
      <li>We feel better when we wake up after using these two oils</li>
      <li>Very nice quality oil, thanks.</li>
      <li>Great product, I purchased 4 bottles and works nice, I put very little on cat and dog and great for jewelry</li>
      <li>High quality at a great price.</li>
      <li>and it smells sweet and nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;m no expert nose, I can&#x27;t wax poetic about its aroma, although it is lovely.  </li>
      <li>It was important for me to use oils that don&#x27;t increase photosensitivity.  </li>
      <li>value, almost too cheap for the quality of this brand</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mixture of natural oils does a good job on repelling mosquitoes, ticks and fleas.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells wonderful and is a high quality essential oil.</li>
      <li>Gave me some unusual and interesting dreams.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-2-3 drops sweet orange&lt;br /&gt;-2-3 drops balsam fir needle</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite wintertime recipes in a diffuser or straight up:&lt;br /&gt;-1-2 drops</li>
      <li>and I put a drop of lavender oil on the mask for sweet dreams.  </li>
      <li>I already own ~30 aura cacia essential oils, the cedarwood addition was a fast new favorite that I love to use in blends.  </li>
      <li>Not the best smell, and it does not last long either.</li>
      <li>It now smells like freshly sawn cedar.</li>
      <li>There is the right amount of cedar oil, but I needed some in a pinch for a project and ordered this for use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-woodsy scent compliments many many combinations, especially ones with other &amp;#34;trees&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-aura cacia brand is great, check out their site and read about their essential oil philosophy</li>
      <li>Very earthy/musty smell, it smells like true cedar,</li>
      <li>Just make sure you use it outside</li>
      <li>It smells more like sandle wood than cedar to me, but I was expecting the cedar smell like the local trees.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>directly supporting aura cacia</li>
      <li>Works for days, not expensive and harmless to us, our pets and the environment.</li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>mix immediately brought the wood back to life: it now had a smoky, woodsy fragrance with a musky note that evoked a certain feminine aroma, making it all the more intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, after adding six drops to a diffuser, I realized how potent this essential oil really was.</li>
      <li>this isn&#x27;t a light cologne sent or something like that, the smell is heavy and thick, great product!</li>
      <li>I wanted the pure oil not the joboba mix.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of cedarwood but really was mostly interested in natural pest repellents for when I&#x27;m outside.  </li>
      <li>and it eliminates odors very well.</li>
      <li>Enjoy some of the same effects of sandalwood oil at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I have to say, this is one of my favorite essential oils in general.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the Young Living one that the other reviewer mentioned, but I&#x27;m interested, if it&#x27;s supposed to smell even better.</li>
      <li>I make a couple of sprays/lotions using this and peppermint oil as the main ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I use this in a diffuser, and it works well and the scent lingers for a decent amount of time.</li>
      <li>What I can do is tell you that when I applied this product to the soles of my feet, I did so expecting a mild psychological grounding effect (the reason it had been recommended to me by a friend).  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend you try some.</li>
      <li>Using this along other essential oils to make my own multi-purpose cleaners, shower cleaner, laundry detergents and fabric softeners.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but the smell is little overwhelming</li>
      <li>After much debate on chemical barriers for insects and dogs, we decided to go natural and stop poisoning our dogs blood.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very surprised, so I looked it up in a book I&#x27;d just received in the mail (Aromatherapy for Healing the Spirit by Gabriel Mojay, which I highly recommend).  </li>
      <li>Instead, I&#x27;ll simply tell you that in my experience, it works, regardless of whether you are anticipating results, which I believe marks this as a high quality oil and speaks very well for the brand.</li>
      <li>I got this to help get the fleas off my dog in a natural way.</li>
      <li>Works good, but too expensive.</li>
      <li>A good everyday scent or when you know you will be working hard and don&#x27;t want a flowery scent.</li>
      <li>For those that are interested, other oils I use in the mixes are clove oil, eucalyptus oil, and thyme oil (sparingly).</li>
      <li>I sent the wrong kind.  </li>

<li> Stinks to high heaven.</li>
<li> /&gt;Add no more than three drops to a diffuser.</li>
<li> After noticing the same results, I did not use either for a couple of days and the snoring was as bad as ever.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Aura Cacia products.</li>
<li> Today, in an apartment the tree is artificial.  </li>
<li> No wonder it smells bad.</li>

    <li> I used this oil to rejuvinate an old cedar wood jewelry box and a little goes a long way. I had plenty left over for future projects. It now smells like freshly sawn cedar.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality oil, thanks.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and arrived quickly. I&#x27;ve also used it around my house (as well as for candles, body products, etc.) and it eliminates odors very well.</li>
    <li> A good everyday scent or when you know you will be working hard and don&#x27;t want a flowery scent.</li>
    <li> Works good, but too expensive.</li>
    <li> Our grandparents used to cut Cedar trees for Christmas...we never had a pine tree...We had the biggest, best Christmases ever because of these two loving grandparents! So..when I smell Cedar....memories come back in droves. Today, in an apartment the tree is artificial.  But I have an oil diffuser that I put Cedar Oil in so I can have a Christmas with Grandma &amp; Grandpa once again,</li>
    <li> After much debate on chemical barriers for insects and dogs, we decided to go natural and stop poisoning our dogs blood.&lt;br /&gt;The mixture of natural oils does a good job on repelling mosquitoes, ticks and fleas.  Works for days, not expensive and harmless to us, our pets and the environment.Highly recommend you try some.</li>

    <li> Smells great! company is very reputable.  price was great too!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of cedarwood but really was mostly interested in natural pest repellents for when I&#x27;m outside.  I make a couple of sprays/lotions using this and peppermint oil as the main ingredients.  They seem to work fairly well.  It was important for me to use oils that don&#x27;t increase photosensitivity.

    <li> a darker aroma of cedarwood , not my favorite .</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good.... it smells earthy (good) but bitter (bad) and nasty.&lt;br /&gt;Did some research and realized it&#x27;s not even part of the cedar family... its a juniper. No wonder it smells bad. Junipers stink!&lt;br /&gt;My family told me it smelled like death.&lt;br /&gt;I have some cedarwood oil from another brand and it smells sweet and nice. So I think I&#x27;ll try and give cedar eo another chance. But not with Aura Cacia! They only carry the Texas cedar (aka juniper) essential oil.</li>
    <li> When I inhaled it directly from the bottle, I initially thought the scent was weak. However, after adding six drops to a diffuser, I realized how potent this essential oil really was. The smell was so overwhelming that I had to turn off the diffuser. In order not to waste it, I took the oil-and-water mix from the diffuser and rubbed it into an old piece of cedar wood that had long lost its fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mix immediately brought the wood back to life: it now had a smoky, woodsy fragrance with a musky note that evoked a certain feminine aroma, making it all the more intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add no more than three drops to a diffuser. Better yet, rub some into piece of wood and sniff it. Cheers.</li>
    <li> it smells like cedar i put it on the cedar blocks i got and put them through out my house smells so good</li>
    <li> Its great!  I use it on my son who is on the ASD spectrum.  I would purchase again.  thank you.</li>
    <li> Very earthy/musty smell, it smells like true cedar, just beware this isn&#x27;t a light cologne sent or something like that, the smell is heavy and thick, great product!</li>
    <li> The exquisite aroma of true Cedar.  Long lasting a few drops on the front edges my sleep mask. Gave me some unusual and interesting dreams. Enjoy some of the same effects of sandalwood oil at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Yep, it smells like Texan cedars, or a barn. In a good way, if you like that sort of thing. I do.</li>
    <li> I sent the wrong kind.  I wanted the pure oil not the joboba mix.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Aura Cacia products. High quality at a great price. THANKS!</li>
    <li> best cedarwood fragrance</li>
    <li> perfect cedarwood scent! i use this in unscented shampoos and conditioners. great deal</li>
    <li> It is ok. Not the best smell, and it does not last long either.Diffusing it hurt my throat. I am using it in carpet freshener (baking soda and EO&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> After reading DIY Household Cleaners, i learned how toxic our regular grocery-store bought cleaners are. Using this along other essential oils to make my own multi-purpose cleaners, shower cleaner, laundry detergents and fabric softeners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful and is a high quality essential oil.</li>
    <li> Great product, I purchased 4 bottles and works nice, I put very little on cat and dog and great for jewelry</li>
    <li> I have to say, this is one of my favorite essential oils in general. I really like the smell of cedar, but all the other ones I&#x27;ve tried simply were missing some element of the scent. They smelled like cedar oil, but not like cedar wood. This one takes the cake for authenticity. I use this in a diffuser, and it works well and the scent lingers for a decent amount of time. I haven&#x27;t tried the Young Living one that the other reviewer mentioned, but I&#x27;m interested, if it&#x27;s supposed to smell even better. Regardless, this gets my praise and recommendation!</li>
    <li> arrived on time, smells just like it should, reminds me of the cedar trees from my childhood. I use it on my cedar Mala during meditations</li>
    <li> I read a review about someone who put this on their feet to help with fluid buildup.  I thought it was doubtful it would help but it couldn&#x27;t hurt either.  After receiving it, I rubbed a few drops on my husband and my feet that night.  We also use sleep masks and I put a drop of lavender oil on the mask for sweet dreams.  I know this will sound weird, but I noticed that my husband snored less that night and he commented to me that I was not snoring at all when he woke up.  After noticing the same results, I did not use either for a couple of days and the snoring was as bad as ever.  When we started the routine again, the snoring was reduced.  We feel better when we wake up after using these two oils so we will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Very good on the dogs and cats with fleas problem</li>
    <li> The size is as listed, and the bottle is labeled and sized as pictured. There is the right amount of cedar oil, but I needed some in a pinch for a project and ordered this for use. It smells more like sandle wood than cedar to me, but I was expecting the cedar smell like the local trees. This looks like it is from Texas and that is about 1000 miles away from &amp;#34;local&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Stinks to high heaven.</li>
    <li> like the oil but the smell is little overwhelming</li>
    <li> I got this to help get the fleas off my dog in a natural way. The fleas don&#x27;t like this so it worked great. Just make sure you use it outside cause the fleas will jump off. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am in the process of learning about the use of essential oils, so let me state up front that I&#x27;m no expert.  I can&#x27;t take a sniff and tell you about purity.  What I can do is tell you that when I applied this product to the soles of my feet, I did so expecting a mild psychological grounding effect (the reason it had been recommended to me by a friend).  What happened was that the water retention and bloating I&#x27;d been experiencing for months cleared within 24 hours.  I went down two notches on my bra band and one notch on my belt.  I was very surprised, so I looked it up in a book I&#x27;d just received in the mail (Aromatherapy for Healing the Spirit by Gabriel Mojay, which I highly recommend).  Cedarwood is used to encourage lymphatic drainage and the breakdown of accumulated fats, as well as to combat fluid retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I guess the cedarwood knew its business even if I didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m no expert nose, I can&#x27;t wax poetic about its aroma, although it is lovely.  Instead, I&#x27;ll simply tell you that in my experience, it works, regardless of whether you are anticipating results, which I believe marks this as a high quality oil and speaks very well for the brand.</li>
