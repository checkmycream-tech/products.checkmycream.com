    <li> Smells great - just like original Old Spice !</li>
    <li> I literally cannot keep my hands off my husband when he smells like Old Spice Classic. It&#x27;s crazy! haha It&#x27;s always been my absolute favorite scent, and I hate cologne. (There is no greater travesty than the entire line of Axe products. That stuff is gross.) I realize this sounds like a cheap sex ad, hahaha, but really, like the bottle says, if your grandfather hadn&#x27;t worn it, you wouldn&#x27;t have been born!</li>
    <li> After having received my shipment of this product I discovered to my dismay that it contains both sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate both of which have been found to have possible connections to numerous health issues for some people. It would have been better if Amazon would have seen fit to let the customer be aware of what is contained in this product instead of omitting that information. One would like to think that people do have a right to know what is inside the products that they purchase from Amazon such as body washes and shampoos.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this wash. Wish it was still available in stores. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this scent but we can never find it in the store, he will be so surprised to see it at Christmas!</li>
    <li> I love the spicy, manly smell of this.  Old Spice needs to market it again.  Hubby was glad I found it.  Now if I only could find the soap on a rope!</li>
    <li> I have always liked Old Spice as a fragrance, even though P&amp;G tweaked the original scent a little bit. My problem is, I can&#x27;t find this particular scent in my local stores, so I ordered two bottles; that way my supply will last a little longer.</li>
    <li> I am sorry that they decided to stop making this - almost as much as I was sorry they stopped making the body wash hair cleaner shave jell version - too bad they will no longer make this either - the new scents - STINK - hell their new version of the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; is nothing to write home about - why couldn&#x27;t they leave a good thing alone - very disappointed, but I will grab up every case of this I can while its available.</li>
    <li> One of the few products my husband uses that doesn&#x27;t trigger a scent-induced migraine!  He likes it, too!</li>
    <li> Everything was good except for the cost of shipping my order.</li>
    <li> Gift for son in law. Great gift..WONDERFUL SCENT..Ya gotta love &amp;#34;OLD SPICE&amp;#34;. Very gentle and makes your man smell like a MAN!</li>
    <li> They have a slogan saying something like had your grandpa not worn it you wouldn&#x27;t be around. I think that is hilarious and yet probably very true haha.  This smell is very classic and manly.  In an age with all the different scents you just cannot beat the spicey manly smell of Old Spice Classic.  This smells great to me and more importantly my wife really loves it. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles of this because it is hard to find in stores.  It is a true Old Spice smell- not the new sport versions.  Im 33, but love this classis smell- in fact I use deoderant and aftershave from old spice.  MAKE SURE IT SAYS \\&quot;CLASSIC\\&quot; ANYTHING ELSE WONT SMELL LIKE TRADITIONAL OLD SPICE When you get close to someone and they catch a whiff you see them trying to place the smell and how it brings them back.  I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it makes me feel like putting on any other scent is not as manly.  My kids have their own little bottles and we all put on aftershave at night.  My wife says we smell like old men, but she cant stop snuggling up and catching a hit of the smell.  If you are insane you can also try Head &amp; Shoulders Old Spice classic scent- I have only found it at Walmart, but it lasts forever and isnt overpowering just ads to the greatness of the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0017WNFXE Old Spice Classic Deodorant , Original Scent, 3.25-Ounces (Pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00187PWDY Old Spice Classic After Shave, 4.25 Ounce]].</li>
    <li> I received this about 2 days after I ordered it and everything was intact with the bottle it came in and it is a really good sized bottle well worth the money</li>
    <li> I love it... I love the fragrance although I think it doesnt last that much...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I will continue buying this body wash... Im waiting to try other references</li>
