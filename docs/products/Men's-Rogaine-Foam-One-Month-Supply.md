<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> helps to retain hair loss. great price</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended me this product two years ago for my hair loss, and since then I keep using it and recovered all my hair again (I&#x27;m also taking some pills for the hairloss). Honestly is the best one I&#x27;ve tried in comparison with the other products who also has minoxidil as its main formula. This is neither greasy nor messy. It actually leaves my hair like I&#x27;m not using nothing at all, so I actually can use it every day without worrying.</li>
    <li> Works for me. Noticed tiny hairs about three weeks of use. Smells though.</li>
    <li> Much better smell than the generic and less gunky feeling.</li>
    <li> My frontal area is getting thinner and thinner... thought I&#x27;d give it a shot (why not?)  It&#x27;s pretty expensive and I know the product isn&#x27;t designed for frontal area loss.. BUT... it&#x27;s month 2 and my hair seeeems to be stopped as far as loss... and I did notice I had some light hair coming in places it wasn&#x27;t...so there is hope.  I&#x27;ve heard this takes a LONG time to see results so there&#x27;s no harm in trying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the product though does make my hair look thinner than it already is...so generally I apply it as soon as I get home...and then another time before bed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if all fails I&#x27;ll just shave it all off... been thinking about doing that anyway :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 and had always had really thick hair. About 5-7 years ago it started thinning and I went to a doctor who told me I was worrying about nothing, some thinning was natural and with hair as thick as mine I had nothing to worry about. Two more years pass and I&#x27;m really starting to see it in my hairline, and worse, it&#x27;s uneven -- the left side is starting to thin and recede noticeably, the right side not so much. Instead of the Jude Law -- the classic widow&#x27;s peak -- I look more like a prank victim with one side shaved. So I switch the side I&#x27;m parting it on, cut it shorter and do the spiky, cover it up thing. I also went to another doctor who prescribed Propecia, which I&#x27;ve been taking ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Propecia was good for stopping / reversing loss on the rest of my head, but the hairline continued to get slowly worse. I&#x27;d checked out Rogaine but found very conflicting claims as to whether or not it would work on the frontal hairline. Last year -- actually 14 months ago -- I decided what the heck, it&#x27;s only $40 or something, might was well try it. From other reviews on here I expected it would take a while to see results so I decided I would give it one year. Now that I&#x27;m just past the year I figured I&#x27;d come on here and share my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s been great. It took quite a while to see anything significant. Early on I saw some wispy hairs growing in but for probably six months the changes were minimal. I stuck with it very religiously, applying each morning and night without fail. I&#x27;d guess that in a year I probably skipped applying it no more than a dozen times. I took pix along the way so I could track for myself whether or not it was working and I put one from the start and one from an hour ago below. They&#x27;re both shot at the same angle, showing the side where the loss was greatest. What you can&#x27;t really see from it is that the entire hair line thickened quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t regrown my teenage hairline and didn&#x27;t expect to. But for the minimal cost and inconvenience of rubbing the stuff in, I&#x27;m thrilled with the results. A few things I&#x27;ve found are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Since I&#x27;m only applying it on the front it lasts me way longer than stated. I just placed my third order so basically I&#x27;m getting six months out of a pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It would last longer than that but when you get to around 1/4 - 1/3 of the can it starts to get thick and greasy. For the first 2/3 of a can it comes out very light and goes in without feeling sticky or making your hair seem damp. That last third of the bottle looks like you&#x27;re applying vaseline. At first I figured I&#x27;d save the ends for the night time application when nobody but my wife is seeing it, then I figured for the cost of a cup of Starbucks forget it. So I chuck the last third of each can. Don&#x27;t know if another brand would prove better in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Don&#x27;t understand any complaints about smell. If it has one my wife and I can&#x27;t detect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line for me is that I was really unhappy that the awkward hair line I had developed had totally limited how I could style my hair and I didn&#x27;t like the way I looked in pictures. 14 months in I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results so far. With all the research going into hair loss there will probably be something in 5 or 10 years that works much better and when that day comes I won&#x27;t have done something drastic and irreversible -- like a hair transplant. I&#x27;ve had friends with worse hair loss comment on how lucky I am that I haven&#x27;t lost mine and I always tell them what I&#x27;m doing and recommend they give it a shot. If you&#x27;re reading this then you&#x27;re considering it and I&#x27;d give the same advice. It might not work for you, but for minimal cost and effort what&#x27;s to lose?ct to.

    <li> I have been using rogaine for last 3-4 months.  I haven&#x27;t seen any significant regrowth in my receding hairline.  We shall see what happens</li>
    <li> Rogaine certainly doesn&#x27;t make any false claims. The instructions tell you right up front what the product can and cannot do. It claims that is not  for a receding hairline. I did not realize this until after I purchased it. So  - what the heck I got it now -I might as well try. First of all - the skinny little cannisters really do give you a months worth of applications. My hair was quickly thinning at the front - I was being left with a  &amp;#34;soul patch&amp;#34; on my forehead. Its been about 4 weeks and the hair loss seems to have been halted. I do see some fine hairs growing in and an overall thickness to my &amp;#34;soul patch&amp;#34; which appears to be rejoining the rest of my head. Is it just summertime growth ? is it Rogaine ? Heck I don&#x27;t know - but it sure seems to be helping. After I get a haircut maybe I&#x27;ll see how the next month works out.</li>
    <li> I have cardiovascular disease and the instructions printed on this packaging state that you should NOT use it if you have this type of condition.  What Amazon.com failed to do is to inform potential buyers in LARGE and BOLD letters that this product is NON-RETURNABLE to Amazon.com.  GRRRRRRRRRRRR...so, not only am I not able to use the product, but due to it&#x27;s potentially hazardous nature, it&#x27;s probably unwise to use it as a $47 paperweight.  Although Amazon.com is one of my favorite purchasing places, it always, always pays to do your due diligence.  Additionally, if you review the details provided by Amazon.com in the product description, you will fail to find ANY listed medical contraindications for the use of this product.  GO AMAZON.COM....I will be happy to write more valid and correct copy for you any day...just say the word!</li>
    <li> The real deal!  I only use this stuff and have for YEARS.  I think it works and so does my doctor.</li>
    <li> I started using this as an 18 year old who noticed thinning in the crown area. It wasn&#x27;t to the point of being highly noticeable by anyone--just slightly thin if I ran my hand through it. Still, I thought Rogaine would be a good option to reverse my thinning and preempt further loss.&lt;br /&gt;So I applied it religiously for four months. What made me stop? After months 3 or 4 I practically had a reverse yamakah! I&#x27;d say the crown area had 30 to 40% of the hair a full, healthy head would have. Now, I know that supposedly there is an initial shedding phase with Rogaine and then hair grows back, but I had already reached the 4 month mark where regrowth should be apparent, yet it wasn&#x27;t. How much longer was I going to apply this chemical concoction to my hair hoping its effects do a complete about-face and actually start regrowing my hair? So I stopped. Now a year later, my crown is still just as thin as when I threw out the Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned: think before you gamble on things like this.</li>
    <li> I am a 44 year old woman who has been experiencing slightly thinning hair since age 39. I went to the dermatologist and had blood work done for my thyroid, hormones, and later a scalp biopsy. The blood work was normal. The diagnosis from the biopsy was androgenic alopecia or what my dermatologist said was hair shedding due to the hormonal changes that come with age. If you google this you&#x27;ll get a lot of information, much of it contradictory and negative. I should state, my shedding was not visible to anyone but me, but it was an increased thinning. I&#x27;d wash and blow dry my hair, look down to the floor and the tears would start flowing. The dermatologist prescribed men&#x27;s Rogaine foam, applied once a day at night before bed. At two months I experienced a slightly increased shed which admittedly freaked me out! After some research, I found this is normal and decided to stick with it. Now, at four months, the shedding has decreased substantially. From what I understand, the product can take up to 6-12 months to show hair reversal, ie. new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also take Elon Matrix 5000 a hair vitamin (not overloaded with stuff, just biotin, silicon, and L-Cysteine) and I also take Nature&#x27;s Way MSM - one tablet a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair thinning for women can be devastating. I normally wear my hair short. However, in a fit of anxiety, at that two month mark I had my hair cut to a Caesar just to prepare myself for what I thought was the inevitable. Needless to say, now that my hair shed has decreased and my hair is growing in nicely, I have only one thing to say - this is treatable and reversible - BUT YOU MUST BE PATIENT and willing to experiment with treatments and/or supplements etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying this, give it time to work and be consistent. Note: using excess product will not improve the results. Also, because this is a foam, it is important to try to get it on the scalp and not in the hair. Applying the foam to cold fingers will prevent the foam from melting/softening in your hands before you get to apply it.</li>
    <li> It goes on easy ,But does do nothing after 4 months of use. They say %85 of men grew hair . I don&#x27;t believe it. Or maybe little tiny baby hair that falls out when you stop using.</li>
    <li> Works well - I needed to use it for awhile before I saw results but I did see results - thicker hair and less hair loss.</li>
    <li> Rogaine has been around for years and I was surprised to hear my doctor recommend it. You have to use this product twice a day for at least four months for it to work. People around might think your darkening or coloring your hair. Rogaine doesn&#x27;t create miracles but it does make a difference you will see. I recommend it for all young me who&#x27;s hair is starting to loose their hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Walgreen minox 5% for the past Decade or more. It&#x27;s the closest to the true Rogaine 5% formula that I have found. I have also tried Costcos kirkland, but found that it didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s the difference in the inactive ingredients, hence why kirkland brand is so cheap. I&#x27;m not saying kirklands doesn&#x27;t work, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Try it, if it works for you, great. However, Walgreen discontinued it&#x27;s liquid form so in search of another substitute, I tried foam for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I don&#x27;t use it on the vertex, I use it on my receding hairline Norwood scale 1 (but still counts as a recession). Rogaine worked for me in that it stopped a lot of the shedding during showering. I notice a lot less hair falling out when I wash my hair after I have use it consistently for about a month or two. (It&#x27;s very obvious and it&#x27;s not just nonsense about you shed \\&quot;X\\&quot; number of follicles a day). When you shower at the same time each day, you should notice the same amount of hair falling out. In my case, when I stop using rogaine, I notice at least 20 hair strands fall out during my showers. When I use Rogaine consistently for about a month or two, the number of follicles drop to 2 or 3. YES, It&#x27;s THAT noticeable. You will notice it will be working (if it works for you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also notice this change if I get lazy and stop using it consistently, after about a month or two I start shedding again. Second, when I use the product for a while, there&#x27;s definitely growth and I can see my hairline, instead of a recession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also take propecia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine Foam is absolutely hands down the best applicator product. Backup a moment, I tried foam once before, but at that time I was using the liquid version actively. The liquid version flakes ALOT, and makes your skin red and irritated. When I used the foam, i felt some pain, so I stopped using the foam. What I realized now, is that it was the liquids fault not the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of Foam:&lt;br /&gt;It does not flake/peel my skin at all&lt;br /&gt;It does not irritate / redness / rash&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply on the frontal lobe/forehead - It does stick to hair, so I read a review that if you are applying to spots that have lots of hair strands like the vertex, it would be a little hard trying to press it onto the scalp i guess.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s QUICK DRYING! - Liquid version drops will streak down your forehead, doesn&#x27;t dry quickly, and if you sleep right before bed or wash your face, or wipe your head, it will most likely wipe off all medicine as well. Foam dries within a minute and it&#x27;s not runny.&lt;br /&gt;Foam Price is the same as liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... hands down, my recommendation is try foam first, then liquid etc etc... And don&#x27;t expect hair to grow fast... its really really slow. But again try to notice the difference of Shedding when you shower to see if it is working.</li>
    <li> Been taking for years, no major growth. It has stopped my hairless from progressing.</li>
    <li> Belive it,this product is total crap used it as adviced for two months now and not a single percent change.I usualy dont review Bad for products,but this product really made me to.Dont buy it....</li>
    <li> The oil makes more of a difference than the foam.  Confirmed.  For me at least.</li>
    <li> Works well after 4-6 weeks of application.  As the bottle empties, it leaves a filmy residue on hair.  Bottle lasts longer than one month for me compared to manufacturer&#x27;s label</li>
    <li> I like this product,  but wish you didn&#x27;t  have to put it on in the morning which makes your hair look greasy.  If it couild be applied just at night , no one would notice  it emphasizes  your  bald spot during the day. .  Any suggestions from just night time users.</li>
    <li> Helps eighty percent of the time even if its just a little bit and smells good too.</li>
    <li> This seller was awesome! I got the product fast and it was exactly as described. I highly recommend this seller</li>
    <li> I have used for the past 6-7 months. For the most part it thickens and I have noticed regrowth in some areas. However these are on the crown and my receding hairline. The only thing is, it slightly grows so you can see very minor growth but nothing ever really comes from it. On the crown of my head I have had a bald spot and only in a very specific area did hair growth occur. Other then that I have noticed increase in thickness and growth in the places I already have hair. If you are in the very early stages of hair loss, I think it would be much more effective. However if you are quite away into it, may be better to look at some other options.</li>
    <li> I am hoping this will control my hair fall one day. Waiting for that day</li>
    <li> After a few weeks my head became very itchy and red and scaly I will let nature do it&#x27;s thing I guess</li>
    <li> When it does come down to men, we all intentionally lose our hair from thinning or from stress. But for those of us whom are looking for a great and simple way to deal with hair loss, they can turn to Rogaine. For simplier methods in Rogaine, they can turn to Rogaine Foam, specialty made for men. I like it because it is simple to use on the scalp and works very well at regrowing hair, and using it is just a breeze. A little dab on the scalp is all you need, twice a day, and it works in just a matter of time, in almost all men. I like it a whole lot, because it did a great job on my thinning hair, and is well worth the money that was spent on. So, if you are looking for a great hair aid, Rogaine Foam is definitely worth the money spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: B+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convience: B+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: B+</li>
    <li> noticeably decreased hair loss</li>
    <li> My husband has been using rogaine foam for 3 months. We have seen a little hair growth. I ordered 3 more months supply to give it the full 6 months rogaine recomends. I also just ordered the progaine shampoo. Hopefully he will see some major hair growth in the next 3 months. Fast Shipping !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a steadily receding hairline since age 22.  I&#x27;m 31 now.  I started to use Propecia three years ago, which slowed the progression and allowed me to grow some back, but ultimately proved to be just delaying the inevitable.  I started using Rogaine Foam two months ago, after I gave up trying to use liquid Rogaine years ago because I found it too cumbersome to work with and it dripped into my face.  All I can say is wow.  In two months, I&#x27;ve had hair coming back on my head in places that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was a teenager.  It&#x27;s steadily getting thicker and darker too (though I have some thinner, paler, vellus hair on the sides still).  I have enough now that I actually have to be concerned about styling it every morning for the first time in years.  This is all after only two months, which supposedly isn&#x27;t even very long into Rogaine&#x27;s full effectiveness.  And, as I get more hair and grow it longer, I have more options to style and cut it.    In short, Rogaine does work on receding hairlines and frontal hair loss, no matter what they say.  For the sake of disclosure, I still use Propecia as well, plus Nizoral,  but I&#x27;ve seen results from Rogaine very quickly and dramatically in my case.    The stuff does have a bit of a sweetish smell to it that I find a little distracting, sort of like hairspray but stronger.  It also leaves my hair where I use it a bit stiffer and clumpier.  But it is much easier to work with than the old liquid Rogaine, and supposedly it&#x27;s more effective as well.  You have to use it twice a day (I do morning and night), and you&#x27;re not supposed to wash it out until it&#x27;s been able to sit for at least four hours.  I recommend letting it dry, then styling or fluffing afterwards with a comb.  Takes a little extra bit of time in the morning, but the results are well worth it!</li>
    <li> I used this for about 4 years and it did a pretty good job of holding off the baldness but eventually my scalp refused to give up and won.  Guess I&#x27;m just destined to be bald.  At least I got a hot wife before I lost all my hair!</li>
    <li> This really worked for me, and is much better than the goopy, irritating original version. But Target&#x27;s $16.00 generic works just as well for me at regrowing hair and is not irritating at all. On the downside, it does not have the mousse effect this product has, which I like. But it&#x27;s 1/3 the price. For those who found the original too irritating and gross, know that there is a cheaper alternative to this stuff that is almost as good.</li>
    <li> I do see slight improvement in my hair falling after 3 months. However there are occasion when my hair start falling for many days and it doesn&#x27;t seems to help.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews.  I started using this October 3, 2010.  I decided to give it the 3 month run.  I was hoping I did not fall into the 15% of not working.    This product is great.  I actually did not look for the entire 3 months.  However, my wife did.  She said \\&quot;It is working\\&quot; but I waited.  Jan 3rd, 2011, I looked.....   It works.  Round hairless area, hair.  Not full, but not skin.  Now (Feb 23, 2011) 90% hair.  I am impressed.    Do it twice a day and you should see results.  Take a before and after picture for comparison.  I didn&#x27;t, which was my mistake.  But I did look in October and then in January.  Just wow (I am 45 yrs old).    I am now using it in areas not recommended (non-crown areas, read the instructions).  It works there also, if my using a mirror looking at a side view (forehead/temple) does not deceive (it doesn&#x27;t).    Use after the morning shower, prior to blow/air drying.  Use in the evening after getting home for the aroma to subside.  Not bad, but noticeable after applying.  It does subside.    It is similar to moose/styling gel (plus the aroma), so be sure to plan your application.  It is not that bad, but YOU will be aware of it.    Also, use just a small (1/2 a cap) application, as directed.  It goes a long way. Use it like moose and it is wasted.    That said, I bought a second round.    Lonnie</li>
    <li> Excellent job and shipping on timE</li>
    <li> Quite good for the application</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Minoxidil products since a couple of years. It&#x27;s giving me very good results on my forehead as long as I keep using it. Hair thinning in case is non hereditary. The doctor said that in my age (20s) it happens that hair sheds and becomes thin for some people. I understood after doing some research that it&#x27;s something related to the excretion of a hormone named testosterone, it prevents the hair from growing normally. Doing sports helps in solving this hormonal issue, in addition to taking minoxidil products like Rogaine. I started using the Rogaine foam a month ago and it seems as effective as some other products (except that it doesn&#x27;t create dandruff like some products do) The foam is very easy and quick to apply directly on the hair. It&#x27;s just excellent!</li>
    <li> First off, Rogaine will NOT stop hair loss! So don&#x27;t believe the reviewers who said \\&quot;Rogaine stopped my hair loss!\\&quot;. Whether you are a man or woman, have full set of hair or thinning hair, use Rogaine or not, you WILL loss hair! That&#x27;s how \\&quot;God\\&quot;/\\&quot;Evolution\\&quot; programmed us humans. It&#x27;s just that as you get older, your hair follicles get smaller to the point that hair no longer grow back (for some people). That&#x27;s where Rogaine comes in. It will (for some people) revitalize the hair follicles and make them grow back hair again. So does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, YES! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and see hair growing back! I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and noticed my hair get thinner, I can see bald spots on some places but it&#x27;s still in early stage. So I decided to try Rogaine. I use both liquid type (I use generic store brand for that, like a CVS brand) and foam type (I use Rogain foam). When I first applied, my scalp felt &#x27;tingy&#x27; like my head got sunburned but after few more application, it went away. Also, I sometimes get flakes and itches, maybe once a week, but I use Selsun Blue and that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply Rogaine all over my scalp, twice a day. In the instruction, it says it doesn&#x27;t work on front of scalp, but guess what? It does because I can see hair growing in front! But like many reviewers said, you got to be patient, it WILL take awhile to grow - my \\&quot;rogained\\&quot; hair is still about 1/2 inch high and looks like newborn baby hair. I also noticed that my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair look healthier and grow faster than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4-star? Other than occasional flakes and itches, you&#x27;ve got to use Rogaine forever if you wanna keep your \\&quot;Rogained\\&quot; hair! (i.e. it will cost you money) I also don&#x27;t like the fact that my hair feel \\&quot;hard\\&quot; and \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; (like I put gel on it) after I use Rogaine (especially when I use the liquid form). But other than that, so far so good for me. I will update to see how things turn out in a long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are consider buying Rogaine, I highly recommend you try it! I know there are lots of &#x27;warnings&#x27; listed on the package that might scare you off, but the manufacturer HAS to put the warnings even if there&#x27;s 0.001% chance that might affect you - after all Rogaine is a medicine! If Rogaine doesn&#x27;t regrow hair, you can just stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a psychological level, I feel a lot more confident and happier after I use and see that Rogaine is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a separate note, if you are worried about hair loss, having stress-free lifestyle and eating healthy and doing exercises might help combat hair loss (although they will not stop). I eat healthy and workout regularly but I notice that few days after having stressful event(s) (i.e. work pressure, relationship issues, lack of sleep, etc...) I lose more hair than usual. It might be coincidence but it&#x27;s something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope Rogaine will work for you too! Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/28/11: It&#x27;s been a little over 2 months since I started using rogaine. My hair looks fuller! Now, I can&#x27;t say for certain that my hair looks fuller because of rogaine or just because my \\&quot;real\\&quot; hair got longer (thus giving the impression that my hair is fuller...), but I can say for certain that bald spots are getting smaller though they are still noticeable. Also my &#x27;real&#x27; hair is getting longer quicker. My &#x27;rogained&#x27; hair is still short but noticed more &#x27;rogained&#x27; hair growing in different parts of scalp. I&#x27;ll take it as a good sign tho it&#x27;s still work in progress. We&#x27;ll see...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 01/30/12: It&#x27;s about 3 months since I started using Rogaine and like many reviewers said, I see the most improvement this month! My hair is definitely getting fuller, notice less hair falling out, and my bald spots are getting much smaller (some places, the spots are gone!). What amazes me the most is how fast my existing hair grows! I feel/look like when I was in my 20s again! But what still bothers me about Rogaine is the flakes!!! It doesn&#x27;t happen everyday but it happens 3-4 times a week and it&#x27;s annoying! but it&#x27;s still not a big issue for me to stop using Rogaine. I will continue to use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 03/09/12: I continue to use it twice a day. And yes, my hair is getting fuller and fuller! Most of my bald spots are gone! I mostly use the liquid version and when I use it, I get scaly scalp. I use the foam version when I don&#x27;t have time for the scalp to get dry and the foam version definitely stops flaky scalp! So, if you got money to \\&quot;burn\\&quot; I suggest you use the foam version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 04/15/12: Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination, but this month I didn&#x27;t notice that much hair growth. Rather, I notice more hair falling than usual! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not like hair fell in bunch or so much to cause alarm it&#x27;s just that compare to last few months, I see (or think I see) more hair falling. I&#x27;m not sure if the hair loss is due to decrease in Rogaine&#x27;s effectiveness or it&#x27;s just the \\&quot;natural cycle\\&quot; of hair growth, or maybe stress related? I&#x27;m sure hair will grow back again (I hope). We&#x27;ll see...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 05/08/12: No significant change this month. My hair still looks full and minimal appearance of bald spots. BUT, I don&#x27;t think Rogaine is as effective as it was few months ago. I still have quarter size bald spots on left side of back of my head and top of my head, I don&#x27;t think they will fully disappear but other than that, my hair looks fuller and longer. As for the hair loss issue I experienced last month, I still have days when my hair falls more than usual (I know this because some days when I wash my hair or comb my hair, I see more hair falling) but most of the time, hair loss is kept under control. I read somewhere that hair \\&quot;shed\\&quot; naturally during seasonal change so since this time of the year (Mar-June) is considered transitional stage from winter/spring to summer, I see more hair \\&quot;shed\\&quot; this time of the year? Who knows.</li>
    <li> Bought out a good price and shipped promptly. Will continue to buy this way. I just wish I knew with a high level of certainty whether it works or not since I also take Propecia.</li>
    <li> I got very impatient with this product because I used it for a year before I noticed anything but I am very glad that I was patient and kept trying. My hairdresser even commented on my new found thickness which made me happy. This beats any surgery that costs thousands of dollars and a long recovery time. I am very glad I tried this product out.</li>
    <li> The rogaine has improved my hair after almost a month of using the product my only complaint is that one of the cans was liquid not foam. Another thing to add is that its pretty expensive compared to some other products which I saw was cheaper I will continue to use this instead of having a hair transplant since its too expensive. Just hoped that this product would fix areas with complete baldness where no hair had grown for years.</li>
    <li> I have been on Rogaine since I was about 19. I still have my hair and I am 31 years old now. It works great for the top or temple of the head. However, if you&#x27;re looking for something that is going to fix that receeding hairline.... the only thing that&#x27;s going to work is a transplant.</li>
    <li> as many of you may know, I am a Native Armenian.  In our culture we value hair all over our bodies.  Unfortunately, I was unable to get hair to grow on my back and buttocks - that is until I found Rogaine.  Now I have a healthy hair look that is the envy of my Armenian neighbors when I go to the pool.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve used the eye dropper bottles. It measures out a precise amount of liquid and you smear it on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently decided to give the foam a try thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be as runny and you can just spray out a little on your head and be done with it. But it doesn&#x27;t work that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the directions say to spray out a \\&quot;half a cap full\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t say where to spray it. I&#x27;m assuming they meant spray it in your hand. So that&#x27;s what I do. I mean, I&#x27;d love to spray on my head but I can&#x27;t see whether I&#x27;m using a half a cap full if I do that. Second of all, that&#x27;s not very precise. \\&quot;Half a cap full?\\&quot; Really?&lt;br /&gt;Then I massage it in as it says to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t get it. I thought the point of the foam was to make less icky mess. But you have to spray it in your hand (I guess) then massage it with fingers anyway. You really don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re using too much or too little. I don&#x27;t see what the benefit to the foam is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to make matters worse, on more than one occasion, I missed a spot and left a little of the foam on top of my hair and someone pointed out, \\&quot; Hey you have some white schtuff on your head\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Oh thanks pal, that&#x27;s just my rogaine foam that now everyone in the entire room knows I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about the product and this is also true of the eye-dropper bottled monoxidil products is that it attracts flies to your head. If you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time outdoors when the flies are out, I&#x27;d skip it. And I&#x27;m not just talking about a fly here or there. I&#x27;m talking swarms of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably be going back to the eye dropper bottles.</li>
    <li> It has stopped my hair loss and increased volume over a four month period of use. Not a miracle worker but a good product for the money. IMO it will not bring all of you hair loss back but provide a supplement like hair product feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cheers</li>
    <li> It really works...i dont know if it would work for any one but it definitely worked for me. I heard you have too keep using it in order to maintain the results, so what i do now is I use it once a day so this package of 3 containers can last about 6 months which is not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> My fiance has been using this for over a year, and his hair seems to be falling out faster!  AND, I know he uses it as directed.</li>
    <li> Stop wasting your money you are bald</li>
    <li> Its hard to tell if it works because you can&#x27;t compare it to your hair without it once you start using. Also, at the end of the bottle the foam starts becoming more of a liquid that runs down your face before you have time to rub it in.</li>
    <li> I did see some decent hair growth with this, so it did work as expected, However, it didn’t do much in terms of making my hair thicker and stronger. I found a product called Mynoxidrin [[ASIN:B00Q5KMX5O Mynoxidrin - Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Formula Nourishes and Strengthens Thinning Hair and Promotes Hair Growth!]] which helped regrow hair just as well, but also made it REALLY thick and strong. I really like it. Both good products but I am sticking with mynoxidrin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great in so many ways.</li>
    <li> it slowed it down for me.</li>
    <li> After doing my research and asking my ex bald friend how comes he wasn&#x27;t bald anymore lol, he told me has been using Rogaine twice a day for a year, well I immediately purchased my first rogain from Ebay and insisted to use it, well the rogain was in the bathroom cabinet for a year!!! I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t expired until my hubby decided to use it and voila 4 and a half years later his hair has grown back but mainly on his crown and the hair loss has slowed down over all. I usually buy it from Walmart or Costco or any chain supermarket.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and undamaged. Exactly as advertised. Foam is so much better in every way than original</li>
    <li> It may help your hair grow back, but the side effects are noticeable and they are scary.</li>
    <li> 1.I bought this product after a friend recommended it to me because it worked for him, so I started using it one month ago and it looks like it is starting to work.  2. Now I&#x27;m writing this review about 3 months later of the 1st one, I can see the difference in my hair and its definitely working for me, yes it takes time and its relatively slow, but it works. consistency in using the product is very important to see the results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recall any problems with this seller, I believe the transaction was perfectly smooth as I expected. In short, rogaine foam has worked great for me and very quickly. I noticed my hair growing thicker and healthier within just a few weeks and shortly after that (maybe six weeks?) I noticed baby hairs forming. After two months my hairline had lowered about a centimeter which IMO is very drastic. I highly recommend any 5% minoxidil product for anyone who is considering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now for the unabridged review...&lt;br /&gt;About me: I noticed my hairline receding around 16 and pretty much went directly into denial about it. My family has a history on of baldness in all of the men. When I started about four months ago my hair was very thin all over my crown. I was beginning to see my scalp all over the top. My temple&#x27;s had no hair on them and I was developing the classic widow&#x27;s peak look. I didn&#x27;t mind my receding hairline until this past year because it was so gradual. since 2010 my hair started falling out very very rapidly and I new I had to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around  the age of 20 I started taking finasteride every other day that was prescribed from my doctor. He recommended using rogaine along with it but I decided against it because of price and hassle associated with using something everyday forever. The fin&#x27; didn&#x27;t seem to ever do anything and by 21 years of age my hair was steadily getting worse and the shedding was getting more and more severe. I could scratch my head and see hairs falling out. It was very depressing and embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I bought this rogaine foam. It&#x27;s cheapest here on amazon I checked all over the place and this was the best option for me. I continued the finasteride and started the foam. I took picture for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 4 months since I first started. I didn&#x27;t have any side effects other than a little bit of soreness at first similar to a sunburn. I am very fair-skined and usually have skin irritations easily so this surprised me that I had so little of side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the product as directed and my hair started looking thicker within just 2 or 3 weeks. by a month or two my hair was clearly beginning to grow back around my temples and my scalp began to disappear under my hair which was clearly thickening. Even my girlfriend (who was skeptical from the beginning) started to notice the growth. I started using it after showering because I had heard that this enhances absorption. I remember about two months ago my hair completely stopped shedding... meaning no more hair in the shower drain and no more hair floating off my head when I scratched it. I also noticed that my hair on my crown was growing at the same speed as all the rest of my hair which is much better than the &#x27;clown-hair&#x27; look I was sporting in years past with the sides of my head growing faster than the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around two and a half months I started to be inconsistent with the applications using it just once a day or every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything was going great until about three months in when my results seemed to taper off and the shedding started all over again. I have started using it twice to three times daily on a dry scalp which is how the directions recommend it. I think that the decline in results is from my inconsistency in using the product and possibly from using it on a wet scalp which may actually hinder the performance of the minoxidil...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using minoxidil for the next few years most likely and will repost a new reviews if my hair starts shedding again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other facts I would like to note is that the foam itself seems to make my hair look and feel thicker almost like a styling gel. I did notice a possible increase of shedding in the beginning but this was followed by a clear increase in growth which undid that initial damage. Liquid minoxidil products make my hair look thin after application and are messy andnever dry. I do use a liquid off-brand 5% minoxidil at night along with the rogaine foam sometimes b/c I don&#x27;t care what I look like when I go to bed and I want to spread out the cost. I am now considering just using the foam and not using the liquid to improve results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product. I would have given it five stars 3 months ago had my hair not started to shed a little bit again. I give it four to four-and-a-half stars. In my opinion,there&#x27;s definitely nothing else out right now that I would trust more than rogaine foam to REGROW hair.</li>
    <li> There is no question Rogaine works, but a) you need to start using it before you lose your hair; and, b) you need to stick with it --- twice a day.   About six months into using it, I had a very itchy scalp, obviously my scalp was reacting to it, perhaps drying out -- I don&#x27;t know -- but I stuck with it, and managed to get through that spell of irritation -- lasted about a month. I have been using Rogaine for about eight years now, no problems; and, definitely works. And, without question, best prices on Amazon. Drugstore prices are insane.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for about three months now. I started using it on my temples and have had great results. I have recently started using it on the top of my scalp and my receding hairline. Though not clinically tested for either of these areas this is where my hair loss is. What else can I say plain and simple other than... it works.</li>
    <li> Ater 8 months of usting rogaine, my hair is still falling, however looks better, fuller and thicker. Over all I was expecting more about this product.</li>
    <li> I just finished a 5 month run with some prescription meds for pattern baldness - couldn&#x27;t see a result $500 later. After a lot of research and review reading - hoping that this is it. Very inexpensive treatment - worth the try...</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product a week prior to this post.  The review lasted on Amazon just a few days before Amazon removed it. I gave it two stars.  There was nothing offensive in my review so it is befuddling why Amazon removed.  So I give five stars in this repost... if this post lasts then a skew may exist for keeping high-star reviews vs low-star reviews.  Anyway, I have some important items to share here.  Just two stars in the prior review because of a couple of major gripes: (1) too strong of fragrance and (2) just mild regrowth results.  If not for the scent, I award the Rogaine foam 3.5 stars.     Years ago I used the original non-foam Rogaine product.  That was before Rogaine Foam entered the market.  That was 17 years ago.  And I had good results with the non-foam version until I developed an allergy to the polypropylene-glycol (PPG).  So I had to stop use about 12 years ago.  Back then there was no foam version.      Turns out there are many like me who develop skin allergy to PPG.  Fast forward 10 years... the foam version hits market which uses glycerin in place of polypropylene-glycol.  The glycerin is much better tolerated.  So restarting use the Rogaine two years ago, this time foam version, I had no allergic reaction.  Yet the new product now has an added very strong fragrance.  Still there was some regrowth using the product.  So do try the product and see for yourself.  It may work for you.  Yet keep your expectations in order.  And beware that when you first apply there will be an overwhelming flowery scent that lasts for about 45 minutes until it dries, which can be embarrassing if not accounted for.  In case makers of Rogaine are reading, please make a fragrance-free foam version (and soon). My wife has a sensitive nose and complains mightily so I usually have to leave the room.</li>
    <li> if your not to old to lose most of your olfactory senses(smell) then you probably won&#x27;t be able to stand using this product. it has a VERY strong smell that could be smelled by my friends around me, while i was wearing a hat. it has a very strong checmical smell that is very noticable. i would rather lose my hair then smell like a chemical dump.</li>
    <li> starting to see new hair. It will take some time to really know how much</li>
    <li> i have gotten good results.</li>
    <li> I am a 59 year old guy.  Very gradually since my late 30s, the hair on the crown of my head has been getting thinner.  All of a sudden one day after a haircut, I realized I could see my scalp from the front!  That was really depressing.  I talked to my doctor and he said Rogaine or Propecia were the only treatments and they didn&#x27;t work for everyone.  Since Propecia can have side effects, I tried Rogaine.  This takes a while so you have to be patient.  Right around the time I had used up the first package of three, I noticed a marked improvement.  Once I saw that, I am very willing to continue this indefinitely.  The application is easy and the product itself seems to have a thickening agent like a mousse -- probably intentional.  I put it on as directed after the shower, comb my hair, and by the time I&#x27;ve finished shaving and brushing my teeth, all it needs is a very quick blow dry and I&#x27;m back to (more or less) the full head of hair I&#x27;ve had all my life.  Also, as directed, I put on before bed.  BTW, the version they send from Amazon is the unscented, so no problem with the cheap fragrance smell some previously mentioned.</li>
    <li> I see good results after using this for 5months. Started to see results at 3 months</li>
    <li> i put it on my bald spot in back. i couldnt see it anyway but i was told by others it was getting bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 options here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Get new, more sensitive friends who don&#x27;t run their fn mouths about the natural aging process, then throw away that stupid pink hand mirror that your x, x, x GF, left in the drawer (smash it first though. it&#x27;s not childish if it makes you feel better)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-OR-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 buy this stuff but honestly, or the 1/3 cheaper Walmart version.  Also, still throw away that stupid hand mirror because you&#x27;re a man and not some easy prey for product marketing that feeds on your insecurities  Eyes forward to the future</li>
    <li> This product did not work that great for me.  I saw limited results (which is why I gave it 3 stars).  Tiny growth, but nothing spectacular that others would notice.  Even though it did not work that great for me, it might work for others (there are a lot of nice reviews here), so I would still give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 44 years old and have been using it for about 4 months now.  I feel some hair thickening at the crown and feel like it is steadily improving.  It&#x27;s not like I suddenly have a thick head of hair, but it seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this item for over 3 months now, trying my best to use it as the directions state (except when I forget to put it on, I&#x27;m human!; although I almost never forget) and so far I don&#x27;t see any results personally. I would say that the little hair that I still have has stayed there, which I guess is a good sign. I will continue using it and update if necessary, but for now I would have to rate it 2 stars as I have not seen any marked improvements on my hair loss.</li>
    <li> My wife begged me to start doing something to make sure I wasn&#x27;t totally bald in our wedding pictures and I have to say this stuff got the job done. The foam is much easier to apply than the liquid and if you don&#x27;t have much hair to begin with it can replace whatever spray gel or hair spray you had been using. My problem is that the recommended dose is so small that I end up using more than directed just because I feel like it&#x27;s more effective, even though it probably doesn&#x27;t make a difference. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 3 years now and my hair looks more or less the same as it did when I started. It&#x27;s a nice feeling to not see lots of hair all over the sink and all over the pillow. I haven&#x27;t experienced any regrowth to get excited about, but I&#x27;m just happy to be sustaining.</li>
    <li> I have been using other minoxidil but now I decide to buy the rogain foam. I am very excited to see better results. I am very happy because this one is far easier to apply and your hair does not get oily. I apply very fast at mornings and nights. The product dry fast. Recommended</li>
    <li> been a month and haven&#x27;t seen any results, the package says it takes about 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;this stuff smells fairly decent.. kinda like a shampoo, but its very strong.. and you will&lt;br /&gt;get sick of the smell emitting off your head</li>
    <li> This product can be purchased at many local stores but I haven&#x27;t found a cheaper price anywhere else....saves the hassle of wasting gas to go out and purchase it too.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, with free shipping.  Automatic refills, with an option to pass.  Great deal on a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 27-y-o husband, who of course would look good in a paper sack, but is not ready for baldness. We saw results within the first 2 months, and he was even using less than directed and not covering every problem spot. It has been working fine in the front. The front sides seem more stubborn (exaggerating his widow&#x27;s peak), but the top of his head was the real problem. He looks more his age now. I cut his hair, so I know his hairloss and now regrowth better than anyone. We&#x27;re both very pleased and will continue to buy it- that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m back here now. I like the price, too. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> It does work, I had to use it for over a year before I saw any change but now I&#x27;m glad I stuck with it. Foam seems better and also I converted to a \\&quot;gell\\&quot; look from a \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; look with my hair. I will ever forget when my hair dresser finally said \\&quot;Oh My Gosh your hair is growning in\\&quot; The only other option is surgery but that costs 15K for most of us and takes a month to recover in public view. I used generic for a while but over time my hair thinned so I went back to the real stuff and it came back. I also sprinkle TOPPIK and the two together worked great I&#x27;m 80% recovered</li>
    <li> I guess I have too much hair for this product as I found it virtually impossible to get this stuff past my hair onto the scalp.  As another reviewer said if you have a bald spot it might work better, but then why would you need a mousse?</li>
    <li> I had to discontinue this product after 2 weeks of use.  I was having breathing problems.  I did a little research and some people have problems breathing when on Rogaine.  They don&#x27;t specifically say this is one of the side effects on there website, but I can tell you it feels like you can&#x27;t take a full breath if you have this feeling it is probably from the Rogaine.</li>
    <li> My doctor told me that my hair loss was stress related.  The doctor has given me cortisone shots and told me to use Rogaine.  It&#x27;s only been a couple of months but my hair is coming back.  My suggestion to others is don&#x27;t let these as...holes get to you in the 1st place and you won&#x27;t lose your hair.</li>
    <li> its ok. but the spray did not work for all the 3 bottles. had to get it replaced which was easy. product was ok.</li>
    <li> I have used this (5% only) about two months. My Dr told me it would take 4 months for this to show results,  I have yet to see hair growth...BUT...  I never forget to put it on two times a day.  Why?  I have an extreme case of DRY EYE with eye pain.  The first time I used it, within seconds, my eyes felt a little bit better.  I thought it was my imagination..however....each time I use it my eyes are better. I now have a marked reduction in the eye pain and friends say my eyes are open wider.  I also use Restasis and other eye drops but they didn&#x27;t help in a real relief and the combination of these products have made a big difference in my life of eye pain.  If you have a similar problem, it is worth a try. (It is important to know harmons play a part, the estrogen patch is a big plus with this treatment versus the Premarin by mouth)</li>
    <li> My hair stylist warned me not to use this because of the alcohol content. I did. It made my scalp scab and than made the area were my hair was thinning completely bald. The size of a golfball. Now I have my first combover at the age of 47. CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <li> I have used the product before</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine foam about a year , my hair have improved about 35-40%.     i did NOT experienced any sides effects. one of my friend have complained about having a headaches, he stopped using it for a while then i convinced him to re-start using it again, apparently he did NOT complain about the headaches. i think it was a coincidence for him.     Rogaine&#x27;s active ingredient is Minoxidil. Minoxidil is a vasodilator that relaxes (widens) blood vessels and improves blood flow. and it used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) when given as a pill ( but we use it TOPICALLY ) Different rout.</li>
    <li> Just started to use this product,I am hoping for great results</li>
    <li> Used the liquid for years .. like this foam better. Doesn&#x27;t run down my head when applied. Does Rogaine work ? Does for me. Check out my picture , That&#x27;s my all my hair (sorry about the hat) .. both my grandfathers and my father were balding by the mid 30&#x27;s .. I&#x27;m well into my 70&#x27;s with long white hair. Rogaine may not work for everyone ... but I&#x27;d give it a shot if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
    <li> It is quite simple - I retain my hair when I should be going bald.  I need this stuff forever, but it beats being a cueball!!</li>
    <li> I been using this product for a month now. Commercials say it works 80% +/- on men but when I opened the package and read some info on the product. It works 80% +/- on white men. One problem, I&#x27;m not Caucasian. It didn&#x27;t work for me but it might work for you.</li>
    <li> I started using Rogaine when my hair started thinning on top (age 51).  I used the foam which is easy to apply.  Since I have been using it, my hair has come back and I have a full head of hair.  I am very satisfied with this product - the only side affect is that my facial hair grows faster also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely more convenient than the liquid formulation, but not sure if it&#x27;s being absorbed into the scalp as well.</li>
    <li> The shipment actually arrived 2days earlier than anticipated which was a pleasant surprise. I used this product for over a month so far and it seems to be working slowly. One thing is that If you are trying to decide between the solution or foam, I would say go with the foam as it is less messy and easy to use.    As far as the results and side effects go, they are not very drastic But, It does seem to work slowly as I am starting to notice some growth. Also during the first couple of weeks it would give me mild headache after applying the foam but after regular usage I got used to it and doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore.    My only complaint is that the hair gets greasy in the are used. so, I use the no frizz cream to soften up the hair a bit and comb it or sometimes use hair gel to get an even look. I wish they made a non greasy foam to save me from messy pillow covers.</li>
    <li> Everything was fine at time of receiving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not losing as much hair as other potentially older men who use this product in an effort to regrow back their lost hair, but a year ago I was noticing my hairline receding. I tried everything to improve it, but nothing seemed to work. As a last-ditch effort, I researched Rogaine and ordered it from Amazon. I realize that it wasn&#x27;t meant for the hairline, but I was willing to take the risk. I used it for a couple of months and to my surprise, it actually worked. I was shocked, and even my barber noticed without me telling her anything. I was happy...but along came the side effects, and just recently they became worse and I decided to stop using it altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I suddenly gained 15 pounds, and my heart-rate dramatically increased. I&#x27;m not willing to ignore these side-effects in order to keep my hairline stable, so I had to give it up. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I&#x27;m impressed by the results and I&#x27;m sure other people may have different, less-changing side-effects so I don&#x27;t want to take away too much from this product. It also goes without mention that the hair that grows out will fall back down if you stop using the product. So it can get expensive for you for the mere fact that the result is definitely not permanent.</li>
    <li> OK THIS IS MY FIRST TIME EVER USING ANY HAIR LOSS PRODUCTS...I RECENTLY EXPERIENCED HAIR LOSS WHEN I WAS 20 YEARS OLD...I BEGAN TO NOTICE HAIRLINE RECEDING AT 18.  I AM NOW 22 YEARS OLD AND MY FIRST 3MONTH SUPPLY OF ROGAINE IS COMING IN TODAY.  I WILL BE TAKING PICTURES EVERY WEEK AND UPDATE YOU GUYS ON HOW THE PRODUCT IS WORKING FOR ME. I THINK MORE PEOPLE NEED TO UPDATE US ON REVIEWS OF THEIR PRODUCTS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY USE IT FOR SOME TIME AND DONT TELL YOU HOW ITS BEEN SINCE THE LAST REVIEW.  SO I WILL BE CHECKING BACK HERE TO KEEP POSTING REVIEWS ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME OR LEAVE A COMMENT TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS OR FOR PICTURES ONCE I GET TO THEM. THANK YOU AND HOPE TO POST POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT ROGAINE</li>
    <li> great product works well but you have to keep using it looking for more at a better price</li>
    <li> been using Rogaine for years with good results.  I will note the first time you use it, almost all of your &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; hair will probably fall out before it regenerates new growth.  This freaked me out, thinking it was doing the opposite of what I wanted lol.  If I would have stopped then I would never have given it a chance to work.  But I hung in there, and it has thickened up the majority of my top - noticeably so.  Now only use 2-3 times/week, not sure if that&#x27;s right but that&#x27;s my tradeoff between expensive and usage.  60 yrs old, thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - there are several knock-offs to the brand name for much cheaper, you can find them in drug stores under the store name etc.  I tried those with mixed results.  Some had poor quality control, like 2 cans were not charged and such.  And I assume they&#x27;re using the correct ingredients.  Anyway I don&#x27;t have time to fool around to see if the imitations got it right, so I just stick to the brand name.  Only Con:  This stuff is WAY too expensive</li>
    <li> I should have taken the advice from others on here and realized it doesn&#x27;t work for hairline loss... its only for male patter baldness... you know... the top/back of your head.  What is the difference between this hair and hair on the front of your head? I even went to the rogaine website and they didn&#x27;t say where it worked either.  I am going to give this three month package a try and see what happens and maybe change the review.  I am uploading a picture of the back of the packaging.</li>
    <li> After using the Rogaine foam for two days, I developed a severe reaction to the product. My scalp, ears, and neck were red and itchy. I needed to use benedryl ointment to reduce the symptoms. Be very cautious about ordering this product since Amazon will not refund you purchase price.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.  I must in the 25% that this less effective on.  I&#x27;ll keep using it to perhaps slow the process down.  Cheaper here than WalMart.</li>
    <li> Good price.. Arrived before I could go bald..</li>
    <li> Pros  1. Ease of application and keeping it from running/dripping vs liquid form  2. No generic version of the foam exists that I&#x27;m aware of  3. Not as much flaking as the liquid form  Cons  1. Considerably more expensive  2. Although claims to be odorless- still has an odor  3. Child safety cap can be annoying at times</li>
    <li> After 2 months I can see small changes, hope it will make things good, but the down side is not east to style the hair... I have to cut my hair short so no one will see my hair is not touchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no smell and easy to use. It takes time and you have to use with Nizoral. Just give it some time.</li>
    <li> I bought Rogaine for my dad&#x27;s hairloss problem and we are happy that it was the only solution! It is easy to use and after 2 months of using this product, his hair started growing! This is a highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> Does&#x27;n really help me to regrow my hair, after using more than 2 years.  Maybe the time for me to stop trying.</li>
    <li> Product is working as stated.  After about a month I am starting to see growth.</li>
    <li> This helped me to grow a great beard</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Walgreen minox 5% for the past Decade or more.  It&#x27;s the closest to the true Rogaine 5% formula that I have found.  I have also tried Costcos kirkland, but found that it didn&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s the difference in the inactive ingredients, hence why kirkland brand is so cheap.  I&#x27;m not saying kirklands doesn&#x27;t work, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Try it, if it works for you, great.  However, Walgreen discontinued it&#x27;s liquid form so in search of another substitute, I tried foam for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I don&#x27;t use it on the vertex, I use it on my receding hairline Norwood scale 1 (but still counts as a recession).  Rogaine worked for me in that it stopped a lot of the shedding during showering.  I notice a lot less hair falling out when I wash my hair after I have use it consistently for about a month or two.  (It&#x27;s very obvious and it&#x27;s not just nonsense about you shed \\&quot;X\\&quot; number of follicles a day).  When you shower at the same time each day, you should notice the same amount of hair falling out.  In my case, when I stop using rogaine, I notice at least 20 hair strands fall out during my showers.  When I use Rogaine consistently for about a month or two, the number of follicles drop to 2 or 3.  YES, It&#x27;s THAT noticeable.  You will notice it will be working (if it works for you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also notice this change if I get lazy and stop using it consistently, after about a month or two I start shedding again.  Second, when I use the product for a while, there&#x27;s definitely growth and I can see my hairline, instead of a recession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also take propecia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine Foam is absolutely hands down the best applicator product.  Backup a moment, I tried foam once before, but at that time I was using the liquid version actively.  The liquid version flakes ALOT, and makes your skin red and irritated.  When I used the foam, i felt some pain, so I stopped using the foam.  What I realized now, is that it was the liquids fault not the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of Foam:&lt;br /&gt;It does not flake/peel my skin at all&lt;br /&gt;It does not irritate / redness / rash&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply on the frontal lobe/forehead - It does stick to hair, so I read a review that if you are applying to spots that have lots of hair strands like the vertex, it would be a little hard trying to press it onto the scalp i guess.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s QUICK DRYING!  - Liquid version drops will streak down your forehead, doesn&#x27;t dry quickly, and if you sleep right before bed or wash your face, or wipe your head, it will most likely wipe off all medicine as well.  Foam dries within a minute and it&#x27;s not runny.&lt;br /&gt;Foam Price is the same as liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...  hands down, my recommendation is try foam first, then liquid etc etc...  And don&#x27;t expect hair to grow fast... its really really slow.  But again try to notice the difference of Shedding when you shower to see if it is working.</li>
    <li> works well easy to use</li>
    <li> I have been using rogaine for a while now, and I have to say it does work, IF you use it twice a day, every single day. It smells so bad though, and makes my hair really sticky. I also started using  [[ASIN:B00XJ3GPJA Finoxidrin - Powerful Hair Nutrient Supplement]] with it, and took a couple tablets a day. As a test, I then started using Rogaine only once a day. I STILL saw an improvement in hair growth, even though I only use the rogaine once a day now. This is an absolutely amazing combo to stop hair loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years and all I can say is that it does work.     I discontinued its use for a couple of months and got bald. As soon as I restarted to use it, I noticed much of my lost hair was growing back.    I know it doesn&#x27;t work the same for everyone, but in my case, I happen to be one strong candidate.</li>
    <li> Excellent shipment time&lt;br /&gt;Very good profuct</li>
    <li> These little white bottles are a life saver for those of us with thinning or bald spots on our head.  After the first series (3 months) I saw noticeable growth and thickening of the hair (I use it on my receding hairline, so yes it does work up front!).  I am now on month 4.5 and its still filling in great.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a growth up top and the added confidence boost.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use the Men&#x27;s Version of Rogaine and it has certainly paid off. I couldn&#x27;t use the liquid form for women as it burned my scalp after a few months but I have been using the men&#x27;s foam for over a year now with only positive results.  I would panic if I couldn&#x27;t get it anymore!  This stuff is great!  Oh, and I only use it once a day, in the evening.  I read one comment that said they use it and then blow dry their hair so maybe I will try that but the instructions indicate that your scalp should be dry so I only use it at bedtime.  Give it a try.  What do you have to lose other than hair??</li>
    <li> This is something I just had to accept I need daily. Good price. Quick shipping. No complains. Good for trying to retain you hair when it&#x27;s falling out.</li>
    <li> Makes it worse. Topical only works for some people, I believe that now.  Per stage one (first couple weeks) my hair fell out per what was described on product. No worries, that&#x27;s fine. But what I didn&#x27;t like is that that hair never came back in even with using the product for past it&#x27;s recommended use length.  Not only did my hair not get better, I lost the hair that stage one of this product says that you will lose to make room for new hair. I used this for more than it&#x27;s recommended time of trial.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping and good quality !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It is a good alternative to joining a hair club or expensive programs. I notice after even 1 month or so long straight hair sticking up out of my head. Most people&#x27;s hair will fall out faster once you start using it which is stated in the instructions. My hair is thinning and falling out on the top and front, but the sides are fine. This product does only work on the crown of your head, it does not grow hair on the front. It also says that in the instructions so I was not expecting that anyway. The price is also better on Amazon than at brick and mortar retail stores.</li>
    <li> Price is incredible, not sure why I keep buying as I keep loosing more and more hair no matter what.  But if you insist on buying like I do, you cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> First I used generic made Minoxidil and that liquid applicator was just a pain to use. This foam stuff is much easier to use. The only word of warning I would give is this stuff melts in heat so if the room is 80F or higher it will melt and won&#x27;t go on your head cleanly. I am one of the men for whom this product worked. Not all men will find this stuff effective, its just how it is. For me this stuff put hair back on my head, can&#x27;t cure the widows peak but is a definite improvement. You just have to wait a few months for the full effect. The foam is more expensive than a generic liquid applicator but the ease of use is so good I pay the extra dollar.</li>
    <li> my  hair not ground, i was used  by 3 month and not result</li>
    <li> Rogaine seemed to work okay for me! It was fairly useful in growing hair. Noticeable growth after about a couple months of use, but nothing substantial for me. I would recommend it to others, but don&#x27;t expect AMAZING hair growth.</li>
    <li> I know this product gets mixed reviews from many people.  For me it has worked for 16 years now.  The foam works well as a hair sculpting gel too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the liquid form of this stuff for over 5 years, and I started using it before any hair loss started. I&#x27;m the only male in my family that still has his hair (although it is thinning now, thanks to this foam product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like someone else said in their review, most of this stuff goes onto your hair, rather than the scalp where it&#x27;s actually useful. I decided to give the foam a try because the Costco near me was all out of the liquid, and I actually started to lose my hair in the time I used this stuff. After they got more liquid minoxidil in, my hair loss stopped. Despite what the packaging says, for me the liquid (or foam) doesn&#x27;t regrow hair, it only stops the follicles from dying. So if you&#x27;re already bald, enjoy the freedom and shave it all off. I know I will if they ever stop producing the liquid form.</li>
    <li> this is a standard product that arrived on time. I am still using it but the result will take about 6 months to show.</li>
    <li> Used as directed for about 4 months and not sure yet if it works; definitely not as advertised.  However, it seems that the hair loss has decreased.</li>
    <li> I have been having significant and noticeable hair thinning for about the last 5 years or so in the areas at the top/front of my head about 3\\&quot; back and to the left from the hair line, where I part my hair in the middle.  After trying Nioxin System 2 for two months with absolutely no effect, I was skeptical about hair regrowth products in general, but I thought I would try this due to the other positive reviews I had read on it. I have been using it consistently twice a day, once in the morning and once at night as directed for almost two months, and in addition have also been taking a supplement that is supposed to help lower DHT levels since I thought taking the two products together could likely have a compounding positive effect. Well it did!  After about 5 weeks using the Rogaine in addition to the supplement, I noticed significant improvement and after about 6 weeks, I would say that I have about 40-50% improvement in the areas where I had noticeable thinning..It really works!!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> After 3 months my wife said.. \\&quot;wow - that stuff really works\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s good enough for me :)  Subscribe and save makes this $15 a month.  No brainer.    UPDATE: Now at 8+ months of use.  I noticed the most growth/thickening in the first 4 months and not much improvement since.  That said, if I&#x27;m able to hang onto what&#x27;s come back for a few years, it&#x27;s the best $12 / month I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff off and on for a very long time and truthfully I&#x27;ve never seen any noticeable results from it</li>
    <li> I started using Rogaine foam after using \\&quot;Equate extra strength men&#x27;s hair regrowth formula\\&quot; or something like that.  Wal mart rogaine.  That stuff was liquid that just dripped around my dome and was wasted.  And an overall chore.  This stuff (the rogaine foam) is much more pleasant to apply.  Foam it up in the hand, rub it around, it&#x27;s much easier to manage than the liquid.  It stays where you want it to.  And just kinda makes my hair feel thicker, instead of a greasy grossness the liquid left.  I&#x27;ve only used this for about a month, so it&#x27;s still a little early to tell how it&#x27;s working for hair regrowth.  I&#x27;m using this with revivogen shampoo.  Started them at the same time, and I&#x27;m feeling good about it.  Hair seems a little thicker.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes so far, but will review again in a few months if there&#x27;s been a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Not sure it works well</li>
    <li> Rogaine foam is an excellent product I have been using it for the past four months and have seen results almost immediately</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I am not going to be able to use, or return for a refund  this product. Once you receive the product and read the fine print it will state that it is ONLY for a specific area of your head, under specific hair loss conditions. If your hair loss is located somewhere else, like the front or sides, it will not work. When I tried to return it and get a return, I was told by Amazon that this product was not returnable. I lost my money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in hair consistency it does feel like your hair is thicker after applying it kinda like you put hair spray in your hair.</li>
    <li> Getting better  I feel my hair is getting better with Rogain.  I hope it will be better.</li>
    <li> Foam did not last long enough after shower,had to run my hands under cold water to make it work.  Didn&#x27;t realize if you stop using or miss a few treatments growth will stop. If you stop all together, you&#x27;ll loose what you gained.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3-4 months now I am reloading, so I&#x27;ll review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using the liquid in the past and for some reason the liquid form of Rogaine really made my scalp itch like crazy.  The foam does no such thing. So if you&#x27;ve had problems with the liquid, I would suggest giving the foam a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the foam directly to my scalp/hair and then massage it in.  I like to put 3 small balls of it from front to back and then massage them all in.  I really like that I can use it to \\&quot;style\\&quot; my hair somewhat since it acts like hair mousse. It also thickens my hair a little bit, which is great because I&#x27;m thinning noticeably at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with a regiment of Nioxin shampoo, the Rogaine seems to have given me fuller hair.  I&#x27;ve had people tell me they notice that I have more hair, which is also encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I really don&#x27;t like getting it on my hands, which is absolutely necessary in order to use it. It&#x27;s not a big deal since you can wash it off immediately, but there have been many occasions where I was hesitant to use it because I didn&#x27;t want it on my hands.  Of course, if you don&#x27;t mind it on your hands, it&#x27;s no big deal at all.</li>
    <li> Product seems to work great.</li>
    <li> Have to wait and see, only some very little growth, and been using it for weeks</li>
    <li> Works great.  My husband has been using this product for a long-time.  He has terrific hair now - on his head and not in the hairbrush.</li>
    <li> You are happy when what you bought is worth every penny! This is one of those products!   I was on my way for a runway (loosing hair on the front, above forehead :)   but this foam not only helped not loose any more hair but regrow as well! Hatsoff to the creators of this foam!  I read it&#x27;s made for Heliports (loosing hair in the middle of the head :)  but it works for runways too!</li>
    <li> The only treatment I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I think it works, i still have my hair...easy to use and last for a while, unless you have a big thinning spot.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great service!  Great price!  Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I was taking it for about a year. I thought meh, I guess I don&#x27;t really have much of a hair loss problem because it&#x27;s not really bothering me like it used to. So I&#x27;ve stopped using it for the last 6 months. Turns out I didn&#x27;t think the problem was that bad because, in hindsight, it appears like Rogaine fixed the problem making it seem like I was using Rogaine unnecessarily . It&#x27;s starting to bother me once again, so I&#x27;m about to order some more right now. Lesgo!</li>
    <li> I have no complains about Amazon on even Rogaine, however they&#x27;ve send to me some bad or old product. The whole kit, I mean, the three bottles are full of product but the pump doesn&#x27;t work, in other words, when you push the bottom the foam doesn&#x27;t come out, and believe or not, I&#x27;ve took all of them to Duane Reade to make sure that it was broken and for my surprise the answer was YES, all bottles was broken. Botton line, I&#x27;ve put 50 bucks in a garbage, due that I have an advice to everyone, if you need this product, don&#x27;t buy on line because you cannot return it, buy in some pharmacy or so.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my brother as he was getting bald spots around Christmas. Glad to say his hair has almost completely filled in now!</li>
    <li> YES, IT WORKS QUITE WELL, FOR MY BOYFRIEND. I WONDER IF IT REALLY HELPS TO JUST &#x27;THICKEN&#x27; WOMAN&#x27;S HAIR... LIKE MINE!?</li>
    <li> I still have some hair on my head so I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t work.  I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I recently got married.  The photos showed a horrible balding spot.  I broke down and bought this.  It works and it worked fast.  In about 2 weeks I noticed a difference.  2 months later and its like I never lost any hair.  I wish I had used it prior to my wedding.</li>
    <li> I will buy it again..</li>
    <li> This thing really halted my loss hair... I had been used it for over six month already. But be aware that you will depend on this to keep your hair in line....</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected! thanks</li>
    <li> As long as you follow the directions you should see growth or at least less fall out! -  - -</li>
    <li> i began using this product and what i have is thin hair only and i wanted to make my hair stronger, but the intruction say that during 2 week you are going to loose dead hair and then you should not loose the hair, after 3 week i was loosing a lot of hair so i contact rogaine and they told me that they recomend that i do not continue with the threatment. at this moment i will cancel my suscription and get my money back. good product but not made for me.</li>
    <li> I suppose it&#x27;s just the type of baldness I have. This did not seem to help me at all and had minor side-effects. Some people swear by it, I just see it as a way to make money from people who have problems. Bosley is your best $/result.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay to use for me , but the expiration date is too short !&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Only 3 month till now.</li>
    <li> Less irritating than the drops and easy to use. I&#x27;ve totally switched. Easy to apply just where needed.</li>
    <li> It helps a little bit.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very expensive and you will still lose your hair unless you use it twice a day for the rest of your life.  Embrace the baldness!</li>
    <li> Please note that many men have experienced unlisted side effects such as sexual dysfunction while using Minoxidil (Rogaine) products (search Minoxidil and sexual dysfunction). In my experience, it succeeded in slowing hair loss but did not regrow any new hair, destroyed my libido and function. In my opinion, this stuff is poison for your body. More harm than good.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for light hair loss.  I travel alot and this is very easy to carry and has given me no problems going through security.  The foam is very gentle and easy to apply.  I would recommend washing your hands after cause the smell can be a little much.  I also use styling products with this after drying my hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem to interfere.</li>
    <li> They should fire the people who put the fragrance in this product. It is sickening.  Don&#x27;t know if it works because I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m growing hair back, slowly but surely.</li>
    <li> The product does not really work for me.  The doctor recommended it and both of us agreee it is not effective.</li>
    <li> I think the product works. Of course it takes time and patience (min 3-4 month).  The only problem -in my case- is the side effects which can be very serious!  I&#x27;m a healthy person with no physical problems but after using rogaine foam for  3 months I started having palpitations, sleepiness and a lot of anxiety!  I never guessed that the problem could be the rogaine. I&#x27;m not a doctor so I can&#x27;t blame 100%  rogaine. All I know is that after stop using rogaine everything went back to normal in  my life. (It took several weeks)    I strongly recommend you to check the following link about the side effects of rogaine :    [...]  Hope it help you decide to use rogaine or not.    PS: I&#x27;m not sure if the link i posted is allowed by amazon, in case is not  just go to the website \\&quot;askapatient-dot-com\\&quot; and type rogaine extra strength for men, in the search box to see the reviews.</li>
    <li> Seemed to be somewhat working, but I finally just embraced the baldness. Watch out world, shiny head coming through!</li>
    <li> For my husband, to soon to tell.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It DOES work!</li>
    <li> I always buy it for my dad and really satisfied these products.</li>
    <li> It is said it&#x27;s gonna work, have not seen the noticeable results myself though, but I have faith in it, cross fingers!</li>
    <li> works great....i put it off for way to long.  Wish i would have started using it much sooner. h</li>
    <li> Used to use this product(liquid)many years back,but getting itchy after 3 months. Stop using for a year, try it again still itchy.After used this Rogaine foam no more itchy and my hair start growing on bald spot (this is my 2nd month).Hopefully my hair keep growing on bald spot and not falling off again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a difference yet but it is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Very good I have been using it for few years and my hair looks much better!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it works because I don&#x27;t have any hair loss. I was told by my doctor to use it early to prevent hair loss. I usually don&#x27;t do what my doctor tells me but after weighing the pros and cons I thought I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprise at how light-scentless the product is and it only takes a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: It is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Price.</li>
    <li> It took about 3 months of consistent use but I have noticed a significant improvement in my hair near the crown.</li>
    <li> I started using the liquid 5% Rogaine when I was 18 years ago when I began to experience thinning in my crown area and slight recession in vertex areas. I&#x27;ve also used Propecia/finasteride for the past 17 years. My crown filled in within four months of starting Rogaine liquid, my vertex mostly filled in within 6 months, my hair regained nearly all of it&#x27;s pre-thinning thickness around 1 year after starting the Propecia and today I still have most of my hair (I&#x27;m between a Norwood I and Norwood II). I have slight recession in my temples and have been able to maintain most of my widow&#x27;s peak. I prefer the foam to the liquid. It is MUCH less irritating to my scalp (although I understand experiences will vary among users), and right now I prefer the brand name Rogaine because it seems to retain more of it&#x27;s foam consistency when applied, compared to generic minoxidil (store brand) foam. The brand name Rogaine foam seems to also be even less irritating to my scalp than the generic minoxidil foam.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work so well</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t fault a original product. I really like the foam better than the liquid. I recommend this for sure</li>
    <li> My boyfriend used this product and recieved fast and prompt results. He used this product for a month and the results are outstanding♥♥♥</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any new hair after 6 months of use. very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my weiner still works tho, so there have been no negative sexual side affects.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if it works or not. Probably doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Not only did this cure my baldness, but my I.Q. went up 25 points.  Now my wife can&#x27;t call me a short, bald dummy anymore.  Now for some platform shoes...</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product only for a few weeks.  We understand that it takes at least a few months to begin to see hair regrowth results.  So far, we can only speak to his experience in using the product rather than the results.  He finds that the foam is easy to use just as advertised.  And he likes the fact that his 3 month supply comes in three easy to use separate containers designed for easy application.</li>
    <li> Not sure whether it&#x27;s working as I couldn&#x27;t notice any change</li>
    <li> I love using Rogaine Foam versus the Minoxidil bottle with the liquid dripper. This creates much less of a mess and dries ALOT quicker. Previously, I would always have an issue applying the Minoxidil right before bed, causing the medication to transfer to my pillow, thus causing yellow stains. This is no longer an issue with the much faster drying time of the foam.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I&#x27;m 24 years old and have been using it for about 4 months now. My friends and family tell me that my hair is coming in thicker and fuller. Glad i started using rogaine when i decided to. If your thinking about using it, stop thinking, and get some!</li>
    <li> So I initially wrote this review thinking I was on the minoxidil female dosage. Now I&#x27;m worried those I wrote it for wont see it. But will get back on and wrote for the appropriate audience. For any males interested, here is my story;  I started using Rogaine in my 20&#x27;s after my hair fell out following use of a medication. It took several months but between that and heavy doses of Biotin, my hair came back.  Not as full as usual but I still looked normal.  So I used it for 12 years or so and then I got pregnant.  I had to quit. But I didn&#x27;t notice any hair loss.  After I had my baby, I began using Rogaine again, but not as directed. I had trouble getting back on my schedule and only used it once a day about every other day.  I didn&#x27;t notice any hair loss.  So I decided I was cured and went off Rogaine completely.  A month later my  hair started falling out and it continued for the next several months.  I was worried and saw my doctor.  All of my bloodwork came back fine so I wondered if Rogaine had been helping me out all along.  I went back on it.  A few months later my hairloss stopped and is as full as it was before.  This stuff has really worked for me.  I can&#x27;t imagine living without it.  I won&#x27;t ever stop it again.  Please try it and give it at least 3 months.  That is how long it has taken to work for me.  Good luck.  It is totally worth any hair falling out in the meantime.  You will be ecstatic!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Using it only once a day gave me horrible headaches.</li>
    <li> SImply brilliant use!!</li>
    <li> I have to say I see too many 1 star reviews from people who only gave the product a try for a month or two, because they saw some hair loss. They seem quite angry too. I would say these people did not do their research and expected this to be a miracle cure. If you are going to consider buying this product, please do some research. It will save you some frustration. You really should know what you are getting into.    First of all, as they mention on their site, remember that you didn&#x27;t lose your hair overnight and the same same is true for regrowing your hair. It may take at least FOUR months to begin to see visible hair regrowth. FOUR MONTHS, not 1 or 2 or even 3. You \\&quot;might\\&quot; see results sooner, but you may not.    Secondly, it clearly states you may lose hair, or rather see increased thinning the first few weeks. You should go into this knowing you WILL LOSE hair at first. It is the thin weak hair that needs to be replaced. Again, YOU WILL LOSE hair for at least a month. Could be a little longer. If you quit using Rogaine after a month or so because you see increased thinning you either did not educate yourself before using it or you were really NOT ready to face that possibility.    Third, they also make it clear that around 20% of people DO NOT have success using Rogaine.    So what does that possibly mean? You COULD be one of the 20% and will not see hair regrowth. To make matters more disappointing this will not be evident until after you also experienced the initial shedding of hair. SO, YOU COULD END UP USING THIS AND SIMPLY HAVE THINNER HAIR AT THE END OF THE DAY. Is that something you are willing to accept or chance? Is it worth it for you to try this, knowing that result is possible? If not, I would suggest YOU DO NOT BUY Rogaine.    I gave it two stars because it did not work for me, not because anything happened that I was not aware of before I started. I was willing to take the chance. PLEASE think about the possible end results before you buy this. If you think there is some guarantee you will regrow hair or this is some miracle cures for hair loss you are a fool. If you use Rogaine and get angry over seeing hair loss initially and stop using it, you are also a fool. You have no one to blame but yourself for whatever results you experience.    It is YOUR CHOICE to use this product, so I encourage anyone who is considering it to DO RESEARCH before just leaping in head first. I am disappointed it did not work for me, but I knew what I was getting into and do not blame Rogaine or try to suggest they make false claims. It clearly works for some, and does not for others. The only way to know is to push through the desire to quit using it when you see the initial thinning and keep using it as recommended. You just may find it works, or you may be like me and be bummed it did not work.    You can see from the pics at these links what happened to me. I used Rogaine for almost 6 months with no apparent results, other than the expected initial thinning.    This picture shows the balding spot on the top back of my head. The circle indicates where the thinning was visible BEFORE I started using Rogaine. After 5-6 months of using it I now have a larger balding\thinning spot. You can see the area outside of the circle is where the hair became thinner after using Rogaine. [...]  That did not bother me as much as the next picture. This picture is from the front of my head closer to my bangs. Rogaine caused major thinning down the center of my head. There was definitely some thinning there before using Rogaine, which is why I also used it there and not just the larger bald spot on the back top of my head. HOWEVER, you could NEVER EVER see my scalp like you can now. If my hair gets messed up or the blown out of place by the wind you can see scalp like you can in this picture. [...]    Also, when my hair is wet it is now VERY apparent that the top of my head lost some major hair and the thinning is now extending from that bald spot down the center of my head all the way to the front. That really is a bummer.    SO, I would certainly recommend going into this with realistic outlook on ALL possible end results. I would also suggest, from my experience I just described, that you DO NOT USE Rogaine on areas of your scalp that are just showing a small sign of thinning. Don&#x27;t get greedy. If you do and the product does not work, you will be sorry to see you will have increased thinning to the extent you may not have seen for some time down the road. Use it ONLY WHERE IT IS OBVIOUS YOU NEED IT. Then if it works for you, try it in other thinning areas to head off any worsening loss in those areas. I wish I would have only used it on the bald spot on the back top of my head. The thinning down the middle and up front I now see probably would not have happened for a while. That is truly disappointing, but all of this was MY CHOICE and cannot blame Rogaine. If you do your research and do not just jump in with a leap of faith hoping for a miracle, you will be much better off in the end. Trust me.</li>
    <li> Stay away from the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m vain. I&#x27;m in my low 30s and my hair is thinning. I&#x27;ve read many places that the drug in Rogaine really does work, so I&#x27;ve started using it. It&#x27;s been about a month now, so can&#x27;t say for results yet, but I can say that the foam is TERRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sticky, hard to get in the right place, leaves a buildup on the scalp that itches (use twice a day as recommended and you&#x27;ll feel like a sunburn is peeling on your head) and God help you if you get it ON any of your hair because it will clot it into a hardened mess like the strongest hairspray can in the world emptied all in one spot on your head. By the way, it is impossible to get it just on your scalp and not in your hair (unless you are completely bald).</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and it has completely reversed his hair loss. It is really easy to apply and isn&#x27;t messy at all. Good buy</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for years on the front of my head and it has done a great job of maintaining what I have. I did slack off on using it a few months back and my hair started to get thin. So, I started using it again and now it is back to the way it was before. Now they say it does not work for the front of your head, however this has not been my experience.  I find the foam does hold your hair pretty good as long as you do not mess with for the rest of the day. Be sure to wash you hand before and after using the product to reduce the absorption into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now some people may notice some shedding after using the product, you will probably freak out because your loosing more hair while using a product that is suppose to grow hair. This normal, stay focused and continue to use the product. Your hair will shed and come back thicker and fuller. Also, at the first sign of hair loss you should start Rogaine, after a certain amount of time I believe Rogaine will be ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use other products as part of my hair loss regimen, they are [[ASIN:B000NNURTS -  DS Labs (aka Revita) - High Performance Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo, 180 Milliliter liquid (View amazon detail page)]] for shampooing my hair. For a conditioner I use [[ASIN:B001M25ONS Nioxin Scalp Therapy #2 - Natural Hair - Noticeably Thinning (4.2 oz.)]].</li>
    <li> Well there is no fast, overnight cure for baldness.  Does it help? I’ve use it faithful and this product has shown very little results. I’m not a vain 23 year either. People will take one for what one is……….</li>
    <li> I have been using rogaine for over two years now and I have not seen much improvement HOWEVER I am not sure if there has been any more loss.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working but I do know it tastes awful. I suggest eating it with peanut butter or honey.</li>
    <li> Rogaine isn&#x27;t bad but I am. Who wants to have a ritual they have to do twice a day just to have hair? I&#x27;d rather just be bald and be able to say that I don&#x27;t put tingling cream on my head because I want to pretend I&#x27;m still young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not young and I never will be again. Why do I want to be? I hated being young. I was miserable. I am actually much happier now. Rogaine didn&#x27;t bring me happiness but it&#x27;s for a different sort of person, you know, a much more terrible person.</li>
    <li> In fact, 2 of them was broken I just throw them in trash. I just lost my money.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it can.  My dermatologist recommended this product when I showed him the growing loss of hair at the front of my head.  I was not interested in having a &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; of receding hair.  You must continue to use it.  If you do not, the hair growth will cease.  Although the product is marketed for men, my dermatologist recommended I use it.  Older women, like myself, who are losing their hair, should seriously consider this product.  Check with a dermatologist first for his advice.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that it hasn&#x27;t grown hair...just not much and not very quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 8 months now and, yes, there are what I would call &amp;#34;sprouts&amp;#34; of new hair, but it  just hasn&#x27;t happened very quickly and these &amp;#34;sprouts&amp;#34; don&#x27;t seem to be growing in length.  I&#x27;ll stay the course, however, and give it a few more months to see if there is any more progress.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with thinning hair since I was 21.  I am now almost 30.  I tried a bunch of different shampoos to keep the hair I had and kept thinking that the reason I was losing hair was stress.  I finally gave in and tried this stuff out.  It has indeed regrown my hair and in more places than its guaranteed to work.  It has also regrown hair in the front of my scalp as well as the crown.  I wouldn&#x27;t tell you to expect to have hair from when you were a teen but if you want to regrow what you have and at least fill out your hairline this stuff may work for you.  Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different so it may not work for you.  The foam is easier to use than the liquid and acts like a mouse so keep that in mind when you&#x27;re styling your hair.</li>
    <li> It works for me. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> the price for this was great and so was the shipping. but the product leaves flakes in your hair after it dries and it wont come out unless you wash your hair again. we used the liquid one before and it did not leave any residue</li>
    <li> I have been using rogaine for several years now and I am happy with it. My hair loss stopped. I hope it remains this way.</li>
    <li> After a month I discontinued it.  My scalp was dry and scaly. Of course, no results with only&lt;br /&gt;a month use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day for about a year and my friends have all commented on seeing more hair on my head and they don&#x27;t even know I am using anything. It hasn&#x27;t given me a full head of hair, but it certainly has improved my look. The foam application is easy to use and works much like hair product except it doesn&#x27;t do anything to keep your hair straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it&#x27;s worthwhile to continue using this product after a year of use.</li>
    <li> this product definitely works with continued use. However, it is extremely important to use the amount that the product recommends. I&lt;br /&gt;applied more of this hair treatment than recommended which gave me weird chest pain, cardiac rhythm problems. So i stopped using it.  Keep in mind that Minoxidil happens to be a medication used to treat patients with heart beat irregularities. So if you are going to use it, be sure to use just as directed. If so, you should have no problems. I stopped because I know i may get tempted to use more than advised. Otherwise, this product certainly works.</li>
    <li> The description needs to be clean that this is meant more for the apex of head, NOT receding hairline.</li>
    <li> Husband and son use this husband started even before the FDA approved it we used to crush pills mix w/liquid</li>
    <li> I stopped using it after Summer of 2014 after nearly 2-3 years of using it. I thought it didn&#x27;t really do anything, and it was starting to irritate my scalp. By Thanksgiving, I was getting comments from almost everyone about how I was thinning and fast. I hopped back on, albeit on a once a day schedule on weekdays only to keep irritation down. After 3-4 months, I started to look fuller again. I think I&#x27;m back to &amp;#34;peak&amp;#34;, but not as full as I was before stopping last Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips to people trying it out: you really have to give it 3-4 months to start to see results. I mean, the hair has to sprout and then grow to a good length before you can visibly see it from a distance. Also, if it irritates you, apply in the AM on weekdays like I do, so irritation is kept at a minimal. I also apply topical corticosteroids on weekends if necessary. It&#x27;s a hassle, but alternative is to let thinning take it&#x27;s course.</li>
    <li> I use this for my receding hairline. It&#x27;s hard to tell if there&#x27;s been any improvement. I still have dying follicles up front; maybe they&#x27;re getting less better?</li>
    <li> So, let me see if I get it right: anytime you see some product dedicated to combat hair loss you feel like you&#x27;re reading about just another scam. Correct? Usually that&#x27;s what happens with me. But since I am a doctor, I talked with some dermatologist friends and they told me that, even though it doesn&#x27;t work for everybody, minoxidil (the product used for Rogaine) is still one of the best therapeutics to stop hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it, on a regular basis, and the truth is that slowly and progressively started seeing very nice results. The trick is consistency and perseverance, though. Don&#x27;t expect this to work from night to day or to work if you don&#x27;t follow the instructions. But if you do, there really is a very good chance that you can finally a nice solution to your hair loss problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been loosing hair for many years and there is no one magic product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is your life style that will make the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Rogaine works and is a starting point, it will not work for everyone, reverse heavily balding hair or is the only solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do prefer Rogaine Foam over the liquid because of the easy application. This makes it easy to use and doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere. It doubles as a styling foam so you do not need to put more unnecessary chemicals on your head. You only need this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a year of using this, I do not experience any major side effects besides occasional heaviness on my head but I can&#x27;t be certain that this is caused by Rogaine. There maybe other factors involed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as hair growth is concerned, I experience a lot less hair loss and some growth, which is good news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do not use just Rogaine by itself, I found it works better with other products and life style changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will highlight them below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Exercise: Do cardio at least 3 times a week. You must sweat. If you exercise and are not sweating, you are not doing it right or hard enough. I prefer playing a sport that I like (tennis) in conjunction with weight work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Eat healthy: Eat organic good without pesticides/GMO. Avoid processed foods, meats and diary. Eat lots of greens that is organic and wash it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Juice it: If you can&#x27;t get all the veggies, then juice! I recommend this juicer [[ASIN:B000MDHH06 Breville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain 700-Watt Juice Extractor]] and this book to get you started [[ASIN:0778801810 The Juicing Bible]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Stop using any unnecessary products you do not need. This includes hairsprays, gels, pastes, or even conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Use an Organic Hair Loss Shampoo such as this one [[ASIN:B00FH692PQ Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label), 16 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.Reduce Stress: If you do all the above, stress should be reduced because diet and exercise plays an important role in stress alleviation. But work and environment is also important stress factors so take these into considerations.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product hoping to get back some hair lost over the years, so far it seems to be making my hair look fuller so i hope with continued use it gets back some of what I have lost!</li>
    <li> Most of my hair loss was at the front of my head and I know they don&#x27;t advertise for growth in that spot. Like many of you, I had nothing to lose. As expected, I freaked out the first few weeks when I lost even more hair. This is normal though. After six weeks I and many others started noticing a difference. After 10 weeks....omg! I have people telling me all the time that I look 10 years younger. It keeps filling in and getting thicker all over. I love this stuff! Very easy to use. It actually helps style my hair. I also took before and after pics to make sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy. My first can also lasted 8 weeks. I hope this works for other guys as it has for me. My confidence is back in a way.</li>
    <li> My husband cant live without it. It helps regrow hair plus it makes his hair look full and in place.</li>
    <li> it worked for me took  2 months to show results   back area filled in   center area filled in, front over far head still working on it used 5 months worth to this point</li>
    <li> FAST shipping ++A got it the date they mentioned.    This product has prooven to work. But you must use DHT Blocker to prevent HAIRLOSS.   This product grows hair but not prevent it from falling off.  I learnt this by going to  [...] . Please keep in mind i am not affiliated with any company.     THIS PRODUCT WILL NOT WORK ALONE ** MUST COMBINE REGIMENT**    Rogaine &#x3D; GROWS HAIR but not prevent it from loosing it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I found this product for such great price. I received it very quick and really satisfied with everything. I suggest to all this goods</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but read a lot of good reviews on amazon so I decided to give it a try. Well I have to say I&#x27;ve seen some good progress over the first month I have been using it. I&#x27;m hoping I continue to see progress in the months to come. Give it a try...if it doesn&#x27;t work for you...u should know within the first 3 month supply.    The only downside is I go through about 1 bottle every 3 weeks...they don&#x27;t seem to last quite a month for me.</li>
    <li> Been using this for last six mths. Had used propecia before, with side effects.  This is very easy to apply, dries very well. Has a slight smell, not offending.  Once it dries the smell is gone.   My wife mentioned that there seems to be more hair on my head than before...  so seems to be working. The hair growth is still very short...will see in another  3 mths where we are...</li>
    <li> It is a very bad product. I can not use it well. The foam can not be taken out after you used it for two or three times.Also it can not be returned. I do not recommen to but this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 9 months and not sure how much it is helping me regrow hair.  However, I think it&#x27;s helping me hold on to what I have.  If it is regrowing it&#x27;s coming back finer.  I think it&#x27;s worth using, but you have to be patient and diligent with using it.  I use it on my receding hairline (which it the instructions say it&#x27;s not meant for that) and I use it for the top (vertex) of my head, which is what it&#x27;s intended for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a paste to style my hair in the morning so I&#x27;ll dampen my hair and apply the Rogaine in the morning and then let it sit for at least 5 min, but I try to let it go longer.  Then I dampen my hair again and apply the paste.</li>
    <li> Started using this product on November 10, It has been 3 month now and I have experience little results. The hair that it is growing is thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a long term treatment so I will continue to use it for 3 more month and then make a final statement. Althoug I was expecting a little more growth on my scalp, I give a 4 star and recomend you try it.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!  After purchasing this product, I learned (the hard way) that there are certain types of baldness that this product works on better than others.  Unfortunately, mine is not one of them.  So I&#x27;m using the product anyway in the hopes that maybe I&#x27;ll get lucky but in my case, I don&#x27;t think that will happen.  Read the fine print and do the research (myself included!  That is one of the dangers of buying things online, I think -- especially unique or very specific types of items.  It&#x27;s too easy to miss something that is critical.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other things over the past year before Rogaine because I didn&#x27;t want to make the life long commitment to it.  The other things did not work and as a result my hair was getting thinner and thinner.  My brother and brother in law had been using the foam and said they did notice a difference so I figured its worth a shot.  I use this in the morning right after I towel dry my hair.  It is kind of a pain to put in because my hair is a little longer and while the box only says to put it on your crown only I&#x27;ve been applying it from the crown all the way to the front.  I also use lipogaine at night all over the middle of my head.  I&#x27;ve only been using it solidly for about 2 to 3 weeks and I have seen more hair loss right now.  I am hoping this means it is working as my old hairs are falling out so my new thicker hairs come grow now.  I will update after continued use.  My hope is to maintain at least until all this hype about stem cell regrowth actually comes to fruition.  Hair loss has been a bit hard on my self esteem but I&#x27;m trying to push through.</li>
    <li> I give this product no stars but 1 is required at least to post this!! It never helped me grow any hair back and over time just came to a point that I am getting older and my hair will never be the same...basically I am at the stage of acceptance plus this stuff I hate to say it but cost me a few months of problems in the bedroom with my wife...and that is never a good feeling to a man. I&#x27;d rather have a bald head and a vibrant sex life than a magic potion with no results. Guys heed my warning...use it if you want just not for too long. Don&#x27;t believe me check some online forums about sexual side effects due to use, very interesting the amount people who had this problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, it really does work, only thing is ... U have to keep on using it</li>
    <li> I was pretty worried about buying this but am glad I did! Its been a little over a month and already some of my friends have noticed my hair returning. What I like about this is that it is very easy to use. The directions say that this will not work on the front of your head for receding hairline, however, that is where I am using it and it is working. The only tip I would give is to make sure you store it in a cool place or the foam dissipates quickly from your hand. Furthermore, the directions indicate to wash your hand in cold water first which helps keep the foam from melting.</li>
    <li> Nice product.Effective but requires regular use and you can see the difference only after using it for 2 months regularly.</li>
    <li> 6 months ago I purchased rogaine as my hair had started thinning a few years back when I hit my late 20s. I kept using rogaine religiously, but still lost hair no matter what. This story is the same for many of you on here, I am quite sure. The problem is, for many people rogaine simply doesnt work and will make you lose more hair, which is what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My quest to regrow my hair didnt end here, however. A lot of research through published scientific journals gave me new insight to how hair loss works, and what you can do to stop/reverse it. New treatments are coming online, specifically Biochanin-a. From journals I read on the ncbi pubmed, biochanin-a is reducing DHT on the scalp, which is what is inhibiting hair growth. I purchased a product that contains biochanin right here on amazon, [[...]]. So far after 8 weeks of use, im noticing much thicker hair, and my wife thinks its just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your one of the lucky people that rogaine works for, then good for you, but a huge percentage of us will NOT have any luck with rogaine, and you will be left hairless and penniless from buying it.</li>
    <li> been using it for 5 years now but it grows a little, but I&#x27;&#x27;ll keep on using it.</li>
    <li> It works where it claims it will work as long as you stick with it. At first, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference, but beginning in the 2nd month, I could tell a difference on the top of my head.  Miracles?  No.  Does what it claims?  Yes!</li>
    <li> The product was used properly but no results were found. I would not recommend this item to anybody. Oh well I guess.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me and I ended up loosing more hair at a more rapid pace than before. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t use it exactly as instructed - I would be lazy sometimes. But I started getting lazy when I didn&#x27;t see any results at all in the initial few weeks.   They do claim that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. Sadly, I was in that group.</li>
    <li> Not sure of the outcome yet....no new growth, but hopeful....I am only halfway on my first can. We&#x27;ll have to see....</li>
    <li> Hate the foam. A waste of money and there are no returns for this product. The foam does not get to your scalp and ends up all over your hair wasting product. Wish I would have ordered the regular solution.</li>
    <li> We could not get the foam in a generic.  The pricing was okay.  Not any better results with the foam than the liquid.  Sticking with the generic liquid at a better price.</li>
    <li> It is such an awesome thing.</li>
    <li> less messy than the regular liquid and easy to target specific areas</li>
    <li> After about a month of using it my wife noticed I got more hair. I did not really notice it, but then again, I don&#x27;t really care, she does.&lt;br /&gt;This foam is odorless and easy to use. One should follow the application routine rather strictly to see and sustain the positive result, as far as I understand from the instructions provided.&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine does not promise you miracles, only slow but consistent improvement in the amount, thickness and quality of hair. Slow here is the keyword, so you better be prepared to buy this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I noticed that the part in my hair was getting wider and wider. Then I saw a photo showing the crown of my head, and oh my goodness -- I&#x27;m going bald! It was a terrible shock. I bought Rogaine and started using it according to the directions. In four months, I could definitely see a big difference. There were &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hairs all over my scalp. Having started with Rogaine for Women, I switched to Rogaine for Men because it&#x27;s stronger. I now have a thick head of hair, so I just use a little once a day to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam is good if you have a place to put it (a bald spot or a wide part). It is less greasy than the liquid. My hair is thick now, so the foam gets wasted on hair rather than scalp. I&#x27;m going to use it up and get the liquid drops next time. That way I can use the dropper to get all the way down to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman, about 60 years old. I&#x27;ve had no side effects from using Rogaine. Just thick hair on my head. My facial hair has not changed, nor has it anywhere else on my body. My eyebrows may be a little thicker (a good thing).</li>
    <li> Nothing against the product itself cos i didn&#x27;t get to receive it. Tried to ship it internationally but got withheld due to aerosol content. Fine. So I tried to return it to the retailer but found out that they refuse to entertain returns of flammable goods, even though they are to be transported on land. Doesn&#x27;t make any sense retailer.</li>
    <li> Every day is a great product, but I ordered two, but one was a normal product, one was outdated goods.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 3 months. I have seen noticeable thickness. I am not bald, but do have receding hairline and while I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s keeping it at bay, the hair I do have is thicker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months now twice a day just like it says, and I definitely have more hair but not quite as much as I had hoped I&#x27;d have by now, it does say most men see results in 4 months, my derm told me it could take up to 12 so we shall see</li>
    <li> When I first realized I had a receding hairline, disappointment was not the word.  Being in my early 20s made it feel even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon heavy research, I found there are a couple of ways to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; hair loss.  But at the end of the day, I realized this was going to a battle that I wasn&#x27;t going to win.  Finasteride (prescription drug) was one thing I found.  Another was minoxidil (a.k.a rogaine) which I immediately bought.  I began supplementing biotin daily and bought an expensive shampoo/conditioner specifically for hair loss.  Aside from this, the only other remedy was hair transplant (something like Bosley) which I am seriously thinking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is about 4-5 months of rogaine use.  Rogaine works but not as well for a receding hairline which is why the company is reluctant to advertise this.  Application is pretty simple.  Rub it in the designated areas twice a day.  The foam dries pretty quickly and it has no noticeable odor which is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mainly, I wanted to see new hairs grow.  This product did cause new hair to grow.  At the two month mark, I could notice very fine hair growing.  But it wasn&#x27;t significant enough to notice and close examination was required to notice this.  At the four month mark, there were several new hairs that were much more noticeable.  It sounds great, but the amount of new hair was insignificant so it still looks like I have a receding hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now looking into Bosley.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone suffering from hair loss because it works.  But it is no miracle potion and the results are less than phenomenal.  It may work better on the crown of your head but this was not the problem area for me.</li>
    <li> Saved my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you wash and condition after&lt;br /&gt;use. It can dry your hair out.&lt;br /&gt;Easier to use than the eye dropper version of Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you massage it into scalp.</li>
    <li> i am using my 2nd bottle already. but i don&#x27;t see any slight improvement. my 2nd purchase was even the 3 bottles in one pack. could this be a waste of money..and time?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while now and it works great. As a woman, I have fairly long hair and had problems with getting the foam down to my scalp at first. Here&#x27;s how I apply it now and it works great: I use a long-tailed hair color brush and bowl. I sqirt the foam into the bowl and use the tail of the brush to part my hair, then dip the tip of the brush in the foam and brush it on my scalp at the part. Repeat at about half-inch intervals. It only takes a couple of minutes and it gets the foam to my scalp without getting it all over my hair. The brush is stiff so you can use it to massage the foam into the scalp as you apply it. You can buy a set of hair color brushes and a plastic bowl for about 5 bucks on Amazon, just search for &amp;#34;hair color brush and bowl&amp;#34;. Problem solved!</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s true item .. i have good result with it</li>
    <li> Try and learn guys, it may work for you, it may not.  For me, it actually accelerates my hair loss by about 10x.  Not only does it make my head itchy, and my hair sticky, it make my hair fall out very heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When taking a hair regrowth product, it&#x27;s crucial that you take pictures of your head every single day, 1 or 2 x a day.  So, if you think about getting this product or another hair loss product, make sure you get into the mindset of taking constant pictures.  I took pictures everyday for about 1 month, and noticed that I had a huge bald spot on the top of my head.  However, I am in luck, because this product works for me: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KYXSF00/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient in this product is Propecia (http://www.drugs.com/propecia.html) and it is working excellent for me. My bald spot is gone, and my hair is regrowing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take this review with a grain of salt.  What may work for one person, may not work for another.  You just have to try.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for about 9 months.  We think it has helped prevent further hair loss and there is a small amount of new growth.  My husband is very happy with just not losing any additional hair and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> horrible, only works 3 times then goes dead</li>
    <li> Product works okay. But why has the price jumped from in the $30&#x27;s to over $50??&lt;br /&gt;Product itself: if you have a brush cut, it will be easy to apply. If your is at all long, be prepared for the majority of the foam to wet your surrounding hair-especially if your hair issue is thinning hair and not some big horkin&#x27; bald spot on your vertex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try a store brand version of monoxidil and also might give the liquid version a try instead of the foam.</li>
    <li> Totally cool, it works just don&#x27;t stop using it!</li>
    <li> Im using it, lets hope for the best.</li>
    <li> My product was sent quickly and I had no hassle from the shipper.  Would definitely use them again.</li>
    <li> I must to accidentally selected the aerosol, it is messy and I do not think that it will last for three months like the liquid one. Hate it, Hate it, Hate it</li>
    <li> Unless you are bald, the foam will cling to the existing hair and will basically be useless to you.&lt;br /&gt;Plus there is no way to actually measure how much actual liquid is being poured on to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;My prefrence is Rogaine liquid drops.</li>
    <li> Straight from the package insert: &amp;#34;In studies with minoxidil topical solution 5%, hair regrowth has not been shown to last longer than 48 weeks of continuous treatment in large clinical trials.&amp;#34;  WTF, if you do get some regrowth it has NOT been shown to last longer than a year?!?!  Putting this stuff on twice a day for results that have NOT been shown to last longer than 48 weeks in large clinical trials?!?!?  Why did this even get&lt;br /&gt;approved for use then?!?</li>
    <li> Rogaine for Men Hair Regrowth Treatment  does not work ..will not work..if it did Bruce Willis would have hair...Disappointed !</li>
    <li> I like the foam much better then the liquid dropper application. It is easier to apply and dries much quicker, not leave that \\&quot;oily look\\&quot; on your scalp. It actually adds volume and hold to my hair during the day. I use the foam in the morning and the liquid with the dropper at night. The liquid is cheaper so I save money that way.</li>
    <li> My hunny ordered this on here. He recently started using it.... no clue why, he has a perfect beautiful head of hair but swears he is thinning. I guess he just wants to keep it that way and continues to re-purchase, so he obviously loves it. He&#x27;d be gorgeous even if he lost his whole head of hair, but the point is, this helps him feel more confident in keeping the hair he has. Great price on here, considering what I have seen him shell out for it at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for years and it has prevented me from becoming totally bald. It also is a wonderful hair dressing because it makes hair totally manageable.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I converted to applying fresh canned coconut milk. All my hair grew back in three months.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
    <li> I believe it&#x27;s equally safe and effective as the brand name Rogaine. I definitely recommend it for people who might need it. If the shipping rates are reduced it would be the most competitive product for minoxidil on the market.</li>
    <li> Made me gain a lot of weight</li>
    <li> I have purchased one from Costco, and have just finished one bottle now.  So far, a little bit hair grows.  Hopefully, it will continue.</li>
    <li> Product works well without any residue or smell.  Easy to use and apply.  I would recommend for any man with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as I was seeing a bit of thinning on my scalp. I bought a three month supply of this product and did not see any results so I stopped using it. I will say that the foam application is easy to apply and leaves little mess. It didn&#x27;t work for me though..</li>
    <li> Perfect, I have used it for 4 years now and can see growth coming into the front and sides and crown.  It took me about 1/2 year to start seeing results; but now..I see a lot of improvement and others notice it too!</li>
    <li> You MUST use it on a regular basis......otherwise it wont work and wait 2-3 month to see results :):) Good product</li>
    <li> Actually two or three weeks my hair start to grow new one. The only problem is how long time those new hair would be kept. I wonder if the new hair can keep for ten years or longer.</li>
    <li> Good one. Its really working. It stopped my hair loss. Need to check hair growth. This is my second month.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t return this product that doesn&#x27;t help grow or prevent hair loss anywhere except on the top of your head.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband so he could try to grow some facial hair. He&#x27;s 26 and looks like he could be in high school with the amount of facial hair he had. His friend recommended that he use Rogaine on his face to help it grow in. It does say its only for the scalp but we figured if it worked for his friend, it was probably safe to try. He now has a full goatee (sp?) not quite a beard yet but he is really happy with it. He hasn&#x27;t used it as faithfully as he should have but the results are great:)</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it is working for me yet or not....slightly at 2 months in but still not using daily as I should. Once I use longer ill update.</li>
    <li> Just helped my colleague buy it before, after useing it for 3 months my coworker is so appreciative that an effective result has occured on his head ,he has been confident of his life again.Thanks for Rogaine,Thanks for amazon,it is really amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff works so good for me.  I know the direction say it will only work on the crown of your head, but works for my hairline as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If this thing is useful, the leaders will not be bald</li>
    <li> I started lose my hair in my mid twenties and I thought there was nothing I could do about it. My father is bald, both of my grandfathers are bald. I was about to give up when I saw a commercial for Rogaine and decided to try it. After a few months of use, my hair stopped shedding. After a few more months of use, I noticed a lot of hair regrowth, especially where the bald spot on the back of my head used to be. This product works, plain and simple. About 6 weeks ago, I added  Skingenixx Hair Regrowth and Thickening Shampoo and the results are even better [[ASIN:B00VSC1C6A Skingenixx Professional Strength Hair Regrowth and Thickening Shampoo]] – also a great product that really works. Two thumbs up here.</li>
    <li> Very fast distribution and excellent product. Will buy this also in future.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say much about the long-term effect right now, let&#x27;s see what will happen.</li>
    <li> No noticeable results</li>
    <li> If you are losing hair. Rogaine foam is the ultimate treatment to halt the progression of the hair loss and in some cases regrow more hair as well. Previous 5% non-foam version was very oily and would make my scalp itch like crazy but not he Rogaine foam. The foam is like a revolution, it&#x27;s non-greasy and dries up quickly. It also keeps my hair in place and I don’t have to use a gel or a mousse.&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle lasts me only 15 days though.&lt;br /&gt;Costly but well worth in your &amp;#34;stop hair loss express armamentarium&amp;#34;. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The product is really working even I am not following full instruction could see results wit in 3 months. however product was much cheaper when bought first time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of this stuff.  I have seen some great improvements on my second bottle and I am very happy with the results.  I&#x27;ve even started to see some small hairs coming out of the temple region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also started to notice some scary side effects.  Towards the end of the second bottle, I started to get chest pains and heart palpitations.  I&#x27;m 35 yrs old and I&#x27;ve never had a heart attack but it sure felt like I was having one.  One day after my workout, I felt sharp chest pains and felt very sick.  That went on for a day or so.  I googled some of the side effects of Rogaine and noticed that some mentioned the symptoms I was having.  I finally concluded that I was using too much product so I stopped using it for a day or so and the effects went away.  I now use only two small dots on my temple region and one at the crown and spread it all over the top of my head.  That seems to be the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, don&#x27;t overdo it, be patient, and hopefully you will see some good results.</li>
    <li> Getting older and a great looking friend told me just use Rogaine.  She looks great and I decided to use this, too.  Started with women&#x27;s type which didn&#x27;t seem to do much and then started with the foam.  Great.  Love it.  Think it is working on my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and have had pretty good results. The areas that have been bald longest will recover the slowest. so far I am still seeing the older areas growing back, although it is much slower than the first spots which had started to re-grow at 2-3 months.   Consistent useage is the key!</li>
    <li> Everyone is going to get different results with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years (in combo with Propecia and two HTs) and have have had pretty good results. If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle cure this isn&#x27;t it. If you&#x27;re looking to slow hair loss then I recommend this product (in combo with Propecia (use the generic stuff for a fraction of the price). Definitely go with the foam as the liquid is harder to use and I found that it causes dandruff (for me).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the 4 months recommended to see results…I see a little bit more hair than before so I do think it&#x27;s working.  My hair is just thinning a bit on top so I still have a good bit of hair….it&#x27;s a bit tricky to make sure the product gets to the scalp well, so I think I use more than suggested.</li>
    <li> Been using Rogaine since being diagnosed with alopecia areata incognito. Dermatologist recommended it to me even though the box clearly states do not use if you are a woman. I was skeptical at first, but it has helped keep the hair I have and grow some peach fuzz along my hairline. I have used Rogaine alongside of topical steroids and shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;The downside is once I stopped using it for a few months, i&#x27;ve noticed my hair going back to the way it once was..thin and more thin.</li>
    <li> great product...fast shipping</li>
    <li> brpught them for my friend，dont it works or not yet.</li>
    <li> There is slight progress,  however still i am facing hair fall. I have completed one and half months only,  i will keep using it for another 5 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 years .  I  noticed that my hair loss reduced a lot and  a few new small hair growed  .</li>
    <li> I received it week ago so I did not use it yet.&lt;br /&gt;However, I belive it must woking for my hair as soon as I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I will report after use rogaine few month later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thx.</li>
    <li> Ordered it and read details on the box...determined it could not be used for anything but a bald spot (not stated on the ad). Tried to return the unopened package, but that isn&#x27;t allowed. Amazon doesn&#x27;t disclose that this purchase is un-returnable...this is outrageous.</li>
    <li> very poor quality does not work.Paul</li>
    <li> I am in my 4th month of using Rogaine and Propecia together. The results are nothing short of amazing. I would estimate I have 50% more hair on the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was balding on the crown, and frontal parts of the head, and I apply to Rogaine to the entire top of my head. I was told that the clinical study was only performed on the crown of the head, so legally they are only allowed to advertise that it works there. It doesn&#x27;t; it works all over your head if you are experiencing male-pattern baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Family and friends are amazed, and now everyone is asking what my secret is. Stop using stuff that isn&#x27;t proven to work, and costs MORE than Rogaine (like thinning shampoos, etc.) because they DON&#x27;T WORK. This is very inexpensive on a monthly basis, and coupled with Propecia, has been a godsend for my 29-year-old not-so-bald-anymore head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the follicle takes about 5 years from thinning to death, you can expect to see a regrowth of up to 5 years of hair. This product, however, will NOT regrow follicles that have died completely, but can regrow hair that still has a root without visible hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, my results are amazing, and I am going to keep using as long as  I need to!</li>
    <li> Seemed to be in order, then I realized it is only meant for the crown of the scalp.  Didn&#x27;t bother applying.</li>
    <li> Thought it was helping at first, but after more time it doesn&#x27;t seem to have worked for me. I didn&#x27;t have a huge problem towards the back of my head (where it says it works best).</li>
    <li> Use it for first time and waiting for results. Lets see whats next. Buy it!!! and see if its works on you.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work out for my husband, but I must admit his androgenic alopecia is quite old, so the product may still be good for men with new onset problems. Very easy to use, nice smell and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residual.</li>
    <li> Product OK, but expires soon.  Check the expiration date before you buy.</li>
    <li> i tried this and i want to stop losing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;please don&#x27;t try this and don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;if you buy this you would not be a good</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t smell and is easy to apply, but after a year of using going to likely stop once I&#x27;ve used up my supply. While I&#x27;ve heard good results for some, unfortunately I&#x27;m not one of them. Hard to fight genetics and nature, but worth the shot if you&#x27;re losing your own hair.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical. But after 3 months my hair looks back to normal. It does take the full 3 months for best results. Definitely recommend it especially since I&#x27;m only 25.</li>
    <li> This product works! I started losing the hair on top of my head. I tried Nioxium, it worked a little but the hair was till thinning. So went on Rogaine foam. Five weeks later I tell my barber, who has been cutting my hair a year , I&#x27;m on Rogaine. She says Let me take a look. And tells its working. She can see new hair growing. And she showed in the mirror. The long hair is my old hair and the short hairs were the new hair coming out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on it now for 7 weeks and have fuller hair and NO Side Effects.</li>
    <li> This product basically synchronizes shedding. Rather than encouraging new hair your shedding and regrowth periods become synchronized. Giving the illusion you have more hair. You have to use this product for the rest of your life to make your remaining hair appear thicker for a few months then thinner a few months when you shed again and again and again. I don&#x27;t want to deal with constant up and down swings. This is not the product for me.</li>
    <li> Best used by those is in early stages of hairs loss. I originally used this along with Propecia and seemed to have good results, not a miracle cure-all but it does slow the progression of hair loss on the crown as indicated by the manufacturer. Use as directed - yes I&#x27;d recommend it over nothing at all. The Foam is very convenient and preferred over the eye dropper liquid version.</li>
    <li> Rogaine (Minoxidil) is meant for the back side of the head. I use it in the front where I had started seeing hair loss. It is working on the 3rd month mark and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT ONLY HELPS WITH REGROWTH, NOT TO STOP HAIR LOSS!!! All the bad reviews you see are because people most likely only tried this product alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take Finasteride to block DHT. Had I started Finasteride earlier I wouldn&#x27;t need this. If you are thinking about using Rogain, get a DHT blocker. I am happy with the results and the price at Amazon beats retail at $35 for 1 can.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work , the only thing you will get is disbelief. You only grow hair that can only be seen by a microscope and this speeds up hair loss.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I have been using this in conjunction with Finasteride, and have seen very noticeable regrowth of hair in just three months.</li>
    <li> Well it worked for awhile, takes a lot of maintenance though needs to be applied a couple times a day, and then when i sweated it got in my eyes and overall I felt like it was not worth it.  I just gave up on it</li>
    <li> the only thing about rogaine its you can quit if you start it will be the worst still wondering what should i do</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 2 weeks now, and in 2 weeks I have lost the hair I would have lost in probably 2 years. My hair looks worse than ever. Granted, the instructions tells you that some shedding might occur for hair that you would have lost anyways, however, I am loosing weak/thin, but also and thick, normal looking hair. My scalp is not red, or inflamed, so I do not think is the result of an allergic reaction. After all the shedding, I freaked out, and have started to make much more serious online research about Rogaine. There is very little &amp;#34;formal&amp;#34; information that seems credible... however, there are plenty of anecdotal cases online where apparently hair lose has happened that has not been compensated by new hair growth even after years of use, or even after stopping the treatment. Apparently there are also cases where the treatment has worked, but has taken between 6 months and 2 years for any results to be evident. So, it might be that the effects of Rogaine are a lot more variable than advertised. It might work for you, it might make things a lot worse. Rogaine does not waranty that you will recover the hair you shed. So you decide if you want to take a gamble. I&#x27;ve decided to stop Rogaine and loose the hair I have left slowly, rather than look 50 in just a few months.</li>
    <li> While this product does not grow much new hair, it has allowed me to keep what I have for many years. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> 1 bottle is not 1 month supply, maybe 2 weeks at best. very expensive and no gurentee it will work.</li>
    <li> Mixed reviews, some great some are not, was worrying if its worth trying.... Still decided to try, went with foam choice since it is easier to. Manage and after 2.5 months of use i already noted some hair regrow. He only applies it to posterior scalp hair loss area, not full head. We haven&#x27;t noticed any initial expected hair loss, but know that i see the regrowth we are very happy. Hope it will continue since its still very early. We are definitely will be using this product further.</li>
    <li> use it preventatively when my hair began to thin, dermatologist directed me right to this. works just fine. just don&#x27;t let cats or dogs around it, it&#x27;s toxic to them.</li>
    <li> If you don’t want to have a mess when using minoxidil try minoxidil in a form of foam. It is easy to use a foam minoxidil than regular liquid minoxidil, it will not mess your head when your applying some minoxidil.</li>
    <li> my head get more empty than before, I still using this to see any changes but there is no change</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any results yet.  So this review is to early.  It is easy to use..</li>
    <li> And my wife says she can see some new growth. My barber also said he saw improvement. Sticking with it with crossed fingers.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for several years and it has slowed the rate of my hair loss and seems to me that it conditions my hair. I would give it a try if I was having above average hair loss to see if it would slow the rate of loss or start regrowth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to tell if Rogaine actually did anything at all. After using it for about a year (and taking Propecia), I haven&#x27;t noticed much hair loss, but I certainly haven&#x27;t gained any. I&#x27;m only taking it to stay on the safe side, but I think most of the foam probably gets soaked up by your hair and maybe only about 25-50% of it reaches your scalp. Of course, this may differ for people with shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Bear with me for a second while I make the case of how this product is incredibly impractical to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not comment on whether or not this actually produces hair or not, because I managed to get myself to use it for only 6 weeks. Then I had to stop, and they only promise results from 2 to 4 months after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons why this is impractical:&lt;br /&gt;1- Short hair: You have to keep your hair quite short if you&#x27;re to be able to actually get the product to the scalp, depends on how thick your hair is to begin with. In my case it has to be really short. And the problem is, that it has to be short for the rest of your life, because this is how Rogaine works, you have to keep applying it otherwise you lose all the hairs you got. So, if you&#x27;re to become a user of this product you will have to be prepared to have the same very short hairstyle for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- Application: it has to be applied twice a day, and you cannot get your hair wet for 4 hours after each application. What makes this even worse, is that it&#x27;s not neutral on the hair, when it dries up, it actually acts as a hair gel, so for the better part of the day, your hair will have to have this douchy wet looks. And again, this will never stop, this will be the case for the rest of your life. I feel that I cannot emphasize this enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: don&#x27;t be fooled by this product, the impracticalities associated with applying it leave it pointless; even if it will give you some extra hairs, your hair will look wet and short anyway. Be content with how much hair you have or look for other solutions like hair transplantation. This is not a solution. After an extremely intrusive period of 6 weeks of application, I will stop right now and get a life instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Costco&#x27;s Kirkland Minoxidil thing, which was in mini pipet and liquid.&lt;br /&gt;I think that one was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll write some of my experience with this product:&lt;br /&gt;-Makes your hair harden (like when applying mousse or gel) when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;-Foam turns into liquid really quickly, so i dont get why it is even in foam.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells..&amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-Overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could get my money back, I&#x27;d be SO happy.&lt;br /&gt;now thinking I spent like $40 for this crap, I wish i could&#x27;ve used it on food instead.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, please read all conditions and rules to use it</li>
    <li> Updated 3/21/2015  Thought I would update my review, now that I have been using the product for about a year. I have to say that I am pretty please with the results so far. My hair is certainly thicker and in better shape than it was prior to my using Rogaine. I have continued the routine I outlined in my original review below. Now I am not saying that I have the same head of hair as I did in my twenties, I am afraid those days are gone, I can clearly see where my hair is thinner when my hair is wet. However when it is dry, I no longer see my scalp  when there is a light source behind me, as I could before I started using the Rogaine.  Interestingly, I think I am just coming out of a bit of a thinning phase again, though nowhere near as bad as the initial shed I went through when I started using the product. Even during this thinning phase however, my hair never got as thin as it was before I started using the product. However, I seem to be through this phase now, and I am seeing plenty of fine hairs growing in again.As these fine hair mature they do indeed darken and thicken. So I guess what I am trying to say is that you may still go through some cycles of shedding and regrowing.  I guess as long as we get the regrowth, I can deal with the occasional shed. So in synopsis, what I have to say is this is a worthwhile product if you are willing to give it a real try. If it doesn&#x27;t work out for you, it is not the end of the world, I still think the guys who embrace their baldness look much better than the guys who try and cover it up.  I hope that if I reach a point where I am only fooling myself about my hair loss, that someone will let me know, and then I too will embrace the loss, and cut my hair short. But at least for now, that is decision that I do not have to make. I don&#x27;t have any doubts that as of right now, my hair is better off than it was a year ago, and how many times in life do you get to say something like that? Anyway, good luck to all.  Original  PostDefinitely getting new hair growth. I am 42 year old male who always had a thick head of hair. I was quite shocked to notice late last year that my hair was thinning out, specifically in the front left portion of my head. It had never occurred to me that I might have to face thinning hair/baldness, so I took it quite hard. Now I was not bald, but I was beginning to notice more scalp showing through my hair, especially when there is an overhead light. On the advice from my dermatologist, I bought my first can from the drug store, after that, I bought a 3 month supply from Amazon. As far as the cost goes there is no comparison, I think the 3 month supply cost about the same amount as the single can did from the drug store. A can does last me about a month, I am only using it in the thinning area in the front left hand portion of my head, and I try to use the recommended amount of half a capful, twice a day.  Now for the nitty-gritty portion of my review. As others have mentioned before, I think you have to have your mind set prior to begin using this product. I think you have to be prepared to give this product a try for 4 months. I think you need to have reasonable expectations set, and an idea of how far you are willing to go to try and retain your hair. If you are going into this trial unsure if you are going to be able to do complete it, I think I would recommend against using it. You will certainly lose more hair at the onset. I was certainly worse off a month into using the product then I was at the onset. This was very discouraging.  I was seeing some hair growth after  a few weeks, but looking back on this now, I think these were just replacing some of the hair that this product caused to fall out in the first place, and not really new additional hair growing in.  Thankfully these little hairs growing in encouraged me enough to keep going. If I had stopped after 6 weeks, I would have been far worse off.  As I said before, I was not bald but thinning, and my goal was just to try and keep my scalp covered. Now that I am about 4 months in, I can definitely say that I see a lot less scalp showing through, even when there is an overhead light, or I am out and the Sun is overhead. When I part my hair, I see loads of small hair growing in. I also see hair growing in along the front of my hairline, even though the product says it will not work there. Now most of these hair are very fair in color, and do not seem to have much volume on their own,  (I can tell however, that some of the older longer ones are darkening and might be thickening as well. I have some that are dark at the end, but are fair at the base)  However, I think these fair hair are providing me with what I was hoping. Essentially filler, so that I do not see so much scalp through my hair. I do not expect to have as much hair as I did when I was young, I just don&#x27;t want to be in that in between state of having hair, and rocking the bald look. So far it has met my expectations.  I also think it is helpful to have an idea of how far you are willing to go to keep your hair. My dermatologist recommended this product, but also mentioned the idea of propecia. Now I was willing to try this because their did not seem to be too many side effects, however I made up my mind before I started that I was not willing to go that far. Between the possible side effects, and the cost, I did not think it was worth it, and this brings me to my last point. I had to accept the very real possibility that I might lose my hair (and still might). For the first time, I began to take notice of how other men dealt with their hair loss. I have to say, that it is not even close, men who embraced the fact that they are losing/lost their hair, and decided to roll with it , look far better than the guys who try and cover it up. The guys who either shave their hear or cut it real close look far superior to the guys who try and do a comb over type thing. They seem to look far more comfortable and confident, in short, they look good. I decided if this stuff did not work for me, then I will try and embrace the change, and cut my hair short, that would be better than fretting about how it was looking, whether the wind was blowing it out of place, etc. I think that is the best advice I can offer about this whole thing.  However, at least for the moment since this product does seem to be thickening my hair, that is a decision I can put off for now.  Now for the last part of my novella here, as far as the actual routine of using twice a day, it is not too bad when you get in a routine. The first application I usually have to do at the gym in the morning after I shower. My hair is usually wet during this application. This stuff does seem to act like a mousse, holding my hair in place for the rest of the day, so I don&#x27;t use anything else. The second application is at night, shortly before bed, and my hair is usually dry at this application, so I get one wet and one dry application.  Seems to be working for me. The actual application only takes a couple of minutes, and I kind of like the smell. I would also mention that I started taking 3K biotin, which you can buy at a drug store. I also started using that Nexus Shampoo available here on Amazon. Kind of expensive, I seem to like it, though I have only used it a handful of times so far, so I can&#x27;t gauge if it actually does anything.  So in synopsis, here is my review. Working well on thinning hair (not bald), be prepared to give it an extended try or you will certainly be worse off for an aborted try, have reasonable expectations, know how far you are going to go with the whole process, baldness is not the end of the world, and may indeed be a good option. Also if you are going to try this, certainly buy it here rather than at a drug store.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> the package arrived the next day. have been using the foam for 2 years and have seen great results.  this is a much better product than the original formula. I would highly recommend it to any guy out  there who wants to keep what he has and restore some of what he has lost. the sooner you start the more you will  keep.</li>
    <li> I started using the product last Jan 2009 and had to stop on July 2009 because the volume of hair loss almost doubled while the foam. It did show some promise on my first month of regular use per instruction booklet suggests. However, the follicles on the new growth did not hold up, noticing a lot of fine hairs on my comb or whenever I take a shower.  I guess it works on some people, not for me.</li>
    <li> horrible, can&#x27;t return it. And it not what I need</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product at the best price we&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone that can&#x27;t use the regular solution of minoxidil.  I wasn&#x27;t able to use the regular becuase it dried my scalp out too much, but now that I&#x27;ve switched to the foam, my scalp feels much better. Buy this.</li>
    <li> A waste of money. Did twice a day for almost a year. Made my hair worse. Wish I could get my money back. Guess I&#x27;ll stick to shaving my head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been over skeptical of rogain but after many months of use I&#x27;ve noticed thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;also when used in the proper amounts there is no residue, of which I was concerned about</li>
    <li> The exact product like the description with the fair price included the shipping, otherwise, I will wait to talk about the result.</li>
    <li> So everyone knows about Rogaine at this point.  I have been slowly losing my hair for about 5 years.  I started using this product about 3 years ago.  When I did, one of my good friends was also losing his hair and we were losing it at the same rate.  He did not use Rogaine and after 3 years there is a very noticeable difference in hair loss between the two of us.  I have much more hair than he does and I 100% believe it was because of this product.  It is easy to use and inexpensive.  Losing your hair absolutely stinks and with Rogaine I feel I am at least prolonging my fight against it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I used on my hairline as well as crown and have seen great results. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great if you continue using it</li>
    <li> Rogain has worked really well for me, but not crazy about the foam.  I find it is easier to get the dripper deep into my scalp.  The foam just get&#x27;s caught up in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine since a year ago and very happy with the product. The foam version is the right product for me.&lt;br /&gt;Combined with ketoconazole shampoo it&#x27;s effectiveness tends to be more significant and noticeable.</li>
    <li> Just into month #4.  No evidence of any new growth.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any change, but I am not losing more hair. I didn&#x27;t realize until recently that this stuff supposedly only works on the crown area.</li>
    <li> Its a good quality for hair regroth.</li>
    <li> Did not really see any change. Used it for beard growth.</li>
    <li> well, only been just over three weeks can really tell yet</li>
    <li> Just as described. Thank you. Great shipping A++++</li>
    <li> Well... I am still losing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a nervous person... I play with my hair a lot, I don&#x27;t eat well, I never exercise... The fact that this is at least slowing down my hair loss is pretty convincing. Because I treat my body like $hi%</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. I got the drops and they are working pretty well for me but I use a spray bottle. Twice a day. I&#x27;m growing new hair even in my residing line</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using both rogaine and propecia (I know it&#x27;s expensive) and they work really well together. I was losing my hair 4 years ago and I was stressing about it especially when my brothers and friends would joke about it. But I started to use Rogaine and it work but not as fast as I wanted so I started to use propecia and boy in a matter of 1 year not a single joke from them, they don&#x27;t know that I started to use it so I know it&#x27;s working and I can tell myself that my thin bald spot its gone and is back with thick hair. Like a lot of this comments say \\&quot;Do not give up and lose hope\\&quot; keep at it and be patient, I would give it a whole year to start to see results, don&#x27;t go with the 3 or 6 months because you&#x27;re going to lose hair to start with because it will come back thicker and stronger so do not give up. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 5 years together and it&#x27;s fine. The only issue I had with Rogaine is that it raised my high blood pressure but I was using the topical and I switch to the foam and it help a lot.</li>
    <li> So I did this for 3 months strait and recorded video of the results ever week, and after the first 2 months you can see the difference. The only issue is my hair loss is a lost cause, I have to much missing to recover. So If your hair just now starting to thin out, use this, save yourself.</li>
    <li> Is it working?  Hard to know.</li>
    <li> Good product I&#x27;m not sure if it really works though</li>
    <li> .....but didn&#x27;t work for me. Tried for almost a year, no difference. Though it does say it only works on the crown and not the temples. Good price though, compared to other retailers. :-)</li>
    <li> Great price comparing to local sores. Don&#x27;t expect this product to grow you a thick head of hair, but what it will do is replace hair at the crown of the scalp and reduce any further hair loss.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I am that guy that started thinning when he was 26.  I am 35 now.  Though I am not bald (we all say that right?) my scalp shows on the top of my head under white lights and sunlight.  In darker lighting, it is not as obvious how thin I am.  This is what my close friends tell me.  I believe my hair is much worse off than what they tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product, I was a little lazy, and didn&#x27;t do it twice a day.  I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of results so I quit.  However, after a few months, I felt my hair was thinning more.  Was it the aging process, or did this product actually give me some small benefit?  I decided to try it again, but this time use it as it was intended, twice daily.  I will say, at first I did notice a little more thinning, but that is expected.  I&#x27;ve stuck with it.  I am a little over a month now, and though my hair does not appear to thicker or fuller, I do feel that the hairs are stronger and more manageable.  I have a feeling I won&#x27;t be one of those guys that has obvious regrowth, but I do feel like it there have been some small improvements.  We will see what the 90 days looks like, and maybe I will bump the rating up then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam massages easily into the scalp, dries rather quickly, and does not seem to leave a residue.  I think it actually helps me with styling my hair in the mornings along with the gel that I use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still skeptical about whether or not it works. Been using it for 6 months or so. It&#x27;s not really making any noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> The title says it all, I&#x27;m in the 15% that it doesn&#x27;t work on.  Been a  month and a half, and nothing.  I would recommend giving it a shot, I mean it&#x27;s under $40 and if it works, that would be a great deal.  I know a lot of people commented on the smell, it smells no worse/better then any kind of moose or hair product people use.  It is simple to use, once in the morning, once at night.  My only concern is that I don&#x27;t see 85% of the reviews saying it works...</li>
    <li> Have used it every day since product arrived and although there appears to be some thickening of the hair in the scalp area tthe product is being used it is much too early to judge success or failure</li>
    <li> This product was for my husband.  While the product arrived very quickly, it appears to be ineffective.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a friend that suffer from hair loss, after few months of using it, he told me it&#x27;s working and he will continue using it to reduce the hair loss for him.</li>
    <li> The lable says it only works for vertext hair loss. Did not know that until I purchased the item. I did not find mentioned anywhere, not on product description, not on their website. Now I cannot even return it, says some hazardous itme policy. What the heck?</li>
    <li> good product, accurate image</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance and he has African- type hair. He has only used this for two months with taking Biotin pills everyday, eating salmon, almonds, and shampooing his hair every 3 or 4 days. His hair is very full now with only a few minor spots. He is very, very happy that his hair is growing back from alopecia. Alopecia runs in his family and they have very little hair. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband it works but you need to be patient, it takes a long time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for frontal baldness.</li>
    <li> did not work as advertised it would</li>
    <li> Used for 3 months, Made MORE hair fall out and when I called customer support they said they had no idea if it would even grow back and quickly gave me a refund for their mistake.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle and simply trying to keep the hair loss at the top of my head from getting any worse.  After 3 months of use applying twice a day my barber, without any knowledge of my use of this product, stated my hair looked thicker and healthier.  Following this I asked my wife if she noticed any difference and she said my &amp;#34;monk spot&amp;#34; was indeed less noticeable and covered up with more hair.  I can&#x27;t say whether the improvement is due to new hair growth, thickening up the hair I still had or a combination of both but I am so far impressed with the results of this product.</li>
    <li> 1. do not use foam, use extra strength liquid&lt;br /&gt;2. shave your head bald every two weeks and apply directly to scalp and rub your head really good.&lt;br /&gt;3. it is good adead to apply to your entire head and more to the balding area, it will make your current hair stronger and you will also give a support to the balding area.&lt;br /&gt;4. don&#x27;t wash your head before 4 hours of using rogaine for better result&lt;br /&gt;5. finally, results vary but I can say this. if you ignore the result at all and focus on using it the right way plus what I have mentioned above. it will eventually work because it needs lots of time. remember time is always part of the solution in any thing you trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;6. works for me I been on it for almost 8 months. works really good I think little bit slow but works . for us something always better than nothing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the key is ignore results. focus on using it all the time. twice a day. you will see it coming and you will be happy once again</li>
    <li> good product.  Effective</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and  resulted with good effects. Recommend everyone to use it. The delivery from the supplier was  very fast.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help with hair loss in a receding hair line.  Only crown hair loss.  This wasn&#x27;t disclosed until after I paid for product.  Useless to me</li>
    <li> Got it on time and just as advertised. This is my 2nd box and my wife says it&#x27;s starting to work!</li>
    <li> Ive been using rogaine for over 2 years now and it definitely has had positive effects.&lt;br /&gt;My hair loss has slowed considerably and possibly even got some regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend rogaine to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming action is so easy. apply it to the spot with a quick squirt, the pat it in and using your fingers to kinda brush it into place.&lt;br /&gt;I wait a few minutes then brush my hair over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it hardens and looks like hair gel, but a quick brush through gets rid of that look</li>
    <li> I stopped using propecia and have been just using this for a year, and it&#x27;s definitely helped slow the hair from falling out. Propecia is definitely a better treatment if you can handle it, and combining the two is even better.</li>
    <li> I put it on and a short time later I became light headed and then a migraine then nausea. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great Product  Excellent service</li>
    <li> Product is effective and it works even better if you keep using it for 3 months or more. Not bad</li>
    <li> worked for me! although not hair is not back to 100% what it was, at least there is real regrowth</li>
    <li> my son started using this like 2 month ago and it works it simply works, his hair filled in nicely and thick and he uses it twice a day. A bottle lasts about 1 month&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend for everyone t o use a biotin shampoo, nexus makes a great one in the green bottle&lt;br /&gt;and add some biotin softgel tabs to your hair loss regime</li>
    <li> Used it as it was directed, but it never worked...still have 2 bottles yet..maybe ill give it another shot...maybe i will.</li>
    <li> Product is good, very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Yeah it works. I wish I could transplant the hair from my nose and back on to my MF&#x27;n head, but this is a great second option. YOU HAVE TO USE IT EVERY DAY AS INSTRUCTED. Go for it baldy.</li>
    <li> Husband just asked this PM if he thought he was wasting his money.  I don&#x27;t know.  I think it helps a bit.  Maybe it keeps more hair from thinning.  He&#x27;s used it for years.</li>
    <li> It works!!! I was about to give up and shave it off but i gave rogaine one more shot becuase it worked in the past. Sure enough it came through for me again. My coworkers are noticing my hair growing back. I love it!</li>
    <li> highly recommended. works as direction. regrows hair quickly</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and good pricing</li>
    <li> This works.  I am a woman with long curly hair that was dropping out by the lockfuls.  It was quite thin by the time I bought Rogaine.  I&#x27;ve been using this since September, combined with Nioxin products.  The hair loss eased a LOT in a week.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much regrowth, but I guess that&#x27;s too soon.  I wish I had started this sooner as all those big piles of fallen hair would still be on my head!</li>
    <li> I am still in the process of using this product (1 month) and am not giving it a low review due to its hair growth potential.  What I am giving it a low score for is due to the fact that most of the product goes to your hair.  If you have a bald spot, then this product will be useful, but for thinning hair, then it is a waste of $$.  The reason being; most of the product goes to the hair due to the expanding foam and only a small, very small amount actually makes it to the scalp.  I do massage and follow all recommendations but at the end of the application process, I feel like a teenager that spiked up his hair getting ready to go with his friends to the mall.  Again, if you have bald spot(s), then I am sure this is a good product.  But if you are using this for thinning hair, then I would recommend using the liquid form of this product and not the foam.</li>
    <li> BETTER THAN PROPECIA. MY HAIR IS FULLER AND THEY TELL ME I LOOK 10 YEARS YOUNGER. I DON&#x27;T KNOW ABOUT THAT, BUT I DO NO IT WORKS EVEN BETTER FOR A YOUNGER GUY.</li>
    <li> Apparently the Rogaine Foam now shipping from Amazon is unscented! It says in the upper left corner \\&quot;NEW! UNSCENTED FORMULA\\&quot; and having tried it, I can confirm this. Thanks Rogaine!</li>
    <li> I have been getting alopecia (small patches of complete hair loss due to stress) They grow back on their own but usually take over a year. I tried nioxin but it didn&#x27;t seem to speed things up terribly. The last one I got I bought this rogain, and I have al my hair back in 3 months!!! woohoo that rocked because it was right in the front of my head. My hairstylist was even excited. I&#x27;m a fan, I don&#x27;t know that it will work for other conditions, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it helps with my alopecia.</li>
    <li> The 3 jars are a much better deal and love the foam!! After 4 months hair growing in really good!!!</li>
    <li> hi how are you!  I must be thankful by its seriousness because you ah given back my money i see you are very responsible people.  I recommend all the people of the amazons who can buy without fear to you, you i leave myself very satisfied.    I have a week using your rogaine and my hair is stronger, I were looking for the scented rogaine but it is almost the same, but no odor    at the moment is working very well your rogaine but I have to wait 3 months I STARTING 29/03/11  I thank you for considering me and thank you very much for your attentions.    Att: Manuel Rodriguez Reyes from the dominican republic</li>
    <li> I have tried to use this product twice. I am not very old and wondrous joy of inheriting the hair loss gene at a young age. I am 21 years old now and I have incredibly thin hair. This product will work, but I don&#x27;t think it is advertized properly. It will work on balding spots on the back and center of the head, but not a receding hair line like I have. It will actually make your hair loss worse if you do not ween your usage off of it. Do not stop using the product cold turkey or you will have more hair loss (this is written in the instructions).     So buyer be aware, this product may not be for you. It did nothing to help me.</li>
    <li> Decent product. I used this product for the first 3 month supply before switching to the Kirkland 5% brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: No smell, seems to be relatively effective for slowing hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: The foam application means that much of the solution ends up in your hair making it appear &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; looking. Also, causes some dandruff as it is an alcohol based solution which  There is definitely some hair loss and &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; of hairs. Price isn&#x27;t the most competitive compared to other products on market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripes with this product was the foam application and price. I found that the eyedropper application of the Kirkland brand is much more effective at targeting the scalp )which is where you want the solution to be), rather than getting it in your hair which makes it greasy. I found that for the price, the Kirkland product is the better buy. YMMV</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve used Rogaine for over 2 years now. I can tell you that I have not been more disappointed in a product I have used for this long, ever. I started using it to prevent hair loss that I started noticing on the hairline at my temple around the time I turned 23. I knew that it was only FDA approved to work on the back of the head, but I was very distressed by my hair loss at such a young age and so I took a chance.    It was a complete disaster. I knew there would be thinning at first, but truly I lost half of the hair on my front hairline within a few months. I kept telling myself it would be okay, and that it would eventually reverse and grow back. Two years of faithful use, and it has not grown back. In fact, it has gotten worse.    I believe that if I had not used Rogaine, my hair would look much better than it does now. My only recourse has been to shave my hair very short. I will either live with it or wait until I have enough money to have hair follicle relocation surgery. I have continued using Rogaine on the back of my head at the advice of medical counsel, where there has been considerably less thinning and where I still hold out hope that it will prevent further baldness.    The moral of this story is that you should either only use Rogaine on the back of your head as it is advertised/FDA approved for, or simply skip wasting your money on hair loss prevention/regrowth products and shave it or wait for money/technology to give you other options.</li>
    <li> I have been using it do about 3 months and hair appears to be thicker with some growth Lready seen. Very happy with the results!!!</li>
    <li> overpaid as BJ&#x27;s has a MUCH better deal and these are only 3 to a box not 4 as everywhere else</li>
    <li> Not the best price as my mom seems to be able to find it much cheaper in store. But the product itself is amazing! I got great results after 2 months. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1 year now and love it. (Note: once you start using this you HAVE to keep using it if you want to keep the results!)</li>
    <li> I started Rogaine foam on 9/1/2013.  At 47 years old I decided that I had heard enough &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; jokes for a lifetime.  It is working for me.  I will update at 6 months for those who are interested.  I do keep my hair short so the application process is not a problem.  Perhaps I will try longer hair when it gets thicker.  I have not gone through a shed process yet.</li>
    <li> Does it work? I think so.  If I don&#x27;t use it for a few months my wife cah tell. It&#x27;s not re-growing hair... but it is keeping the haor I have in place.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it worked or not. My man said it seemed like this made his balding worse.</li>
    <li> Rogaine for men hair regrowth treatment is showing its effect. It is more than a week now I am using it and some new hair has already sprouted.</li>
    <li> Its a lot easier to apply and dries very quickly compared to the liquid Rogaine. However, it has the same effects as actual Rogaine (slow for me, a fraction quick for my Dad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its a good replacement for Liquid Rogaine with marginal bump in the price and does leave the hands all wet while wondering, where should I apply the rest of the Rogaine on my fingers without wasting it on already hairy part of the head??</li>
    <li> I did not receive what I ordered. I ordered the foam, but got the regular with dropper. Do not like the regular Rogaine liquid at all. Makes your hair look and feel extremely oily.</li>
    <li> Used the product for 3 months. Didn&#x27;t show any improvement. Waste of money for me! Still looking if there is a product that can really stop hair fall n regrow hair!</li>
    <li> Tried for 6 months. NO results at all. Will better do hair implants. More expensive but guaranteed. And takes one day only.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff wish they go on sale more often</li>
    <li> I still have hair, i guess that says it.</li>
    <li> Works decently have been using it for over a year tough to tell if it has done a whole lot. Better than generic brands though!</li>
    <li> I use this instead of the Women&#x27;s Rogaine. A dermatologist stated the only reason it isn&#x27;t recommended for women is because it hasn&#x27;t been tested on women. I have been using it for quite awhile and it appears to be working.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled. This product is not enough for 3 months supply. I only use it once a day(at night) &amp; each can lasts 2 weeks. Trust me because I am very frugal with the application.</li>
    <li> I am still a little shocked that this product actually works.  It has been about 3 months, and my V shape on my forehead, is gone.  The V has filled in.  Hopefully it continues to fill in, in the months to come.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and good price. Cant wait for my afro to grow!</li>
    <li> The product did not last even for 2 weeks for my first container. It did not even come out as foam.&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money. Contacted seller, but his suggestion was to contact rogaine.com for replacement, which does not make any sense.</li>
    <li> It worked well for me, except I have just thinning hair that&#x27;s not too thin (I&#x27;m just being proactive in stopping it from getting worse) and I keep my hair at about 4-5 inches, so the foam acted more as a styling mousse and struggled to even reach my scalp.  I switched to the liquid dropper solution after 6 months and that worked much, much better for me.</li>
    <li> In general, this product works for me. Like some other users, I noticed significant hair loss for the first month. Then after around 6 weeks, hair loss stopped almost completely, even when I blowdry my hair everyday. I&#x27;m not a fan of foamy hair product, but if it works, I will continue using it. I do not notice hair growth yet since I finished the 3 bottles in 2 months.</li>
    <li> decided to try this out doesn&#x27;t work at all and i am only slightly balding exactly were it says it actually works best.</li>
    <li> Just started using it, not seeing any results yet.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for over a year now - while I don&#x27;t think I have any hair regrowth, I think I have stopped losing hair.  I am pretty careful about applications and I try not to use more than 1/2 a capful as recommended, but I always seem to run out of product before I am supposed to.</li>
    <li> Impressive, how this works</li>
    <li> For anyone who is thinking of using this, I have almost 2 years of experience with it and can give you the honest truth. If you are concerned with your balding and thinning hair, Rogaine can give you an added boost, an offset of growth, that occurs and improves over time, sometimes after a horrible initial shed, the &#x27;dread shed&#x27;. When I first started using I lost so much hair, it was raining down, my hair where I applied it looked WORSE than it ever had before. Sometimes I wanted to give it up, but I stuck it out, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the first year it was a rollercoaster ride but I had patience and continued the routine, btw with not only Rogaine but other generics too; they all work the same, it&#x27;s just a matter of taste (or smell) and $. For the vast majority, me included, the shed hairs will grow back, get stronger and thicker over time, and additional new or dormant stimulated hairs will fill in the blanks. Let it be noted that I saw very little to no results for 6 to 8 months, and it got worse before it got better. But eventually all of a sudden what seemed like thousands of tiny new hairs began to sprout in my hairline and throughout my beard, eyebrows and upper cheeks, and with continued application I have been able to maintain and nurture this new growth. At this point, I am considered a hirsute man, which is what I strive to be; No one would know that I&#x27;m thinning at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other things I do to encourage hair growth, Rogaine is only one tool in the arsenal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eat a healthy diet. I am vegan, eat tons of fruits and veggies, and a decent amount of soy, which may reduce DHT. I eat organic when I can.&lt;br /&gt;Get regular exercise. I lift and bike and play tennis; get the blood pumping. Go outside, get some sun.&lt;br /&gt;Use Nizoral shampoo once a week, or less; for me it&#x27;s very strong, and over-use irritates my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Use a regular shampoo without any weird chemicals, like Dr. Bronners or something natural.&lt;br /&gt;Take a multi-vitamin, I like Alive whole food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to, you can take Propecia. Personally I do not, I refuse to risk my sexual health, but I also fully expect to go bald one day and when I do, I will embrace it. But there&#x27;s nothing wrong with trying to buy a few years with Rogaine ;-) Studies show you can maintain above baseline for up to 16 years with Minoxidil, and possibly beyond that; everyone will respond differently, some probably not at all, but this isn&#x27;t some snake oil, it absolutely works and will give you more and better hair, at least it does for me.</li>
    <li> great product, helped me grow back some of the hair i&#x27;ve lost over the years</li>
    <li> Giving this 5 stars for now....I plan on using it for 4 months and at the end of that time, will be prepared to give a well informed review based on my experience....I&#x27;m going to update this review once a month.    Some background...49 y/o male. Had one hair replacement treatment at a place that begins with a B. After 2 years bare spots at back top, top and front. Not willing to pay the price for more hair replacements.    Month 1:  * I&#x27;m using this on my entire head, not just the back top. Based on that, my 3 month supply was gone in about a month and that&#x27;s ok with me.  * I put dabs all over then massage/rub it in until it&#x27;s almost dry, then brush my hair...It seems to be a pretty good styling product. So much so that I use much less of the normal stuff I use.  * No noticeable shedding. I mean I&#x27;m in the process of losing my hair, so there will be some loss whether I use this product or not.  * No noticeable dandruff  * I use this 2x a day. After morning shower and hair is dry. After evening shower and hair is dry.  * I do not expect results of any significance for a while, and I don&#x27;t check every day...But I have noticed some differences..    Month 2:  * Half of this month I&#x27;ve only had time to apply once a day...It was done in the manner I mentioned in Month 1  * Some hair loss and within the last week, itching  * Noticed some new hair growth  * Not much else to report....I&#x27;m happy so far and no new surprises are a good thing...:-)    Month 3:  * Continued the only once daily regime for most of the month  * Occasional second application before bedtime over hair that was washed in the morning and had 1st application of Rogaine along with styling product in it  * Noticeable filling in of top back, left front and right front. But middle right front seems to have less hair...Could be from normal loss or shedding due to this product...Don&#x27;t know but everywhere else seems to be very very slowly filling in.    I expected very slow results, if any at all and that&#x27;s whatI&#x27;m seeing...This month will be month number 4 and after the end of it, I&#x27;ll make a decision on if I&#x27;m going to continue....I&#x27;m not totally convinced I will yet, but things look promising.</li>
    <li> The rogaine is easier to apply as a foam, but those little foam cans just don&#x27;t seem to have enough in them for a months supply, especially if you use them as directed, twice a day. I just use it once a day and it lasts about 2 and a half weeks if you only use a quick dab. Other than that, it is ok. Wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any similar products and it seems to work or, at the very least, I&#x27;ve noticed less hair loss.</li>
    <li> It Works!!!!! I been using this great product more than a year already. I highly recomended this product for everyone.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers the foam and this is a liquid.</li>
    <li> I have the type of hair loss that Rogaine is supposed to help (vortex balding) and guess what? It didn&#x27;t work, and much to my dismay and horror, I have now lost substantially more hair at a substantially faster pace than I was losing before using Rogaine. I used it for about 8 months and quit after noticing that I was losing more hair then ever before. Rogaine claims that you will lose hair initially and then it will regrow, but that was an absolute farce in my case. The kicker is that when I quit using it at the suggestion of a Rogaine representative (who sounded alarmed when I described my results), my hair thinning became much worse in the aftermath. I am sick to my stomach over this fiasco and I am uglier because of it. Thanks Bill Rancic! Thanks Rogaine!!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!!!!</li>
    <li> Hi   all this product is working after using 3 month you can see the difference   its really help your hair to regrow .I wish may this product help to regrow front hair.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with Rogaine. I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a serious try and have some patience with it. I&#x27;m 5 months into it now, and I&#x27;ve regrown most of the hair that I lost. My hair line even moved forward to the point where I need to take a new photo for my business card because I look different now. I&#x27;ve also been using Nizoral shampoo every 3 days. There is still a small bald spot in the back but it&#x27;s still filling it, I&#x27;m hoping after a few more months of use that too will be gone. The trick is to not let your hair loss advance too much before starting this product. Catch it early. My hair loss was pretty advanced already when I started it, but I think I got very lucky and my results are probably not typical. I&#x27;m VERY happy. Saved me a lot of money now that I don&#x27;t have to have hair restoration surgery. I&#x27;ve been encouraging other people to give it a try because I&#x27;m genuinely that satisfied with it.    I only wish they allowed photos on amazon reviews so I can post my before and after photos.</li>
    <li> At 25 age the clock had already started ticking. My hair was thinning at a rate that made it obvious between hair cuts. I accepted my inevitable baldness at a young age. Collectively, the males from both sides of my family would struggle to combine for one nice full head of hair. However, with my wedding looming I really loathed the idea of paying a small fortune for a photographer just to have be able to review the growing shinny patch at the back of my head. I can&#x27;t say I had any faith this product would work, there are a decent amount of mixed reviews and the key seems to be that it takes a long time to notice a difference, but I had to try something and from all my research this was one of the easiest and most effective.  I&#x27;ve been using this now for just over 18 months and am now happily married. As I look back at engagement pictures we had taken (about 1 week before I started using this stuff) I see the first photographic evidence of a balding crown. Although this will certainly not work for everyone, looking at my wedding pictures from 9 months later, I can actually see a slight improvement. Even today the signs of thinning are still present but the fact that a slight improvement is visible is a HUGE accomplishment in my opinion. Given how quickly I was loosing my hair two years ago I would imagine I&#x27;d have a fist size patch of mostly bare skin on the back of my head by now. Instead, I have maintained my very thin covering of hair and there is really no defined area that is completely void of hair. Since it is impossible to really say how bad things could have gotten I don&#x27;t know how much this has truly helped, but it has certainly lived up to my best expectations.  One of my worries when I started buying this product was that I would just be wasting the purchase cost. But given the very high cost of more permanent procedures the cost is really not that bad. The product certainly lasts the full 3 months, even when I apply it generously. Using Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save (Thank you Amazon!) it has worked out to ~ $150 a year. It will take decades at that price to reach the several thousand required for many other hair replacement options, not to mention the fact that I don&#x27;t have the extra cash just sitting around today. I doubt that I will personally ever have significant hair regrowth using this product but that always would have been a side benefit. The fact that I can prolong the inevitable until I am more mentally prepared to loose my hair is well worth the cost.  One final note is that I always hate taking on anything that I will have to do multiple times everyday. I always avoid taking on those responsibilities as I generally start to forget after only a few weeks. It was certainly tough with this product as it took me about 6 months to be confident that it was actually having a positive effect and that is a long time for me to stick with anything. I&#x27;m glad I did and I don&#x27;t envision stopping any time soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Good Value / Good Product</li>
    <li> This product is only for the spiral of you head</li>
    <li> I never ordered this product-???</li>
    <li> great price--to early to tell results</li>
    <li> My hair has grown a bit after 4-5 months of use.</li>
    <li> After using it consistently, I&#x27;ve really seen a difference.. and it gets better every day. Works really well for me.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and the subscription service!</li>
    <li> Lets be serious, results don&#x27;t happen overnight or with one 3-month pack, My wife is seeing some baby hairs now and I am 7 or months in , I probably won&#x27;t see visible results till the end of the 9th or 10th month. Stay committed</li>
    <li> I still like the scented form. This is good but smells like alcohol. Rogain should reconsider bringing the scented form again.</li>
    <li> This product gave me all over hives, rapid heartbeat, scalp irritation, redness, flaking. Horrible reaction. Maybe I am allergic?</li>
    <li> This treatment really works if you do it right... After 4 months I can really see the difference!  I recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything for my husband. He&#x27;s still using it faithfully. At first we thought it might be. Now, however his hairs seems to be even thinner.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> Nothing happened to me...</li>
    <li> I am not going to comment on the results of Minoxidil, as they may vary, but on the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid 20s and started losing hair (still have &amp;#34;plenty&amp;#34; though). My physician prescribed Minoxidil 5% and baught one that is applied as a liquid solution. After months of using it, I thought newer foam treatments were going to be reach my scalp better, so bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, to be honest, I didn&#x27;t like it...&lt;br /&gt;1) Lots of the product stays on the hair and it is even harder to make it reach my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is hard to estimate how much to use each time.&lt;br /&gt;3) It is like using hair fixing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I am waiting for the 3rd bottle to finish, and will then go back to the liquid solution.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product, and worth buying here as opposed to a drugstore for their better, more-competitive pricing.&lt;br /&gt;Now this product works for me, but it does NOT work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is for the back of the head (the crown), and not for the front area.&lt;br /&gt;Decent smell, and actually is helpful in styling my hair, as opposed to the other delivery methods that Rogaine comes in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> This new Rogaine in Foam in my case meet all my expectations, I am using like primary application(day). and the Hair-DRx at night.</li>
    <li> Rogaine does not always work for everyone.  I happen to be one of the men it DOES work for.  The trick is to keep using it.  Also.  Even though the Foam type cost&#x27;s a bit more, less alcohol come&#x27;s in contact with the scalp.  My head itched when I used the non-foam type.&lt;br /&gt;I n my case, the spot I was losing hair was small.  After 5 month&#x27;s this foam filled in the balding area completely.  I might keep using it and I might stop at some point.  But if I stop,  eventually the bald area will return.  I&#x27;ve proved it in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, Rogaine claim&#x27;s they will refund the full price.</li>
    <li> Husband used this and didn&#x27;t feel like it helped but also it didn&#x27;t worsen what he originally had. Not sure if we would buy it again. He used it for almost a year too</li>
    <li> Works as intended, good results.</li>
    <li> Perfect and cheaper than any place else!</li>
    <li> i used it a lot but no progress.</li>
    <li> I have been using for around two months, I have noticed quite a few baby hairs popping up and my hair does appear to be thicker. Keep in mind though this will not prevent old hair from falling out and the second you start using you must continue or the new hair will fall out.</li>
    <li> Is it working?  I don&#x27;t know:)  I will probably do it for 1 year before make my assesment.</li>
    <li> Exactly what is says.</li>
    <li> I was using the liquid from equate and made the change to Rogaine foam because of the itching and the white stuff (there&#x27;s a residue that stayed on my hair and simulated dandruff but I know it wasn&#x27;t dandruff because it only came from the sites where I applied)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say the foam solved the problem, my scalp is no longer irritated and itchy. It makes your hair crunchy just like using hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bad side it is actually more difficult to apply than liquid since the foam melts fast on your hand and you get a lot on your hair before it reaches your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to use foam try to have your hair as short as possible for it to reach scalp. The way I do it is pour it on another surface colder than your skin (I use a little plastic base) then use a q-tip or something else to apply it, is for me the best way to get it more on your scalp and not your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid was working very well for me, at month 3 I started seeing some growth and shedding stopped. Will update on how the foam perform</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by explaining the unique nature of my situation, and what it was that prompted me to begin using Rogaine two months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 36. I&#x27;ve been using Propecia for the last 8 years, with great success. It arrested my hair loss at the time (hereditary), and I even regrew some lost hair over the following year after I&#x27;d begun taking it. Life went on. I just kept up on my prescription and remained consistent on the Propecia. Other than that, I never gave it another thought. Until I discovered testosterone boosters 10 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize what had happened until I walked out of a haircut two months ago. My hair had been long, and I&#x27;d been noticing some extra hair on my hands when I shampooed. But I was working intensely at the time and was so otherwise preoccupied with life that I didn&#x27;t connect the dots. But after I got my hair cut short and saw shocking areas of scalp revealing themselves through my hairline, I was horrified. Obviously, I put the kibosh on any and all haircuts going forward, hoping that, as my hair grew in length, it would help to conceal the gaping patches of scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I should have done my homework prior to using Tribulus, Pink Magic, etc. While they&#x27;re great T-boosters for guys in their 30s, and they can help you to make tremendous gains in the gym, they also have a potentially negative side effect: more good testosterone can, inevitably, be accompanied by more bad testosterone (DHT). Apparently, I was creating so much of it through my supplement stacking that it overwhelmed the Propecia&#x27;s ability to protect my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair loss may have also been caused by Colius Forskholi, or 7-Keto, or a combination of the two. I&#x27;d heard about them for weight loss. And it was right about the time that I&#x27;d started using them that I noticed the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, that&#x27;s the context. Now here&#x27;s what I did to combat it and regain ground that even the Propecia alone hadn&#x27;t been able to recover. The following will probably only be relevant and useful to guys who&#x27;ve found themselves in a similar predicament, but, perhaps, it can help you in your unique situation as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I kept up with my Propecia. I&#x27;d take it in the morning, before any other supplements, even my multivitamin. I&#x27;d eat my breakfast, take the Propecia, give it about an hour to be absorbed without competition from other supplements, and then I&#x27;d have a late morning snack and take the rest of my morning vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I read up and researched. I discovered that Stinging Nettle Root, Saw Palmetto, Pygeum, and Pumpkin Seed are four natural remedies that work in synergistic concert to interfere with DHT production. I started taking those in the recommended dosages, but added the first dose to my Propecia in the morning with breakfast. The second dose came at night. The idea was to begin the day by attacking the DHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I started using Revivogen Shampoo. I had been using regular brands (Axe, Kirkland, etc), but I stopped all those and stuck with something designed specifically for thinning hair. I did NOT use the Revivogen potion that you&#x27;re supposed to apply each day in concert. I started out trying to, but thought it would be more effective to use Rogaine instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The final -- and perhaps the most critical -- step was the Rogaine. Now, here&#x27;s something many of you may not know. The Rogaine directions clearly state that it&#x27;s only intended for the back of the scalp (vertex), and no other area at all. However, I remembered something the dermatologist who originally prescribed my Propecia had told me. He said the reason for that statement from the folks at Rogaine was that they had to test the product&#x27;s effectiveness by shaving an area on the back of a tester&#x27;s head, keeping it clear, and continuously applying Rogaine for months to gauge its effectiveness. Obviously, it was nearly impossible for them to find testers willing to have anobtrusive, shaved patch of scalp at the front of their hairlines. Essentially, what he was saying to me was that scalp is scalp, and Rogaine would work just as effectively up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that coating the entire top of your scalp with Rogaine is expensive. Because I was targeting the entire top of my scalp, and because my hair was so long, I had to use A LOT of Rogaine foam to penetrate down and be sure that I was hitting the scalp. I was burning through a month&#x27;s supply a week. Seriously. I bought it at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I used this 4-pronged approach, and I used it diligently. It&#x27;s costly and it takes months of dedication. But it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been just over two months now. And after seeing what looked like new hairs grown in at the front of the hairline, and a thickness throughout my entire scalp that I was certain I hadn&#x27;t seen in years, I decided to take a gamble and go get my hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my relief, my hair actually appears thicker now. I&#x27;ve regrown hair that I haven&#x27;t seen in years throughout my entire scalp. It&#x27;s shocking, the difference, considering that two months ago I was staring at sections of scalp showing through and panicking. I&#x27;m not kidding, guys, I could literally count the number of hairs at the very front of my forehead two months ago. Now, the scalpy sections have filled in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine has worked incredibly well, at least for me. There are no guarantees, obviously, but hopefully it will for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I can tell you that I&#x27;ll probably continue to use the Rogaine and Propecia together indefinitely. The synergistic effect of the two has been remarkable for me. Perhaps the other components helped as well, but the Rogaine and Propecia are the strongest and most proven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you guys.</li>
    <li> Started using within past month. Results thus far have been&lt;br /&gt;disappointing. Will colntinue using. Hoping it will work&lt;br /&gt;with continued use.</li>
    <li> Actually reverses the process. Not in every case but in my own empirical experience this product speed up my hair loss. I was only losing a little and in spots. When applying the solution (product) in about one months time I noticed an exponential decay patter pertaining to hair loss. Be sure to internalize all the material and not just the case studies or television chemicals.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product via amazon, I bought a product named Regaine in my country which contains minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was worried about my older bro&#x27;s receding hairline so I decided to use this product as advertised in the television.&lt;br /&gt;However, the advertisement didn&#x27;t say anything that Minoxidil has an &#x27;after-effect&#x27; when you stop using this product.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy this product, please do some research about the effects when you stop using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a long-term contract if you want to use the product, or else, your hair is going to fall more than you actually were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can try to google: stop using minoxidil hair loss.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. He thinks it&#x27;s really giving him results and  he prefers it to the liquid version.</li>
    <li> Quality is fine, results pending. The foam makes it far easier that the liquid form. Why they don&#x27;t make a hair gel version too is beyond me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just hit the four month mark, and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  I&#x27;ve used it almost every day, although I&#x27;ve missed a few days here and there, and haven&#x27;t consistently applied it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the foam not only to the vertex area of my hair, but also the frontal and mid areas, which were going bald.  I couldn&#x27;t be more regretful to not take pictures of my progress.  Believe it or not, there was a one inch diameter area on the front right corner of my head that was shiny bald.  That area is now growing new hair after I applied the foam and massaged it in!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I went to my hair stylist and she said, \\&quot;Are you using some kind of shampoo?\\&quot;  I didn&#x27;t tell her about the Rogaine, but she said, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my eyes or what, but I think you have much more hair than before,\\&quot; as she acted all perplexed.  Haha, it made my day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the Kirkland brand if you want to save money, and I highly recommend buying their Progaine shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I&#x27;m a male in my mid 20s and my family has a history of baldness.</li>
    <li> So I am currently in the 4th month of using the product (bought a second round recently). I have to say that my hair was starting to fall out at an alarming rate prior to using (frontal, worse in the temples), and at 28 years old I figured this was too early. I purchased this product and used it twice a day since. The hair loss has definitely stopped and there is a fair amount of new growth as well. I began noticing the loss to stop near the end of the second month and hair growth shortly after. I will continue to use as long as it works! Good luck to everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It worked initially it seemed for a 4-5 months. Even started growing hair back, however all of a sudden over the past month it seems like my hair is falling out much worse than it ever was. RIP. :(</li>
    <li> i did not get any benefit by using this product..i order&amp;#34; Rogaine for Men Hair Regrowth Treatment, 5%&amp;#34; for full head but that is only for some head part.</li>
    <li> Good product, arrived at expected time</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this foam, and has been using it for almost ten years now. He started in his late twenties when he noticed his hair was starting to thin in the front. He uses is religiously, and tries to never miss an application. His hair grew back slightly fuller, but most importantly he has not lost additional hair since using this product. My husband is not a vain guy, but was mortified at the thought of being bald. He was even looking into more permanent hair treatments. This was really a lifesaver for him, and a great confidence booster. Hopefully this continues to be effective.</li>
    <li> Excellent Seller and excellent product !!</li>
    <li> some effect, to make it more efficient results I&lt;br /&gt;taking finasteride and use a shampoo anti fallen, and using all three if I have seen a markedly improved my alopecia.</li>
    <li> It does what it promises!</li>
    <li> I can tell that this stuff is doing something. I only apply it to the frontal area (I don&#x27;t even apply it to the crown area), and I can see a couple of very small hairs growing that weren&#x27;t there before. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months so patience is key with this stuff.  i would&#x27;ve given it a five but its just so difficult to apply. When you try to just get in on you&#x27;re scalp, you&#x27;ll waste like half of it on the hair that&#x27;s already there.   If you&#x27;re going to use Rogaine, I strongly recommend you use the topical solution and not the &#x27;easy to apply&#x27; foam.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product regularly for more than 2 yrs now. I started using it when I noticed that I have been loosing hair and started to see the bald spot on my head and during the first few days of using it, I lost more hair but eventually the hair loss slowed down considerably. I also started taking Ne Hair pills (stage 1 &amp; 2) for the last few months and I feel my hair has been holding up. I still have some hair on my bald spot, so am forced to believe that rogaine did slow down my hair loss and hair growth is minimal for me. NeHAir did make my hair thicker and the combination seems to be working, not sure how long will this work.....might have to admit someday that I will eventually go bald..thanks to the economy and stress one has to cope up in life..just kidding!..just make use of the $10 printable rebate coupon rogaine website and the $20 mail in rebate and stock up!</li>
    <li> excelent product really works for me, just three weeks and can see the results, I try this product and feel confterble using it...</li>
    <li> Do I like Rogaine....&lt;br /&gt;  I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell everyone a quick story. Im in my mid 40&#x27;s. back when I was mid 20&#x27;s Ihad a friend ( same age). He developed a large bald spot on his crown. - and that was 20 years ago&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward... 20 years&lt;br /&gt;I lost touch with him for about 15 years and eventually set up a dinner to meet.&lt;br /&gt;Since I havent seen him for so long, I figured he must be completely bald.&lt;br /&gt;That evening, I met up with him. To my amazement, he had a complete head of hair. I was shocked. Dont get me wrong. It wasnt the head of hair you see on the posters hung on a barber shop wall. But still, no bald spot, no receding hair line.&lt;br /&gt;I got up to go to the bathroom 3x so that I could come back and look at the crown of his head.to see if there was a weave or something unusual going on.. I looked very natural.&lt;br /&gt;So over the next 9 months, I would talk to hi on occasion.Finally I said to him, what s up with your hair? Did you get a weave or hair transplant.&lt;br /&gt;He then told me about Rogaine w Minoxidil and how good it worked for him. For the next few months I started thinking about it. I was never completely bald. I lost my hair on about a 4&amp;#34; area on the crown, the hair line receded and the top was thinning a bit. All typical for a 40 something I would think.&lt;br /&gt;I started to think that my hair never really completely fell out. Maybe with Rogaine, I could have the same results that my friend did.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my 1st 3 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;What I did from here was for the next 6 months, i buzzed my head ( military cut) never shaving it. I bought a hair clipper and every week buzzed it 2x down to nothing. I used the rogaine as prescribed..&lt;br /&gt;Here is where is gets cool.&lt;br /&gt;I remember grabbing a mirror and looking at the back of my head. I definitely say new hair growth without a doubt. But i said to myself does it warrant the price of the Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;Now , I stopped shaving my head and started to let my hair grow in around month 9.&lt;br /&gt;MY God....It worked.....&lt;br /&gt;The hair that was there was a new revived consistancy. Thicker and full. The entire top of my head was filling in. The bald spot in the back now has hair growing on it and filling in ( it really is filling in)&lt;br /&gt;Do I have the hair I did when I was 20 - absolutely not BUT&lt;br /&gt;I have a great head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair follicles seem to somehow been revitalized with the foam and YES, it does grow new hair back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the packaging prior to starting and it states somewhere that you ay not get the same results as others or something to that extent. You may not grow hair at all....&lt;br /&gt;For me... I enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i was young, i used to use hair gels and sprays. The foam is nothing different. A small bit in the morning and at night as well.&lt;br /&gt;I actually have friends asking me whats up with my hair...lol&lt;br /&gt;Like I had a replacement ( very funny)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANyway... I hope this review finds its way to other s with interest&lt;br /&gt;Good Luckund month 9.&lt;br /&gt;MY God....It worked.....&lt;br /&gt;The hair that was there was a new revived consistancy.

    <li> It&#x27;s actually helping.. My hair is starting to regrow slowly. T a K e s a W H I Le</li>
    <li> No result after using it from months,,, hair started falling,,, so stopped using it,,,, Not sure, if it worked for anyone.... but for me it dint...</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my husband since June 2012, and the truth so far I see no good  result  :(</li>
    <li> Never sure if it work, but makes you feel better. By my genetic ancestry I know I will loose my hair, so give it a shot.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works but my issue is that you have to keep using it....which is pretty much the case for anything like this  but in a perfect world it would fix the problem not temporally help as long as you use it consistently</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR 4 MONTHS AND I CAN SEE THE GROWTH.  SLOWLY BUT SURELY.  I WILL BUY MORE AND WOULD RECOMMEND PRODUCT TO FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> They say it works for 85% of men?  Guess I&#x27;m part of that unlucky 15%.  I used it religiously for a little over a year attempting to reverse the thinning spot on the crown of my head, which was about the size of an orange.  12 months later the spot is now the size of a grapefruit.  This sure is an expensive way to ruin your pillow.</li>
    <li> I good product. For a greeat price</li>
    <li> Trying it out...we&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> lost my hair just after using .. but started to come back gradually</li>
    <li> this product had a bad date on it</li>
    <li> it keeps my hair from thinning more.  So I use it everyday</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Rogaine. It&#x27;s the best among other hair treatment products but not the perfect solution. I mean if I stop not using it for a week, then a week later my hair would fall down. Eventually I feel I will use Rogaine for my whole life. Whe I keep using it freq like twice a day for 2 -3 months, I feel like my hair in the best time ever.</li>
    <li> If you have any hair left and just want to give this a shot stay far far away. Once you start using it you can&#x27;t stop. Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t aware of that and have lost almost all my hair in one year thanks to this product. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product since they advertise it and make it out to be a miracle. Besides losing my hair I also noticed it affects other parts of my body. I noticed my facial hair started getting severe split ends and my heart would have sharp pains every now and then. That&#x27;s the reason I stopped.</li>
    <li> Husband is seeing real improvement on hairline</li>
    <li> seems to be working very slowly.  Slow is fine with me, It&#x27;s way better than losing hair.  now on with show....</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction to this stuff. My face and ears swelled up and I ended up in the ER. True story.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that this product was worth the money.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair and will not order it again.</li>
    <li> No luck with this product so i wouldnt waste the time and money, good luck. Seams like a scam to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking propecia for about 15 years with great success, but I&#x27;m nearly 40 and propecia alone isn&#x27;t enough to stop the thinning. Adding Rogaine to the mix has worked great, but if you&#x27;re like me and you caught the hair loss early, then you still have a reasonably thick head of hair. The foam does NOT work well for me; far too much of the foam ends up on the hair instead of the scalp where it belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the liquid form, I can use the dropper to get the Rogaine exactly where it needs to go. To me, the only advantage of the foam is that it seems to dry and lose the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel a bit faster, but either one eventually dries and leaves behind the same feeling overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me,&lt;br /&gt;Liquid &#x3D; 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Foam &#x3D; 3.5 stars</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s hard to review something that takes 4 months to work, that being said after a month of using it i&#x27;m seeing minor results in the form of small light baby fuzz growing where i have my hair loss. The directions say this will be the first sign that it&#x27;s working and in 4 months i will see better results. i have my fingers crossed this will happen</li>
    <li> Better than liquid form I have used. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy. Must massage into hair well to apply it.</li>
    <li> I wish it would magically regrow the hair all over my head, but unfortunately it only works as advertised, perfectly. Convenient, I use it like hair gel in the morning, and again after dinner. After two years, have gained back some on the crown, and not lost any.</li>
    <li> I tried Rogaine for about a year and one half, got no results and my scalp itched so bad I had to Stop.</li>
    <li> I used it as indicated in the label, after six month I dont see any improve of hairs  in my scalp</li>
    <li> i guess i just wanted it to work. I have hairloss from graft vs host disease after a bone marrow transplant. not male pattern baldness,&lt;br /&gt;so this did not work for me. i was trying to regrow some bald patches that i have. however it did make the hair around those bald patches grow a little thicker/ faster. so the stuff works, just not when your follicle is scarred</li>
    <li> After about 6 months of faithfully using Rogaine, my hairline is restored. It&#x27;s worth the money, and the patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, BEWARE. For the first 3 months I was not washing my hands after using Rogaine, and it significantly increased the amount of hair on my forearms, hands, and fingers. This is now the new problem on my body, but it&#x27;s my fault, because the directions clearly state on both the packaging and the manual, to wash my hands after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl:dr it works, but wash your hands or you end up with gorilla fingers.</li>
    <li> One must be religious with its application, i.e. 2x a day and be patient. It seems that usage is forever.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. I started losing my hair very early and by the age 25 lost it almost completely (type 7, which cannot be helped even through transplants). So I accepted the fact that I will be bald for the rest of my life. I ran into Rogaine online and although I lost my hair more that five years ago (which I read gives little hope of regrowth) I decided to give it a shot. I am applying it twice a day (except when I forget to do it) and it is really simple and easy to use. A little more than one month later, I see results all over my scalp. It is not that I got all my hair back, but there are visible results. I will update in a few months, but this thing works for sure. I wish I had this in the early 90s when I started losing my hair, I am sure this would help me keep it.</li>
    <li> Gave me heart problems. Had to quit use. Game me heart problems, scared me to death, but that&#x27;s the way it it.</li>
    <li> As with any hair growth treatment, results will vary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when compared to other treatments, the FOAM is the best. Other liquid (including Rogaine) applications are difficult to apply without it running down the front or back of your head, and sometimes leaving me to wonder if I even got the solution on the balding area I need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unscented, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking oily. Simply apply a small amount (half a cap) &amp; then do your normal hair routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father, and I must say we expected quite a lot, the results were mild after 6 months, nothing impressive. He decided to stop buying it since it&#x27;s kinda pricy and doesn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
    <li> If you use this daily buy this 3 pack, it is convenient and saves you money!</li>
    <li> I used it, did not work as effective the advertisement say . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> all i can say its...HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;People have actually asked me why I have more hair, even the chinese lady who cuts my hair said &amp;#34;you more hair my friend&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually too early to tell.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks and it appears I see some fine hair growing.  Will give it another rating after 3 months if all goes well with the hair growth.</li>
    <li> Excelente Seller! Product as described and fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, muy puntual la entrega, la envoltura del producto estuvo acorde al tamaño del mismo, altamente recomendado . .</li>
    <li> This 5% minoxidil aerosol works well and is much easier to apply than the liquid version.  I use the product for maintenance, and have not experienced any noticable hair loss over the past several years as a result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different minoxidil applications for my thinning hair, including Rogaine drops and Kirkland drops. Both always left my scalp feeling extremely itchy. My doctor recommended this when I told him about the problem and mentioned that I was thinking of trying an off-brand minoxidil. He warned me not to, because &amp;#34;you never really know what&#x27;s in it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine foam for about two months now and I&#x27;ve already seen better results. The corners of my frontal hairline have begun sprouting new hairs and my [not terribly] receding hairline seems to be coming back. It&#x27;s advertised as being effective only on the crown, but for me (and others) it works anywhere it&#x27;s applied—but it should probably just be used on the head. Anyone just starting minoxidil treatment should be aware that after about the first two months of use, there will be an increase in shedding, what I&#x27;ve learned is called the &amp;#34;dread shed,&amp;#34; and it can be very dreadful, indeed. DON&#x27;T STOP USING when this starts even though it might make you panic. It&#x27;s a good sign! The shedding stops relatively quickly and hair growth will start soon thereafter. Though I&#x27;ve read about it and why it happens, I&#x27;m not qualified to explain it, so I&#x27;ll leave it up to you to search for more information. I can say, though, that my hair loss seems to have stopped almost completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that though the foam is easy to apply and dries quickly, a good amount of it can get stuck in your hair and not actually make it to your scalp. Because of this, and because I use it around the entire top of my head, I end up using about double the recommended amount.</li>
    <li> This product did wonders for my hair, I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and started thinning just a bit on the crown of my head, Started using the foam and to my amazement my hair has thickened, people at my job think my thinning was due to work related stress, I didn&#x27;t let them know I used this product, and that&#x27;s why my hair has made a complete recovery, hope it does the same for you.</li>
    <li> Initialy it works, grew hair a little bit, but, now it seems there is nothging works. I have not seen any hair growing.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this stuff.  It&#x27;s a little runny, but using it for a couple of weeks and folicure shampoo, there&#x27;s already signs of hair growth.</li>
    <li> This is a medication.  Only problem is it&#x27;s vastly overpriced, as is true of US drugs in general. But it apparently does work, albeit slowly.</li>
    <li> Using for two years, make hairs at least better, definitely growing better, but need to use all the time, every day</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to know if it&#x27;s working, but I will say that the foam is a lot easier to apply than the liquid.  I was hesitant at first because I&#x27;m a woman and I was worried it was going to make my hair sticky, but it doesn&#x27;t at all.  The foam liquifies as you massage it in, but it doesn&#x27;t run down like the liquid does.  I think it&#x27;s easier to work with and ensures that you&#x27;re really targeting the area that you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll tell you what you want to know.  First, don&#x27;t expect results right away.  Try using for a full month and then make your judgments.  I can definately see results after a month and had others comment as well.  Please understand that it is not for a receding hair line, only for balding on top.  They say use twice a day, but I only use once a day at night before I go to bed.  A family friend with a heart problem was told by their doctor not to use it, so if you have a heart problem, you might want to look into it.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen regrowth yet but I keep using it hoping for the best. Maybe I&#x27;m not losing the kind of hair that Rogaine regrows or maybe I&#x27;m losing hair a lot faster than I realize and Rogaine prevents it from showing.  Either way, I&#x27;m not bald but thinning.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet if it helps with hair loss-time will tell- but the foam is far, far better than other products: no flaking, easy application</li>
    <li> So far so good, 3 month bearly starting to see small hairs coming in. It does make your hair a little thicker but you need patience because its a slow process.</li>
    <li> Starting to see moderate results</li>
    <li> I have been using since February.  No hair regrowth but hair has stopped falling out.  So that&#x27;s good.  Foam is much better than the drops.  No mess.  No irritation.</li>
    <li> best price. works really good for men only.</li>
    <li> I have seen some stubles making there way up! fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Order these for my cousin, it works, what should I say</li>
    <li> I use it, because there&#x27;s no real alternative. I&#x27;m thinning moderately on top; I have no idea if it&#x27;d be worse if I stopped using it. It certainly doesn&#x27;t fill it it, after three years. My main complaint is it irritates my eyes so much, they&#x27;re always red. Used to use Visine, but the eye doc says no. So now I just look stoned first thing in the morning, also with a bald spot.</li>
    <li> If this stuff really worked, do you think there be any bald men walking around? And would men be spending thousands and thousands of dollars on hair transplants?</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about 4 month and my hair has got a little thick.  As for new growth, I am still waiting for the 6 month recommended time to see results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and then found out that it will not work for my particular type of balding. Now I cannot return it even though I never opened it and I&#x27;m out $85.  Further, I also found out that if you ever stop using Rogaine, you&#x27;re hair falls out quicker than if you never used it at all.  WARNING: If you buy this, it cannot be returned, it only works on one specific type of baldness, and if you ever stop using, all your hair will fall out.</li>
    <li> Most of this product goes to your hair. If you have a bald spot, then this product will be useful, but for thinning hair is a waste of money. Rogaine works, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But this package will not work for you if you are using this for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this to treat a receding hairline at the front of my head. After receiving it in the mail, I noticed on the side of the box that it says it&#x27;s only meant to treat the vertex of the scalp (top/back of the head), and it&#x27;s not supposed to be used for the front. Unfortunately Amazon will not let me return it because it&#x27;s considered hazardous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for those who have hair loss on the vertex of their scalp, but I really just wish it said somewhere on Rogaine&#x27;s website or here on Amazon that you can&#x27;t use it for the front of the scalp. I&#x27;m just going to have to eat the cost of this now.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for a year now. I am using it twice a day.  I could notice that there is reduction in my hair fall. Also there is some improvement in hair growth.  Earlier, the baldness in the central part of the head was clearly visible. Now there is some hairgrowth in that area and baldness is not clearly visibile though it did not completely remove the baldness.  This is not a replacement for hair transplant. But I would definitely recommend this product to those who would like to maintain hair they have now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure when this stuff is supposed to work, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years and my hair has progressively gotten worse. It does not seem to have stopped hair loss or grown new hair. So today I am going to stop using it forever. If my hair falls out then so be it. The faster it all falls out, the faster I can get transplants. They look a lot better than they did to a decade ago (look at Gordan Ramsey for example, totally looks real). Save your money on this placebo foam and do something that actually gets results that will last. Rogaine is not the answer.</li>
    <li> Only ok. Had higher expectations.</li>
    <li> Causes me to break out, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price &amp; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Now to be fair, I did not have the male pattern baldness on the crown of my head which is the only area that Rogaine claims to guarantee help. I have thinning on the top front of my head. I read more than one review where a user had success with that area, so I went for it. I was disciplined and faithful, using it twice a day religiously, applying it just as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for three and a half months with no results. I developed an odd pain inside where my left lung is, lower area. It was like a sharp, quick pain that would last only a second or two, maybe three times a day. I can&#x27;t prove a correlation, but it did disappear after I stopped using the stuff.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I ordered the wrong Rogaine, it is for men only , not for women. I did not know that.  It is a non returnable item, so I am stuck with it. However you were kind enought to send me a replacement for women. I am presently using it, and am not sure whether it is going to help me. You want me to rate the product I really don&#x27;t know how to do that without having tested it.</li>
    <li> For those of you that are losing your hair this is good product, but you must use it every day and night.  When you stop using this your hair will start falling out again.if you do not use it regularly it will not work.  Every morning and evening for three months and it will work.:)  My hair has stopped falling out and is looking thinker.</li>
    <li> I am a real person giving you a real review.  THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! 3 months and I see a HUGE difference in the thickness of my hair.  I actually took pictures to see.  Just checked the other day and I can say I am a VERY happy customer.  I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THIS HAIR lol</li>
    <li> My doctor said it best, \\&quot;If a product works then you won&#x27;t hear about it, but if a product fails then everyone becomes a bitter critic\\&quot;.  So, for my two cents for what it&#x27;s worth; the product for the last five months has worked for me.  My hair loss was minimal and mostly involved the left temple receding higher then I wanted, which caused a noticeable gap sometimes when my medium-long hair was parted, but since taking this product the gap has seemed to vanish.  Even examining my hair I can tell it has been filling in slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a permanent solution, having to apply a substance to my head twice a day for thirty seconds a pop?  No, but also I like to remain optimistic and believe we are closer to an actual cure.  So, my mind set now is that if I can fight this long enough by using a product such as Rogaine, then why not?  Roughly, it cost me about 150 for a year supply.  If that&#x27;s all it takes to remain youthful when I&#x27;m pushing thirty then by all means, take my money.</li>
    <li> Decent price on the three pack.  Since you&#x27;ll be ordering it for life, get the subscription and save yourself some cash.</li>
    <li> I am only 25 and began noticing my hair loss about a year ago. I was in denial for a while but it soon became apparent when I really looked in the mirror. I was weighing all my option and this appeared to be the safest and least invasive solution. I have to say that within a few months this product really did work. I noticed considerably less shedding after showers and improvement in hair thickness. I can even notice the new hairs growing in the spots where I need them too. The people closest to me have noticed a considerable difference without me mentioning anything to them. I have been losing hair form the crown and temporal portions of my head and I apply the foam directly to those areas and massage them in. The product smells great and acts like a mousse as well. It has been one of the best decisions I made and I am glad I decided to do it early. You have to use it twice a day for the best effects. It will not work for everyone but I think everyone should give it a shot and try it for at least four months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for multiple years and love it! I use to have a giant (and only getting bigger bald spot) but guess what? Not anymore! I like Rogaine, the cream is probably the easiest to use also.</li>
    <li> New face which is better than prior one. I have used Rogaine for half year already. Didn&#x27;t see the much progress obviously, hope it works.</li>
    <li> I have used Rogaine for several years and have and continue to get real results. Don&#x27;t know why every man that is hair challenge doesn&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> Rogain helps...not totally but it does. Foam is worth the extra couple bucks...doesnt stream all over the place like the alternative</li>
    <li> This stuff worked for me with excellent results after 4 months. But because it is drying, I don&#x27;t wash my hair as often. Maybe once a week or week and half. Because if you wash and rogaine it will make ur head soooo dry.&lt;br /&gt;Also this product does make you loose hair at first. But it regrows. I have so much hair now. And I don&#x27;t even use it twice a day everyday but I&#x27;m going to now. Usually I just put it on in the morning. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;It works. Use it for 4 months once a day. And don&#x27;t wash your hair unless it feels dirty or greasy. Besides your scalp needs oils. Google it.</li>
    <li> The item description is very misleading. The box shows however once you have paid for the item that the product only works for what is called vertex hair loss.(Top back of your head)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay extra attention to this:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;To regrow hair on the top of the scalp (vertex only, see pictures inside label).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy this product goes elsewhere on the internet and read the labels about what it works on and does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to do something for a receding hairline this product is worthless.</li>
    <li> I bought into all the hype, big mistake.  After 3 months of use I can honestly say I have less hair than when I started.  Just accept that you are going bald and move on with your life....</li>
    <li> So I noticed about 3 1/2 months ago back in November, my hair line at the temples had receded a significant 3 inches.  I went to a hair specialist who recommended that I start 1.25 MG of Propecia and Rogaine twice a day.  I took Propecia for a week until the day I was informed of the potential impotence side effects.  Especially for a young guy like me, its important I have a fully functional you know what.  I stopped and continued with Rogaine.  About two weeks into the Rogaine, I noticed significant shedding at the temples.  Knowing that this topical medication takes 4-6 months to show results, I decided I was going to ride it out and deal with the hair loss/shedding.  So about 4 weeks went by and my hair continued to shed at an accelerated rate to an eventual point that my vertex started thinning out and becoming noticeable.  I started applying the Rogaine there as well and by week 10 of the treatment my hair had become so thin in the front  that it became blatantly recognizable by most other people.  I started freaking out because I now looked like a 24 year old with the hairline of an average 50 year old.  I started using Caboki to cover up the thinning.  However you have to wash it out every night and if you hair is brittle and thin and you walk around outside when its windy, then everyone notices.  By week 12 on the Rogaine foam I started getting these horrible chest pains.  After resisting the sharp pain for a week I finally went to the doctor and he gave me an EKG, which showed that I was totally fine and the Rogaine had caused no damage.  I went off the Rogaine for 2 days and the pain went away.  I soon after went back on it and the pain came back.  I called up Rogaine customer service and they told me to stop taking it immediately and that they would reimburse me for all my previous purchases.  I am now off it after about 14 weeks and my hair has so drastically thinned out that I think I may just buzz my head and go for a Jason Statham look.  (Its just sad I&#x27;m one of the few my age who does not have a full head of hair) :(  I suspect that when I receive the check in the mail from Rogaine customer service I would guess it will probably have a disclaimer note saying that if I cash the check then they are not responsible for any long term pain or side effects that the medication may have caused.  In the highly unlikely event this has caused ill effects, I still certainly won&#x27;t be cashing that check any time soon.  THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS THAT ROGAINE IS NO MIRACLE CURE AND YOU SHOULD USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Im not saying it doesn&#x27;t work because it does for some.  I&#x27;ve just decided that I&#x27;m going to save up $10,000-15,000 for a hair transplant by the time I&#x27;m 30.  Hopefully there will be great advancement in hair re-generation technology by that time so my fingers are crossed.  (Sorry for the long review but I just had to speak my mind about this product)</li>
    <li> I am 21 and I have suffered hair loss as a side effect of steroid use.  I did not believe it would work.  In only 2 months the hair on the crown and top of my head has become thicker.  Give it some time it wont work over night, but it is definitely worth it.  I will be using this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> Hair regrowth products are nonsense. Science has not developed anything yet to help men/women grow hair.. its obvious. Save your money. Just eat healthy and take your vitamins.</li>
    <li> I am female and the Rogaine for men works well for me.  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine for about 18 months and am satisfied with the results. I began with the Rogaine foam but switched to the solution because I believe more of it reaches my scalp where it is needed, and after I read a dermatologist&#x27;s website where he said he achieved better patient results with the solution. I believe my satisfaction is based on realistic expectations. My hair is indeed thicker than when I began, but not as thick as it was when I was 25. Rogaine is part of an overall strategy that involves using the right shampoo and conditioner (I use Nioxin System 6 for Noticeably Thinning hair), having the right haircut and style,, and using the right grooming products. Use it as directed and as part of an overall strategy and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results. Oh - in hindsight I&#x27;d say, if you&#x27;re in doubt, start as soon as you think you may need it.</li>
    <li> Did regrow some hair.  About 3 years ago I noticed that I was getting a small, thin spot towards the top/back crown area of my scalp.  It had developed into a bald spot about the size of a quarter.  Hair loss does not run in my family, so I was kinda worried how this would progress, as I grew up never thinking twice about loosing my hair.  I also noticed that the area around my small bald spot (about the size of a tennis ball) was also getting thinner.  I started using Rogaine foam about 2 years ago, and now the small area that was completely bald does have some hair (although extremely thin and fine) and the scalp no longer has that &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; appearance.  It also appears that the rest of the thinning area has not progressed any farther.  So is this worth it?  I don&#x27;t know...Since I don&#x27;t have any relatives who have lost their hair (in order to gauge how mine might progress in the future)  It is more of piece of mind to me that the Rogaine may have slowed/stopped any future hair loss for me.  Only more time will tell.</li>
    <li> I said I would come back with more information. I ended up being yanked into the hospital for surgery and rehab with no warning. I went through emotional turmoil, lots of medication changes, pain, fatigue and to top it off, I forgot about the Rogaine. Well a bunch of my hair fell out in front where I have the most trouble. So at home I started using it religiously again and started looking at wigs. But after everything settled down and I used the Rogaine, it is growing back. It doesn&#x27;t look like I have my hair. I will still have to use certain hairstyles and tricks, but I am convinced this stuff really helped get my hair back so it could be the best it could be. I will keep using this until someone tells me I have to stop for some reason. If you are having problems, I would try this.  I am a woman and I use the extra strength anyway.  I am too old for pregnancies which is why they say women should not use the extra strength formula. They have never tested it for that and don&#x27;t want a lawsuit. I have used both this Rogaine and other minoxidil from other companies. I never had a big shedding cycle when I first started using it. I can&#x27;t say that it brought back lots of hair either.  So I keep plugging along with this stuff. I only use it in the evening instead of twice/day because I would have to wash my hair everyday if I used it more than once/day and I just don&#x27;t want to!  I have been told that it works better at encouraging the hair to stay it than it doesn make new hair grow. That would be hard to prove unless I quit using it and it all fell out.  But until I have a better solution, I am going to keep using it in hopes it delays having to use a wig or a hat all the time. So far I can fool people by using a hair style that hides the baldness and then use a little spray on hair color/thickener where it is the worst. I am disappointed in the application processes they now use. They used to have small pump bottles that would get it to my scalp easier. Now they give you an eye dropper which seems to just put on too much and it rolls off your scalp and the foam which gets on more hair than you want to use it on. I had one aerosol bottle left from the old days and I continue to fill it up with other liquids.</li>
    <li> I am not really sure if the product works on me or not... I am not seeing any difference on my head.</li>
    <li> Since a lot of people are wondering, I figured I&#x27;d throw a review up and share my experience. I am not balding in the back, but I do have a pretty severe receding hairline. It started in my early 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m 34). I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since the age of 31 (3 years) because I got tired of seeing more and more of my forehead each morning. Did it regrow all of my lost hair? No. But in the last 3 years of daily (once, sometimes twice) usage it has stopped my hairline. I&#x27;m not sure if it will continue to work forever, however for now, it definitely gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Just was i waiting for, a good product and it comes at the right time. The product works very good.</li>
    <li> I wanted to write a positive review of my experience to offset some of the negative and misleading reviews that I have seen here. Also keep in mind, I have only been using this product for about 3 months and the results are already astounding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background: I am a 27 year old male that has been experiencing a frontal receding hair-line since I was about 21. I have tried other hair regrowth products in the past that I have found online but have never had any success. For many years I gave up trying to regrow hair and started to cut my hair shorter and shorter as I was losing more and more of it. I considered a hair transplant procedure but the cost was too expensive and I was too embarrassed to go through the whole process. I was literally days away from shaving my head and accepting defeat until I decided to give one more product a shot, and thank god it was the Rogaine Foam. It has literally changed my life and I feel so much better and have 1000x more confidence that I did only months ago. Let me run through a couple of points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The myth that Rogaine foam only works on the vertex of the head is entirely FALSE. The vertex of my head surprisingly still has hair and has not thinned out at all so I never used it in that spot. My frontal scalp was receding and I was losing hair in the \\&quot;peaks\\&quot; of my scalp so I only used the foam in those spots. Rogaine has regrown about an inch of new hair on both sides of my little patch of hair I used to have in the front. It has absolutely redefined my hairline in the front and has made the existing hair much, much thicker. So yes, Rogaine will work in the front of your head, as well as the vertex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The \\&quot;dread shed\\&quot; is REAL. I know the last thing men with hair loss want to do is put a product on your head that will make you lose the little hair that you have left. The old saying \\&quot;It has to get worse before it gets better\\&quot; has never been more true. The good news is, it doesn&#x27;t last that long. I think it was about 2 weeks before I stopped shedding and started to regrow the new hair. I know this scares the hell out of most people, but it&#x27;s well worth it in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Supplementation and other products are key to aiding hair regrowth. It is very important that if you are serious in trying to regrow hair that you supply the best foundation to do so as possible. I am not a doctor so before you start taking any sort of supplementation it&#x27;s best to get approval first, but the following is what I would suggest: Take a good daily multivitamin. The vitamin I take is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0015R3AAO Optimum Nutrition Opti-Men Multivitamins, 180-Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has amazing ingredients such as Saw palmetto and B-complex vitamins that will aid with hair regrowth, not to mention all the other excellent benefits the vitamin has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started to show signs of thyroid problems such as feeling lazy, depressed, and of course hair loss. I went to the doctor to check my levels, but of course they said I was in the normal range. Not agreeing with the diagnoses I went ahead and purchased a Thyroid Support supplement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0036THNO8 Gaia Herbs Thyroid Support, 120 Liquid Phyto-Capsules]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking the Thyroid Support I feel 1000x better that I did before. I feel better, have more energy, no depression, and my hair is regrowing. For all I know, it could of been the source of my hair loss the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other product that I use that isn&#x27;t a supplement but I honestly think is helping a tremendous amount is a Bosley Revive Shampoo that reduces the amount of DHT on your scalp. As we all know, DHT is a major cause of hair loss in males. The Shampoo not only removes DHT from the scalp, but also makes the hair stronger and healthier. I use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003RZPCU8 Bosley Bos Revive Nourishing Shampoo for Visibly Thinning Non Color-Treated Hair, 33.8 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I stated earlier, these are the products that I use and have had amazing results with. Obviously, not everyone will have the same success that I have had, but it is extremely important to aid your body in every way possible to promote healthy hair growth. I am not even through the last bottle of foam in my first 3-pack and I have already gained 5 years of hair back that I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I hope this review doesn&#x27;t come off like an advertisement but will help some men that are on the fence with trying the product. After reading the negative reviews, I had to tell my story of success and I hope it helps at least one other person achieve their own success story of hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any questions, leave them in the comment section and I will try my best to answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> You want your hair back? Get it - use Rogaine. I&#x27;ve been taking Propecia for over a decade which works fantastically, but I still had thin hair on top and on the crwon, but mostly in front - a definite bald spot where my bangs should be. No more! Rogaine grew it almost all back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using off-brand minoxidil in the past and it was difficult to apply and FLAKED like crazy when it dried. Not this - the foam works well and there&#x27;s no sign of having used it.</li>
    <li> Im a women ,but the womens wasn&#x27;t strong enough,This works good .</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and received earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> For the first time in many,many years, I grew my hair past my bra strap! I loved having long hair and I will continue to order more.</li>
    <li> if I was to go bald.. the heck with hair.. I bought this thing and I just didn&#x27;t use it.. I have no idea if it works as I guess mine must have expired.. the product states that it is for people wh are getting bald from the centre of their head and not from the front.., im loosing my hair from the front, but not that bad where I need a product.. so im sorry I don&#x27;t have much feedback on this product.. hope it works fr whom uses it..</li>
    <li> I can see little hairs already growing on my head and it has only been 3 weeks and I only use it once a day.</li>
    <li> I have a great head of hair thanks to Rogaine! Try it. It is easy to use and effective.You must be patient.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my temple area, only to find out when I received it that it&#x27;s only for the middle of your head.&lt;br /&gt;This information is stated clearly on the package however, the merchant fails to give this information on amazon. I believe they know this and omit the information on purpose (which is why you see so many people trying to resell theirs here), so that they can achieve higher sales.&lt;br /&gt;Complete waste of money in my case, and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase if you&#x27;ve bought it before, but if trying for the first time, please buy from more honest channels.</li>
    <li> shipped on time, great product. This is second time ordering. I have been using for 4 months, once or twice daily. I have noticeable hair growth on the crown, midline. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The price was not bad. The delivery was quick. Didn&#x27;t do much for me. It might help you. I would go buy a generic form at your local drug store instead.</li>
    <li> I can only report that &amp;#34;so far&amp;#34; this product seems to be working well!  I slightly changed the texture of my hair and my hair color has been somewhat &amp;#34;lightened.&amp;#34;  It appears that I am beginning to regain some hair growth in back portion of my head&#x27;s crown.</li>
    <li> Great dispenser and what an improvement.  Just need a little dab so don&#x27;t waste this expensive stuff.  Does it work?  I don&#x27;t know, but it feels good to try.  Vanity, vanity.</li>
    <li> I  I am 45 years old and I am doing a very stressful senior manager job. I travel a lot and change time zones, take sleeping pills, get and resolve difficult situations  with demanding customers.  No wonder my hair started thinning five years ago. I tried a lot of different things: thickening shampoos, scalp massage and  rven Chinise accupincture. Nothing seemed helping and and my forhead line kept Enlarging in size and my hairline kept diminishing. I bought Rogaine in December. Now in April  my hair is almost fully grown back. It&#x27;s thick in the front of my head , it&#x27;s natural color not even silver. I did not beleive it, but it did work. I need a hairbrush again to put my hair in order and not to camouflage my bold forhead , hm, what a different feeling!  Now it is time to get 6 pack back and enjoy summer in full</li>
    <li> No problem with the description of the product and the packaging. Using it regularly and still waiting for results. Will update the review after couple of months</li>
    <li> I just used up three bottles of rogaine. I use it twice a day for almost three months and more thicker hair show up at the back top of my balding head which covers about three to four inches in diameter. The growth seems to be still uneven. I still have fine hair of some of the spots which hopefully it evens up with the rest of the hair for the next three month of use.</li>
    <li> Not sure and there is no way one can know the actual effectiveness of this (unless you can go back in time and re-live it again without using Rogaine).  Nothing obvious.  Just the hope that it might have slowed down the hair loss around the crown.  The hair loss in the front part of the head is progressing on its own and Rogaine does not make the claim that it would affect the front hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for top of head (vortex?) baldness only ... not frontal hair loss. You can&#x27;t return this product to Amazon because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; so you stuck with the bill and junk that apparently &amp;#34;might&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;might not&amp;#34; work for SOME hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving hair completely off is cheaper, and probably better for the environment anyways.</li>
    <li> My hair started thinning in the crown area several years ago, and like any male losing his hair at a young age, I immediately bought this product out of hope for delaying the inevitable.  That was in 2009, and now in 2013 I have decided to stop using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the instructions, I would eat the recommended amount of foam twice a day - once in the morning and once in the evening.  It tasted godawful, but at 23 I was willing to endure whatever suffering was necessary to stop the loss of my thick, luscious hair.  I tried to make it better, like adding the foam to my morning coffee or mixing it with ice cream, but that did little to dilute the awful taste.  I took the recommended dose daily for four years, and not only did Rogaine fail at regrowing my hair, but it also failed at preventing further loss.  Furthermore, throughout that period, I experienced an elevated heart rate and an inability to do cardiovascular exercise for more than a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I was rushed to the hospital due to unknown reasons at the time.  After several hours of tests and treatment, my doctor informed me that my heart was in terrible condition.  So bad, in fact, that if he had not known who I was, he would have assumed my heart was the heart of a 70 year old man who had survived multiple heart attacks.  After several minutes of discussion, he identified my Rogaine use as the culprit for my heart condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, not only did Rogaine fail at preventing hair loss, but it also destroyed my heart in the process.  The only reason I give it two rather than one star is due to the fact that after years of ingesting such a terribly tasting substance, I am now at peace with my hair loss.  So, thank you for putting me through something so traumatic that losing my hair now seems like a walk in the park.</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t seen much results with this product it was shipped to me fairly quick going to keep using this to see results</li>
    <li> Product works for a majority of people. It&#x27;s scientifically proven to be effective. End of discussion. Science. However, it won&#x27;t work for a minority of people (also scientifically proven to be the case). Because it didn&#x27;t work for you does not mean you can go nuts with your review saying it&#x27;s the worst product ever. I use a generic version of the foam. Application is easier than the oil based one. Quick and simple. No problem doing it a lifetime; i do a bunch of other things everyday like brush my teeth, put gel in my hair, write amazon reviews, etc. It does cause shedding in the beginning. Stick with it because it does regrow hair.</li>
    <li> For top not frontal hair loss; Didn&#x27;t see this in product information but only found out on the product box, not for me;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t return, listed as &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> this stuff continues to work.</li>
    <li> hair is growing in my bald spot and it is easy to use.will tell all my buddys about this great hair regrower.</li>
    <li> If Men knew how good this worked they would buy a year supply and would never run out! Just make sure to put it on everyday, and not give up, If you have the right reasons for hair loss, you will regrow your hair with this product! It is amazing! But you need to do it daily!  I saw my son use it and his confidence came back. I wish my ex would try it, it sure would help male pattern baldness...</li>
    <li> I tried Rogaine when my hair was thinning on the vertex of my head. I have been using it once a day for about 11/2 years and I think it has made a difference. I think I grew new hair on the balding spot and my existing hair thickened. Perhaps a key is to start using Rogaine early before you have a complete bald spot. It is easy to use and there appears to be little to no risk. Why not give it a try?</li>
    <li> It came in a different packaging and doesn&#x27;t feel like the original.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that you just can&#x27;t get an accurate reading off of.  My husband has been using it for a while, and requires refills, though, so it is really nice to find a cheapish 3pack for his refills rather than the more expensive store bought versions.  I recommend this to any wife who notices the cost. haha</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen a lot of improvement. These products always work better with a good dht blocker, but ofcourse results always take about 6 or more months.</li>
    <li> I m using this Product for more than 5 month and the results are perfect,&lt;br /&gt;i recommend every one to get it it&lt;br /&gt;USE IT BEFORE YOU LOSE IT(HAIR)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I got VERY bad dry/flaky skin, and my hair fell out even quicker (probably because of the bad state my scalp was in). It was easy to apply though, so 2/5 stars.</li>
    <li> Been using Rogaine for several years and although my hair is thinner I am sure it would have been alot worse if I had not been using Rogaine</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone because the price was practical and now I&#x27;m stuck with it because it didn&#x27;t work. I should have tried a single can first.</li>
    <li> works and fast service</li>
    <li> Definitely has reduced the amount of hairs I see in my comb each morning. Wish it was a once a day application. I still see one or two hairs, but this product has made a good difference.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Delivers what it promises.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my cat for in order to cure him of some bald spots he was suffering from; he developed a severe rash and despite expensive veterinary care he died from the subsequent infection. I am heartbroken and furious at the peddlers of this product, and warn everyone out there to AVOID it as it is NOT SAFE.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since October 2014, and have not finished my third bottle yet. I started to see amazing results upon finishing the second bottle. Ironically, I have grown lots of hair in unwanted areas including my hands, face and neck. I have placed another order.</li>
    <li> Be patience... You need at least 4 to 5 five months of continued use to start seeing result... But i can honestly say that it works and probably is the only thing in the market for hair-growing that actually makes a difference... 100% recommended..</li>
    <li> Rogaine seems to slow down the speed of hair loss. It&#x27;s not the same for everyone but it does seem to work for me. The foam is much better than the liquid form as in it is easier to apply. As the rogaine website often list the 4-foam spray format as unavailable, I often place my orders for the 3-foam spray instead here and I get it fast. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars only because I&#x27;m not 100% sure that my hair would be any thinner without it. I think it&#x27;s more of a mental thing that I&#x27;m doing what I can to prevent hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine is tricky, because if my hair stays the same, then they have a life long customer. So, maybe they have a great product, or they&#x27;re making bank by sending me tubes full of white foam and hair loss just hasn&#x27;t set into full effect. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just starting to use it</li>
    <li> I got all items with shipments except&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine for Men Hair Regrowth Treatment, 5% Minoxidil Topical Aerosol, Easy-to-Use Foam, 2.11 Ounce, 3 Month Supply .. and the status here is delivered!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell how effective it is when you have thin hair but haven&#x27;t begun to noticeably bald because it slowly grows in hair and when you look everyday you don&#x27;t notice the small increase in hair. However, if you stop using it, you notice how much hair disappears and realize just how effective it was. Additionally, the real stuff has been a lot better than the cheaper brands. The cheaper brands leave you with a burning scalp and the smell of alcohol.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years ,will not grow hair ,just keeps what you have ,the hair you have will grow</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working?</li>
    <li> Being a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; woman, my hair is thinning out and I can&#x27;t have it.  Only used it about a week so will let you know if I see a difference.  Reading a beauty &amp;#34;blog&amp;#34;, it said that women should go for the men&#x27;s Rogaine to see more of a difference.  Hope my voice doesn&#x27;t get deeper. :)</li>
    <li> So, I was losing some hair around my temporal lobes.  I know it isn&#x27;t supposed to work for that kind of baldness, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.  Very, very glad I did.  Grew back a couple of millimeters of hair line (not guessing, I was measuring my rate of hairloss. haha), and my hair line has not receded since (over 2 years of use).</li>
    <li> It works. Only thing is if you are a man of color (Black) make sure you check the mirror to see if you have a white patch on your crown. Brush it in and after it dries add moisturizer to lessen the powdery white stain on your crown. I been using the same box since April 9, 2014 and it&#x27;s 10/26/14 so it last much longer than advertise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seem difference yet.</li>
    <li> I am in week 6 of using the FOAM. I am a Black guy (40 years old) so i was skeptical about its effectiveness on coarse hair. I wasn&#x27;t balding at the crown, i was balding in the middle front area (my hairline was starting to recede resulting in a bald patch dead center above my forehead. Had to start taking my hairline waaay back to disguise it. The patch wasn&#x27;t completely bald put thinning very badly. After 4 weeks, I could see the hair getting thicker. I&#x27;m now at week 6 and the hair is slowly growing back in. At this rate I&#x27;m expecting the bald spot to be grown back in the next 4-6 weeks. I&#x27;ll update more then.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its just me, but this Rogaine makes my head itch everytime i use it. I didn&#x27;t get any side effects or anything, but the constant itching makes me not want to use it. I prefer to use Nioxin instead.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. I see hair on the crown of my head and the coverage look good. I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> My husband decided to start using this a while back. He went through one bottle and bought more. After about 3 months he started noticing odd things happening. I&#x27;ll be blunt about it: he said he had zero sex drive and that his penis became noticeably smaller when in its normal, flaccid state. Obviously, this freaked him out. He&#x27;s a very healthy, normal mid-thirties guy who isn&#x27;t taking any other medication. I looked around on the internet and found no mention of any sexual side affects coming from the official Rogaine website, or even sites like Webmd.com. However, a general search on the topic brought up numerous websites where long lists of men complained of the exact same symptoms. The fact that Rogaine won&#x27;t own up to the serious side affects their product can cause is ridiculous. My husband stopped using the product immediately and within a week everything went back to normal. He is lucky because I read about men who didn&#x27;t recover fully or who took up to a year to finally regain their original size and sex drive. He only used the product for about 3 months so that could be why he got away with no long term problems. In the time that he used the Rogaine he noticed no difference in his hair. I know that isn&#x27;t enough time to judge the hair restoring ability of Rogaine, but with those side affects, what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> I been watching this product years ago. I figured cool when my hair starts to fall at least theres something.Iam in my early 40s and low and behold i started seeing some thining. At first i was in denial. then my son saw it and my wife confirmed it. they said its ok but hey i wasnt ready. I bought the foam 6 months ago after three months i think i lost more. This is normal but painful for me to see. But i stuck it out 6 months into it and finally its coming back. My spot is not as noticible. I didnt tell my wife or son ive been using the product to see if they notice anything. And amazing enough my wife said are you taking vitamins? And my son said dad what ever your doing its working.They say some respond quicker and others longer but you wont know till you try it. My advise dont wait. nip it in the butt at first sight. you will know in at least 4 to 6 months. oh iam not talking peach fuzz either. if it works for you the way it did for me then you found your product.if not you can always shave your head.</li>
    <li> I only have used the product for 6 weeks and must be a lucky one. it is clearly growing hair. it is the peach fuzz that i have read about at this point. let&#x27;s see if it turns into manageable hair. the only bad is that rogaine is making my forehead flake and rough. i have baby&#x27;s skin as i use lab series since 22. It could be the winter drying my skin out, but never has it happened like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also use n- shampoo mixed with nioxin and ovation. i had some ovation and nioxin left so i just mixed them all up. don&#x27;t know if that does anything. but it&#x27;s what i do. i plan on switching to the generic when my stock is out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would give it 5 stars but due to it drying my head out i can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know that it works but not hurting anything</li>
    <li> Growing hair now. My hair has now stopped falling out at a lower rate. I would recommend this very higlhy</li>
    <li> Bought it to try on my (incipient!) receding hairline and just found out it is only indicated for top-of-scalp hair loss.  BEWARE: AMAZON DOES NOT ACCEPT A RETURN ARGUING THE FLAMMABLE CONTENTS CANNOT BE HANDLE SAFELY.</li>
    <li> I found the same product at Target and it is much cheaper.  I have been using this product for a while now and don&#x27;t notice any difference but loosing hair.</li>
    <li> recommended by a friend. hoping it works.</li>
    <li> I have only frontal baldness (receding hairline), and this product clearly states it does not work in that case. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months and now can say it works mildly. I&#x27;ve taken close-up pictures of my hair before starting to use, after 3 and 6 months. After 3 months I saw no difference. Persisted more time, as some people say it took more time to work. After 6 months I saw on the pictures that the hair on the \\&quot;border\\&quot; is growing thicker and stronger. But I did not see new hair growing. Where there were the holes of previous absent hair, now I see tiny thin hair growing, but I can only see them watching intently, so they don&#x27;t give me any hair volume, but show the medicine working. I have been using it only once daily instead of twice daily, I&#x27;ll try now to use more frequently. So, considering I&#x27;m already using finasteride oral and ketoconazol shampoo; and the next choice is surgery, I&#x27;ll keep using this. If you have frontal baldness give this a try, but don&#x27;t forget to take close-up pictures from many angles before and after, for the effect may be mild, don&#x27;t expect you&#x27;ll simply get the hair back...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I use this even though I am a woman. The woman&#x27;s dosage (2%) is not strong enough to do any good and is never recommended to patients.  The foam is much easier to use and doesn&#x27;t run like the liquid.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this at WalMart, but when I seen the price I knew I had to start buying from this site.</li>
    <li> Entrega en tiempo establecido por el vendedor, producto nuevo y en perfecto estado y correctamente embalado. Compre con toda confianza</li>
    <li> Rogaine has worked great for me.  It seems to make my hair thicker and when I was my hair way less hair falls out vs before I started using it.  It&#x27;s recomended just for the back of your head but I apply it to the front too and my hair is noticeably thicker in front where it was receding.  Worth a try!</li>
    <li> I am about to conclude my third month using this formula and to the naked eye I think I am seeing slightly thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Used for years.  Does not add hair just prevents it from falling out.</li>
    <li> It just smells good. I didn&#x27;t notice a change.</li>
    <li> Well I try this one for growing facial hair. It works fine on my face expect for that it is kind of smell like soda s***. And I ran out 3 bottle of them and I got pretty significant improvement on my face. Recommend this one. And this is my second purchase btw.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Let me recommend friends&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Also packing is perfect.</li>
    <li> I switched to the foam because I couldn&#x27;t find the liquid applied directly to the scalp at the store I usually shop.  This stuff flat out does not work.  Fortunately I was able to find a source for Minoxidil in liquid form but strongly suggest you never buy this.  The foam pretty much guarantees the minoxidil really doesn&#x27;t get on your scalp where it&#x27;s needed.  After a large weight loss and resulting hair loss my doctor recommended minoxidil and the liquid worked very well.  I had used it for years with no problem.  The store where I buy it stopped carrying the liquid and a month after using the foam I started losing hair.</li>
    <li> Great product definitely regrows hair very easy to use foam daily, i have been using it for a year now and the difference is very notable i started seeing new hair just 2 months after using it twice daily.</li>
    <li> If you do not want to lose your remaining hair, do not use this item. At the first time you feel that everything is ok because the item gives some volume to your hair. So you assume that it is working but you lose your remaining hair day by day faster than you did before the product. One other thing is some of the cans are not working at all and you do not have any chance to return it. They offer you to pay less to replace the item ( doesn&#x27;t make sense) All in all, if you do not believe my review, get the product and see what will happen on your own. I purchased the item by means of reading the positive reviews. Actually I should have read the 1 star reviews first.</li>
    <li> I love using this product because it is very easy to apply, and it does not leave my hair feeling greasy, sticky, messy, etc. I have not given the product a 5-star only because I have not used it long enough to see results. If my results (reversal of balding) end up good I will write another review.</li>
    <li> I know this product is intended for the crown of your head but I have to tell you I have been using this product for 2 years on my frontal hairline and it has come with absolute great success! While I do have a hairline that sits farther back than normal, most of the gentleman in my family are either completely bald or half way there. I have to attribute this to my consistent use of Rogain. I don&#x27;t dare stop using it to see if my theory is wrong because I am enjoying a full head of hair. From my research the only reason Rogaine&#x27;s parent company does not advertise this for the frontal hairline is because they never tested it to do so. I&#x27;m not the only one who has had success with the front hairline either. Many others I spoke with who tried it on a whim have agreed. While I can&#x27;t say it helps grow hair in the front I can say it absolutely stops you from losing that hair, at least that&#x27;s what happened in my situation. I think for the price Amazon offers it and the success myself and others have had why not try it for frontal hairline loss? What do you have to lose besides more hair?!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful guaranteed product that will have you amazed as it did myself from none to get out here that&#x27;s not a hair piece, toupee, or weave/sew in? AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I figured I would try this stuff and see if it actually did fill in the balding spot on the top of my head, and it did.  The only thing about it is that you have to continually use it or you&#x27;ll lose it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this stuff for a long time.  So much better than the liquid.  You can style your hair and it looks normal.  As for effectiveness, I&#x27;m not sure since it has been so long.  I just stick with it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, but I don&#x27;t reall see much of a difference, but my husband thinks it&#x27;s working so that that. If he&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Everything was ok. :)</li>
    <li> After a few uses, the foam exit got blocked, so now I am unable to apply it. That happened on all of them.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband he like it very much and make the hair healthy and smooth</li>
    <li> No greasy hair with this one compared to the liquid. I&#x27;ve seen great improvements with Minox. Beware of all the fake review for other hair products! Minoxidil is the only stuff that has been proven to work.</li>
    <li> This is working really well to restore my husbands hair.  He&#x27;ll never have the full beautiful hair he did in high school, but it looks pretty good and maybe if he had used it sooner, he wouldn&#x27;t be as bald as he is now.  :D</li>
    <li> I am 28 years old and I started getting bald 5 years ago. I used to use Minoxidil 2% for 6 months and it was working without any side effects. I realized some new hair was growing and everything was fine. I ran out of Minoxidil 2% and decided to buy Rogaine (expecting to see better results in less time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:  I had dandruff and I started having this problem (I bought a special shampoo to avoid this issue), then 20 minutes after application my head becomes itchy. (but only for some minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive things: It works much faster than 2%. It definitely works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal Advise or personal point of view: Use this product if you have money to spend and want to see some quick and efficient results but be ready for side effects.  If you want to avoid side effects or have never used this type of products.  You better start with Minoxidil 2% from another brand or with another active ingridient that avoids side effects.</li>
    <li> No effect on hair growth</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this stuff for around a year now.  It helped with the baldspot on the back of his head but like the instructions state, didn&#x27;t do anything for the receeding hair line in the front.  :-(  He uses it with Nizorol shampoo and s5 DHT blocker cream.</li>
    <li> Such a pain to lose hair at a young age. Stress, Stress and more stress will do it to you. ROGAINE WORKS! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone....</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s a foam, because it doesn&#x27;t drip. I can put it exactly where it&#x27;s needed.  I definitely see new hair growth (although the new growth is very fine and lighter than my other hair).  Warning: if you stop using it, the new hair will disappear.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t give comment on it yet.&lt;br /&gt;3 stars are for seller.&lt;br /&gt;and for the product smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a month but no new hair seen yet.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
    <li> it is very great use it use it every day, also works as a styling product  will buy it again</li>
    <li> After months of using the liquid formula unfortunately i got allergic to it, so i l looked up this one online and it works perfectly! Btw i am a female and my doctor said it is even better to use the men&#x27;s formula for better results</li>
    <li> The foam is really nice because it can double as hair gel if you rub it throughout your head. Given the expensiveness, I think the 3 pack is the only way to go if you are regular user.</li>
    <li> not seeing any results...</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 2-3 years but not that dramatic. It&#x27;s just keep what you have - err or say 90% of it 😀</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I use the men&#x27;s Rogaine since it was stronger for my thinning hair/hair loss.  I am a 44 yr. mom of three and my hair loss has been more visible this last year.  I did some research and found that it&#x27;s better to stop and treat the loss early, since it&#x27;s easier to stop then regrow.  I started my second bottle with no significant changes in hair loss or growth knowing it takes up to 4-6 months to grow hair.  I was applying to the front top and right side of my head since that is where my thinning  was most noticeable.  I know the instructions say for use on top of head but since my doctor told me that Rogain does grow hair anywhere I decided to apply where needed. The instruction also say \\&quot;not for woman\\&quot; but the more I looked into it, they don&#x27;t recommend for woman because Rogaine for Men is tested on men.  I know there is Rogaine for woman but my mother used that and it didn&#x27;t grow any hair for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the second week of my second bottle my right ear started to itch and swell.  I thought I had gotten a bug or spider bite.  Didn&#x27;t think it was the Rogaine since I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.  Then I started applying to the left side of my head since I wanted more hair there too.  That&#x27;s when I realized I was allergic to the Rogaine because my other ear started to get swollen, red and itchy too.  Not only that, my whole face, eyes lids, behind my ear lobes and back of neck broke out into hives, rash, and terrible itching also experienced accelerated heart rate and dizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally freaked out, I did some probing around on the internet and found that even though rare, these exact symptoms have been reported.  It takes about a month for your body to react to the chemicals and once it does, it&#x27;s a serious allergic reaction.  I thought I had to call 911.  I was worried my throat would swell up too and have a heart attack.  Not exaggerating, it was a serious allergic reaction.  I will notify the company and report the reaction but for now, it would be good to use a test patch.  It&#x27;s been reported that those who have experienced the allergic reaction did a patch test and it wasn&#x27;t the Minoxidil in the Rogaine but another ingredient so do some research and patch test before.  Unfortunately the patch test will be a smaller dose the results may not be the same as when you apply to your scalp, plus the test will take time and we all want to grow hair asap but it&#x27;s still worth it.  If you notice any changes in your skin, I would discontinue at once. I can only assume I&#x27;m not the only one who has experienced this reaction but that others who have either have not reported this because they didn&#x27;t know it was the Rogaine (since it developed a month later), didn&#x27;t think it mattered or just didn&#x27;t care but my experience was truly alarming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck everyone out there and share any good findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Wednesday and this full blown reaction was Monday.  The swelling is just starting to go down, the itching is still there but the heart rate and dizziness is gone.  I didn&#x27;t want to rate the product since it didn&#x27;t work plus I think it can be a serious health matter but since a star rating is required I gave it the lowest rating.</li>
    <li> not sure this stuff works, but have been using for years and still have some hair:)</li>
    <li> I tried alot of hair restorating products thisone really worked. In the first 2 to 3 weeks your hair starts to fall out I almost stopped using it but in the next 2 weeks it started to grow stronger and fuller. You have to use it twice a day I would also recommend propecia.</li>
    <li> It seemed okay until after about a week of use when the top stopped dispensing the foam.  When I tried to fix it, the whole plastic mechanism just fell off, so now there is no access to the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since November with very little results. However, my balding isn&#x27;t occurring at my crown but rather at the front of my head.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one that works for my hair. It&#x27;s not greasy like the oil ones. And my hair has been growing since i&#x27;ve used this product. Great product!! will continue to use it</li>
    <li> everything was on time and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> I love Rogaine. I have been using it since I was in late college (I am 35 now). I totally expected to be bald by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I stop using rogaine I notice that in the shower i see hair on my hands. With rogaine that rarely happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your maternal side has hair issues, you should use rogain and early on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am not a physician. Check with your physician first about medical issues etc. Rogaine was used as a high blood pressure medication so make sure it is okay for you</li>
    <li> Although, this product is not a cure, it really helps to keep the hair loss at bay and look younger!</li>
    <li> Product got here in time. Looks like new packaging. Have been using this product for about 1.5 years. Possibly helping to maintain.</li>
    <li> As a note - amazon will not allow a return on this product.  And what the description does not say - is that it is only for use if you are getting bald on the back or top of your head - not to be used for receding hairline.  So I cannot use the product and spent $40 for it only to be told it cannot be returned.  Unfortunately this fine print was not disclosed.  Hopefully my review will save you the $40 if it is not the right product for you.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple products and rogaine works for the back of the head bald spot. They need to use all of the money they have made on rogaine over the years, and invent a product for the frontal hair line, which is what everyone really needs.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by it, and he has thick, lustrous hair.  His hair is scores better than mine.  We get this on auto delivery, as he won&#x27;t be without it for a single day.</li>
    <li> I cant say 100 percent that this is what has kept my hair over the years (pattern of baldness in the family) but years ago I started using this at least once a week as a preventative measure. I still have my hair, and just for that piece of mind its a recurring investment that I will definitely keep making.</li>
    <li> it works only this way&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t forget it&lt;br /&gt;take too long to regrow&lt;br /&gt;getting a hat maybe an option&lt;br /&gt;good luck</li>
    <li> it was the best price on the internet.....new packing looks very cool. new bottle old wine.......&lt;br /&gt;still applying ...waiting for results.</li>
    <li> Used it for four years, and never truly saw the benefit. I kept thinking that it was working, but now that I have stopped, I have seen no change.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine so much better</li>
    <li> As the product and many reviewers would tell, one needs to apply this without fail everyday twice for it to work. So patience pays off with this. Foam is easy to apply than topical solutions. Its best if you can apply it directly to head instead of with hand, because if tends to vaporize a little before you move your hand towards the head. Some time ago, I used it irregularly and didnt see any effect.. but since the last 4-5 months have been using it regularly without fail twice and since then I am seeing noticeable improvement, not a lot though.  My receding hairline is still visible.. also the product desc tells depending on the individual it may or may not work for the front receding hairline problem.</li>
    <li> I hope this helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Rogaine Foam for 3 months 2x per day. I have not missed an application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It grows hair.&lt;br /&gt;It gave my hair more lift and body within 1-2 weeks. Prior to using this my hair was dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;It has decreased my hair shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply with the bottle directly on the area/s&lt;br /&gt;It does grow hair in the front hairline. Several doctor&#x27;s informed me that the company would have to go back to the FDA to get it approved for frontal hairloss. Regardless it works for the front.&lt;br /&gt;5-10 minutes to dry&lt;br /&gt;After I had my Ferritin levels/Iron stores checked and vitamin d level checked the product worked better. I was vitamin d deficient and my iron stores/ferritin levels were low. I learned that it is paramount that you have ample stores otherwise your hair will not grow as quickly if at all. I added iron and 5000iu of vitamin d3 to my regamine.&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking Propoecia for 9 years. It helps but what I have learned with hairloss (MPB) is it is a must to use many products in concert with each other. Nizoral shampoo 1% is also a good shampoo that I use.&lt;br /&gt;I also feel confident that the formula will not change with Rogaine foam. Considering the company went through the fda. I bring this point up because I was using Spectral DNC for years then they changed the formula and my hair fell out in clumps. No more experimenting for me.&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient to buy. It is in just about every retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gained 10 lbs within 2 months of using the product. My diet was the same.&lt;br /&gt;It bloats you, so it is tough to lose weight with this.&lt;br /&gt;I have increased my cardio and made sure that my carbs and sugar are very low. I lost 3lbs so far.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a long time to notice hugh improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend the product. I am 40 yrs old.</li>
    <li> I am 21 years old and I have been using the Rogaine foam for about 2 years now.  Does it work?  I would say yes. It works to the point it stopped the balding process.  However, do I now have a thick head of hair now.  No. I would say if I go a few days without it I think it is noticeable. The product is certainly easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cause a mess.  It doesn&#x27;t have an odor.  I recommend you give it a try and stick with it for a while.  The risk is it doesn&#x27;t work and your hair falls out.  If you are looking at this product it is happening anyway. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I accidently spilled some of this all over my hands.  Now it looks like I haven&#x27;t left my parents basement in years and spend all day with my hands down my pants.</li>
    <li> Received as said, but I can&#x27;t give you a perfect score until I am able to us it. I have only used if for 3 days so far</li>
    <li> Rogaine is definitely working for me, but it is a somewhat unpleasant experience. It messy, smells bad, and You have to remember to do it twice a day EVERY day. It took a good 6 months to see some results. I started looking around to see what else could help, and I ran across a hair nutrient that I thought looked interested. I used it for about a month, WITH the rogaine, and my hair growth literally doubled in a month. It is called Mynoxidrin. [[ASIN:B00Q5KMX5O Mynoxidrin - Extra Strength Hair Nutrient Formula Nourishes and Strengthens Thinning Hair and Promotes Hair Growth ]] I cant say enough about this combo..absolute miracle for me</li>
    <li> ive  tried  every  product  under  the  sun but in 2012  i found  a product called  zx42  and ive  been  very  very pleased  it started  working  fast</li>
    <li> Frankly this review is slightly embarrassing to write, nobody wants to admit that they&#x27;re going bald, especially to everyone on the internet. But I really think it&#x27;s important to share my finding about Rogaine because there seems to be a lot of negativity directed towards this product. First and foremost, Rogaine works for only a very small percentage of people, but it does work. Secondly, it&#x27;s not the end-all, be-all product for hair-loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss is caused by a number of factors, including the loss of testosterone and the increase in DHT. Rogaine does not go after these factors as a cause of hair loss, which is why it is only effective less than 50% of the time. What Rogaine does is focus on opening channels in your cell membrane to promote hair regrowth. While the mechanism isn&#x27;t 100% understood it basically is trying to increase oxygen and blood flow to the part of your scalp that needs it to produce more hair. I&#x27;ve actually had very little success with Rogaine, until I started using [[ASIN:B00KYXSF00 this product]] AS WELL as Rogaine. Both products alone simply did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still unsure as to why each product wouldn&#x27;t simply add the other&#x27;s ingredients, but perhaps it&#x27;s an efficacy problem and combining both would water-down the other. What I usually end up doing sounds more like a ritual than anything because it takes over 30 minutes to apply both products to my scalp, but I have to say it&#x27;s well worth it after (finally) seeing some significant hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine itself is a foam, you must apply this FIRST before applying the NuNutrients hair serum. You must apply this to a 100% clean head, no hair products are anything on it. You don&#x27;t want to block the transmission of any of the chemicals in the products that are helping you regrow your hair! That said, I also must tell you NOT to blow dry you hair. This is going to demolish your existing healthy hair and burn your cells around the follicles. Just gently towel dry your hair, and then apply the rogaine foam. Let the foam go deep into your pores, and let it air dry. Make sure to wash your fingers after you do it, you don&#x27;t need hair there!  (jk)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you let the foam completely absorb, within 15 min you MUST apply the NuNutrients. This product is a spray, and I recommended that you actually spraying it on your hands if you only have a small section of hair that needs to be regrown. After it&#x27;s on your hands, then massage it onto the problem areas of your scalp. However, if your whole head is missing hair, then the spray is actually easier than trying to apply it to your fingers then your hair. After you let this product dry on your scalp, do NOT by any means wear a hat!!! I was doing this for over a month because I was ashamed of my balding head, and it really does counter the affects of using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I can say that after 4 months of using this technique, I&#x27;m actually now starting to see results. I&#x27;ve used Rogaine by itself for over a year, but that alone wasn&#x27;t doing the trick. I hope this review helps.el dry your hair, and then apply the rogaine foam.

    <li> I purchased for my wife, who is 60.  Her dermatologist recommended the men&#x27;s strength, along with a prescription for a special shampoo (Nizarol, I think).  She tried the spray first, but it really irritated her scalp, so she switched to foam.  The hair growth is visible -- after 3 months of regular use, she has lots of very short hairs coming in.  She uses it all over the top part of her head, when her hair is damp.  (She had purchased a wig, because she was so concerned about the thinning on the top of her head, but she still hasn&#x27;t worn it yet!)  I think that is the best evidence that this is working.  It&#x27;s a commitment, but I guess you will be committed to using this if your thinning hair bothers you.</li>
    <li> I am 24 male and before I started this product I had minor balding at the vertex of my scalp. During my application of Rogaine, at about the 2nd or 3rd month, my hair began to rapidly thin all over the top of my head, and I had a very itchy scalp. I discontinued the drug and am left with only thinning hair, worsening of my baldness and have bad scalp folliculitis that have not gone away after 3 months of cessation. This product was a total nightmare for me and am hoping it has not cause permanent effects; I am glad it works for others though, but it&#x27;s still a great gamble.</li>
    <li> I use this product once a day and it has helped me with female hair loss.</li>
    <li> I am a hopeful fellow so, I think I&#x27;ll keep this habit!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 8 months and have finally regrown what hair is going to grow back.  But you must keep using it.  I use it 5 days, once a day,  out of the week.  I am a female and my doctor recommended that I use the 5%.</li>
    <li> Cool, my hair will be saved. My hair should soon can grow a lot of very thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this products from 3+ years and I really works! Hair grows thicker and helps you to retain your hair. In my case, I only use it in the mornings, one application a day (and not two, as they recommenden), and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you apply too much, your scalp probably gets itchy, so beware.</li>
    <li> I have lost more hair using this product. I didn&#x27;t even get to use the 3rd bottle it just went in to the trash.</li>
    <li> Like many other people reading these reviews, I was having a hard time deciding whether I wanted to take on the cost, hassle, and potential let down of trying out Rogaine. Personally, it got to the point that second-guessing whether or not to try it was more mentally taxing than just giving it a shot and dealing with potentially less than ideal (or no) results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now used this for almost 2 months, with fairly strict adherence. Most days I&#x27;ll apply twice, but sometimes only once (maybe 2/7 days a week only apply once). Somehow I havent even gone through one entire bottle which really lowers the cost per application for me. I am only 25 and my hair loss is pretty much limited to a receding hairline at the temples (probably closest to III on the Norwood Scale but I dont have an objective assessment of my crown). My hair is still thick but the pattern is definitely there. Despite reading conflicting things about whether this works on the temple area, I gave it a shot. Granted, I didnt take any objective measurements/pictures, but do think I have a pretty honest sense of whats happening. I generally apply a styling paste to my hair, work it in, then sort of slick it back; then apply rogaine to the temple areas before styling my hair. I&#x27;ve tried the reverse order and it works just as well (ie., apply rogaine when hair is damp, then apply styling paste). This stuff dissolves really quickly and doesnt leave any residue or scent. Basically like its not even there. Of course things could get messier if you had to apply it to a broader area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results: After almost 2 months, I have definitely seen some results. It appears to be working on one side more than the other for whatever reason, even with identical applications on both sides. I never experienced a marked increase in shedding as is reportedly pretty common--maybe I&#x27;m just lucky. Its hard to tell exactly what hairs are the result of the Rogaine but when I hold back my hair on the part the hairline is definitely straighter and more filled in. Definitely exceeded my expectations in that regard. I am eager to see if it ends up making a difference on the other side. Could be random or possibly be related to the way I part my hair. Who knows. In terms of shedding in the shower/pillow, I think I can safely say that has decreased. I&#x27;ve started to use shampoo/conditioner less frequently (once every 3-4 days) so that has affected hair loss in the shower on its own I&#x27;m sure. But I think I can safely say I have less shedding overall as a result of the Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this product. Granted, I&#x27;m young and my hair is still thick, but it seems to be working in the contentious temple region (the only place I&#x27;m applying it). At first I was hypersensitive to possible side effects, but after 2 months I really cant attribute anything to Rogaine. I feel fine and any time I dont there is usually a reason (hungover, etc.). Based on the cost per application and the minor hassles involved to use the product, I think I&#x27;ll keep using it. It looks like I can get 2 months out of each bottle, which puts a year supply at something like $80--pretty amazing. If your hair loss is in the early stages, I&#x27;d suggest trying this out. Yeah, there are horror stories out there about people shedding a lot and having adverse reactions--but I think it&#x27;s worth trying it out for yourself. Better to take control than to just sit back IMHO.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months now.  Honestly I don&#x27;t really notice much difference.</li>
    <li> Works and also can be used to style your hair makes it look fuller</li>
    <li> Works well however it does not blend in well with your hair.. .. . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> This should be banned. Im 19 and my skin wrinkled as a side effect with 1 month of its use. I got dark circles under my eyes and after a few online research I found out its not just me who is experiencing these side effects. Dont buy this unless you want hair  growth really bad that you dont care your skin to be seen as 90 year old and health problems it causes.</li>
    <li> Well saddly I am using this but at least there is something to resist the jeans I have been given.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure it is really working for me but  just may be one of the 10% that is does not work on.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> very nice product, effective,easy to use and cost efficient compared with Kirkalnd or the topical solutions. I do recommend this to all male-patterned hair loss</li>
    <li> My case:&lt;br /&gt;I was never a guy that had &amp;#34;a lot of hair&amp;#34; like some people do. My hair has been always straight and very fine. I noticed it started thinning on the crown area and on top of my head when I was in my early twenties. I am now 31 and since I was about 28 some people, specially in my family, started telling me that it was getting more and more noticeable. I started looking at it more using a mirror in my bathroom and could definitely see a very noticeable bald spot that was rapidly getting worse. The front of my hairline has held nicely though.&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I decided to search for hair transplant clinics and finally went to one. They were very honest, straightforward and asked me if I was using anything right now to fight the baldness. I was surprised about how open they were about my situation and that they did not charge me a single penny for the consultation (that&#x27;s a different review :) They mentioned that Rogaine can work so I decided to try it after that recommendation and learning how expensive the hair transplant was going to be...&lt;br /&gt;Result:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 14 weeks now... Using it twice a day most days. I have missed a few days but try to follow the instructions. I am keeping track of the progress by taking a series of pictures on the balding area every saturday morning after I take a shower and the hair dries. I always try to use the same angles and apply the camera flash to have the same perspective. I can tell you that it is definetely working and I started noticing progress after 9 or 10 weeks. The bald spot is still there but I can see how the hair is growing back. As long as you make it part of your daily routine, use it twice a day, and keep track of your progress I would definetely recommend to at least give this a try. I am not sure if my hair will grow back entirely but it is definetely looking better so I am just going to keep using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;I am complementing this by using a Biotin Shampoo by Nexus every day and occasionally taking a Biotin supplement. I was never entirely bald in my thinning spot in the crown area and on top.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to know if it works for me. But I relieved it quick and it is easy to apply with the foam. I will update once it&#x27;s been a few months.</li>
    <li> It depends on your genetics so it seems, through much research, and not right for me.  I stuck with it for 2 years and didn&#x27;t see any difference, in fact, my hair loss continued unabated.  It may help some so I don&#x27;t want to negate hope because everyone is different.  A weird side effect for me, I had trouble sleeping when I used it. Could be correlative and not causative, but I slept better after I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Minoxidil works for me.  I decided to go with the foam so the product would stay were I applied it.  Now that I have new hair growth (and it does take a few months) I think the foam is a bit more messy because it&#x27;s sticking to my hair so I may switch to the topical, but I would highly recommend the foam if you have a &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; area to apply it to. I didn&#x27;t experience any redness or itchiness from the product.  I have used both the Rogaine brand and a store brand (the red bulls eye logo) and don&#x27;t think I got any better results from the brand name so will most likely save a few $$ on my next purchase..</li>
    <li> Seems to work, I&#x27;d hate to stop using it to find out then have my hair fall out.</li>
    <li> Roughly $40/box of 3 which only lasted about 1.5 months instead of 3 months, just wasn&#x27;t worth it as I didn&#x27;t see any change. If I had seen change, the cost would have been worth it. I am in my early thirties and wanted to stop the balding look on the back of my head and because of this brand name, I thought it was worth a try. I actually used a little more then I should, but I also had a bigger area then most of the rogaine model&#x27;s pictures of their bald spots. I also didn&#x27;t like if the foam got on any of my hair, it would leave a greasy spot on my pillow or couch. Since the directions say to use it twice a day, it just got irritating since I didnt see any results. I am now going to try Natrol Boitin which has good reviews, only $8/bottle with 100 tablets in it, and with only have to take one tablet a day orally. Trial and error. Some products may work better for different people.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really give it 5 stars because I&#x27;m not using it as directed so I&#x27;m not seeing the results claimed.</li>
    <li> I guess it works for some but for others it doesnt.  Luckily for me I was one of the ones it didnt work on so I wasted money on the recommended 6 months of use.  So what I did was buy a Philips Norelco 1250X/42 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor with Jet Clean on amazon at a great price to shave my head.  Much better investment in my opinion</li>
    <li> It is working well so far, no complaints or regrets. A lot better than those generic brands or Cosco brand.</li>
    <li> Rogaine is only good for the back of your head not the front which they don&#x27;t say and when you do grow hair again you have to constantly keep buying rogaine in order for the hair to stay</li>
    <li> If your going bald do it gracefully. This doesnt work! Some may get peach fuzz, I got nothing. Shave your head it&#x27;s the look now a days.</li>
    <li> seems to be helping thicken my hair, easy to use, I only use it once daily</li>
    <li> Men all I have to say it this works. not just the appearance of thinking of hair new hair growth.</li>
    <li> This product works great, and if you combine it daily with a few other supplements that block DHT formation (Saw Palmetto, Nu-Hair, flaxseed oil, Niozin shampoo) it can really make a difference. Don&#x27;t give up if you don&#x27;t see results right away or if you notice more stray hairs coming out- this actually means that it&#x27;s working. Stay faithful putting it on (morning and evening) and you will probably begin to see noticeable results around the 3-4 month mark. I highly recommend this over pills such as Propecia which have considerably negative side effects for some. It dries very quickly and nicely and the scent is not very bothersome at all. You may want to use slightly more than the recommended dosage- the instructions state that it only works on the vertex (mid-back of the scalp) but this is not true. It has REALLY grown hair for me around the temples, but it took longer to come in. The first place I noticed was that the back of my hair, which had thinned a bit, was now covered (after about 1-2 months). I&#x27;m at the 5 month mark now and am still seeing great results. Give it time, be patient, and wait for it to work. I think people might give up too easily because they think it&#x27;s not working, but it does take time. It also works great if you use any kind of concealers on the scalp (like toppik or courve, spencer forrest brands)- it works with those as well, just allow it to dry before putting anything else on your hair. Drying time is about 5-10 minutes max. Anyway, highly recommended for hair loss- be faithful in using it, be patient, and the results will come. Good luck to everyone on looking your best!</li>
    <li> Been using for 20 years.  Im the only guy in my family with a full jead of hair.  If used as directed TWICE a day, wash hair every day...this stuff is amazing.  I would be bald without it.  Wont work if you &amp;#34; try&amp;#34; it.  You have to USE it correctly  so grateful for this wonderful product !</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 5 weeks on my frontal hairline and it is almost regrown in. I will tell you that I am 49 and was receding a little in the front hairline and a little on the crown. I also use Nioxin #2 with the rogaine and the results are astounding. I assure that if you do not have male-pattern baldness, you will see results like me. Don&#x27;t pay attention to the disclaimer on the&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine label, just give it a try on the front hairline. I decided (WHAT DO I HAVE TO LOSE) and the results are dramatic after only about 5 weeks. I have to say again, don&#x27;t listen to the disclaimer give a shot.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I liked the quality and everything happened as expected. Everyone did a great job in this deal.</li>
    <li> Most of my hair in the front fell off. Do not buy this product if your scalp is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Itches like hell....left with skin tags on my scalp</li>
    <li> Takes a long time for it to work but eventually you will see a difference. Need to be patient though...</li>
    <li> What would I do without it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> After six weeks I can&#x27;t tell any difference but, maybe aspirationally, I think I see more hair (I only use half the recommended dose).</li>
    <li> Works great and it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the stores. Yes once you use it you must always use just like the instructions say. I gives me fuss not my complete hair growth back but that&#x27;s okay with me. It has different results for everyone never the same.</li>
    <li> It only works for back of the head baldness (where a kippah usually sits). Those with receding hairlines, stay away.</li>
    <li> Burned my scalp after regular use. Had to discontinue and throw away valuable product.</li>
    <li> This product did help my hair grow back, but not enough to really notice.  I used it as directed for 90 days.</li>
    <li> Months of daily usage and this product has caused more hair loss and no regrowth. I understood that there would be some initial loss, but my slight bald spot had become thinning all over. Disappointed that I continued the usage for so long because of the promise of regrowth. Now I need to scramble to save what is left of my hair. Amazon Prime is five star for service, even that was not enough to take this overall rating above two stars.</li>
    <li> It works slowly but it definitely works! (PS. I&#x27;m using it for my beard.)</li>
    <li> Some of the side effects, such as losing more hair, may be consistent with a problem not caused by the minoxidil but rather the fact that the metal can used is manufactured in a region of the world where they recycle slightly radioactive metals. In the U.S., people selling metal at facilities are met with a guy who scans the metal for radioactivity. The one I talked when they would not accept a run-down car because it gave off high readings said that there are a lot of consumer products that sometimes register an amount of radioactivity that is not safe enough for him to take. So makes me wonder if some people are unlucky enough to have bought Rogaine with cans that were unfortunately high. One can imagine what that would do to your hair.</li>
    <li> I reread the description once I received this product, and it never stated that it was only for thinning at the crown, and NOT for receding hairline.  Very misleading waste of time and money, as it isn&#x27;t even refundable.</li>
    <li> the price for this was great and so was the shipping. but the product leaves flakes in your hair after it dries and it wont come out unless you wash your hair again. we used the liquid one before and it did not leave any residue.</li>
    <li> Caused hair shedding with first 6 weeks of use but then helped regrow new hair and slightly thicker. After 3 months got scalp irritation I don&#x27;t know if it was related to product but most likely. Used T gel and Nizoral every 3 days to prevent scalp problems. Still effective product but will vary on user depending on what your genetically predisposed to with family hair loss.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. I thought this was going to be better than the liquid version but it turned out it wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s very hard to control how much you get and also it takes forever to dry and when it does my hair is left feeling SO sticky and nasty. I do not recommend this for women, specially.</li>
    <li> He thinks it works for him.</li>
    <li> I must be in the bottom of the percentage that doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m not bald but am thinning a bit up top in the back side of head.  Just ended up loosing some hair but stopped using product and it grew back a little.</li>
    <li> It was the original Rogaine and it does a little good if used everyday but it is nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> I bought rogaine because I was receding at the temples. I know that they say that rogaine is only useful on the crown but honestly does that make any sense to you? It&#x27;s all hair follicles, no matter where on your head it is. But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was using it twice a day for months without seeing any results. But I kept at it. Recently, which is about five months of use, I noticed a fair amount of hair regrowth. My dermatologist noted it as well. It&#x27;s light hair (I&#x27;m a blonde male) but it&#x27;s definitely hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is it a miracle drug? No it&#x27;s not. Why haven&#x27;t they figured out a cure yet? I have no friggin&#x27; idea. Clearly a pill that worked would be as successful as viagra. I mean, is there any population that is as vain as America? A pill that worked would bring in billions for pharmaceuticals. But I digress again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine is worth a shot. It&#x27;s really not that expensive and if you are here looking that means your hair loss bothers you enough to spend fifty bucks on a chance. Buy it and try it out for at least six months. Follow the program and you just might see some hair regrowth. Good luck my brother.</li>
    <li> Accurate picture and lot date. Arrived quick!</li>
    <li> After the 3 moth of the initial treatment I don t lose hair in the shower any more. I can not see any new hair, ii guess it is a slow process. I use it once a day and not 2 as it should be and the can last 5 weeks so i guess is not really a 3 moth treatment. I will still recomend it!</li>
    <li> My son likes it so far.  Only a couple of weeks into it though. Easy to use. No issues to report.</li>
    <li> I think I see a little bit of hair growth. At least I hope so. Have used it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference</li>
    <li> It does not work for me.</li>
    <li> Either get over the fact you are losing hair or find a better way to resolve the problem. The foam is a nice alternative but you&#x27;ll be using this stuff for the rest of your life...</li>
    <li> I used the Kirkland minoxidil and I have to say, rogaine is a much better product aside from the effects which I believe are the same. The foam can be used as mouse as well for those who look for style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not make you itchy which most other products do.&lt;br /&gt;- Dries fairly quick&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used as mouse&lt;br /&gt;- Gets to the base without getting stuck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you can allocate 10-12 more dollars buy this one instead. Kirkland worked for me. It stopped my receding hairline. Let&#x27;s see how this product fairs. Will update</li>
    <li> Was what I was looking for but paid a cost equal to their price for shipping from the US to Canada (not fair).</li>
    <li> So far, results are beyond expectations.</li>
    <li> It helps slow down hair loss</li>
    <li> Got these as requested for my uncle, apparently it&#x27;s working because he re-orders all the time, so it has to be doing something positive !! Great price !</li>
    <li> cause dandruff but good product</li>
    <li> I used this for about a year with little to no noticeable results. I&#x27;m in my early thirties and I have thinning hair due to heredity and stress. My thinning is primarily around the back/center of my head.    The application is relatively easy and it is relatively odorless, but you must be careful to only use the recommended amount per each application or it may make you feel vertigo. Also, the results vary. Roughly three months in I thought the product was working because my hair appeared more fully. After six months of daily application, though, my hair began falling out and felt thinner than before. I was a bit concerned, but I continued to use it for six more months after, as the product states that some hair may fall out during earlier application. After a year, my hair was no better than before I started using Rogaine; it was still thin and the thinning spot on the back/center of my head was more noticeable than it had been before use.    In the end, I think this product works for some, but not all. The product clearly states this, so it will always be a gamble. You may be one of the one in four this doesn&#x27;t work for, as I was.     TL;DR: If it isn&#x27;t working for you within three to six months, I suggest you just stop using it. It&#x27;s not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Took about 16 weeks for me to notice a difference.  You have to remember when you start using this stuff you will have accelerated hair loss.  Not sure why that is but it does happen.  In my experience I did lose a lot of hair in the first 4 to 6 weeks.  Then I gradually stopped losing hair and I guess it started to grow?  Not sure exactly how that worked but after 16 weeks I have definatly seen a change.  I had a growing bald spot on the crown of my head.  It is slowly going away now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted I did get worried (like most people) when I started with Rogaine and noted a much greater loss of hair.  This is normal - You just have to remember it and to continue its use 2 times per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would take the foam over the generic &#x27;oil&#x27; any day. I am very satisfied with the results thus far.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice a difference and don&#x27;t see the need to keep paying for it. description wasn&#x27;t clear about it only working for a specific type of baldness, probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought had I known that first.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for over a month. no help rather hair loss has increased considerably&lt;br /&gt;it was soooooo scary, I lose a lot of my hair, which make me soooooooooooooooooooooooooo concern&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will not recommend you guys using it&lt;br /&gt;noooooooo&lt;br /&gt;plz dont buy it</li>
    <li> I previously had used the liquid version for 3 months, but that took forever to dry, so I switched to foam. The foam version dries much quicker and now I&#x27;m just hoping I get my hair to grow back...lol</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 months, twice a day, while taking Biotin 10,000mcg and Biosil (hair, nails, skin). I read the reviews about hair shedding but this product removed so much of my hair. I stuck with it because nothing works overnight. When I saw no improvement and massive hair loss, I decided to discontinue its use. Don&#x27;t be confused or fooled by the &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation, thats the chemicals burning your open pores.  Instead I opt to try organic coconut oil and wheat germ oil. I apply this to my hair twice a day and use both items mixed as preconditioners before I shampoo my hair. I also take 2 table spoons of the coconut oil and wheat germ oil with water or a smoothie.  I use chemical free shampoos on my hair.I&#x27;m waiting to order some Vitamin E. Chemicals are not the answer. there are other ways to preserve and grow hair naturally. I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> I used it before, hair grew back (although took a couple months). Stopped using it, hair fell out.  Sooo, back on the Rogaine Train.  TOOT TOOT!</li>
    <li> very powerful product</li>
    <li> Want buy again.  Doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I ended up being allergic to it and broke out in a rash.  (3 stars because I am &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; on the product.)  If you have skin that is at all prone to allergies and rashes, there is a good chance you will get one from this.  Obviously that is a risk with any such product.  Just be aware before you buy a 3 month supply.  Anyone want 2.5 cans of Rogaine for free? :-)</li>
    <li> Makes a difference and will keep using as directions ! Takes some time but after over that time it makes a difference !</li>
    <li> This product has not helped me to regrow hair, but it seems to have stabilized my hair situation. My hair has remained the same after six months of use. I love the foam because it is so easy to apply, it&#x27;s not messy or smelly and it leaves no visible signs for anyone to see that you&#x27;ve applied something to your head.</li>
    <li> The foam is not runny at all, is a lil&#x27; pasty or gooey, not like shaving foam. Depending on temperature it will melt sooner or slower, my city is cold so I found it a little stubborn for saying something. The best way to apply it is to letting it melt in your hands, if you have bald spots you can even apply it directly if you want, if you have some long hairs in the area and try to apply it directly, the foam will &amp;#34;climb&amp;#34; your hair and will end with lots of product sticked on it. It dries super quick, and it is not grassy but the final sensation in the surface of scalp or even your hands is also &amp;#34;weird gooey&amp;#34; not smooth, I do not know how to describe it, but is a weird sensation. Anyways, the fact that you can control where exactly to put the product and doesn&#x27;t run, and the fact that is not so oily it is a big benefit. Let&#x27;s see how it works!</li>
    <li> Penelope D.&lt;br /&gt;I really Love the product, I&#x27;d buy again. Thanks..</li>
    <li> Great product. Much better than the dropper as it dries much quicker and is easier to conceal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 2 years and have had great result.  It&#x27;s simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Im 58 and seems out of the test ages but thining began and was geting faster so I had to try it. I had always had a full head of hair but then I went thur a great deal of stress as a result my hair thinned quick. I found a new barber when i moved and she found a bald spot the size of a dime then quickly told me it was alpesia. Ive been using Rogaine for about 45 days and even i think thats not long enuff for sych a product to work but the thining has slowed dramaticly. I am now stress free thank God! I do ride a motorcycle about 15,000 miles a year I use to ride bare headed, now a helmet or hat Hell i thought is was blowing off! I Hey with my past luck? No chances! I had a little scalp irratation at first then decided to slowly introduce it to my scalp. I skiped a day every couple now its fine I plan on continuing with it. However i seen it in a local  retail drug store for dollars less. I  thank Rogaine for the product and Amazon for the intrduction but will buy it local.For anyone concerned with hair loss must know a healthy diet and proper shampoo is very important.  Thank Ya, chuck</li>
    <li> Used kirkland 5% liquid for almost a year. It started to burn my scalp, so I made the switch to the foam, and I&#x27;m glad I did. The liquid always made a mess on anything my head ever came in contact with... headphones, hats, pillows, chairs... you name it. And it was ugly, too. You could practically see your own reflection in my head, it was so shiny. This stuff is great: Easy to apply, not too expensive to make you think twice, and after about 5 months of use I&#x27;m seeing a lot more regrowth than I ever saw with the liquid. good luck, gentlemen</li>
    <li> Romaine is super expensive! This is a great deal for this product! My husband was really surprised on the money we saved by getting the 3 pack!</li>
    <li> good price. item as described. thank you. it&#x27;s not really going to re-grow hair but it&#x27;s going to stop your hair from falling out :)</li>
    <li> Takes a while to work</li>
    <li> Works okay.  I just buy it online because it&#x27;s embarrassing in the store. Don&#x27;t want those weird looks from cashiers. I figure even if it helps me save just a few of the hairs I would have lost it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Will lead to your head turning whiter and flakey and will make hair loss worse and look worse and oily</li>
    <li> It gets very hot here in the summer and if your house is kept at above 78 F, you should refrigerate the Rogaine as it becomes liquidity.  Once I refrigerated, it has that foaminess when it comes out of the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the first 2-3 months I used it, it did seem like my hair was getting a little thicker, like I had more hair.  But, since summer, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working or not or if I lose more hair in the heat or not.  Will see what happens as I also see the dermatologist this month.</li>
