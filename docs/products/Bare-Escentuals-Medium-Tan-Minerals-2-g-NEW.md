<li> The size is very small when compared to others I have purchased for the same or lesser amounts.  </li>
<li> w/ my other loose powder.. loves it!</li>

<li> it was not a full size.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was so little.  </li>
<li> My wife loves the Bare Escentuals makeup line, but the little containers are so expensive.</li>
<li> , I didn&#x27;t realize the size was small.  </li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t seem to be the medium tan color I usually get.  </li>

    <li> The fact that it contains sunscreen was not shown in the picture with the product and it couldn;t be read on the container.  I would like to return it, but don&#x27;t know how to go about it.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery, product just as described, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> i have used bare minerals since it first came out many, many years ago....will not use another because when I tried I wasted my money</li>
    <li> although it&#x27;s 2 shades darker than my skincolor...i like this product bec it has really great coverage &amp; I can mix it w/ my other loose powder.. loves it!</li>
    <li> The only thing, I thought the container was bigger, when I received it I was little disappointed because it was like sample size.  Beside that I love the product.</li>
    <li> I live in Hawaii and it&#x27;s not always easy to find Bare Escentuals.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I&#x27;m so happy that I can get here.</li>
    <li> I bought this and wondered why it didn&#x27;t look the same, well I bought the wrong color I needed warm tan not medium tan, it covered but some days I looked like I was ashy lol.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years but always bought it at Sephora. I was happy to order it on Amazon but was very disappointed to see that the size is smaller than the one I usually buy.</li>
    <li> Love it, best ever!!!</li>
    <li> This is the same product that you can purchase at the retail store, only at a much cheaper price. My wife loves the Bare Escentuals makeup line, but the little containers are so expensive. Thanks for providing a great deal.</li>
    <li> The product is good, the size for the price is bad. You can get a larger size in Sephora for a little more dollar.</li>
    <li> I ordered Medium Tan and received Medium Beige.  Tried to return and was chasing my tail to get any help.</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation. Kind to my skin with great coverage.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over 10 years !</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the Big container...it&#x27;s like getting a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; size but having to pay the BIG price.  This make up only lasts maybe a month even when you apply a small amount.  If they would make it worth the Price they charge you it would be worth wearing.  I would also appreciate a more organic pure foundation for the big price they charge.  I can get Two different Organic foundations for half the price on Vitacost.  Gabriel is one of them :)</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time haha. It matches my skin tone really well :) I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup. Goes on very easily and makes your complexion look like your make up was done professionally. Feels very light on the face.</li>
    <li> The makeup came as promised.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with that.....the problem I have is my fault, I didn&#x27;t realize the size was small.  I thought I was getting a great price, but it was not such a good deal...........it was not a full size.  It&#x27;s the size that you get when you order from the informercial.  But as I stated, the size was listed in the ad and I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it because the price was too much for that small size.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Escentuals and order it all the time but this was a bad choice.  The size is very small when compared to others I have purchased for the same or lesser amounts.  I would not buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was so little.  Didn&#x27;t seem to be the medium tan color I usually get.  Will buy from the store from now on.</li>
