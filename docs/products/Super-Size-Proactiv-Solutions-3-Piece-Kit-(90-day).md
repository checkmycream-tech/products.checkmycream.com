      <li>Works great, but have been more impressed with the Acnefree Severe products.</li>

      <li>otherwise it was good</li>
      <li>Purchased this set for a family member who was very pleased with the product.</li>

      <li>and when i stoppe using it my face got way better!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
      <li>It is kind of like spinning the Wheel of Fortune or flipping a coin...only this time, instead of head and tails, the sides are &amp;#34;Clear Skin&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Not&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I had to stop using it but one product I really liked was their under eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I found that these products quit working as effectively after about six months.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s effective</li>
      <li>So far a wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>This is a great seller, selling the product for a much friendlier price!</li>
      <li>And the company who shipped it was very speedy and on time, and the product was in great shape when I received it.</li>
      <li>Since he love it why not purchase this product again that can used up to 90 Day.</li>
      <li>I like using more anti-aging products).</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the product..</li>
      <li>He used it before and love it.</li>
      <li>the box it came in was tore open and not packaged the greatest..</li>
      <li>must use it correctly for best results.let step 2 dry as it specifies in the directions.</li>
      <li>This product works great for controlling my teens breakouts and the larger value size can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
      <li>This is really a GREAT price for the giant sized proactiv.</li>
      <li>Proactiv is a very effective facial product to fight acne infections.</li>
      <li>The larger bottles are so much more convenient  : )  YEA!</li>
      <li>It is easy for him to use consistently.</li>
      <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to count how many times I have received compliments on how smooth and clear my skin looks.</li>
      <li>These larger bottles are a wonderful value and the products really last.</li>
      <li>This has helped my daughter tremendously.</li>
      <li>I like the super size of this product</li>
      <li>The toner works GREAT on dark spots or dark\uneven skin tones like mine.</li>
      <li>My skin depends on Proactive, and it&#x27;s great not to have to worry about buying a new supply each month from the local mall kiosk.</li>
      <li>Worth buying.</li>
      <li>It has worked great for me for 6 years, from my teenage years to my young adulthood.</li>
      <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
      <li>It is simple and easy to use and has easy to understand directions.</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  </li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>And although I have never had a problem with acne, Proactiv still keeps my skin clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>If used consistently this product works well.  </li>
      <li>Sure, it still struggles to fight those PMS breakouts, but overall, it works wonders!</li>
      <li>This set is a bargain if your&#x27;re an avid Proactiv user.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Proactiv will also give you some freebies (if you order from the site) for your first couple orders.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
      <li>She has been consistently using this product for a number of years now.</li>
      <li>and i saw results within the first week.</li>
      <li>The cleanser and the repairing lotion always goes first for me, I don&#x27;t use the toner as much.</li>
      <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick, the set was complete.</li>
      <li>This is very convenient to have this in an xtra large size.</li>
      <li>and it cleared up fast.</li>
      <li>This product is not the real proactive.</li>
      <li>I feel like this product really does what it says.</li>
      <li>She has found that if she uses the cleanser twice in one day, it&#x27;s very drying to her skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for this.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it really works.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for almost a year but at the beginning I was expecting too much too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much acne.</li>
      <li>but as I&#x27;ve gotten older</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>One of the bottles had it&#x27;s cap crushed, but the stuff inside was fine.</li>
      <li>Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  </li>
      <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
      <li>The new ones seem to disappear quicker too.  </li>
      <li>But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
      <li>I did have some minor drying around my eyes when I first used it, but, I kept at it and used a little more moisturizer</li>
      <li>finally, clear skin!</li>
      <li>The first one only came in.</li>
      <li>The first one only came in.</li>
      <li>I went from using it once a day every day the first couple years, to once every other day or so less or more depend on my skin, its like a maintenance thing now.</li>
      <li>I buy this stuff to clear up my acne.you</li>
      <li>having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will not be ordering from Clear Skin Solutions again.</li>
      <li>My face is always clear, and my skin looks refreshed and clear.</li>
      <li>This was unexpected.</li>
      <li>Cheaper than ordering it from Proactiv directly.</li>
      <li>Although I never had problem skin, after age 40 I developed Rosacea for which every dermatologist prescribed antibiotics.  </li>
      <li>I like to use it right after a shower since my skin is all steamed up and ready for scrubbing off dead cells.</li>
      <li>I never expected it was going to gI&#x27;ve such a fast effect.</li>
      <li>He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something</li>
      <li>you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  </li>
      <li>this proactive though looks to be older bottles since i have a recent shipment and noticed this difference</li>
      <li>He likes the Green Tea Extract cream specially.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.</li>
    <li> There are 9 payments of $30 dollars.  Go to any superstore and get a quality face scrub, a quality facial astringent,and a big tube of Benzoyl Peroxide and save some money.  The products work if you use them but not worth the hassel or price tag.</li>
    <li> I order this product from amazon some time ago for my son. He has been using it for three month with excellent results. This product must be used according to the included instruction and you have to be patient to get the desired results.</li>
    <li> I like the super size of this product now I do not have to buy it so often and I do not have to worry about not having enough on those days when I need to use a little more than usual for the breakout. The price is great also.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I would recomment ProActiv for anyone that has a problem with break outs. I dont have severe acne, but break out in pimples that do leave pretty bad marks...(yes, I cant help but to pick). But since I have been using ProActiv, my skin has cleared up beautifully, and I can even go with out make-up.</li>
    <li> Skip the TV ads and don&#x27;t buy in the malls! These larger bottles are a wonderful value and the products really last. When I bought this 30 day supply it was $57 and some change!</li>
    <li> Product is great, would like to be able to buy separately since some are consumed faster than others.</li>
    <li> This product is not the real proactive. They do not even sell this at the proactive stands or online.</li>
    <li> I really wish I could post the before and after pictures, cause its bad, this product was such a waste of money maybe the next 60 days will be better. It probably won&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> Peoactiv works in under a month.  It&#x27;s also the only product that works for me.  Sure, it still struggles to fight those PMS breakouts, but overall, it works wonders!</li>
    <li> We have tried everything for my daughters back &amp; chest acne.  (Prescription, pro-active look-alikes etc.)  but the actual Pro-active product is the only thing that actually works!!!  The one thing to keep in mind is that you need to use 2x/day and can&#x27;t get lazy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Overall, this product worked for me, but it will not work for everyone. It is kind of like spinning the Wheel of Fortune or flipping a coin...only this time, instead of head and tails, the sides are &amp;#34;Clear Skin&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Not&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is very convenient to have this in an xtra large size. Thanks so much for this. It really works!</li>
    <li> Was about to run out of this product when it got here; as expected. One of the bottles had it&#x27;s cap crushed, but the stuff inside was fine.</li>
    <li> My 16-yr-old son has been having acne for a couple of months.  Seems like it just flaired up into something awful after a few pimples on sides of face.  Now with help from Proactive, the sore swollen pimples under the skin are disappearing and healing.  The new ones seem to disappear quicker too.  It has  only been a couple of weeks but things are coming along.  Will keep you posted.  So far a wonderful product.  It is easy for him to use consistently.</li>
    <li> We have used this product before and find that it works well.  Amazon has the best pricing for it - even better than the proactiv website.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is really a GREAT price for the giant sized proactiv. I&#x27;ve seen it on QVC for about 5 dollars less (the giant sized) so you may want to check there as well.     Don&#x27;t bother with the smaller sizes unless you need to buy them for air-travel; these are too big and might be thrown out if you try to take them on a carry-on-- you don&#x27;t want that!     Just invest in these larger sizes and I think you&#x27;ll be very happy. The cleanser and the repairing lotion always goes first for me, I don&#x27;t use the toner as much. But It&#x27;s still cheaper for me to buy the kit then bother with the smaller individual sizes.    Proactiv works for me. It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it really works. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my dry/sensitive skin. The repairing lotion will usually clear a small breakout (like on my chin from holding the phone) in about two days.    If I get a breakout on my forehead (I get some breakouts before my cycle), I always use the cleanser and the repairing lotion at night on my T-zone. I feel like this product really does what it says. I don&#x27;t have really bad acne, but it&#x27;s still a bother to have breakouts when you&#x27;re older like me.     My teenage daughter uses it too and it works well for her.    Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using Proactiv for a little over 7 years now and I can&#x27;t say that I would use anything else at this time. I can&#x27;t even begin to count how many times I have received compliments on how smooth and clear my skin looks. And although I have never had a problem with acne, Proactiv still keeps my skin clear and smooth. I would definitely recommend Proactiv to anyone.</li>
    <li> Proactive made my skin really dry and red. I had to stop using it but one product I really liked was their under eye cream.  The rest was too harsh.</li>
    <li> This review is for my sister. She has been consistently using this product for a number of years now. She has no complaints. Her doctor was happy she was using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 14 years and every time I try something else my face breaks out. I have learned my lesson. Proactiv for life!!!</li>
    <li> This has helped my daughter tremendously. She has found that if she uses the cleanser twice in one day, it&#x27;s very drying to her skin. She uses it once a day and Cetaphil once a day. She loves the product, though.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to receive the supersized kit, as I didn&#x27;t even realize it existed! My skin depends on Proactive, and it&#x27;s great not to have to worry about buying a new supply each month from the local mall kiosk.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than ordering it from Proactiv directly. And you don&#x27;t have to have a contract! Works well to treat acne.</li>
    <li> My acne blew up like a mother!!!! i had such horrible acne after using this product i staed growing acne balls all over my face. I used it for about 1 month and when i stoppe using it my face got way better! i now have horrible dark acne scars with craters all over my face! i regret not listening to the rest of you saying not to purchase this !</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as describes and expected. However they were less than 3 months from the expiration date! How can you order a 3 month supply that wont last 3 months?!?</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while now and must say I absolutely love buying it through amazon! This is a great seller, selling the product for a much friendlier price!</li>
    <li> Great product  as we have used it before. No problems with getting it quickly.my wife has used it for years</li>
    <li> it says 90 day kit but it was a 60 day kit  (6 oz not 8 oz) otherwise it was good</li>
    <li> I only received one of the three bottles (3 oz.). The first one only came in. None of the others came. That was over 3 months ago...</li>
    <li> This product works great for controlling my teens breakouts and the larger value size can&#x27;t be beat.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on 2-12-2011 and i saw results within the first week. I&#x27;m an African American male and my facial hair causes my skin tone to be uneven. The toner works GREAT on dark spots or dark\uneven skin tones like mine. I will buy this again in another 3 months!</li>
    <li> My teenaged son has had a bad case of acne for more than a year now.  We&#x27;ve tried a variety of different medicines, one of which actually made his acne worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like nothing we tried worked, so after hearing several friends recommend Proactiv, we decided to take the plunge and buy a 2-month supply, even though it&#x27;s a little expensive.  After using it for several weeks now, we&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement in our son&#x27;s acne, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally got fed up with all of the over the counter stuff and decided to visit our pediatrician.  He told us that our son had 3-4 level acne on the Pillsbury scale which classifies the severity of acne from 1 to 4.  Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something teens are notorious for not being faithful with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  So now we&#x27;re moving from using Proactiv to using prescription antibiotics and some stronger prescription acne medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish us luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
    <li> proactive is the fav. product of mine for a long time which prevents pimples when it&#x27;s that special time of the month for women, putting down the inflamation of the face when your hormones are in haiatus. it just works for me.</li>
    <li> Proactiv is the only thing that works and having this jumbo size will keep me from having to reorder for a while.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the tubes and tops are a little bit large.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has worked great for me for 6 years, from my teenage years to my young adulthood. My face is always clear, and my skin looks refreshed and clear. Whenever I have a zit or pimple coming on, Proactiv immediately stops it from growing any further and gets rid of it. I love this product!! And the company who shipped it was very speedy and on time, and the product was in great shape when I received it.</li>
    <li> If used consistently this product works well.  It does bleach clothes and wash clothes however so need to be cautious on how it is handled.  Teens need to be coached on this and encouraged to be diligent with its application.</li>
    <li> Always use when I start to break out. However,  I don&#x27;t use it every day, because when you stop using it, you break out</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff to clear up my acne.you must use it correctly for best results.let step 2 dry as it specifies in the directions. Thats what I used to do wrong and it helps to let it dry a couple minutes.im a 31 year old male and have been using proactiv for 11 years.</li>
    <li> This was unexpected. The biggest proactiv bottles that I ever bought. Worth buying. When i was in my teen&#x27;s I been using this product alot, now that I&#x27;m 27 I don&#x27;t have much acne. I recommend this product to my boyfriend and decide to buy it for him. He used it before and love it. Since he love it why not purchase this product again that can used up to 90 Day. Thank you Proactiv and the seller!!</li>
    <li> This product may not be fore everyone but I like it, its the only thing that keeps my skin clear. I went from using it once a day every day the first couple years, to once every other day or so less or more depend on my skin, its like a maintenance thing now. Your skin does get use to this product so I quit using it so often after a while bit it still works.  I like to use it right after a shower since my skin is all steamed up and ready for scrubbing off dead cells.</li>
    <li> Proactiv is a very effective facial product to fight acne infections. It is simple and easy to use and has easy to understand directions.</li>
    <li> I received my proactive with all three bottle caps cracked in half and the toner leaking in the box.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Ordered  this for my grandson and he loves it!!!  The larger bottles are so much more convenient  : )  YEA!</li>
    <li> Purchased this set for a family member who was very pleased with the product. The price on Amazon was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I only received one of the three bottles. The first one only came in. None of the others came in.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the product.. the box it came in was tore open and not packaged the greatest.. but the product was as described and unopened... this proactive though looks to be older bottles since i have a recent shipment and noticed this difference but I am sure will still work just as great.</li>
    <li> This set is a bargain if your&#x27;re an avid Proactiv user. Shipping was quick, the set was complete. Product-wise I will always recommend Proactiv. It&#x27;s the go-to skincare line for both me and my husband when we start to have some problems with our skin. My husband uses Proactiv for his skincare routine. I use it when I need to (I use to use it for my routine but as I&#x27;ve gotten older I like using more anti-aging products). Either way we swear by Proactiv because it works. My husband has tried other lines but always comes back to Proactiv.</li>
    <li> I will definitely order a second round its worth your money.&lt;br /&gt;The product it&#x27;s effective I definitely see the differences around my trouble area which are my cheeks will recommended.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product is excellent. I never expected it was going to gI&#x27;ve such a fast effect.</li>
    <li> Proactiv works. I mean, I know for some people it won&#x27;t, and it doesn&#x27;t mean you will never have a breakout but, as someone who has always had horrible skin and has been on oodles of medications that make me break out (included B-12 which will make you breakout).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use, smells good (very faint smell) and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or weird. I did have some minor drying around my eyes when I first used it, but, I kept at it and used a little more moisturizer and it cleared up fast. This dryness might have also been due to this other stuff I was using. At this point, I use nothing on my skin but Proactiv and eye makeup/coverup. No foundation or anything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my skin. However, this will do nothing for cystic acne. It also does not work overnight. Give it a week or two at least. I have been using it for almost a year but at the beginning I was expecting too much too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv will also give you some freebies (if you order from the site) for your first couple orders. Not to bad.</li>
    <li> finally, clear skin! it took about 4 months but once i stuck with it for this long, it cleared everything up! Never going back</li>
    <li> Although I never had problem skin, after age 40 I developed Rosacea for which every dermatologist prescribed antibiotics.  After a lot of years they no longer had the desired effect but ruined my digestive system.  Proactiv solved that problem.</li>
    <li> While I was pleased that the product arrived on time and as described, I was extremely disappointed to discover that the Proactiv formula was nearing expiration. I ordered a 90-day supply that expires in just over a month from the delivery date. Proactiv formula typically has a shelf life of at least 18 months, so this is definitely an old product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very shady practice on the part of the seller. I will not be ordering from Clear Skin Solutions again.</li>
    <li> its an average product which didnt really work wonders(as it usually promises). so i think its an average product with extra publicity..</li>
    <li> Along with some antibiotics from the general practitioner, my son swears the Proactive is making a big difference.  He likes the Green Tea Extract cream specially.</li>
    <li> Works great, but have been more impressed with the Acnefree Severe products. I found that these products quit working as effectively after about six months.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected, however the bottles are not as chubby as the picture. Still got a 90 day supply though.</li>
