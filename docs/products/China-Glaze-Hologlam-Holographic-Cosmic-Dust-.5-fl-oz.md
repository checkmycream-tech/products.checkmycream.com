### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Beautiful!</li>
      <li>Again, the holos in China Glaze are really a beautiful effect.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>I have found this shade of Hologlam to be the perfect undercolor to stamp on while still showing a strong holo.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this polish!</li>
      <li>I have found these stamp really nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice to experiment with</li>
      <li>Removal of these Hologlams polishes are very easy.</li>
      <li>LOVE any holo polish honestly</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite silver shades i own, or have ever seen.</li>
      <li>but this were pretty great.</li>
      <li>I ordered it through amazon because the price was better.</li>
      <li>I love holographic polishes.</li>
      <li>I love it and would get it again</li>
      <li>I love China glaze</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t really recommend this product unless you can get it for a good deal.</li>
      <li>Love how I can play with the stamp colors and keep the same Hologlam shade for a variety of great manicures.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for holo, try a different brand, but this is a beautiful silver.  </li>
      <li>and it is truly stunning, a full rainbow of color.</li>
      <li>Get a nice crisp image using them.</li>
      <li>I used 2 coats, even though it looked fine with just one.</li>
      <li>And if you do your dishes - well, you might as well take all the polish off because it chips in huge chunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Two coats of China Glaze Hologlam Cosmic Dust covers completely with no visible nail line, produces a great holo, and mixes with many other colors - what more can you ask of a nail polish?!  </li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t like how it looks on all my nails, so right now i am using it as a feature nail for one of my designs, but I still really like it.</li>
      <li>The Polish is very smooth and you really do see a lot of color.</li>
      <li>looked so cool in the sunlight</li>
      <li>Not a bad polish but lacking the luster shown.  </li>
      <li>This color is a gun-metal gray, as described in a previous review, and it has a great holo effect in sunlight and indoor light.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first swipe of your first coat, the holographic effect is quite prominent.</li>
      <li>Silver nail polish is, by far, my favorite color.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly what I wanted: it came very quickly and is look very holographic.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and stays for a few days when paired with a top coat.</li>
      <li>also find that this chips far more easily than any other China Glaze product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
      <li>I have the whole</li>
      <li>But as you use try to add more color to the rest of the nail, the other color swipes off in streaks.</li>
      <li>I may try other China Glaze holographs because I&#x27;ve heard better for newer additions to the line.</li>
      <li>The second and third coats make it look more like a</li>
      <li>Obviously the color and holo effect were more defined with the second coat.</li>
      <li>Very pretty &amp; my 2nd</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for your collection.</li>
      <li>These are not as strong holo as previous china glaze holos (well, not the tronica collection)</li>
      <li>The formula is a bit thin, but adding a second coat or a good thick first coat easily solves that.</li>
      <li>I have most of them, but they are super expensive.</li>
      <li>I had to coat it with 3 layers of OPI clear to stop the chipping.</li>
      <li>In the sun it shimmers green and blue and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I mean its Ok for the price</li>
      <li>Not very holographic as far as holo polishes go, but still pretty.  </li>
      <li>The color lasted me about a week before it began to peel, which is a pretty long time for polish to last on my nails.</li>
      <li>But the second coat diminishes the effect so that you only see the effect if you&#x27;re really looking for it.</li>
      <li>It barely lasts a day or two before it starts.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the bottle I received is old or heat-damaged, but there are no holographic particles in it, even after shaking it up properly.</li>

<li> for some reason the Holograph polish comes of while you are putting the polish on and doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
<li> but not much of an holographic polish</li>
<li> it goes from a dark grey to bluish, to a teal...</li>
<li> The delivery was on time and the price was typical for China Glaze.</li>
<li> It went on smoothly, dried quickly, no streaks, chips, or smudges.</li>
<li> This was a kinda gun metal grey that I was disappointed in at first because online it looked like something else.</li>
<li> to almost a green haze.</li>
<li> I consider myself to be an amateur nail polish afficionado.</li>
<li> So when I say this product is weird, I mean it is weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Really a disappointing purchase.</li>

    <li> This product was exactly what I wanted: it came very quickly and is look very holographic. I honestly don&#x27;t like how it looks on all my nails, so right now i am using it as a feature nail for one of my designs, but I still really like it. I would recommend this polish to anyone who like feature nails or designs.</li>
    <li> for some reason the Holograph polish comes of while you are putting the polish on and doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
    <li> I consider myself to be an amateur nail polish afficionado. I am starting to amass quite a collection from a variety of brands in a variety of colors, textures, and opacities. So when I say this product is weird, I mean it is weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first swipe of your first coat, the holographic effect is quite prominent. But as you use try to add more color to the rest of the nail, the other color swipes off in streaks. So of course you add a second coat. But the second coat diminishes the effect so that you only see the effect if you&#x27;re really looking for it. The second and third coats make it look more like a deep gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that this chips far more easily than any other China Glaze product I&#x27;ve tried. It barely lasts a day or two before it starts. And if you do your dishes - well, you might as well take all the polish off because it chips in huge chunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t really recommend this product unless you can get it for a good deal. It&#x27;s a nice to experiment with but I definitely won&#x27;t buy this shade again. I may try other China Glaze holographs because I&#x27;ve heard better for newer additions to the line.</li>
    <li> I love holographic polishes. These are not as strong holo as previous china glaze holos (well, not the tronica collection) but this were pretty great. I have the whole collection.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE any holo polish honestly lol rainbows on the nails make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using these hologlam collection polishes to stamp over similarly colored cr&amp;egrave;me polishes. I have found these stamp really nicely. Get a nice crisp image using them. I even bought backups of a couple colors.</li>
    <li> Just get this! The Polish is very smooth and you really do see a lot of color. I highly recommend this for your collection.</li>
    <li> I have found this shade of Hologlam to be the perfect undercolor to stamp on while still showing a strong holo.  Love how I can play with the stamp colors and keep the same Hologlam shade for a variety of great manicures.  Two coats of China Glaze Hologlam Cosmic Dust covers completely with no visible nail line, produces a great holo, and mixes with many other colors - what more can you ask of a nail polish?!  I can recommend this polish to anyone who enjoys playing on their nails.</li>
    <li> This color is like platinum &amp; almost has a greenish look sometimes. Very pretty &amp; my 2nd favorite.&lt;br /&gt;(1st- Take a Trek) Removal of these Hologlams polishes are very easy.</li>
    <li> looked so cool in the sunlight</li>
    <li> The color is awesome, but the nail polish chips terribly. I had to coat it with 3 layers of OPI clear to stop the chipping. I applies 2-3 coats of the China Glaze and it still chipped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen China Glaze&#x27;s holographic &amp;#34;Cosmic Dust&amp;#34; polish up close and it is truly stunning, a full rainbow of color. I ordered it through amazon because the price was better. I don&#x27;t know if the bottle I received is old or heat-damaged, but there are no holographic particles in it, even after shaking it up properly. perhaps they&#x27;re stuck at the bottom of the bottle, I&#x27;ll poke it when I have the time and a tool. Still, my daughter and I tried the polish - it&#x27;s just a blueish gunmetal color, takes three coats to become opaque, and chipped the same day. Really a disappointing purchase.</li>
    <li> Not very holographic as far as holo polishes go, but still pretty.  If you&#x27;re looking for holo, try a different brand, but this is a beautiful silver.  The delivery was on time and the price was typical for China Glaze.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this polish! I&#x27;d compare it to China Glaze&#x27;s discontinued OMG collection. I have most of them, but they are super expensive. This color is a gun-metal gray, as described in a previous review, and it has a great holo effect in sunlight and indoor light. It went on smoothly, dried quickly, no streaks, chips, or smudges. I used 2 coats, even though it looked fine with just one. Obviously the color and holo effect were more defined with the second coat. I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim haven&#x27;t used it, don&#x27;t think I will.</li>
    <li> Again, the holos in China Glaze are really a beautiful effect. they make you do a double take.This was a kinda gun metal grey that I was disappointed in at first because online it looked like something else.I love it and would get it again it goes from a dark grey to bluish, to a teal...to almost a green haze. Beautiful!</li>
    <li> I love China glaze but this is not what I thought it was I mean its Ok for the price but not much of an holographic polish</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! you will need 2 coats to make it non transparent though.  Goes on smoothly and stays for a few days when paired with a top coat.</li>
    <li> Silver nail polish is, by far, my favorite color. I buy silver nail polish almost every time I see it. This is one of my favorite silver shades i own, or have ever seen. In the sun it shimmers green and blue and I absolutely love it. The formula is a bit thin, but adding a second coat or a good thick first coat easily solves that. The color lasted me about a week before it began to peel, which is a pretty long time for polish to last on my nails.</li>
    <li> Not a bad polish but lacking the luster shown.  Works with neutral clothes &amp; has enough sophistication for times out.</li>
