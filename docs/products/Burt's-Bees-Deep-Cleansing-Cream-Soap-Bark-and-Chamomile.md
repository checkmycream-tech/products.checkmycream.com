      <li>Love this face wash.</li>
      <li>If I had dry skin it would be perfect.  </li>
      <li>I think the wipes are better used on light or no make-up days.  </li>

      <li>Not too strong.</li>
      <li>Feels cool and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Great creamy facial cleaner.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the feeling on my face and after rinsing I felt extremely fresh and still felt the &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; of tingles.</li>
      <li>Very fresh.</li>
      <li>I also like the scent very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Best facial cleanser that has all natural ingredients which derives from nature.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used the cleaning wipes and didn&#x27;t feel my skin was as a clean.  </li>
      <li>and I suppose it could be, but the menthol is the 22nd ingredient in a 37 ingredient formula (full ingredient list</li>
      <li>It does have a scent, but not a bad one.</li>
      <li>As I applied it, I felt a super cool and tingly sensation.</li>
      <li>All 3 products are great, but not what I was expecting, considering the description says nothing about the other two products.</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty nice, although the slight feminine scent isn&#x27;t for me (but isn&#x27;t overwhelming and fades away for the most part after a bit).</li>
      <li>Works beautifully and you&#x27;ve never had such soft skin until you&#x27;ve used burst bees!</li>
      <li>Because the overall sensation is so cooling and refreshing!</li>
      <li>I threw it away, which is something I rarely do.</li>
      <li>I have very dry, reactive skin, and this is very kind and gentle, doesn&#x27;t strip at all.</li>
      <li>I love the concept of Burt&#x27;s Bees- using as many natural ingredients as possible.  </li>
      <li>It works super well, and leaves my skin feeling soft, clean and radiant.</li>
      <li>and I love the way my skin feels when I use it daily.  </li>
      <li>me there is firstly an earth tone to the scent from the quillaja saponaria and sunflower, followed by the softer chamolile, jasmine and coconut scents.</li>
      <li>Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
      <li>Love this facial cleanser!</li>
      <li>so I decided to invest in other BB&#x27;s products to see how I liked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling tingly and clean, not tight and dryed out.  </li>
      <li>gentle, no residue, leaves skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel cool and clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
      <li>but it certainly removed my sunscreen</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and has this tingly, cooling sensation that is so refreshing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like feeling greasy and this product doesn&#x27;t really leave me feeling that</li>
      <li>Lesson learned to read the description more carefully.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
      <li>It is very creamy</li>
      <li>is really my bottom line</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed BB&#x27;s chap stick but haven&#x27;t tried much of any other product.</li>
      <li>It has a bracing fragrance and feel on the skin that makes it really feel like it is getting your face as clean as possible.</li>
      <li>Skin definitely feels clean after using it.</li>
      <li>I love every other Burt&#x27;s Bees product that I&#x27;ve tried, but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me at all!</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling deeply cleaned, soft, and smooth.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>If it were cheaper i would lather my whole body with it, except the sensitive parts, as this has a LOT OF TEA TREE OIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have demodex mites, or just sensitive skin, acne, etc, this stuff has a ton of tea tree oil in it and is so soooothing.  </li>
      <li>I am 43 years old.</li>
      <li>This product leaves my skin soft and tingling.  </li>
      <li>Yet, it is gentle enough to use over your eyes to get off the eye make up.</li>
      <li>I actually feel moisturized, but not too much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I must say out of the gate there seems to be an equal balance of masculine and feminine scents; the soap bark smells masculine and the chamomile smells feminine.</li>
      <li>The smell  is very light and non - irritating.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s frustrating not being able to smell a product - this came with a tinfoil seal, so</li>
      <li>I got some pretty dry skin after using Proactiv+,  this completely got rid of my dry skin after only two uses without making my skin oily, like</li>
      <li>but instead I received one bottle of the cream, Burt&#x27;s Bee Sensitive facial moisturizer and a package of their facial towelettes.</li>
      <li>use it all the time, does not dry out your skin</li>
      <li>And it did not dry out my skin at all.</li>
      <li>As this is the first and only I&#x27;ve bought, I am not sure how this differs from this other Amazon listing which is marked as being an older version: http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Cleansing-Cream-Chamomile/dp/B000RC2V4Y/&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product was delivered late this morning by mail, decided to try it right away, I like the way it feels on my skin and left it hydrated, not tight and dry.</li>

    <li> use it all the time, does not dry out your skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two years now and I love the way my skin feels when I use it daily.  Great product!  Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s bees and this is no exception! My skin looks and feels great. My sisters tried it and loved it.</li>
    <li> Great creamy facial cleaner.  Leaves your skin feeling tingly and clean, not tight and dryed out.  Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years</li>
    <li> Love the creaminess with the tingle in this product. Smells wonderful, too. Cleanses without drying.</li>
    <li> It is a great moisturizer for,winter, but it smells like Pledge Spray Wax - it is way to Lemony smelling!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> this is pack of 3,but i get only have one,I think have something wrong</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin soft and tingling.  Five Stars!</li>
    <li> I bought this product from the link below, the description says pack of 3 so I assumed I was getting three bottles of the cleanser cream, but instead I received one bottle of the cream, Burt&#x27;s Bee Sensitive facial moisturizer and a package of their facial towelettes. All 3 products are great, but not what I was expecting, considering the description says nothing about the other two products. Beware buyers.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Chamomile-Cleansing-Cream/dp/B001GIOV3W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie&#x3D;UTF8</li>
    <li> Great cleanser! Removes makeup without stripping your skin of moisture</li>
    <li> I love every other Burt&#x27;s Bees product that I&#x27;ve tried, but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me at all! It stings the eyes, even if you&#x27;re careful to try to keep it away from your eyes. Next, I tried using it as a body wash, just to avoid wasting it. It has some nice exfoliating grains in it. However, it doesn&#x27;t rinse off well at all. Some people might like that on their faces, but it felt bad to me, both on my face, and everywhere else when used in the bath. I threw it away, which is something I rarely do.</li>
    <li> Favorite face cleaner.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered late this morning by mail, decided to try it right away, I like the way it feels on my skin and left it hydrated, not tight and dry. I also like the scent very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> As this is the first and only I&#x27;ve bought, I am not sure how this differs from this other Amazon listing which is marked as being an older version: http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Cleansing-Cream-Chamomile/dp/B000RC2V4Y/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from a CVS to add to my other Burt&#x27;s Bees (BB&#x27;s) purchases in order to spend enough to get $5 back. I have enjoyed BB&#x27;s chap stick but haven&#x27;t tried much of any other product. There are very few companies left that don&#x27;t test on animals so I decided to invest in other BB&#x27;s products to see how I liked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s frustrating not being able to smell a product - this came with a tinfoil seal, so I took it home and hoped for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say out of the gate there seems to be an equal balance of masculine and feminine scents; the soap bark smells masculine and the chamomile smells feminine. As a man I&#x27;m not too keen on using feminine smelling products but this one gets a pass. Why? Because the overall sensation is so cooling and refreshing! I first tried this after a hot and muggy day outside. I had some sunscreen on my face and was sweating a bit. I rinsed my face with plain cold water first, then applied about a quarter sized amount (the instructions don&#x27;t tell you how much to use). As I applied it, I felt a super cool and tingly sensation. Many say that&#x27;s the menthol and I suppose it could be, but the menthol is the 22nd ingredient in a 37 ingredient formula (full ingredient list below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me there is firstly an earth tone to the scent from the quillaja saponaria and sunflower, followed by the softer chamolile, jasmine and coconut scents. After that I began to notice a subtle citrus scent from the lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thicker than I would like, but it does the trick. If that&#x27;s the constancy that makes it work, so be it. I don&#x27;t wear make up, thus I can&#x27;t speak to how well it removes that but it certainly removed my sunscreen and I don&#x27;t feel overly dry. I actually feel moisturized, but not too much. I don&#x27;t like feeling greasy and this product doesn&#x27;t really leave me feeling that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I absolutely love the feeling on my face and after rinsing I felt extremely fresh and still felt the &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; of tingles. The smell is pretty nice, although the slight feminine scent isn&#x27;t for me (but isn&#x27;t overwhelming and fades away for the most part after a bit). I can&#x27;t take away a star from my review because of the feminine smell since it&#x27;s effectiveness is really my bottom line here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full ingredient list: Water, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, stearic acid, glycerin, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, cetearyl alcohol, polysorbate 60, sodium borate, cetyl alcohol, silica, glucose, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) leaf extractaloe barbadensis leaf extract, anthemis nobilis (chamomile) flower extract, echinacea angustifolia (coneflower) extract, quillaja saponaria (soap) bark extract, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract tocopherol, citrus medica limonum (lemon) peel oil, coriandrum sativum (cilantro) oil, artemisia dracunculus (tarragon) oil, lavandula hybrida (lavandin) oil, jasminum grandiflorum (jasmine) flower oil, xanthan gum, sucrose stearate, menthol glucose oxidase, lactoperoxidase limonene, citral.</li>
    <li> Very good cleansing cream, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great value!</li>
    <li> SOOOTHING minty stuff:  If you have demodex mites, or just sensitive skin, acne, etc, this stuff has a ton of tea tree oil in it and is so soooothing.  It is very creamy so I have to wash my face after I use this if I want to put sunscreen on.  If I had dry skin it would be perfect.  \&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on parts of my body with Exzema also, and it helps me to avoid the cortisone cream.  If it were cheaper i would lather my whole body with it, except the sensitive parts, as this has a LOT OF TEA TREE OIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and really liked the results. Excellent creamy cleanser which leaves my feeling moist with a touch of menthol.  I purchased this trio thinking I was purchasing 3 tubes of the Soap Bark and Chamomile Deep cleanser but realized it was 1 tube with a packet of facial cleaning wipes and moisturizer after I opened the box.  Lesson learned to read the description more carefully.  I&#x27;ve also used the cleaning wipes and didn&#x27;t feel my skin was as a clean.  I think the wipes are better used on light or no make-up days.  I haven&#x27;t yet tried the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. The scent reminds me of an orange dreamsicle.</li>
    <li> This is the best foaming face wash I have come across. It has a bracing fragrance and feel on the skin that makes it really feel like it is getting your face as clean as possible. Yet, it is gentle enough to use over your eyes to get off the eye make up. It is applicable to everyone from my mid-40&#x27;s skin to my teens skin. This is all we buy for cleanser.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this cleanser left my face feeling and appearing too oily.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel cool and clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Creamy, non-greasy cleanser. Perfect for use morning and night. The smell  is very light and non - irritating. I am allergic to almost all products with  fragrance, but this one doesn&#x27;t  bother me at all. This is my go - to cleanser as it does not over-dry or leave oily residue. A little goes a long way, so the tube lasts a while, too. I love the 3 pack that Amazon sells--great deal!</li>
    <li> Great for acne prone skin.  Feels cool and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Love this face cleaner! It smells like gum.</li>
    <li> perfect face wash for my sensitive skin - provides thorough cleansing without over-drying</li>
    <li> I love the concept of Burt&#x27;s Bees- using as many natural ingredients as possible.  I tried this by chance- it was part of a trial sized gift set I bought on clearance. I was hooked immediately! Very mild scent, and my 40-something skin glows after I use it (too bad the glow doesn&#x27;t last, but that&#x27;s not the cleanser&#x27;s fault :) I have very dry, reactive skin, and this is very kind and gentle, doesn&#x27;t strip at all. The menthol is nice and tingly, and the lather is creamy and indulgent. Very happy with this cleanser!</li>
    <li> Skin definitely feels clean after using it. And it did not dry out my skin at all. I got some pretty dry skin after using Proactiv+,  this completely got rid of my dry skin after only two uses without making my skin oily, like almost all moisturizers and creams seem to do. It does have a scent, but not a bad one. Very fresh. Not too strong. Also has a cooling sensation on your skin, which didn&#x27;t bother me. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Mild and feels cold when you apply on your face. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. Works beautifully and you&#x27;ve never had such soft skin until you&#x27;ve used burst bees!</li>
    <li> Great product, works very well. I am 43 years old. I was a little worried about using this product, thinking it would dry out my skin. It did just the opposite. It works super well, and leaves my skin feeling soft, clean and radiant. Highly recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
    <li> A bit tingly, I like the orange and radiance line better...</li>
    <li> Love this cleansing cream! Leaves skin feeling deeply cleaned, soft, and smooth. I love using it in the morning and at night. Does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> the best facial wash cream on the market!  gentle, no residue, leaves skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I love this product, leaves my skin very smooth and refreshing. It&#x27;s my favorite cleanser soap, I like it to be in cream.</li>
    <li> I am in love with it!</li>
    <li> Shipment took only 6 days. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Love this facial cleanser! It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and has this tingly, cooling sensation that is so refreshing. It wakes me right up in the morning, and cools me down after these muggy, St. Louis summer days.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Love buying Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  Best facial cleanser that has all natural ingredients which derives from nature.  Doesn&#x27;t dry up your skin &amp; it has a cooling effect. It&#x27;s more expensive sold at the stores.  Love buying it at Amazon cuz you can&#x27;t beat their price deal.</li>
