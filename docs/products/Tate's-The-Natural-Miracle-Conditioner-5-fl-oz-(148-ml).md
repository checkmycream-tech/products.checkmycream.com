      <li>best body creme i ever used, soaks right in skin, never greasy of staining, can use all over your body, even your hair, so glad i came across this product.</li>
      <li>Tate&#x27;s is one of the greatest natural products out in the market.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin very smooth.</li>
      <li>So pleased</li>
      <li>The storekeeper wasn&#x27;t sure if Tate&#x27;s would help specifically with rosacea but suggested I give Tate&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sharing the product with many many people.  </li>
      <li>I buy it for gifts for my favorite people.</li>
      <li>As a conditioner or leave-in, it&#x27;s probably better for thicker hair.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most make up removers.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Tates has so many uses.  </li>
      <li>I have gifted this product to so many members of my family and they all love it.</li>

      <li>hair does feel clean and healthy the day after washing,</li>
      <li>product itself, cost aside, is pretty nice.</li>
      <li>It does go on \\&quot;wet\\&quot; but dries smooth with out that greese or waxy feeling.</li>
      <li>and you want something light and multi-purpose.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for people with dry frizzy hair, but it is probably perfect for those with fine hair or oily skin types, those who only need very light conditioning.</li>
      <li>Natural, Safe - This product rocks!</li>
      <li>Good essential oils.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my fine wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Love all the natural non-toxic ingredients.</li>
      <li>I almost only gave this 4 stars because I wanted a nice smell</li>
      <li>It works in many different ways for many different things but we love it for hair and skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks Tate&#x27;s for all of your special products.  </li>
      <li>Luckily it has many uses and I&#x27;m using up the tiny bottle as a shaving cream.</li>
      <li>This conditioner does not weigh down my hair and in fact makes a good conditioning shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I also like the faint delicious smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was worried because the first time I applied about a dime size and when I put it in</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for someone that wants a pure moisturizer.</li>
      <li>(I have fine hair but LOTS of it--might be better for someone with thick hair), and I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  </li>
      <li>It is very lightweight and has almost no scent at all.</li>
      <li>a moisturuzer, it is very non-greasy and will leave your skin silky.</li>
      <li>I used to use garnier sleek and shine to detangle my very tangley hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really picky about conditioner.</li>
      <li>What this means is, if you don&#x27;t shampoo/condition daily, this is a good option for not having weighed down, grimy</li>
      <li>Nope, my hair was left soft, smooth and plenty of movement.</li>
      <li>Based on all the complaints filed against this company with the BBB, I highly doubt that what is in the bottle is what the label says.</li>
      <li>Very soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: My cons were, I needed a huge handful of this stuff, just to detangle my slightly curly ends.</li>
      <li>I have not dealt with the company directly, so I cannot comment on that topic.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Two or three years ago, I bought Tate&#x27;s the Natural Miracle Conditioner at a store that sells natural products.  </li>
      <li>Tate&#x27;s works very well but does take a bigger handful</li>
      <li>It contains natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I sought out the store looking for a natural product that would help with the pain, stinging, and redness that is rosacea.  </li>
      <li>: I have only used this a few times and so far it seems to make a much better shampoo (except for the curl straitening) and body wash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>My hands feel normal, not dry or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my hands there is not odd lotion feel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does also make a fabulous shave cream; you need very little to help the razor glide</li>
      <li>Like one other reviewer mentioned, the first day your hair seems a bit flyaway and drab, but then the next day when your natural oils kick in, it is soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>It took lots of combing and tons of hair came out from having to tug more than I usually do with other conditioners and hair masks.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this to try as a lightwieght conditioner for my hair (curly, a little dry and frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now back at baseline, following my normal cleansing and moisturizing routine that allows me to keep the rosacea under control as naturally as possible.  </li>

<li> what I do smell bland clean smell that is not strong at all and is not barely there when I use the product.</li>
<li> I plan to try it on my face as a moisturizer soon but waiting for a few things to clear</li>
<li> : Read the long list.</li>
<li> And with the very small bottle I bought at this price, how much would I need for my hair and body every month?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you have extremely dry skin</li>
<li> I knew I could not live the rest of my life this way and sought out holistic alternatives.&lt;br</li>
<li> What slightly concerns me, is how do you mix all of those natural plant ingredients with distilled water and get a perfectly white liquid with hardly any scent.</li>
<li> The topical creams were of little help.  </li>
<li> /&gt;For my hair apply this while my hair is wet.</li>
<li> This is something I am really curious about.&lt;br</li>
<li> I thought the bottles were too small, they didn&#x27;t last very long...</li>
<li> The day after using this product with nothing else, my hair does not feel overly conditioned and is not very shiny from silicones/ oil and alcohols found in other products.</li>
<li> I have very dry, curly hair that I&#x27;ve been straightening for a few years.  </li>
<li> I expected this to smell of fruit and a little earthy.</li>
<li> can&#x27;t wait to try this stuff out in other ways!</li>
<li> I have used it also by mixing with a little bit of water and putting it in a spritzer bottle as a detangler for my hair.  </li>
<li> I also use it as a leave in conditioner with a little oil and a heat protector.  </li>
<li> Within a few days, the rosacea flare-up had subsided.  </li>
<li> I was diagnosed with rosacea a few years ago.  </li>
<li> I have thick curly hair and it worked as any other grocery store conditioner</li>
<li> but I understand why the smell is plain as this allows anyone to use it.</li>
<li> /&gt;The day OF washing however, my hair looks a little dull and fluffy.</li>
<li> Bought this small size to keep in my travel bag.</li>
<li> The dermataologist recommended several courses of treatment, including oral antibiotics (which made me extremely ill).  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative details here about the company.  </li>
<li> My daughter had exema and we both have thin hair.</li>
<li> have course hair with thin roots and tend to get seasonal scalp infections.</li>
<li> So yeah, it is expensive.</li>
<li> It does not leave it looking dirty but does help to take out the tangles and relieve the frizz.  </li>
<li> This product stinks - literally.</li>
<li> At the time, my rosacea spot was painful, itchy, and weeping.  </li>
<li> Horrible chemical smell that I couldn&#x27;t wash off my hands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves skin very smooth. Love all the natural non-toxic ingredients. As a conditioner or leave-in, it&#x27;s probably better for thicker hair. Didn&#x27;t do much for my fine wavy hair. I would recommend it for someone that wants a pure moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Rave, Rave, Rave!!! I expected this to smell of fruit and a little earthy. Nope has almost no smell and what I do smell bland clean smell that is not strong at all and is not barely there when I use the product. I&#x27;ve not tried this for all the things they say it can be used for. I&#x27;ve only tried it for my hair as a leave-in conditioner and hand cream. I plan to try it on my face as a moisturizer soon but waiting for a few things to clear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair apply this while my hair is wet. I was worried because the first time I applied about a dime size and when I put it in it felt like my hair was going to end up greasy. Nope, my hair was left soft, smooth and plenty of movement. It even added shine!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hands there is not odd lotion feel. My hands feel normal, not dry or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try this stuff out in other ways! I almost only gave this 4 stars because I wanted a nice smell but I understand why the smell is plain as this allows anyone to use it.</li>
    <li> Tate&#x27;s is one of the greatest natural products out in the market. The ingredients list says it all. It is water based so it is not sticky, really great for frizzy or naturally curly hair. it does not result in hairloss unlike greasy chemical based hairgels, leave-in conditioners and sprays. I have gifted this product to so many members of my family and they all love it.</li>
    <li> This skin conditioner just doesn&#x27;t sit on your hand or body it is absorbed into your skin and does a lot of good.  Smells wonderful too. Good essential oils.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to try as a lightwieght conditioner for my hair (curly, a little dry and frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 oz size is smaller than a tube of toothpaste and considered to be a trial size. So yeah, it is expensive. (Mine was purchased through veganessentials which has a different price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself, cost aside, is pretty nice. It is very lightweight and has almost no scent at all. It is enough conditioning (a slippery but not viscous texture) to help you get a comb through your hair in the shower, but doesn&#x27;t appear to provide much lasting conditioning. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for people with dry frizzy hair, but it is probably perfect for those with fine hair or oily skin types, those who only need very light conditioning. Like one other reviewer mentioned, the first day your hair seems a bit flyaway and drab, but then the next day when your natural oils kick in, it is soft and shiny. What this means is, if you don&#x27;t shampoo/condition daily, this is a good option for not having weighed down, grimy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does also make a fabulous shave cream; you need very little to help the razor glide perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;As a moisturuzer, it is very non-greasy and will leave your skin silky. If you have extremely dry skin it is probably not enough.&lt;br /&gt;This would make a nice massage cream because it is slippery but won&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy like some creams do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle makes some rather outlandish (implied) claims, such as using it for arthritis, rosacea, and migraines. That BS aside, it is a great product if it is in your budget and you want something light and multi-purpose.</li>
    <li> PROS: This conditioner does not weigh down my hair and in fact makes a good conditioning shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have course hair with thin roots and tend to get seasonal scalp infections. The day after using this product with nothing else, my hair does not feel overly conditioned and is not very shiny from silicones/ oil and alcohols found in other products. I also like the faint delicious smell.&lt;br /&gt;My hair does feel clean and healthy the day after washing, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;The day OF washing however, my hair looks a little dull and fluffy. I think that is because I am used to chemicals adding shine?&lt;br /&gt;I would need a weekly hot-oil treatment to go with this product I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a great  body wash/ shower cream! Very soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS ?: Read the long list. What slightly concerns me, is how do you mix all of those natural plant ingredients with distilled water and get a perfectly white liquid with hardly any scent. What are the percentages and how is this conditioner actually made? This is something I am really curious about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: My cons were, I needed a huge handful of this stuff, just to detangle my slightly curly ends. It took lots of combing and tons of hair came out from having to tug more than I usually do with other conditioners and hair masks. This is my biggest concern. And with the very small bottle I bought at this price, how much would I need for my hair and body every month?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner also flattens my curls completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: I have only used this a few times and so far it seems to make a much better shampoo (except for the curl straitening) and body wash.&lt;br /&gt;I will use the entire bottle and see if I notice any thing new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really picky about conditioner. I used to use garnier sleek and shine to detangle my very tangley hair. It took me a while to find something organic that would work as well. Tate&#x27;s works very well but does take a bigger handful then I would use of garnier to get the same results so its quite a bit more expensive. When I can&#x27;t afford Tate&#x27;s I get [[ASIN:B001EWET96 Yes To Carrots Pampering Hair  Conditioner, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years - that says what I think of the product! Bought this small size to keep in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I thought the bottles were too small, they didn&#x27;t last very long...I only could use 1 bottle for 1 0r 2 times.</li>
    <li> I had a milia cyst on my forhead.  The doctor was going to remove it.  In the meantime, I received this conditioner product.  Within three days, the cyst was gone!! I&#x27;m sharing the product with many many people.  Thanks Tate&#x27;s for all of your special products.  I am a customer for life!  Natural, Safe - This product rocks!</li>
    <li> I am a nurse and I would not be without this product...not only are my hands softer..so is my face.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with rosacea a few years ago.  I was told there is no cure.  The dermataologist recommended several courses of treatment, including oral antibiotics (which made me extremely ill).  The topical creams were of little help.  I knew I could not live the rest of my life this way and sought out holistic alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two or three years ago, I bought Tate&#x27;s the Natural Miracle Conditioner at a store that sells natural products.  I sought out the store looking for a natural product that would help with the pain, stinging, and redness that is rosacea.  At the time, my rosacea spot was painful, itchy, and weeping.  The skin color was purple, with white pimples and pustules.  The storekeeper wasn&#x27;t sure if Tate&#x27;s would help specifically with rosacea but suggested I give Tate&#x27;s a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMMEDIATELY upon applying Tate&#x27;s, the pain instantly vanished and the swelling started to decrease.  My skin was calmed in SECONDS.  Within a few days, the rosacea flare-up had subsided.  I was applying Tate&#x27;s several times a day at any time I noticed that the area felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now back at baseline, following my normal cleansing and moisturizing routine that allows me to keep the rosacea under control as naturally as possible.  I keep a bottle of Tate&#x27;s on my person at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative details here about the company.  I have not dealt with the company directly, so I cannot comment on that topic.  The product works well for me.  Also, friends who have used Tate&#x27;s as a hand lotion have commented how amazingly well it works for them.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and it worked as any other grocery store conditioner</li>
    <li> My daughter had exema and we both have thin hair. I switched soaps, began using organics and tried lots of tips and tricks and this is what worked for her skin. I began using this all over her body and in her hair as a leave in conditioner. It worked so well, I began using it. I love it for me as well. It works in many different ways for many different things but we love it for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough about this Conditioner/Lotion.  It contains natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Tates has so many uses.  It can be a hand lotion, body lotion, make up remover, or even a hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greesy.  It does go on \\&quot;wet\\&quot; but dries smooth with out that greese or waxy feeling. I have used it also by mixing with a little bit of water and putting it in a spritzer bottle as a detangler for my hair.  It does not leave it looking dirty but does help to take out the tangles and relieve the frizz.  I am allergic to most make up removers.  But this does the trick with out any effort.  I have recommended this to a friend, and she thinks it works great also.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, curly hair that I&#x27;ve been straightening for a few years.  This conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I also use it as a leave in conditioner with a little oil and a heat protector.  My hair is really wonderful with this product.  So pleased</li>
    <li> i watched my mother scratch her head throughout my childhood only to find myself doing the same thing.this conditioner resolves the aging process itching!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but it didn&#x27;t condition my hair the way I like (I have fine hair but LOTS of it--might be better for someone with thick hair), and I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  Luckily it has many uses and I&#x27;m using up the tiny bottle as a shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This product stinks - literally. Horrible chemical smell that I couldn&#x27;t wash off my hands. Based on all the complaints filed against this company with the BBB, I highly doubt that what is in the bottle is what the label says. Stay away!</li>
    <li> best body creme i ever used, soaks right in skin, never greasy of staining, can use all over your body, even your hair, so glad i came across this product.I buy it for gifts for my favorite people.</li>
