      <li>I looked for a product to strengthen and rebuild my hair so it won&#x27;t break so easily</li>
      <li>The smell is strong and fruity.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that is colored and highlighted.  </li>
      <li>I have really fine hair</li>
      <li>The shampoo is gentle and has an amazing fragrance.</li>
      <li>both my granddaughter and I use this and even though our hair textures are very different, it works great for both of us.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean, but not stripped of moisture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for dry and brittle hair.</li>
      <li>so I actually get compliments on how good my hair smells.</li>
      <li>It only takes a couple of squirts to get a good lather.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of sweet tarts.</li>
      <li>Deixa o cabelo super macio e com um brilho lindo.</li>
      <li>Luckily the scent doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair to bother me.</li>
      <li>Once i realized this i switched back to Nexxus &amp;#34;therappe&amp;#34; shampoo and my hair feels so much better and looks better too.  </li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>I was very put-off with the smell initially from the bottle (it kind of smells like sweet tarts?)</li>
      <li>I have pretty oily hair</li>
      <li>So this shampoo did the opposite of making my hair better.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves my hair soft, smooth, and hydrated.</li>
      <li>which is pretty unheard of for me.</li>
      <li>the first use, therefore the sulfates don&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a little strong but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
      <li>My hair feels healthy and clean without being weighed down.  </li>
      <li>I just spray it with dry shampoo which mostly deals with the problem, but I also work out on my shower days</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner it does contain sulfates however it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair</li>
      <li>and I must say, for the price it is very high quality.</li>
      <li>My hubby even loves this shampoo as he agrees that it really cleans your hair and helps from hair splitting.  </li>
      <li>Now my hair is much softer, shinier and healthier looking.</li>
      <li>This shampoo has made my hair so soft that it&#x27;s fun to touch.</li>
      <li>I plan to keep buying this product since you get so much quality for your money.</li>
      <li>My hair has become softer to the touch and much easier to manage.</li>
      <li>i dont want to write unnecessary stuff like its great for the hair</li>
      <li>so you dont need too much for your lengthy hair.  </li>

    <li> This stuff could not smell any better. It reminds me of sweet tarts. I dig it.</li>
    <li> &amp;Oacute;timo shampoo. O cheiro &amp;eacute; muito bom, para quem não gosta de cheiros fortes esse não recomendo. Deixa o cabelo super macio e com um brilho lindo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and the conditioner that goes with it!!! Just used it once this morning and am hooked. It made my dyed (blonde) hair so soft and smooth. I have very thick, corse, wavy/curly hair and this stuff tamed the beast! A definate must have it your hair is similar, either dyed and/or thick and corse. It&#x27;s awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I have never felt a more cleansing shampoo on my hair. I&#x27;m thrilled to be using this everyday. The fragrance is a little strong but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff on vacation at a really nice hotel and loved the way it made my hair feel but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in OKC when we got home.  Local salon could get it but much more expensive than I found online.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever bought.  The scent is awesome.  My hubby even loves this shampoo as he agrees that it really cleans your hair and helps from hair splitting.  He also loves the scent as it makes your hair smell so good and clean.</li>
    <li> Got this and was very excited to try it.  Been using it for the last month or so and at first thought I saw a little improvement but after a few washes my hair became very dry.  Once i realized this i switched back to Nexxus &amp;#34;therappe&amp;#34; shampoo and my hair feels so much better and looks better too.  So this shampoo did the opposite of making my hair better.  Will not get this again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this brand and damage level three twice already and I really love it. It is gentle on the scalp and leaves my hair very soft. I don&#x27;t get frizzys or fly aways with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! My hair was dry and brittle. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for 2 months. Now my hair is much softer, shinier and healthier looking. I know it will continue to get better. I color my hair and have not noticed any fading due to shampooing. The smell is strong and fruity. I don&#x27;t care for the scent. Luckily the scent doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair to bother me.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST&lt;br /&gt;You will love it every time you use it...&lt;br /&gt;Try it and you will be pleased</li>
    <li> Smells nice but leaves my hair frizzy.  Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Gave me itchiness. Wouldn buy it again. I have oily scalp n this definitely not for my kinda hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo and even though it is a little bit expensive I care about my hair. I found great offers in amazon.com with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the shampoo my stylist uses for my hair.  The product is great.  I don&#x27;t use conditioner, just comb it out. My hair is colored and highlighted and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t fade the color (even though it is not labeled for that).  I wash my hair every day.  The shampoo is gentle and has an amazing fragrance.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is PERFECT for my hair. I love how it smells and how soft it makes my hair, I have bleached, long, thick, curly hair and I was contemplating cutting it due to the excessive dryness the bleach caused but this shampoo helped me revitalize my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year.  Love how healthy my hair is now.  Shiny and soft</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for dry, damaged, brittle, or gray hair.  It is the only shampoo I use since I discovered it at my hair salon.  I would highly Bed Head Resurrection shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft, smooth, and hydrated. I lose less hair in the shower. I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that I am not ashamed or afraid to wear my hair down for the first time in 6 years.</li>
    <li> Great for my daughters hair!  tried it at the salon and had to get it.  Will order this again soon</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!! It leaves your hair soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t use daily due to my Brazilian Blowout and this is not sulfate free but it is my go to once my Brazilian starts growing out since it leaves my hair really soft. Great conditioner too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a year and absolutely love it. My hair is long and highlighted and it leaves it soft and easy to comb out. I have pretty oily hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down which is pretty unheard of for me. I&#x27;m personally not a fan of the smell. It reminds me of pepto bismol. But the benefits outweigh the smell by far!</li>
    <li> i dont want to write unnecessary stuff like its great for the hair blah blah as i recently bought it so my usage is limited to few wash and its too early to say the effects, however i will give it a 4 star as the price i paid on amazon and the shipment was awesome by the seller. my hair is damaged beyond repair at this stage due to burnt effect i have inflicted with the hair irons, however lets see how this shampoo affects in the long run. will wait patiently and post the findings.</li>
    <li> Perfect lightweight but effective for my over chemical treated hair. I have fine hair and products often are too heavy. This is perfect my hair is light and bouncy after I use it</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  Not too heavy and my hair has NEVER been SO SOFT!  I have very thick, curly/wavy hair that has a mind of its own.  Most shampoo/ conditioners weigh it down and feel all built up - not this stuff!  Will be buying again!  Oh - and it smells AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I was very put-off with the smell initially from the bottle (it kind of smells like sweet tarts?) but once it was in my hair, I fell in love. In fact, I&#x27;ve caught myself a couple times smelling my hair. This shampoo has made my hair so soft that it&#x27;s fun to touch. It also feels hydrated and healthy. I definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone!</li>
    <li> So i bought this based off of ratings and cause I&#x27;ve used bedhead in the past so I know what their products are like.  As for smell, i love the smell of candied cherries so the scent is likeable even though others say they dont like that &amp;#34;artificial&amp;#34; smell. The product gives u a great lather of suds so you dont need too much for your lengthy hair.  As for results, its still too soon to say but i think my hair has gotten a little softer and thicker, it doesnt feel as dry as it used to and that was when i was using Biolage which did recieve a lot of popular ratings on amazon.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great and the smell is incredible!</li>
    <li> I just started using tigi urban anti+dotes after reading all the hype and I must say, for the price it is very high quality. I was using pureology, but at $30 a bottle I just couldn&#x27;t keep up with it. Does it always seem like everyone else has great smelling hair except for you? The scent with the pureology lingers in my hair for days ( I don&#x27;t have to wash everyday) so I actually get compliments on how good my hair smells. It has a cherry popsicle kind of scent. My hair feels healthy and clean without being weighed down.  I plan to keep buying this product since you get so much quality for your money. Worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. I have fine hair that is colored and highlighted.  This makes my hair very soft.  Love it.</li>
    <li> wife loves it not much more to say. it cleans</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo my hair will tolerate anymore. I tried going back to my other shampoos (including Moisture Maniac which used to be my favorite), and they just don&#x27;t do the trick anymore. Urban Anti-dotes, however? Leaves my hair looking sleek, smooth and healthy. I love it!</li>
    <li> My hair feels a lot cleaner after using this and i love the smell :)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!!! It&#x27;s the only shampoo that works with my flat, static, oily hair. My hair is just a big combination of mess. I would try a different shampoo and it would work for alittle bit but then it&#x27;s like my hair got used to the shampoo and that different shampoo would stop working. I&#x27;ve used several different shampoos and they have all failed. This shampoo is the best of the best, in other words, it&#x27;s perfect!!! I also love the price through this seller!!! I highly recommend this shampoo to everyone who has hair that is out of control and who has tried everyother shampoo out there.</li>
    <li> It only takes a couple of squirts to get a good lather. My hair feels clean, but not stripped of moisture. Will happily purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not only do I use this shampoo throughout the winter months (along with the conditioner), but my younger son has started using it too. It doesn&#x27;t take much &amp; feels great! Keeps it all conditioned &amp; full of body through the cold, dry weather &amp; all of the blow-drying. During the summer months, with more swimming &amp; sweating, we use Bed Head &amp;#34;Some Like It Hot&amp;#34; shampoo &amp; conditioner. Love them both!</li>
    <li> purchased for my teen daughters. they seem to like it so far(meaning they havent asked for anything else)&lt;br /&gt;my opinion is that it smells funny, not bad just strange</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now. I have dry hair and this has helped me ever since. It smells really nice and not I overpowering.</li>
    <li> If you dye your hair, process your hair then this is for you!  It leaves your hair with shine and softness.  Just need a little bit.  Takes away frizzy hair BUT doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair nor make it look greasy.  Finally, I found something that works!  My hair is slightly wavy......but lost the shine and bounce it had from years ago.  This product brings it back.  Love it.  Don&#x27;t use a lot.  Don&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit angry as this shampoo was spilled ALL over the inside of the box when I got it however, it quickly seems to be making my hair feel healthier. I typically don&#x27;t like bed head products because I find them thick and sticky leaving residue behind but not this. It stinks too but... It works</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner it does contain sulfates however it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair and I saw improvements the first use, therefore the sulfates don&#x27;t bother me. Smells great really tropical and fruity like papaya, which is nice. The only reason why I stopped buying this product is because it is expensive and I found something not as good but still good for a lower price!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, but I like the smell of the green one better.</li>
    <li> My  Wife is a big fan of this product . She is very happy!!  I was somewhat Unhappy with the shipping packageing , the cap&lt;br /&gt;For the bottle was not secure and  a part of the product leaked all over the interior bag .</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for close to a year and, yes, I would recommend it to anyone who has brittle hair. It got to the place that I did not want to wash and blow dry my fine hair very often due to it thinning and breaking off. But after using this shampoo and conditioner for less than a month I could really tell the difference. My hair has become softer to the touch and much easier to manage. Yes, over time my hair has started not breaking like it times past. I do not know about the thinning part thou.</li>
    <li> This has such an amazing fragrance to it!!</li>
    <li> I finally cracked and bought this shampoo after a year or so of going from platinum blond to red-brown to box-dyes to brown with blond highlights. I pretty much did everything I could to kill my hair by accident and my haircutter told me I desperately needed to step up from drugstore products to get rid of the breaking-off ends and hair loss. I would get straight-up dreadlocks around my neck every day that were miserable to comb out at night. So, I bought this and Biolage&#x27;s deep conditioning masque and have been using them for a month now. My hair is SO much more manageable. No more insane tangles, barely any breakage (the trim probably helped with that too), and no more full hairbrushes after a month. My hair&#x27;s starting to look like it used to before I messed with it! You put this on in the shower and it goes on like a conditioner in shampoo form as far as moisture sensation goes. Love love love it. The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that I try not to shampoo every day and my &#x27;day 2&#x27;s I have noticed that my hair gets a bit stringy up near my scalp. I just spray it with dry shampoo which mostly deals with the problem, but I also work out on my shower days so maybe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s adding to the buildup. Good to keep in mind though. Also, I have thick hair down to my mid-back and I&#x27;ve only run through a half bottle in a month. Pretty good!!</li>
    <li> I love Tigi. I really like Urban Antidotes. It&#x27;s great for dry and brittle hair. The order can quicker than expected.  I&#x27;d order from them again.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair that is very long.  I&#x27;ve done a lot of color treatment and noticed that i was starting to lose a lot of hair in my brush and when I washed it.  I looked for a product to strengthen and rebuild my hair so it won&#x27;t break so easily and this product did the trick!  It is quite noticeable how much LESS hair I lose from brushing and washing now, and my hair is very soft without being overly weighted down.  Plus,it smells good.</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo. both my granddaughter and I use this and even though our hair textures are very different, it works great for both of us. We also use the conditioner. Both are great products.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. This shampoo put the moisture back in my hair, leaving it soft non frizzy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is creamy, rich, and smells great.  I have really fine hair and it helps detangle my hair some.  (I still have to use conditioner to get completely snarl-free.)  Try this shampoo (plus respective conditioner) for super soft, fresh-smelling hair.  I used the Bed Head Control Freak shampoo and conditioner to help get rid of snarls but this formula works a bit better.</li>
