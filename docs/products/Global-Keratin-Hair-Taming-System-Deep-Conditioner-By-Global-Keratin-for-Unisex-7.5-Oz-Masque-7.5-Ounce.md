      <li>great for dry hair and curly hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this thinking that the Keratin was something special for my hair , I see no difference when using it</li>
      <li>nothing special.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.....and has a nice scent too.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser used this as a deep conditioner and I loved what it does for my hair.  </li>
      <li>exactly how I like my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>I also tried the daily sahmpoo &amp; conditioner and love those too!</li>
      <li>So far, it is the best product to calm down my frizzy, over processed hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have measurable success.  </li>
      <li>But worth the results .</li>
      <li>That rarely if ever happens to my hair.</li>
      <li>Today we used this conditioner &amp; the comb glided right thru.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a deep conditioner that works for my hair (very fine, color treated, but lots of hair strands).</li>
      <li>I have not found anything else that leaves my hair as strong and soft.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft, strong &amp; conditioned.</li>
      <li>I saw the difference after first application.</li>
      <li>My only advice is when you get your first keratin treatment get a stylish who will comb it into your hair.  </li>
      <li>But adding this really controled frizz!</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it said it does.</li>
      <li>My hear look like the first day I did the keratin treatment.</li>
      <li>only ok.  </li>
      <li>Excellent deep conditioner, leaves my hair soft mostutized without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>I purchased for my daughter, she has very thich, ringlets that tangle.</li>
      <li>I am very upset.</li>
      <li>thanks Wikipedia)&lt;br /&gt;PPG&lt;</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve been able to come to the old deep conditioner I used to get from my stylist in Atlanta before he went out of business.</li>
      <li>Packed well and decent price..</li>
      <li>prefer my hair natural, kinky, curly, frizzy, but healthy than no hair at all, cause I read people complaining about thinning due to this treatment as well.</li>
      <li>Thank you Global Keratin for making such a fabulous product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It contains a pretty cocktail  of Toxic ingredients such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and my hairdresser said I needed to be careful how much I used it because you can get to much keratin .</li>
      <li>Please look at the packaging it is old packing from years ago</li>
      <li>and it makes it feel so soft after use.</li>
      <li>On time, actually early.</li>
      <li>I will never put another harsh relaxer in my hair for as long as I live:-)</li>
      <li>Definitely not a true deep conditioner; reminds me more of a drugstore conditioner, very light and thin.  </li>
      <li>Rich in texture, very hydrating and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I used this deep conditioner initially with my stylist, then purchased individually because I liked the results - silky bouncy hair that looked repaired from the dull, heat damaged strands</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m african and my natural hair is coarse and curly.</li>
      <li>I have to flat iron my hair everyday to get my hair straight and everyday, I can see white fumes being released from my hair as it touches the hot iron.</li>

    <li> I used this and its Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Im so glad I tried it. Does exactly what it said it does. I love my hair</li>
    <li> This conditioner is everything I wanted and more.  It tames my hair and leaves it silky smooth and thats exactly how I like my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> I saw the difference after first application. Very good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have measurable success.  I may have used it incorrectly. No fault to the vendor. My original experience with the product was great.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of good reviews on this product,so i decided to give it a try but once it arrived and i read the ingredients i decided not to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It contains a pretty cocktail  of Toxic ingredients such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARABENS&lt;br /&gt;DMDM HYDANTOIN which is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative (thanks Wikipedia)&lt;br /&gt;PPG&lt;br /&gt;SILICONES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> nothing special. cheaper alternatives available</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly, along with the daily shampoo and conditioner. I have not found anything else that leaves my hair as strong and soft. Love it and have turned many friends and family members onto it as well. Great deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> Its a tubs up product.&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of a fact I am feeling to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!! And makes my hair super soft not to mention a huge continer I was not expecting I&#x27;m so happy with it!</li>
    <li> On time, actually early. Packed well and decent price..&lt;br /&gt;I was happy and will reorder for sure when I need more</li>
    <li> love this product and always get a better deal at amazon than at the salons.  great for dry hair and curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for dry hair. Excellent value for price and size too.</li>
    <li> Good product. The price is little high</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve been able to come to the old deep conditioner I used to get from my stylist in Atlanta before he went out of business. It does a great job of strengthening and conditioning. I have much less breakage and my hair feels like silk afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as my old deep conditioner. For the price, it ought to last a little while longer. The effects only last for about two weeks before I have to do it again. I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a deep conditioner that works for my hair (very fine, color treated, but lots of hair strands). In the mean time, it does what it says and does it well.</li>
    <li> i ve been using it for quite a while and it does work when you did the keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;for the price it is a great product.</li>
    <li> i like it and i will buy it again</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling healthy, lasts for about 5 weeks.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I think I finally found my holy grail deep conditioner. I am African-American &amp; I have very coarse, kinky &amp; thick natural hair. My hair has been giving me a lot of problems lately, tangling up in knots, feeling very dry &amp; being hard to comb. I bought this conditioner on somewhat of a whim, I saw a Youtube video &amp; the vlogger used this for her blowout. I did some research on it &amp; decided to give it a try. Best hair decision I ever made.    I took it to my usual salon to get a deep condition. Because my hair gets so tangled &amp; knotted up the shampoo girl always has to put some conditioner on my hair &amp; comb it out. This usually takes about 15-20 minutes &amp; can be somewhat painful because I am tender-headed. Today we used this conditioner &amp; the comb glided right thru. My hair was detangled in less than five minutes. OMG. That rarely if ever happens to my hair. There is only one conditioner I recall giving me those type of results &amp; it&#x27;s very hard to get a hold of (it&#x27;s UANS Therapi Reconstructor in case you were curious).    My hair feels so soft, strong &amp; conditioned. Thank you Global Keratin for making such a fabulous product. You got a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I used this deep conditioner initially with my stylist, then purchased individually because I liked the results - silky bouncy hair that looked repaired from the dull, heat damaged strands I walked in with. I purchased online and then used as instructed with heat, conditioning cap, under dryer. The results were great, but not as good as the first time. Maybe I reached my maximum potential with my hair with this product line at the time. I used the Deep Conditioner along with the leave in creme while blowing out my 4A hair. It does have silicones in it, but those are helpful to protect your hair if you&#x27;re going to apply heat from time to time. Bottom line with this conditioner I would say that the good thing is, you don&#x27;t have to keep using the product over and over to maintain results. One or two uses makes your hair better and lasts a while. So if you use it and it seems your hair isn&#x27;t getting as shiny as before, maybe let it alone for a while and use it as a treat occasionally. Or your hair has a different need. For the price, probably won&#x27;t repurchase. I think I can get similar/better results with Nexxus Emergencee Reconstructor.</li>
    <li> Good price and shipping</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this as a deep conditioner and I loved what it does for my hair.  My hair seems as thick as it was in my early 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now).  I was noticing that the top of my hair was thinning but this product has put a reverse on that.  It softens the texture of my hair - which is curly african american hair.  Since using this product, my curls are even bigger and wavy in the front of my head.  I definitely recommended this to minimize breakage and as a deep conditioner.  Everyone that I&#x27;ve recommended this product to loves it regardless of hair texture.</li>
    <li> Love, love it!  It manages my frizzy hair so mcuh</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this product would help repair my color treated hair but after talking to my stylist I found out that this product is intended to be an express blow out and doesn&#x27;t offer much deep conditioning.  It would be great for extending the life of your blow out.</li>
    <li> Please look at the packaging it is old packing from years ago</li>
    <li> only ok.  Definitely not a true deep conditioner; reminds me more of a drugstore conditioner, very light and thin.  I prefer Moroccan Oil Deep Condition hands down.</li>
    <li> Great product. Performs as advertised. Leaves hair soft and manageable.....and has a nice scent too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I had rather dry hair. Already used the shampoo and conditioner an they were great. But adding this really controled frizz! My hair looks hydrated and healthy. Shine and texture are amazing! I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of improvement. Definitely will keep using it!!!!</li>
    <li> Stay away from this product!!!!! Like another reviewer said, it contains DMDM hydantoin, parabens and other toxic components. Side effects include eye irritations, migraines, etc. I had the keratin treatment done and I used this conditioner to maintain results. I&#x27;m african and my natural hair is coarse and curly. I have to flat iron my hair everyday to get my hair straight and everyday, I can see white fumes being released from my hair as it touches the hot iron. As I&#x27;m writing this review, I have serious, very serious migraines. I am very upset. I regret paying so much money just to jeopardize my own health, because these products contain carcinogen components. They contain components that release the not so popular FORMALDEHYDE. I wish i was warned before I spent my money on these dangerous products from global keratin aka van Tibolli beauty aka GKHair. Don&#x27;t take my word for it, do your own research on side effects of each ingredients. It is so scary how manufacturers do not care put people&#x27;s health at risk just to make money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer my hair natural, kinky, curly, frizzy, but healthy than no hair at all, cause I read people complaining about thinning due to this treatment as well. Not to mention risks of CANCER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have been warned!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever tried~!  My Son&#x27;s girlfriend is a stylist and brought me a sample~  I am blond and have issues with dry hair especially as I age.  This conditioner makes my hair soft and the smell is amazing!  I also tried the daily sahmpoo &amp; conditioner and love those too!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that the Keratin was something special for my hair , I see no difference when using it and my hairdresser said I needed to be careful how much I used it because you can get to much keratin . this is expensive and not worth it !</li>
    <li> I been usi,ng the global keratin deep conditionel  for 5years is been the bests my hairsoft ,shiny and smell so good my hoby&lt;br /&gt;loved.</li>
    <li> Works great. So far, it is the best product to calm down my frizzy, over processed hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent deep conditioner, leaves my hair soft mostutized without weighing it down. My hair is fine. Also detangles great. I purchased for my daughter, she has very thich, ringlets that tangle. The conditioner works wonders for her</li>
    <li> I really love this conditioner. I have very dry, processed and coarse hair and it makes it feel so soft after use. It is pricey$$$.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing conditioner, learn how to use it.  I recommend it for any stylist.  Charge $50.00 to $80.00 for it.</li>
    <li> I do like this deep conditioner . Kind of a hassle with 20 minute dryer time. But worth the results .</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite conditioner!</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and damaged from bleaching and I have found this to be an excellent product! Rich in texture, very hydrating and a little bit goes a long way. This will forever be in my bathroom as a staple. So pleased to have found this line!!</li>
    <li> A month after I got my keratin treatment in my hair it got a little dryer on the ends. I decided to get the GK Deep Conditioner to see if it help repair the dryness. I followed the instructions and I can say I can&#x27;t be happier with the results. My hear look like the first day I did the keratin treatment. Have been two weeks since I used the deep conditioner and my hair still look beautiful and the dryness is gone!</li>
    <li> I love love love GK products and they work wonders for my hair.  I am African American and I have struggled for years with finding a good healthy solution for my hair.  I love this product.  My only advice is when you get your first keratin treatment get a stylish who will comb it into your hair.  After that, it all gravy!  Love it, love it, absolutely love it!!!  I will never put another harsh relaxer in my hair for as long as I live:-)</li>
    <li> I could not tell that it was any better than the conditioner I was using and it takes longer by having to wait.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes your hair feel after you use it!  It has lots of bounce and shine and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Loved it - it really left my hair nice and silky smothed&lt;br /&gt;Shinny and easy to manage I will recommend to any out there</li>
