      <li>So we did our own experiment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not being paid to say this, just wanting to give an honest review</li>
      <li>It lathered nice, but those beads felt like they weren&#x27;t breaking</li>
      <li>So far loving it!!!</li>
      <li>It lathers up really nicely and rinses out easily.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad that I bought it.</li>
      <li>I tottally love this stuff I use it on my hair all the time.</li>
      <li>I was certainly able to go 2 days without needing to do anything else with my hair.  </li>
      <li>To get a brush or comb through it, I ended up yanking out more hair than I was keeping on my head, it seemed.</li>
      <li>Since this was supposed to make hair softer, more moisturized, and the like, I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>Probably needs more time.</li>
      <li>As for shine, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as prominent?</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo thinking it would make my hair more moisturized</li>
      <li>my curls are so defined bouncy and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>this honestly made my hair color fade 3 times faster than my sulfate free shampoos.</li>
      <li>Which in sure</li>
      <li>The shampoo alone doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair but when combined with the matching conditioner and one minute treatment they are a great regimine.  </li>
      <li>IT REALLY GOES GREAT WITH MY HAIR AND GREAT LATHER AND VERY INEXPENSIVE.</li>
      <li>It did keep my hair clean without drying it to much, and I had great shine and body.</li>
      <li>But once it air dried, I was most impressed by the shine.</li>
      <li>My hair felt drier, and tangled so easily.</li>
      <li>The smell is too strong.</li>
      <li>it was ok nothing special</li>
      <li>I feel like my hair looks so smooth and silky now all the time</li>
      <li>BUT, the next day my hair still looked great.</li>
      <li>For a week my mom switched to a cheap suave shampoo while I still used this shampoo.</li>
      <li>honestly would not recommend this to anyone unless you really want brittle hair.</li>
      <li>The texture of this shampoo is bizarre.  </li>
      <li>This is important because, as I said before, this shampoo has no slip for me.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>I also have tangled hair easily and the conditioner made it super easy to brush through.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if Garnier knows it, but some natural oils are good for the growth of your hair.</li>
      <li>It lathered up better then the first time and again as i rinsed it out</li>
      <li>I am a fan original Garnier Fructis &amp; the triple nutrition.</li>
      <li>First off I would love to start out by explaining my hair type.</li>
      <li>The shampoo itself made my hair feel squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>The smell is quite pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t overpower the perfume that I regularly wear.</li>
      <li>i wasn&#x27;t completely sure that the bead really broke.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s kinda cool.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
      <li>or I braid it to the side quickly.</li>
      <li>IT LEFT MY HAIR NICE AND LIGHT.</li>
      <li>There should be more more directions on whether all three products should be used at the same time every day.</li>
      <li>So good that I skipped the dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>The only positive thing I can say about this shampoo is that it smelled good.</li>
      <li>I got the whole Hydra Recharge system for free through BzzAgent.com</li>
      <li>It smells nice, but it&#x27;s kind of thick and sticky.</li>
      <li>It was kind of gross.</li>
      <li>And sure enough, when I rinsed my hair, it did feel squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>and right away I felt</li>
      <li>I notice that my hair would get oily right away.</li>
      <li>could tell even in the shower that it was stripping my hair too much because my hair had that \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice anything special while I was washing my hair.</li>
      <li>The shampoo has a wonderful scent and has little tiny microbeads in it.  </li>
      <li>This totally dried out my hair and is one of the most drying shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used and that is saying a lot because I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to do anything.</li>
      <li>When I took my hair out of the bun this morning, it was so silky smooth and SOFT.</li>
      <li>I think the thing I appreciate most of this... even more than what it&#x27;s made for (hydration, shine, SOFTNESS) is how it&#x27;s probably not as damaging for my hair as the shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>At first we couldn&#x27;t figure out why</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo for 2 days at first</li>
      <li>My advice to any using this product would be to use all three products as directed to get the exact results you are looking for.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Garnier, you are a peach!</li>
      <li>Get more info by checking out my entire product review</li>
      <li>I have used Garnier in the past with good results (the Length and Strength line).</li>
      <li>When I first washed my hair with it, I was a little terrified to be honest.</li>
      <li>And the conditioner wasn&#x27;t strong enough to help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had to really work at it to even get it to lather.</li>
      <li>and her hair is straight and a lot thinner than mine</li>
      <li>I bought it because it was reasonable.</li>
      <li>It has put so much nourishment in my hair.</li>
      <li>The conditioner I tried is a bit too much conditioning</li>
      <li>My guess is that the superfruits really do help?</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t sweat much and</li>
      <li>By 4 days every night my head began to intensely itch.</li>
      <li>Steer clear!!!</li>
      <li>YOU MUST CONDITION YOUR HAIR AFTERWARDS or it will feel like straw as many of the other reviews have mentioned.</li>
      <li>In the shower, my hair felt like straw but this shampoo made my conditioner &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; better than it ever did with my other shampoos....</li>
      <li>and I was looking for a shampoo that would clean my hair without totally stripping it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells really good and good price ty</li>
    <li> I have such dry, tangled hair and am always looking for new shampoos. I tried this and I am obsessed with it! Leaves my hair so shiny and smooth. I&#x27;ve never gotten a compliment in my life on my hair being shiny and two different people have said it since I started using this! I also have tangled hair easily and the conditioner made it super easy to brush through. Kept my hair clean feeling all day and smelled so good!</li>
    <li> I like their products seem to be good for hair</li>
    <li> It does make your hair feel a little like straw, but combined with the other Hydra Recharge system products (Conditioner and 1-Minute Conditioner), oddly does work!~ Smells wonderful and really gets rid of dandruff and oil.</li>
    <li> It did keep my hair clean without drying it to much, and I had great shine and body. However, the little hydrating beads inside of the shampoo do not want to dissolve and I ended up with some in my eyes the first time I used it. I only bought this because I could not find my usual Garnier shampoo, the Length and Strength, which I use because I have fine, somewhat fragile hair. This did seem to protect my hair from breakage, and in a way it&#x27;s a nice change, because I have found if I use the same shampoo all the time, my hair seems to have less body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to using this shampoo, is put some on your hands, not very much, and rub and rub until you break up as many of the beads as possible</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo thinking it would make my hair more moisturized but I got DISASTER! I used this shampoo for 2 days at first it was ok nothing special but then something odd had started to happen. By 4 days every night my head began to intensely itch. I tried not to scratch but when I did I got a horrible burning feeling after that spread all across my head starting at the original itching spot. Then my mom began to have the same issue it got so bad that she had to go to the doctor! At first we couldn&#x27;t figure out why but then we realized that the only shampoo we had in the house was that. So we did our own experiment. For a week my mom switched to a cheap suave shampoo while I still used this shampoo. By two weeks my moms problem went away completely while my issue progressed horribly! As soon as I switched I felt almost immediate relief by 1 shampooing. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t know why this shampoo has done this but I advise anyone and everyone not! To! Use! This! Shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products I have EVER used. I typically try to stay with cheap shampoos that can be found at grocery stores and I have basically tried them all. I switch up my shampoo after I empty a bottle because I just haven&#x27;t found one that I like. I have thin, curly hair that likes to frizz because I live in Florida. It is also damaged from years of straightening. It&#x27;s pretty much unmanageable and disgusting ALL THE TIME. It&#x27;s such a pain to work with that I typically just throw it up in a bun or I braid it to the side quickly. I hardly ever wear my hair down because it&#x27;s so disgusting. But then I found this stuff. The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to do anything. It smells nice, but it&#x27;s kind of thick and sticky. It lathered nice, but those beads felt like they weren&#x27;t breaking and it almost felt like I had sand in my hair before I washed the shampoo out. It was kind of gross. It also left my hair feeling &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; like this shampoo had stripped my hair of all natural oils. So, I was thinking that this shampoo wasn&#x27;t going to work and I thought it was just going to damage my hair further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man, I was so wrong. I typically take a shower at night and then throw my hair up in a high bun to let it dry overnight. When I took my hair out of the bun this morning, it was so silky smooth and SOFT. My wavy curls were actually bouncing and my hair felt weightless. I am IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT! Granted, I have only used it once, so I&#x27;ll update this review in about a month from now after I&#x27;m about halfway through the bottle. I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that this product continues to work on my hair. I&#x27;m having the best hair day ever today!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo on a whim one day when I ran out of my clarifying shampoo. I have shoulder length 4a, relaxed hair and I was looking for a shampoo that would clean my hair without totally stripping it. I figured I didn&#x27;t need to clarify as often as I was previously because I cut down on my use of silicones. When I first washed my hair with it, I was a little terrified to be honest. It&#x27;s really thick and it lathers A LOT, which always concerns me because in my experience, a lot of suds &#x3D; stripped hair. And sure enough, when I rinsed my hair, it did feel squeaky clean. Oh boy! My hair had very little slip, but I detangled it with a shower comb under running water with no incident, and then proceeded to my normal shampoo day routine: protein conditioner and then a moisturizing deep conditioner. As my hair began to airdry, I was shocked how soft, hydrated, and bouncy it was! In the shower, my hair felt like straw but this shampoo made my conditioner &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; better than it ever did with my other shampoos....and I have no idea why! It was weird but it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve refined my technique a little bit. I prepoo with coconut oil for a little while, and then before I get in the shower, I carefully and thoroughly detangle my hair. This is important because, as I said before, this shampoo has no slip for me. When I shampoo my hair, I do it in quadrants. I only use about a dime-sized amount of shampoo on each quadrant and I lather it up on my hands before putting it on my hair, focusing on the scalp and then GENTLY working my way to the ends. I rinse it out slowly and run a shower comb gently through it under running water. After that, I apply conditioner and let it work its magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap, things to keep in mind with this shampoo: 1) it has no slip so detangle beforehand, 2) it&#x27;s really really thick, 3) YOU MUST CONDITION YOUR HAIR AFTERWARDS or it will feel like straw as many of the other reviews have mentioned. If you want a shampoo that&#x27;ll leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;juicy&amp;#34; in one shot, this is not the one for you. BUT if you&#x27;re used to deep conditioning your hair after shampooing, then I recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> First off I would love to start out by explaining my hair type. My hair is down to my armpits and is thick. I have wavy color treated hair (as you can assume I need something hydrating). I went to walmart and saw this product and was in desperate need for shampoo. For only 3 dollars I thought \\&quot;what the heck?\\&quot; So I grabbed te shampoo and conditioner and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this shampoo out.&lt;br /&gt;Once it was time to wash my hair I poured some of the product into my hand and right away I felt like I was going to wash my hair with an exfoliating facial wash. When I put it in my hair to lather it felt like I was washing my hair with gritty sand. It was awful. My hair starts to feel brittle and like straw. It was so disgusting. The conditioner helped a big but it left a lot of residue on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Since this product does contain sulfates (I usually purchas sulfate free shampoos) I notice that my hair would get oily right away. That same day my hair would already look as If I hadn&#x27;t washed it in days when it has only been a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly would not recommend this to anyone unless you really want brittle hair. Which in sure no one wants.&lt;br /&gt;Also if you have color treated hair avoid shampoos with sulfate this honestly made my hair color fade 3 times faster than my sulfate free shampoos.</li>
    <li> I think this product does what is promises.  Give it a try.  Get more info by checking out my entire product review at;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite shampoo so far out of any that I have previously used. I purchased this with the conditioner and the treatment (which is like a second conditioner). This shampoo makes my hair feel wonderful. For some reason, my slightly wavy hair dries completely straight when I use the trio, which spares me from having to use a straightener. The smell is quite pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t overpower the perfume that I regularly wear. I am definitely dedicated to this product from now on.</li>
    <li> I see alot of negative reviews here, but I have the driest hair in the world and I usually like Garnier and anything John Frieda, and I just love this shampoo! My hair is not dry at all after using this shampoo and it&#x27;s very soft and bouncy.  The conditioner I tried is a bit too much conditioning I think, but the shampoo is amazing! Love how my hair feels after using this!</li>
    <li> This was the worst purchase I could have ever made. I had been having trouble with split ends and dry hair for a while, so I decided to try something new. Since this was supposed to make hair softer, more moisturized, and the like, I decided to give it a try. When I washed my hair, it was the worst feeling ever. My hair felt drier, and tangled so easily. To get a brush or comb through it, I ended up yanking out more hair than I was keeping on my head, it seemed. My hair felt like I had washed it with dish soap or something meant to strip all oil. I don&#x27;t know if Garnier knows it, but some natural oils are good for the growth of your hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anybody ever. My hair was not soft or hydrated after use of this product.</li>
    <li> I received a trial size of this shampoo with the conditioner and one-minute repair conditioner.  As many have described, my hair immediately felt dry after using just the shampoo, however, using the conditioner it was immediately silky even while wet.  My advice to any using this product would be to use all three products as directed to get the exact results you are looking for.  I was certainly able to go 2 days without needing to do anything else with my hair.  The shampoo itself made my hair feel squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the worst I&#x27;ve used.  I am a fan original Garnier Fructis &amp; the triple nutrition. I bought this because the triple nutrition weighed my hair down and I wanted something lighter. This totally dried out my hair and is one of the most drying shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used and that is saying a lot because I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands.</li>
    <li> I got the whole Hydra Recharge system for free through BzzAgent.com and I have to say, it&#x27;s the best shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve used!  I always am so happy with how silky and smooth my hair is when I leave the salon, but disappointed when I can&#x27;t get the same results at home.  Well, because of this system I can now!  I was stunned!  I&#x27;m not being paid to say this, just wanting to give an honest review so Garnier can get the credit they deserve for this awesome system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B7UQXLC Garnier Fructis Hydra Recharge Fortifying Shampoo, 13 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B7UPNQS Garnier Fructis Hydra Recharge Fortifying Conditioner, 13 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B7UT0K8 Garnier Fructis Hydra Recharge 1-Minute Moisture-Plenish Treatment, 8.5 fl oz]]</li>
    <li> The shampoo alone made my hair feel weird as i washed the shampoo out of my hair it sounded squeaky, maybe from the beads or maybe that is what the shampoo is designed to do. I did not like this, so i decided to try it again i reapplied the shampoo this time i did not comb my hair through. It lathered up better then the first time and again as i rinsed it out it felt the same way. I continued to use this product twice a week for a month the results have improved teamed with the other two products in the &#x27;series&#x27; i have noticed good results my hair is stronger, shinier and less dry then it was before. I love the smell of the product!!</li>
    <li> I saw this shampoo in the store and thought I would try it.I wet my hair and applied the shampoo, within seconds of massaging this into my hair it felt soo dry! I rinsed it all out, and felt my hair and it stripped my hair of any moisture.My hair did not feel hydrated at ALL!!!!The best example I could compare this to is when you wash your body with a bar of soap and then dry off and then you feel that tight dry feeling on your skin?That is how this shampoo was on my hair!. I have naturally curly/wavy thick hair.After I rinsed out the shampoo I applied some alberto V05 Conditioning treatment to my hair which brought it back to life. I won&#x27;t buy this product again. I simply can&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo I usually buy (pantene) was not in stock when I went to the store today, so I bought this as a substitute. There are a lot of Garnier styling products I like, so I figured this would be a good shampoo. Boy was I wrong. When I put this on my hair it felt so thick and greasy. I had to really work at it to even get it to lather. As I was washing it, my hair was sticking together and getting all tangled up, it was a goopy sticky mess. I had to re-wash my hair with my old brand of shampoo just to get this stuff out. When I was done my hair felt dry and brittle, and it was completely frizzy and flyaway. The only positive thing I can say about this shampoo is that it smelled good. Other than that it was quite possibly the worst stuff I have ever used. Needless to say I will not be buying this again!!</li>
    <li> Cleans your hair real good but it does not leave it soft. I bought it because it was reasonable. I only use after a hard day at the gym or when I&#x27;ve been out mountain biking when I need to really clean my hair. Definitely use cream rinse after using this. Rotate another shampoo that is gentler on your hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Garnier in the past with good results (the Length and Strength line). However, this product does not do what it claims. My dry hair feels even drier than usual. The lather is even a bit sticky in my hands as I massage it into my hair and scalp. The smell is too strong. I feel like I&#x27;m pouring an alcoholic cocktail onto my head instead of a lightly fruity shampoo. I use this in conjunction with the conditioner, and I can&#x27;t recommend this line at all.</li>
    <li> This was just like washing my hair in dishwashing liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could tell even in the shower that it was stripping my hair too much because my hair had that \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean feeling.  And the conditioner wasn&#x27;t strong enough to help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got out, my hair was super dry and tangly.  Even after it air-dried it was still tangly and wouldn&#x27;t move normally because each strand was sticking to each other.  I had to wash it again with a different shampoo just to get it to be normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the 800-number on the back of the bottle, and they&#x27;re sending me some coupons to make up for it.  I&#x27;m not even that picky with shampoo/conditioner, but this stuff is seriously horrible.  And what a joke that it&#x27;s supposed to be hydrating--It&#x27;s the exact opposite.  Steer clear!!!</li>
    <li> it was horrable the shampoo came opened it was missing like half the bottel and it almost ruined everything else in the box</li>
    <li> I tottally love this stuff I use it on my hair all the time. I am so glad that I bought it. I always had dry frizzy hair before I started using the shampoo. It has put so much nourishment in my hair. I feel like my hair looks so smooth and silky now all the time and it also makes me feel so much younger. Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
    <li> I think it cured my baldness!  Hooray For Fructis!  I ju st love life again!  Thanks Garnier, you are a peach!</li>
    <li> The texture of this shampoo is bizarre.  It&#x27;s like trying to wash your hair with molasses.  Don&#x27;t know how else to describe it.  It is thick,  gritty and almost sticky.  It strips my hair, so I have to use extra conditioner.  I&#x27;ve used about a fourth of the bottle and am going to have to throw it away.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> The Garnier Hydra Recharge is amazing!!! I have curly color treated hair so it is very dry. I used the shampoo conditioner and the leave in treatment and my curls are so defined bouncy and healthy looking. My 16 year old is addicted to this and her hair is straight and a lot thinner than mine and it has left her hair soft and shiny!!</li>
    <li> Been using this for about ... one and a half weeks? I think the thing I appreciate most of this... even more than what it&#x27;s made for (hydration, shine, SOFTNESS) is how it&#x27;s probably not as damaging for my hair as the shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;ve been losing more hair than normal for like probably the past few months. I&#x27;m definitely losing a lot less hair with this shampoo set..so I think I&#x27;m going back to normal :) My guess is that the superfruits really do help? The hydration/softness definitely works as advertised. I&#x27;m not really sure if the added hydration hair mask is necessary to use at the same time as conditioner. There should be more more directions on whether all three products should be used at the same time every day. I have been doing that though, just because I&#x27;m not sure what to do otherwise. I definitely get softer hair, even though my hair is already pretty soft due to its thinness. As for shine, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as prominent? Probably needs more time. So far loving it!!! was never hooked on the garnier brand but good job this time ^__^</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product because most of the Garnier Fructis line leaves my hair feeling and looking awful. I have dry hair so for the  most part, I only wash my hair every other day.  I usually use dry shampoo to bring volume back to my hair when I don&#x27;t wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo consistency is a liquid-gel with blue beads that smells like kiwi cleanliness. The conditioner is somewhat thinner than a standard drugstore conditioner. I didn&#x27;t really notice anything special while I was washing my hair. But once it air dried, I was most impressed by the shine. I&#x27;m not convinced that my hair was anymore silky or soft than it was the day before. And with all my hair, I don&#x27;t even know how you could call it weightless. BUT, the next day my hair still looked great. So good that I skipped the dry shampoo. In fact, on one of the \\&quot;hair wash days\\&quot; I went to the gym. I didn&#x27;t sweat much and my assessment the next morning was that the Hydra Recharge fortified my hair against exercise and didn&#x27;t need a re-wash. However, I did use the dry shampoo. This isn&#x27;t always the case and just depends on my workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydra Recharge utilizes goji berry, passion fruit and kiwi to ensure hair is hydrated, weightless, silky and soft for up to 2 days. I did read recently that the beads are a combo of the superfruits and burst on impact. That&#x27;s kinda cool. I did squeeze a bead this morning but didn&#x27;t notice anything awesome. They&#x27;re so tiny i wasn&#x27;t completely sure that the bead really broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switch shampoos and conditioners every time I finish a bottle and I&#x27;ll definitely be incorporating this into the rotation.</li>
    <li> I have to say that overall I like this shampoo, however it doesn&#x27;t really stand out for me from any other product.  The shampoo alone doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair but when combined with the matching conditioner and one minute treatment they are a great regimine.  The shampoo has a wonderful scent and has little tiny microbeads in it.  It lathers up really nicely and rinses out easily.  But without the conditioners it does not leave my hair as moist as I would want.  Overall I would recommend this product (along with the conditioner and 1 minute treatment) to people with dry hair.</li>
    <li> i JUST LOVED IT I AM AFRICAN AMERICAN AN I HAVE 4B/4C HAIR TYPE. IT LEFT MY HAIR NICE AND LIGHT. I HAVENT USED THE CONDITIONER YET BECAUSE IM DEEP CONTIONING BUT I CAN IT REALLY GOES GREAT WITH MY HAIR AND GREAT LATHER AND VERY INEXPENSIVE.</li>
