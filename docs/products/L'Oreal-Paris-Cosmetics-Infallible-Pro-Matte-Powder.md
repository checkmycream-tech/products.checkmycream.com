      <li>It&#x27;s very nice over the liquid-powder makeup, but what I really like is that it&#x27;s great on its own.</li>
      <li>It comes with a sponge which is neatly tucked in it&#x27;s separate compartment, and is very easy to apply with.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;d still prefer a translucent powder for instances when I&#x27;m already using a foundation with more coverage, but a tinted powder is nice when I have tinted moisturizer underneath.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a light hand with powders so keep that in mind when I say that I got good results from this L&#x27;Oreal Nude Beige Pro-Matte Powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and provides good coverage.</li>
      <li>And although this is a nicely sized compact with a great mirror design, I wouldn&#x27;t carry it in my bag because I&#x27;m pretty sure it wouldn&#x27;t hold up to being rattled around.</li>
      <li>The pressed powder goes on easily with the included sponge (dry), giving the face a beautiful texture, feeling smooth, and looking great!  </li>
      <li>So glad I did.</li>
      <li>love the container this comes in.  </li>
      <li>I love how this smooths out my complexion.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use much to get a great and even look.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have switched from powder to cream because I felt they are more lightweight.  </li>
      <li>I also used concealer underneath my eyes and to better camouflage acne scars.  </li>
      <li>I like this product more than BB or CC Cream.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and [[ASIN:B00BN7FDPQ BOOTS No. 7 Tinted Moisturiser]] and love the look.</li>
      <li>did notice that like most face powders I&#x27;ve tried it does make my skin feel a bit itchy</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the coverage it provided.  </li>
      <li>I also like that it gave me a bit more coverage to help even out my skin tone and make my skin look better without giving me an overly powdery or made up look.  </li>
      <li>LOVE Infallible Pro-Matte : )</li>
      <li>and now she&#x27;s asking me to buy her more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned with lots of freckles, and nothing I do seems to look right when I experiment with make-up.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks bright and pretty when I use this.</li>
      <li>Looking at the color chart and reading the information on the company website it SEEMED like the right color (I have fair skin that burns easily</li>
      <li>This Matte Finish Powder is amazing, because it does a perfect job of &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; her whole face to last all day.  </li>
      <li>There is a separate place for the sponge along with a nice size mirror, which is useful to use for touch ups during the day.</li>
      <li>the best I have used for a while makes one feel so much better with softer skin and way less oil  stays on till I remove it.</li>
      <li>Even at this price-point L&#x27;Oreal could have created a simpler, more elegant design that a woman wouldn&#x27;t mind having in hand for a quick blot.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s easy to wash and clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>In the evening it is easy to take off with makeup remover or cleanser.  </li>
      <li>and it goes on easily with either.  </li>
      <li>On it&#x27;s own, I didn&#x27;t feel like it gave very much coverage like a foundation powder like BareMinerals would.  </li>
      <li>This works wonderfully to keep my face looking freshly made up but also only lightly covered with make up.  </li>
      <li>I also thought it did a nice job of giving my skin a more matte finish without taking it too far and again, making me look powdery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had issues with breaking out or irritation with it, so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me.  </li>
      <li>Does not keep my face free of oil&lt;</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recall the brand, but since I&#x27;m cheap that way, I suspect it&#x27;s a lower end product -</li>
      <li>It went smoothly over foundation</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another part of this product that I thoroughly enjoy is the way it is packaged.</li>
      <li>A light swipe is all I need of the oil free powder.  </li>
      <li>so thought the oil free part of this might work well for her.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with this product and will keep an extra in my purse for touch ups.</li>
      <li>powder goes on smoothly and takes away shine.  </li>
      <li>claims to keep my face oil free for 16 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The good news about having had oily skin since 6th grade is that when you&#x27;re 50+ your skin can look surprisingly young.</li>
      <li>The Pro-Matte nude beige powder worked well with my skin type while also giving me a clean, smooth look.</li>
      <li>The powder is super fine and goes on so smoothly, it&#x27;s almost like a cream.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to try this out.  </li>
      <li>The size is perfect for any size purse, even a small evening clutch.</li>
      <li>The case if very attractive and both sides have clear tops so that you can quickly see which side you need next - the powder or the puff/mirror.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have finally found good matte face powder.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to apply but you would need to use cover-up of some type first if you have any blemishes.</li>
      <li>When the wife viewed this product, she was very interested because she uses L&#x27;Oreal products of makeup and blush on her face.  </li>
      <li>I first applied my Laura Mercier oil free primer on my skin, followed by Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer in Nude.  </li>
      <li>I am not crazy about the case.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the packaging, though.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
      <li>It is nice having the sponge in a separate compartment in the back, so that it does not touch the powder.  </li>
      <li>I have long liked L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s products, but I really didn&#x27;t think that there was much difference when it came to most &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; pressed powders.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recall the brand, but since I&#x27;m cheap that way, I suspect it&#x27;s a lower end product - so always fun to try something new thanks to Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging with the twin openings, one for the applicator pad and one for the powder itself. Takes up less room than the one I&#x27;ve been using that&#x27;s flat and too thin to stand up on its own, or else it takes up too much room on the counter. This is a definite improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the powder itself? Went on very smooth over my foundation, and I didn&#x27;t get as much flaky dryness picking up afterwards like the other product. I&#x27;m not terribly oily skinned, but the foundation always feels a bit shiny and this helped to keep that feeling down for me. I did reapply it after a few hours, so as another reviewer noted this might not be an all-day type of twelve hour coverage kind of product. The coverage is good, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face like I&#x27;m wearing war paint or something :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good product for its price range, and one I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product, if not the best I&#x27;ve tried.  It has good wear,  but it definitely does not last 16 hours.  I do have oily skin though,  so maybe it&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel of this powder. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling soft.  It does not feel like I am wearing make up it is so light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the applicator sponge as I can get solid coverage and blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shade seems darker than what I an used to using though (&amp; I use loreal products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good powder that feels and looks good,  even though you will need to reapply often.</li>
    <li> For past few years I was using L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Natural Mineral Foundation and always loved it, it is perfect for me. Recently Amazon Vine offered me Infallible Pro-Matte Powder in the same shade as my True Match one, and I thought why not to give it a try. So here is my review plus comparison:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It feels the same on my skin as L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Natural Mineral Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;2. Shades are exact same so that&#x27;s a relief.&lt;br /&gt;3. It comes with a sponge which is neatly tucked in it&#x27;s separate compartment, and is very easy to apply with.&lt;br /&gt;4. Spreads evenly on my face. I use sponge and brush both, and the results were same.&lt;br /&gt;5. The big PRO is that I can carry it in your purse as this is very compact while L&#x27;Oreal Paris True Match Natural Mineral Foundation comes in a size, not very convenient to carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product and will keep an extra in my purse for touch ups. I trust L&#x27;Oreal, they make quality products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of L&#x27;Oreal products for a long time. The Pro-Matte nude beige powder worked well with my skin type while also giving me a clean, smooth look. The powder does not cake even when hot weather causes sweating. Of course, we need to reapply after swimming or profusely sweating, but that is normal with any product such as this. I would definitely purchase this stylish and useful item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another part of this product that I thoroughly enjoy is the way it is packaged. The powder is on one side of the plastic case, and when you turn the case over, there is another case that has a mirror and holds the powder puff. The case if very attractive and both sides have clear tops so that you can quickly see which side you need next - the powder or the puff/mirror. The size is perfect for any size purse, even a small evening clutch.</li>
    <li> I used this both on it&#x27;s own and over a foundation.  On it&#x27;s own, I didn&#x27;t feel like it gave very much coverage like a foundation powder like BareMinerals would.  Over another foundation, I liked it a lot.  It gave my skin a nice, matte finish that lasted for hours.  For a less expensive makeup, I really like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a light hand with powders so keep that in mind when I say that I got good results from this L&#x27;Oreal Nude Beige Pro-Matte Powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sponge applied product that I found to be a good match for my winter complexion.  It went smoothly over foundation and I&#x27;ve even worn it all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over foundation it acted to set the liquid I use and gave it a matte finish.  Alone it acted to provide just a little bit of coverage, just enough to hide red spots and a tiny broken vein that I have near my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was that the container isn&#x27;t very sturdy.  And although this is a nicely sized compact with a great mirror design, I wouldn&#x27;t carry it in my bag because I&#x27;m pretty sure it wouldn&#x27;t hold up to being rattled around.</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte powder is great. I don&#x27;t have a problem with oily or dry skin, except on and around my nose and sometimes my forehead.  Using foundation alone sometimes left those area kind of shiny, especially later in the day.  I now apply the Infallible Pro-Matte powder over my foundation and there is no shine.  The powder is super fine and goes on so smoothly, it&#x27;s almost like a cream.  It comes in an attractive compact with the top compartment containing the powder and the bottom containing a nice mirror and a makeup sponge.  I have applied it using a brush and the sponge and it goes on easily with either.  The compact is a nice size and fits easily into the small makeup bag I carry in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t last 16 hours, but it does last long enough to get through a workday.  If I plan to go out after work, then I touch it up.  It&#x27;s winter and my skin is drier when it&#x27;s cold so I am curious to see how this product works in hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this product over my air brush Sephora makeup.  I use a pore minimizer under that makeup and have been using a Bobbie Brown compact as well as a Body Shop compact during tthe day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sharing this with you because I am not using all L&#x27;Oreal products and perhaps that is why this isn&#x27;t working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s a perfect nude and goes with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It contains a sponge and a mirror which makes it perfect for applying&lt;br /&gt;3.  It&#x27;s well priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to keep my face oil free for 16 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Does not keep my face free of oil&lt;br /&gt;2.  My nose turns red (I have rosacea) within an hour&lt;br /&gt;3.  I think it&#x27;s led to my acne prone face breaking it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because for me, it didn&#x27;t work.  It may work for you though.  It&#x27;s a good concept, nice color and perhaps if you&#x27;re already using Loreal and have had good luck with it, it will work for you.</li>
    <li> When the wife viewed this product, she was very interested because she uses L&#x27;Oreal products of makeup and blush on her face.  Well, she is now SOLD on this Matte Finish Powder,...in fact, she said that it REALLY IS INFALLIBLE!  Her daily regimen is a moisturizer under the True Match, Shell Beige-C4 makeup, but by the end of the day her nose is too shiny, and the rest looks rather frayed and sweaty.  This Matte Finish Powder is amazing, because it does a perfect job of &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; her whole face to last all day.  The color Nude Beige is a perfect match.  The pressed powder goes on easily with the included sponge (dry), giving the face a beautiful texture, feeling smooth, and looking great!  Other powders seem to look feathery and clumpy, dry and dusty-looking, but the Infallible Pro-Matte Powder is just beautiful.  She will be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> I like the very matte look of makeup that young women sport these days but didn&#x27;t know how to do it myself. This powder does a great job of giving me that look. I layer it over [[ASIN:B00NQ2Y8IY Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Primer Skin Transformer]] and [[ASIN:B00BN7FDPQ BOOTS No. 7 Tinted Moisturiser]] and love the look. It&#x27;s smooth and provides good coverage. I&#x27;m not crazy about the packaging, though. The case is hard to open and it&#x27;s awkward trying to get the sponge from the bottom and the makeup from the top.  It’s a juggling act. I wish design committees tested their own products!</li>
    <li> Although \\&quot;nude beige\\&quot; seems oxymoronic, I find L&#x27;OREAL&#x27;s Pro-Matte Powder an effective cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;It nicely minimizes the appearance of minor blemishes, softens the appearance&lt;br /&gt;and is odorless and non-caking, both pluses in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quite small dual-hinged case is cleverly designed so the applicator rests not on the powder&lt;br /&gt;but on the unit&#x27;s mirror, which is completely separate from the cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this very much, thanks!</li>
    <li> Picked this up for my wife and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was long-lasting and easy to apply, blending perfectly with her skin tone.  She also says it was great for combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said it&#x27;s worth the extra money for this one and now she&#x27;s asking me to buy her more.</li>
    <li> I would like it to have lasted a bit longer. It was easy to apply but you would need to use cover-up of some type first if you have any blemishes. The color was a bit dark for me. I like how it felt when on. Didn&#x27;t bother me in any way. The first few times you use it, it&#x27;s a little hard getting enough on the sponge to apply. Once the sponge has some on it, it gets easier. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a moderately priced face powder that will work to absorb oil on your face thus reducing shine.  The company says the powder can last for up to sixteen hours but personally I find that very optimistic.  It can be used over foundation to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it though actually I am not using a foundation right now.  The powder comes in a small (.31 ounce container) and a sponge applicator and mirror are included and there is nifty second little container that snaps open below the powder where the mirror and the storage for the applicator are located.  I&#x27;ve bought  L&#x27;Oreal beauty products from time to time over the years and have always been reasonably satisfied with them as they seem to give good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using mineral powder foundation when I put my makeup on in the morning, but I like compacts like this one to carry in my purse for touch-ups throughout the day or after exercise.&lt;br /&gt;This powder goes on smoothly and takes away shine.  I was pleased with the coverage it provided.  It doesn&#x27;t last 16 hours but it definitely lasts a few hours, more in dry weather and less in warmer weather.  It is nice having the sponge in a separate compartment in the back, so that it does not touch the powder.  I did find it odd that the mirror is in the sponge side of the compact and not with the powder, so you have to keep flipping the compact back and forth to get more powder and then look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this, it seems like a good product for the money and it&#x27;s perfect to carry with me in my bag during the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetics junkie so I was excited to try this out.  I also really had no idea what to expect since it&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics.  Typically I&#x27;ve tended to gravitate towards department store boutique brands because I&#x27;m terrible at finding the right shade without actually trying something on my skin.  Because of this, I rolled the dice when selection this in the Nude Beige shade.  Looking at the color chart and reading the information on the company website it SEEMED like the right color (I have fair skin that burns easily and that is more yellow), but I really had no idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully this shade seems to match my skin well.  I first applied my Laura Mercier oil free primer on my skin, followed by Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer in Nude.  I also used concealer underneath my eyes and to better camouflage acne scars.  Then I swept this on my face with a face brush.  Thankfully the color seems to look great on me.  It seemed very similar to the hue of my tinted moisturizer.  I thought the shade complimented my skin well.  I also like that it gave me a bit more coverage to help even out my skin tone and make my skin look better without giving me an overly powdery or made up look.  (Some of this I think has to do with opting for a brush rather than the included applicator.)  I also thought it did a nice job of giving my skin a more matte finish without taking it too far and again, making me look powdery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that like most face powders I&#x27;ve tried it does make my skin feel a bit itchy and I have to resist the urge to scratch right after application, but thankfully this seems to go away with wear.  I think I&#x27;d still prefer a translucent powder for instances when I&#x27;m already using a foundation with more coverage, but a tinted powder is nice when I have tinted moisturizer underneath.  Other than the slight itchiness at first it feels lightweight on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a longevity standpoint, its important to note that the sixteen hours refers to how long it is supposed to absorb excess oil and reduce shin, not how long it makes your makeup last.  The website description does mention that you can use this to set your makeup.  My skin is on the dry side so absorbing excess oil and reducing shine isn&#x27;t a huge deal for me, but I can see where if your skin is naturally oily this would be a benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth noting that Talc is one of the first ingredients in this powder.  I mention this because I know it is an ingredient some people seek to avoid in their cosmetics.  I will admit I didn&#x27;t have much familiarity with it as an ingredient until recently and personally, have found that the studies about the kind of Talc that is in cosmetics to be inconclusive.  Obviously Talc that contains asbestos is dangerous, but everything I have read is that cosmetic-grade Talc is asbestos-free.  So for cosmetic-grade Talc, I haven&#x27;t yet made up my mind about whether or not it is something I will seek to avoid.  (Though admittedly I don&#x27;t pay as much attention to ingredients in cosmetics as I probably should.  I always ditch products my skin responds to negatively, but it isn&#x27;t always easy for me to know what specific ingredients to avoid.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I like this product over a tinted moisturizer.  I appreciate the extra coverage it gives me and the ability to set my makeup.  I think I still need to use it longer to ensure it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, but will update my review if that is the case.</li>
    <li> The good news about having had oily skin since 6th grade is that when you&#x27;re 50+ your skin can look surprisingly young. All that moisture. The bad news: you often have a shiny nose. I always carry a compact of pressed powder for touch-ups, so I was curious to try this product. As far as its promise of keeping skin oil-free for 16 hours: baloney, though I doubt any powder could absorb oil for that long. My bigger concern is packaging. First, it&#x27;s brazen branding is tacky, with type all over the front hyping the product. Even at this price-point L&#x27;Oreal could have created a simpler, more elegant design that a woman wouldn&#x27;t mind having in hand for a quick blot. Second, the construction of the compact looks as if it will fall apart the first time it&#x27;s dropped on the floor by accident, though I like its clever construction--the pressed powder is in a top section, above a separate section with a big mirror and nest for a sponge applicator that&#x27;s easy to wash and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressed powder is excellent</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m not much of a make-up wearer.  I&#x27;m fair skinned with lots of freckles, and nothing I do seems to look right when I experiment with make-up.  I&#x27;ve been using Pur Minerals for a few years now when I do wear make-up, and I like the coverage but don&#x27;t care for the powder look.  I&#x27;ve tried compacts like this before, and they just left my face feeling greasy.  This one doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It&#x27;s light weight and feels about the same as the minerals powder.  It actually looks pretty decent - a bit of coverage for my freckles without making me look like I painted on a mask. I haven&#x27;t had issues with breaking out or irritation with it, so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me.  As I said, I&#x27;m fair skinned with freckles, and nude beige is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased and will definitely get this again.</li>
    <li> My wife writes:&lt;br /&gt;This excellent powder fits my needs perfectly. It was not splotchy and did not accentuate the pores of my skin.  Also worked well over a foundation. As someone with sensitive and somewhat dry skin, I did not experience any skin irritation when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I hope that this product is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I love how this smooths out my complexion.  My skin looks bright and pretty when I use this. This works wonderfully to keep my face looking freshly made up but also only lightly covered with make up.  I don&#x27;t need to use much to get a great and even look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matte finish is good for me as I dislike my face looking shiny and or/greasy.  My face is naturally on the oily side and this helps to keep the shine down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the container this comes in.  There is a separate place for the sponge along with a nice size mirror, which is useful to use for touch ups during the day.</li>
    <li> I have long liked L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s products, but I really didn&#x27;t think that there was much difference when it came to most &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; pressed powders. Boy, was I wrong. This product reminds me a lot of the Clinique Superpowder Double Face Make-up I used years ago in high school and college only it is much better and half the price. This is great. It gives a great matte finish, lasts all day, and feels like silk going on. My only beef: the cheap packaging in comes in. Usually, the packaging does not matter to me, but this one cracked when I was opening it. It&#x27;s very thin, cheap plastic and I fear it will break in my purse or just from daily use. I do wish it was different, but it will not stop me from buying this product once my Vine freebie runs out. I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I received this in the nude beige color and it&#x27;s a great tone for me.  It will be good on just about any of the beige shade tones I believe.  It provides a nice thick (but not cakey thick) coverage that lasts on my face.  I have a face on which makeup just won&#x27;t stay so I was pleasantly surprised when I looked in the mirror hours after applying this and it was still there.  It comes with a sponge that sits in the compartment under the powder and there is also a mirror in the separate compartment.  I like this product and thick it is a good powder, and very good for a drug store powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I just wanted to add that I really love this powder because it even out then skin tone so well without going on too thick. It also stays on so well and the color is perfect.  I will actually stick with and purchase this powder from now on.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good pressed powder and am so glad I tried this.</li>
    <li> I like this product more than BB or CC Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, L&#x27;oreal Infallible Pro-Matte Powder evens out my complexion with complete coverage.  I&#x27;ve lost a lot of pigment, due to Vitiligo but also have areas of pink.  L&#x27;Oreal Nude is natural,  even coverage for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a sponge and mirror on one side of the compact  and the powder on the other.  A light swipe is all I need of the oil free powder.  It lasts all day - for me over 12 hours - without settling into wrinkles.  Actually, my wrinkles are less apparent - yay!  My skin is soft and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE Infallible Pro-Matte : )</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to like this... she didn&#x27;t, First, it didn&#x27;t cover very well. Second, if used as a foundation, it had so much firming agent that it was terribly uncomfortable, and both times she tried it she had to take it off. Third -- and this is my complaint -- it didn&#x27;t smell very nice. When a woman is wearing makeup it shouldn&#x27;t overpower you -- this stuff does. The smell is very strong, and not pleasant at all. So her advice and mine -- find some other makeup. Forget this stuff.</li>
    <li> For quite some time I have been purchasing expensive face powders in hopes that I will find the \\&quot;perfect one\\&quot;.  I have switched from powder to cream because I felt they are more lightweight.  After trying this product, I became convinced that one does not need expensive face powder from department stores, that L&#x27;Oreal has brought a fantastic product at affordable prices to the mass market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply powder to my face for the main reason that I have combination skin and as soon as it is mid-day, my face starts shining from oil.  This product provides soft application pad that is non-abrasive and puffy.  Powder will not splash all over your clothes.  Nude Beige color matches my skin color perfectly.  Face does not look artificaial or \\&quot;caked\\&quot;; product adds look and feel of flawless skin.  And then the best part is that the product does stay on for 16 hours.  It does not smudge at all.  In the evening it is easy to take off with makeup remover or cleanser.  I have been using it for 3 weeks now and I have not noticed it clogging the pores which is also very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have finally found good matte face powder.  It was about time!</li>
    <li> the best I have used for a while makes one feel so much better with softer skin and way less oil  stays on till I remove it. everyone tells me they like my makeup. The shade is perfect and I am happy I found the makeup. One needs to look good at 66</li>
    <li> This works well for me. My skin is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (not too dry or oily) with a slight olive tone. The color looks good and it has a definite matte finish that lasts a long time. I am not crazy about the case. I don&#x27;t like having to open two sections to get use the product. I don&#x27;t like how the bottom is clear so that you can see the used side of the spongy applicator when you pull it out of your purse. If you flip the sponge, then the side with the make up gets on the mirror. I just think it&#x27;s ugly to see the &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; side of the sponge, but the product does work well.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife.  She tends to have sensitive skin so thought the oil free part of this might work well for her.  Well, unfortunately, not only did it not keep her oil free, it also broke her face out.  Being that it doesn&#x27;t follow through with one of its main selling points, I can&#x27;t get behind this product.</li>
    <li> Background: I&#x27;m one of those girls who doesn&#x27;t wear full makeup on a  regular basis. When I do, though, I wear Maybelline or Cover Girl liquid-powder makeup as a foundation, then regular powder on top. The rest of the time, I wear neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some different brands, so when this came through on Amazon Vine, I jumped at it. So glad I did. It&#x27;s very nice over the liquid-powder makeup, but what I really like is that it&#x27;s great on its own. Yeah, I have to admit, I&#x27;m at that point where I need *something* on the days I normally wear no makeup at all. This has been perfect. Not heavy, but covers well. The color looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is having to open a separate compartment to get the applicator pad. And the mirror is with that as well, so putting on the powder when you don&#x27;t have a large mirror would be difficult as you&#x27;d have to keep going back and forth between compartments. Still, five stars because I like the product itself so much.</li>
