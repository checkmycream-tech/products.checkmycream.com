<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Color is natural. The smell is not the greatest, its a mix of melon and the self tanner smell. Sometimes it seems like it needs more then 6hrs to develop. Overall, its a great product. I recommend</li>
    <li> As long as you follow the directions for application, this lotion works great. Gives good color. Be careful, if you use it more than 2 days in a row, you&#x27;ll start to look a little orange</li>
    <li> This cream does give a subtle glow, but not much of a \\&quot;tan.\\&quot; It really doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, but you have to rub it in fairly quickly before it disappears. Not bad for the price, but doesn&#x27;t exactly make you as tan looking as I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this product months ago and discontinued using it after I showered and exfoliated at night because of the smell.  I dunno, some people don&#x27;t mind it, but my nose is really sensitive to scents and it felt like being enveloped in tacky cheap perfume smell all night long!  Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I broke it out again because it&#x27;s that time of year again and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else that is this natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to apply it in the morning after a shower, wore it all day, and the smell did not bother me at all!  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for a month now and it hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all any more.  Just shower, put the lotion on, and then wait a few min to dress.  Maybe the extra clothing gives enough of a barrier that it doesn&#x27;t bother my nose and moving around gets the smell to evaporate more quickly.  Have had no problems with it staining my clothes.</li>
    <li> Safe:&lt;br /&gt;After learning of the harmful/toxic ingredients found in most sunless tanners I discovered Caribbean Solutions on the Environmental Working Group’s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild odor:&lt;br /&gt;While the product is not completely scent-less, is does not make you smell like “fake bacon.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast acting:&lt;br /&gt;Goes on invisibly; take care around knees, elbows, and ankles.  I was amazed by the amount of color I saw within hours of application.  I use it every other day, as recommended, and every morning on my face as I exfoliate daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stains Nails:&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to wash hands and clean under nails after application.  I went to Sally’s Beauty Supply and purchased a 79 cent nail brush – problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, it develops into this beautiful medium colored bronze that lasts longer than most. The lotion has a pleasant tropical smell. I only wish is came in an 8oz or 9oz bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the only self-tanner I will ever use on my skin. It&#x27;s chemical free and it gives the most natural looking color. It is very gradual so you can make it darker if you want but I typically find that one application is the exact color I need. The only area I have issues with it looking even semi orange (not really but slightly) is on my hand and nails if I don&#x27;t clean them well enough afterwards. I try to use a babywipes to get in all the dry skin areas of my hands and nails but I have missed a few a time or two. You can hardly notice it but I know it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not that bad. All tanners have a smell and this one is the best I have ever used and I have used a TON! It&#x27;s better than the lacome tanner smell in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest win on this is that I know it is not harmful to my body, all organic and clean. I hope they never stop selling this product.</li>
    <li> This is as good as it gets for a self tanner. I use it after bathing as a moisturizing cream and by morning my legs are a nice glowing bronze.  If I use it twice a day for a couple days I get a tan that will stay for several days. The only downside is that it is very temporary, lasting 3-4 days at the most. Everything else is 5 stars, no unpleasant odor, easy to apply, never any streaking and no harmful ingredients. One last word of caution, this is NOT a bronzer, it takes several hours (overnight) for the color to develop.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on a product, but this self tanner motivated me to do so.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how it stacks up for me:&lt;br /&gt;1. Great natural-looking color (none of that jaundice-y I-just-dunked-myself-in-Dijon-mustard look). I also like the even quality of the color. Of course you still have to watch not overindulging on elbows, knees, knuckles, etc. unless you like accenting those features excessively.. but that goes with pretty much any self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;2. Even some of the chemical tanners I used in the past didn&#x27;t do a good job on my legs, for some reason they never had the same intensity of color that I got on my arms. This product made my legs look like they did when I was a kid during the summer- brown as a beary!&lt;br /&gt;3. Ingredients are pronounceable (which in my opinion means safer- check out the ratings on the EWG website as other reviewers pointed out). Although it may not be 100% pristine, this is about as close as it gets, and you can rest assured that you&#x27;re not dousing your skin in diesel fuel.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;m not sure why some of the reviewers thought that this stuff smells bad. It smells floral/gardenia-ish when you put it on, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. There is that slight \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; smell the next day though, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;4. Price.. well compared to some of the other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; bronzers and self tanners out there, this one is cheap considering how long this size lasts (mine will probably hold out for several months and I use it about 3x a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a healthy alternative to petroleum-based tanners and baking like a chicken outside or in a tanning bed, this is THE one to try!</li>
    <li> I have to agree wholeheartedly agree with all of the 5 star reviews left so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another customer who purchased this product after a search through EWG I am thrilled with the result. I&#x27;m red-headed and very fair skinned and burn easily because of it. I grew up in the Arizona desert and had become acclimated to the light quality there. After moving to the Denver area I was shocked by the change the altitude made and how I react to sun exposure. Where I used to get a little warmth to my skin tone after short periods of time, and could stave off burning with judicious use of sun screen, here I start to burn after 15 minutes in direct sun - requiring daily, constant sunscreen application and cover. (And it&#x27;s not a burn that tans underneath.) I&#x27;ve taken to covering up entirely and avoiding the sun whenever possible and constantly wearing sunscreen. (Which I should do anyway, but I can&#x27;t even seem to BBQ in the back yard for dinner without getting pink. It&#x27;s annoying.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is I&#x27;m super pale, and it doesn&#x27;t really look like a healthy pale, I look pretty sickly most days. I have been hoping to find a way to get just a little color, but my history with self-tanners has left me looking like a pumpkin. I was thrilled to see all the positive reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first application was this morning and eight hours later I&#x27;m totally excited. I&#x27;ve got just the slightest bit of warmth going on in my skin tone. It spread evenly and easily from my finger tips to my toes, and while I do echo the sentiments about the smell (strong, generic floral scent) and how it lingers, it&#x27;s not nearly enough to make me consider not using it. If you use primarily unscented products it&#x27;s going to be pretty shocking for you, and if you&#x27;re accustomed to natural scents (i.e. essential oils) it&#x27;s going to make you wrinkle your nose. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, though. Just really strong.(More pleasant than raw shea butter, more annoying because it *lingers*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do make sure you take the time to get it spread evenly; I do have a few streaky spots, mostly on the backs of my hands where I know I wasn&#x27;t as careful. I&#x27;m positive they&#x27;ll disappear when I apply the second coat tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color came through slowly, it&#x27;s subtle and not at all orange. I now know I need to apply more to my legs than to my arms, and I can probably use more in general for a darker tone right off, but a little does go a long way if you want just a little color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite product.</li>
    <li> Love it! If I apply it every other day I can maintain a natural looking tan. It&#x27;s a small container, but a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This really works!  I apply it lightly after a shower before bed.  Has a slight odor that is gone by morning.  I am so pasty white that it took 2 days of application and everyone commented on my tan (which I never get) and it lasted about 2 days before needing to reapply.  Careful on feet if you put it on then use peppermint foot lotion it makes the tanner run and if you have your feet in sandals that sweat at all the combination of that with foot lotion will leave obvious self tanner marks.  So I wait a full 24 hours after applying before using foot lotion this seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> I found this product after going to EWG&#x27;s website.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I have used MANY other self tanners that disappointed me.  But, I can say I am pleasantly surprised!! In addition to the \\&quot;O\\&quot; rating from EWG&#x27;s website, I had a natural looking bronze color after just one application!!! The scent is pleasant and the next day I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;self tanner\\&quot; smell. This is a keeper as far as I am concerned!!!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 2 years now and love the natural color it creates. Gets a good score from EWG so I feel good knowing its non-toxic. I have to feel confident about anything I&#x27;m putting all over my body. After all, skin is the body&#x27;s largest organ and you know you&#x27;re going to absorb this stuff.  Here&#x27;s the EWG review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I love that this works with natural plant DHA instead of harsh chemicals.  It takes one or two more applications to get the same tan that I get from the store brands, but it&#x27;s worth it for the peace of mind.  It smells better, but does still have that \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; smell after it sits on your skin for a while, so I used it at night.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best self tanning cream I have ever used and it is amazing that it is organic also! The effects last much longer and are more even than any self tanner I have used, including Aveeno and Clinique brands. As always with self tanner, you want to be careful to wash your hands after and to not use too much on your knees/elbows. I think they must have changed the formulation since some reviews, as the smell is light and pleasant, another positive over other self tanners. I am always a little wary of using self tanner on my face, but this gave me a nice seamless glow, with non of the orange tan in a can look. I am a somewhat tan person naturally, so it is possible that results may be different for someone with much fairer natural skin.</li>
    <li> Well, took forever to rub it in &amp; it really didn&#x27;t jive w/my skin color.  I&#x27;m fair skinned but a bit olive... Yep- really brought out the yellow.  Alot of people love this so for many skin types I&#x27;m sure its fine but not for mine.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to have found Caribbean Solutions Natural Beach Colours which received a very high rating for safety and quality.  The natural ingredients were very important to me.  I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and it&#x27;s not easy to find a self tanner with such high rating for safety while at the same time providing a great natural looking tan without any undesirable offensive odor.  I have light olive complexion, and I get a great natural, beautiful looking tan in a short amount of time. Oh, and one more thing...it also leaves your skin feeling nice and soft. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a self tanner that is chemical free while providing outstanding results!</li>
    <li> I have very light skin, and this product worked very well to give me a natural looking tan, but the problem is that although there isn&#x27;t a fragrance to the product when it is in the jar, this funky smell begins to reveal it&#x27;s self as the hours pass.  I have used it twice, but even after applying it in the morning and washing my legs twice with soap by the evening, it still did not take away all of the smell and it gets in your bedding and clothes.  I have a sensitive nose, so I hope I am the only one who could smell it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  No odor and the tan is a great color</li>
    <li> I have tried every self tanner on the market.  I have purchased drug store to very expensive.  This is by far at the best self tanner that I have ever used.  The color is very natural and after only two applications I look like I have been on vacation.  I find the smell kind of nice.  I guess it must be about body chemistry because I am not experiencing  the odor issues that a few others complain about.  Most of my lotions and creams are organic so I am accustomed to no smell or an unpleasant smell from organic products.  I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> A chemical free tanner that really works. I&#x27;m fair but can add to my color by applying for several days, or keep a lighter color by doing every other day. Even and natural look.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner. It smells really great and leaves a natural looking tan. I like it mostly for the fact that it contains no chemicals!!</li>
    <li> The most harmless self tanner that i know of (ingredients wise).  it has 7 or 8 simple ingredients and the product smells really good.  it doenst give as much color right away as some of the other brands and needs more applicatoins to get the color i want but its worth knowing its not nearly as toxic.  the color is pretty natural, not too orange.  it could stain white clothes so be careful with that.</li>
    <li> It arrived with the container broken on the bottom( one small spot ) and you can see that the product is ok,because it&#x27;s a double lined jar. I used it today and I can see the difference already.</li>
    <li> I chose it because this is the most \\&quot;innocent\\&quot; selftanner according to [...].  It only consists of 7 ingredients, so I was worried for the results and didn&#x27;t expect it to be as sufficient as other high brand selftanners with a long list of chemicals, I had used for several years. Great light formula, non leaving color in clothing after 5 minutes of application. Got me a great color - non orange - in just 2 days and I keep using it to maintain this color. Highly recommended product !!!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  There is no real odor, a big plus in tanners.  The consistency works well with blending onto the skin or with lotions.  As others have noted it would be great if it was in a pump form for dispensing but I can work with the jar method too.</li>
    <li> Its natural and by instructions I used it 2 days and 2 rest and a great natural color occurred. Hands and nails have to be washed very good so u don&#x27;t wake up with yellow nails. Would recommend as u get beautiful color and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> While the product does have a stronger smell to it as the other reviews stated, it isn&#x27;t too intolerable. I used it once and woke up with a noticeable glow that was complimented by friends and noticed by classmates as well! i love this tanning product and will continue purchasing it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: A little goes a long way, and be sure to mix in with lotion in drier areas and to also make it last longer as it is a very thick paste and will be used up in about 10-12 uses I think.</li>
    <li> I was about to officially terminate my (attempted) relationships with self-tanners after the last one left me all streaky - again. I set out to find one that:    -was all natural / chemical free  -didn&#x27;t smell  -didn&#x27;t stain my clothes  -looked natural  -didn&#x27;t cost a fortune    A tall order, for sure.  I found this one and although I never heard of the company, the reviews convinced me to try it - there wasn&#x27;t a bad experience among them.     This is the BEST product I have ever used.  It really seems too good to be true.  It is SO easy to use - no color, no stink (although it was a light rose -like smell), no staining, no streaks, no breakouts (yes, you can use it on your face, too!).  Everyone is totally shocked when I tell them my tan isn&#x27;t \\&quot;real\\&quot;.  It looks natural and is totally hassle-free, not to mention you&#x27;re not putting nasty toxins on your skin.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and I will continue to purchase it.  It was the best $14 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time - bring on summer!!</li>
    <li> great product. natural. smells a bit at first but it goes away fast. never looking for another one again. satisfied.</li>
    <li> I found this while pregnant and continued to use while breastfeeding and now all the time. I originally was looking for something safe to use without all the chemicals and found it on the skin deep website. It had the best rating. I have to say it is the best self tanner I have ever used and I have used all the drug store kind and more expensive kinds as well. My husband hated the smell of the others but this one smells a little better-more like flowers than chemicals. Still a strong smell but at least it smells good. It goes on even. I&#x27;ve never had streaks or blotchy marks ever. The color is not &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; but natural looking. I apply a heavy thick lotion like Eucerin dry skin therapy(the thick white cream thst comes in a tub) to feet and hands and then apply the tanner. And then wash my hands when done. It has always worked really well that way for me. If there is any negative and I wouldn&#x27;t even consider it a negative because it works well I would say that it does take a bit to rub it in to skin. It stays white on skin for a min or two. But I actually think it is a good thing so you can really see where it is going and feel where you may have missed a spot. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I am not usually one to write bad product reviews. And this is not a bad product, really. It does what everyone says it does - turns you tan without turning you yellow. And it goes on well and smooths in just fine. What&#x27;s my beef? The SMELL is VERY off-putting - enough so that it outweighs the benefits of using it. Now, I know that everyone perceives odors differently - so it may not bother you. But to me, it&#x27;s an all-pervasive, overwhelming smell of very cheap toiletries - and it takes a LONG time to go away. I&#x27;ve used this cream twice, trying to get used to it. I think I&#x27;ll switch back to my other self-tanner - maybe not as healthy or natural, but at least it doesn&#x27;t stink. And this cream does. Make sure if you do use it, that you let it sit for a few minutes to dry before you put on any article of clothing, because the smell gets into anything it touches. I always thought that people who complained about the way things smell were oversensitive - well, I guess I&#x27;m oversensitive now!!!! Four stars for doing a good job, minus 3 stars for the smell. That leaves 1 star -  and while I don&#x27;t hate it, I do dislike it enough that I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Great Self Tanner! This product gives a great color, it is not greasy and is quick to use. It is the only self tanner I will use and I am lucky I found it!</li>
    <li> unfortunately it&#x27;s color is a little off, i really love everything else about it. it smells great and has healthier ingredients compared to the alternatives out there. maybe i&#x27;m just too pale, and it would work well on someone who has a little color to begin with.</li>
    <li> Okay, day 2 (in a row).  This stuff has worked, more golden to me than &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; look but told it looks good.  Palms are definitely orange, will work on that later.  Cream is white and runny, goes on well and not much of a scent.  However, it begins to smell later and though it isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s not good either.  It smells bitter or sour.  Not too strong, but doesn&#x27;t wash off right away.  Hoping this lasts a bit.  Wanted a base tan before going to Cancun and running out of time to do it naturally.  Hoping this will be the bootstrap to a decent tan instead of burning right away on my trip. I used on my whole body, face included and no burning in my eyes.  I put on at night and slept with it on and washed off in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is a review of three comparable products: Jergens Natural Glow - 3 Days to Glow Moisturizer Medium to Tan Skin,True Natural: All Natural Self Tanner Face &amp; Body, and Caribbean Solutions Beach Colors Natural Self Tanner. I have been using the Jergen&#x27;s product for years, but have been reading too much about the toxicity of the ingredients. I used several sites to research this, and found EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep to be most helpful. So I narrowed them down, and tried True Natural and Caribbean Solutions. I have been using the latter two for about a month now, and here is my findings.&lt;br /&gt;Jergens: Pros - It is the darkest color, two applications and you can really tell the difference. Cons -- Very potent odor. Smells your clothes and everything it touches, with the smell lingering for days. My family can&#x27;t stand the smell. It dyes fabrics that it comes into contact with, like sheets, even multiple hours after application. Hard to get the last part out of the tube. Apply too much and color goes to orange. Aforementioned toxicity fears.&lt;br /&gt;True Natural. Pros - very good color, not as dark as Jergens, but not as orange. Odor is not potent. Low toxicity and cancer concerns. Cons: Doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, have to really rub it in. Container is not the easiest to use, but better than Jergens.&lt;br /&gt;Caribbean Solutions. Pros - Mild odor. By far, the easiest to apply. Low toxicity and cancer concerns. Smooth. Decent color -- not orange. Can apply any time. Cons: Color is the lightest of the three, but still makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: I probably will use all three -- with Jergens use the least frequent. Maybe an application every other day for the first couple of days a month to get some rich color, and then touch up the rest of the month with the other two. I will not use Jergens more than that because of the toxicity, smell and mess. I imagine Caribbean Solutions will be used most frequently, because the color is almost as good as True Natural, and it is byfar the easiest to use. Really simple to use every two or three days: you don&#x27;t have to figure out a good time when you won&#x27;t stain anything, or be around other people to offend with the smell, or soil your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, with them all, you have to wash your palms really well after using so they don&#x27;t get the color.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  After 2 applications  I think I look a bit orange and my feet look dirty.  I exfoliated with a good scrub  and moisturized prior to application both times. I&#x27;ll see how I look little later and edit my review accordingly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent! I love it! It goes on super smooth and dries very quickly, just like any regular lotion.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a WHILE for a good quality, NON-toxic, NON-irritating self-tanner and I&#x27;ve finally found it.  I love that the DHA is from beets, and is a much healthier option.  I noticed an entire shade darker of skin within hours, literally.  It works great!  Unfortunately though, there is a strong &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell for the rest of the day/night until you shower next, so don&#x27;t put this on before an important day or date!  It is sort of an embarrassing smell..&lt;br /&gt;But that aside, it&#x27;s my new favorite self-tanner! So happy.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, especially the ingredients. But being middle eastern, my skin is already a light olive/yellow color, and this cream didn&#x27;t give me much color. I didn&#x27;t get any streaks... but then again it&#x27;s hard to streak when it&#x27;s the same color as your skin already! I would recommend it if you consider yourself to be pretty pale, because it&#x27;s not as damaging as other chemical-filled tanners, and the container lasts a long time. Would buy again if it made me darker!</li>
    <li> The best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used; seriously. Not streaky or orange, at all. I was skeptical b/c its a white cream, but it does the job and looks natural. I apply it for 2 days then skip 1 &amp; repeat that.. it seems to be working. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was the closest all natural self tanner I could find being pregnant. I used it only on my legs &amp; it is awesome. I applied after shower, just one thin layer and had a very nice light bronze sheen the next morning.</li>
    <li> This Self Tanner is the best I have ever used. I have 2 daughters in their 20&#x27;s who are also now users of this tanner exclusively. We have tried lots of them and this is now the only one we use. It smooths on easily like a lotion, doesn&#x27;t have a yukky smell like so many self tanners do, creates a lovely natural looking tan, doesn&#x27;t streak, and best of all --has an excellent rating from EWG (environmental working group site) because it is natural and completely non toxic for your body. Our skin is our biggest organ and it absorbs the chemicals into our system. Wonderful to not only have a fabulous product, but have one which we can feel comfortable with for our health.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is one of the nicest I&#x27;ve used for color, but I won&#x27;t continue to use it. It has a golden, even, color but, the cream is such a weird consistency that seems to sit on top of the skin as opposed to absorbing. It takes a long time to dry and the melon smell, while nice, gets to be overpowering for my taste. I thought Carribean Solutions was expensive, but I&#x27;ve started using Chocolate Sun (which is $40!) but, it&#x27;s much better in my opinion - dries quickly, absorbs well, great color, smells like cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the smell of Carribean Solutions Kukui Body Silk, a bit like a tropical pikake scent. If the self tanner came in that choice I would probably use it. :-)</li>
    <li> This is the best self-tanner I have ever used!  I would give it 5 stars if the smell was lighter - it&#x27;s not a bad smell, just strong like most suntan products.  I am horrible at applying lotion/creme tanners...with this product, I don&#x27;t have a problem and the results look natural.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t contain all the horrible ingredients most other tanning products contain.</li>
    <li> I used to buy another high end brand that was twice the price.  This stuff is pretty awesome.  The color looks great, nice and dark not at all orange.  I was impressed most of all that it doesn&#x27;t stink like most tanners do after it&#x27;s been on your skin awhile.  It&#x27;s kind of a werid container tho but I really shouldn&#x27;t complain.  My new fave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super white (I buy the whitest make-up you can buy) with freckles and after 2 applications I have no streaks and a slight color to my skin. I like that it&#x27;s gradual so that I can add more if I want, and the smell is not too bad at all. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale and its hard for me to get a tan. All I do is burn. I used this product for a few days and it made my skin look amazing. I had a nice tan. But then I started noticing that I had an orange tint like a spray tan. I thought maybe I needed to keep applying it to make it look good. Nope. I looked like an Oompa Loompa. Not my style. This product was good for a week. Not so much anymore. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll be forever pale.</li>
    <li> I resisted self tanners for the longest time .. I used one that claimed to be low or non toxic and it was pretty nice, but it was a spray and a pain. I saw this on EWG and since I do avoid tanning anymore, I have been using this on my legs... it is a thick white cream and very luscious! I used a tablespoon amount , rub hands together, and then equally massage it onto calves, then another tablespoon size dab for thighs. This covers both front and back. Its white so you can see it where you are applying it. Make sure to glide some onto your feet, I made the mistake of NOT, and had tans legs white feet, as if I was wearing sneakers and tanned.  I am very fair and it gives a lovely natural even tan look!  Very little scent except for the next day - its that &amp;#34; self tanner&amp;#34; scent, which actually I dont mind.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great results, low toxicity, moisturizing !!! I love it! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For a natural product this stuff really works! Also the updated formula doesn&#x27;t have any added scent anymore just the standard smell from tanning lotions.  I love that I can use this (takes about 2-3 coats) to get rid of my pasty legs in summer without worrying about getting skin cancer from real tanning, or getting cancer from the self tanner either (it scored the best score on the environmental working groups toxicity scale!).  Its even so good that my boyfriend uses it on his shoulders to get rid of his shirt tan come summer... you know is good when other people start sneaking off with it ;-Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion- it is natural and goes on without streaking.  Provides a great glow without too much fuss. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Just be careful with application as it has no tint to guide you.</li>
    <li> I adore this self tanner! It looks great and has quality ingredients that meet cosmetic safety data standards.</li>
    <li> Gives me a nice brown tone in just a few hours :)  Yes you still have that self-tanner smell but the smell fades after about a day and the tan goes on and on</li>
    <li> This stuff gives such a natural color and is easy to apply. There is hardly any smell after it is applied. I like to add to my other lotion for maintaining my glow without getting too dark. I will definitely buy again and again and again!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, when I was searching for non toxic tanners, this came up. The reviews were good, decent price. I was hesitant, because I&#x27;ve noticed lots of beauty products on amazon with good reviews seem to be giving out their product free for &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; good reviews. But, it&#x27;s getting warm out after all and I really try avoiding toxins, so what the heck. I bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let me tell you, I&#x27;m so glad that I did! Some reviews talk about some terrible perfume smell- I didn&#x27;t notice that at all. After it&#x27;s on your skin a few hours, you do get a very slight self tanner smell as you do with all sunless tanners (I detest that smell, but with this cream it is the mildest I&#x27;ve ever had. Very faint) The cream is thick, you don&#x27;t need much. I&#x27;m very picky about lotions, and it&#x27;s heavy like body butter (butters make me feel a little sticky) so I put it in before bed so I don&#x27;t have to think about it. I was excited the morning after my first use, when I woke up and saw a natural looking tan. It worked! It&#x27;s super easy to blend when applying. I am glad I gave this product a shot. It&#x27;s real you guys, it&#x27;s a great product that really works.</li>
    <li> Great color with one application. No typical self-tanner smell. I live the unfortunate combination of being pale in South Florida, so I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> Not dark enough. I put a thick coating on and waited.  Barely any color resulted.</li>
    <li> I have very pale skin. I have tried a bunch of self-tanning products. Either the color was off or the product was so chemical laden that I probably was way better off taking my chances with the real sun. I found this product on the Environmental Working Group SkinDeep site www.ewg.org/skindeep. I love it. I would compare it more to a Jergens type product. It took two applications before I looked tan, but the color is sooo natural. The lotion is thick, so it takes a little time to absorb. Totally worth it for the peace-of-mind that using a nontoxic product brings though.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many self tanners. Recently wanted to go more natural ingredients BC of chemicals in traditional STs. I can&#x27;t believe how awesome this stuff is!! I use coconut oil prior to application &amp; it seems to help in avoiding streaks  Gradually fades. No weird blotches when fading &amp; even when I sit in the pool all day it still doesn&#x27;t fade to a blotchy mess. A little goes a long way. If u want to avoid chemicals you must but this!! Let&#x27;s hope this stays around for a long long long time!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very nice if you are looking for a natural product that gives a light tan. I am very pleased with the outcome of this product. I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it was on the EWG Skin website for a safe product. When you first apply it, there is a very fragrant flower smell.  Then, a few hours later, the flower smell is gone and you have the classic \\&quot;sunless tanning\\&quot; smell that you just cant hide.  Once you shower, it does go away.  This product, for whatever reason, didn&#x27;t give me any color.  I tried it a second time just on my stomach(which is very white) to see how much color one application achieved.  The next morning, there was NO difference.  Very disappointing!!  Im not a hard person to tan.  One week in the sun and Im very brown.... so I have plenty of color in my genes.  So, I dont know why it didn&#x27;t work.  Im sending it back.  Thats why I LOVE Amazon!!!  Even though the  container is small, it goes a LONG way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar.. the first I ordered about a year ago. At that time it was a pure white cream, not too thick and not too thin, just perfect. I loved the outcome and used the entire jar almost last summer. I ordered a second jar a few months ago and just opened it two days ago to find they have [unfortunately] reformulated the lotion. I&#x27;m not sure why they did.. don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broke, right? The new formula is a tan-yellow, much thicker &#x27;lotion&#x27; although now it feels like it has gums or gelatin mixed in because of the jiggly thick consistency. There is a floral scent for this new jar that I don&#x27;t recall from the older formula... I don&#x27;t mind it necessarily, although it doesn&#x27;t make the experience any better. Once applied, the floral scent quickly faded and all I smell is the self-tanner smell until I have to reapply (I am pretty fair and need to reapply every 4-7 days.. also to be noted is that I&#x27;ve used about 7-10 self tanners over the years and this is one of the least offensive smelling ones.. I don&#x27;t like the smell but it isn&#x27;t as horrible as many other brands). I love that it is so non toxic and the ingredient list is pure, which is why I tried it. I frequently visit EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep site for toxicity ratings, and this scores very very well. The old formula applied much better- I never had blotchy marks or streaks, ever. It just worked itself out and would come out so nice every time. I also liked that the old formula would give me a little tan and not overdo it, so I could build the tan gradually and not look suddenly tanned. And it was so natural looking (a beautiful glow, not orange which the new formula has a bit of now). The old formula left my skin unbelievably soft, it was incredible and wonderful.. I&#x27;ve never used anything like it! I didn&#x27;t use any lotion all summer last year- just exfoliated in the shower twice a week, reapplied this tanner about once a week or a little sooner and that&#x27;s it, my skin would be the softest it&#x27;s ever been in my life until I stopped self tanning toward the end of fall). This new formula (current one, my second jar), doesn&#x27;t leave my skin nearly as soft and tans me MUCH more suddenly, was harder to rub in and I&#x27;ve noticed a couple slightly blotchy areas so I am really really disappointed in the reformulated product. It has more of an orange effect than before, too. It&#x27;s too thick, bottom line. And they should have 2 gradient options, so that the fair skinned people can have a lighter more natural looking tan. Otherwise they&#x27;re really onto something with their healthy sunless tanner.., I just hope they read this and bring back the old white formula again. Or offer them both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Amazon.com put a pesky bar code label right across the jar so now I cannot read the ingredients or some of the info on the jar because the sticker won&#x27;t come off. Not a good idea, Amazon.y life until I stopped self tanning toward the end of fall).

    <li> I think this is a GREAT sunless tanning creme. It is the safest one I found.  So many say all natural until you actually read the labels.  I got it for a March wedding I was in to get some color.  It gave me a nice tan after two&lt;br /&gt;applications.  It does have somewhat of a unpleasant scent but it is not unbearable.  I will continue to use this product all year now.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of Mellon so I had to throw this out. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m sensitive to smell generally but this just stinks. I didn&#x27;t even use it, I opened it, took a wiff and threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I used this for the time the other day and it seems to work well. I&#x27;ve used several other self Tanners before and this one ranks high On the list. The Consistency makes it so that you have to thoroughly work it into your skin making it virtually impossible to have streaks or missing spots. It does have the classic self tanner smell that is caused by the DHA but i didn&#x27;t find it to be overwhelming and it goes away after a shower. It also didn&#x27;t stain my clothes or sheets (i wore white underwear and slept on white sheets to be sure). I have olive skin on the pale side which makes me look a little yellow at times but the tan looks natural and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;i used to work as an airbrush artist so here are a few tips for anyone having trouble with the tan: Exfoliate and shave before application, put a little lotion on your toe and finger nails to create a barrier that will prevent dark spots, mix the tanner with a little lotion when applying To knees, elbows, hands, feet and face.&lt;br /&gt;For the price and the fact that this product uses mostly natural ingredients, i give it 5 stars and plan to stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;I will update if it fades horribly but with proper exfoliation, I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! The most natural looking tan without getting in the sun! No streaks ever! I get compliments all the time on the color it gives!</li>
    <li> I am finding this product to be superior to  most self-tanners.  I have to say it is not quite as good as the more expensive brand (MyChelle) which is my favorite, but the difference in price is quite significant.  MyChelle has been out of stock for quite some time, so I tried this one.  It&#x27;s but pretty darn natural looking, even on my feet.  A lightly warmer color than MyChelle produces, but to be honest, it is almost imperceptible.  Most brands make dark spots at the ankles and toes which  advertise that you use self-tanner, but I&#x27;m finding this product is not prone to that problem.  I mix a little of my regular moisturizer into it and with a little effort to get it even, I&#x27;m having good luck.  Even in bright sunlight, I see very few flaws with my fake tan, and if I do, a little regular moisturizer on those spots seems to fix the problem after a few hours.  It lasts well, also. I use a sugar scrub 2 or 3 times per week to keep skin prepared for a nice fake tan.  I have fair to medium coloring and stay out of the sun, so my self-tanners have their work cut out.  I have not tried using it on my face, but when I do, I&#x27;ll update.</li>
    <li> I received a lot of compliments on my color after just one application and I will continue to purchase this product and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It really works well without the typical scent! I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals. My favorite!</li>
    <li> I bought this for coloring/tanning my face, as I am allergic to ALL sunscreens (chemical or natural) in makeup. This seemed like a clean basic product without wheat/gluten oils or sunscreens. This self tanner left my skin soft and slightly tanned. With repeat application after 24 hours, left me dark. GO easy. A little goes a long way. I appled with gloves. However, after using for a few weeks, I developed a reaction to the product. Mild itchiness and my skin became dry. Ugh. I&#x27;m fairly chemically sensitive. If you are too, let&#x27;s face the facts: this is a chemical we can do without. If you aren&#x27;t chemically sensitive, this product works well and delivered a promised tan on my face. I gave it four stars because I felt it still tanned my skin well, and not everyone has chemical product issues.</li>
    <li> Great color, really makes you look awesome. It does take 2-3 before you notice your skin darkening but I&#x27;m excited that it natural looking and has natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me - I am very pale and this item was supposed to be a natural streak free color - had stripes up and down my legs - was careful to exfoliate and then apply carefully....very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think it smells as bad as other reviews are saying. I do like that it has minimal harsh chemicals but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t make me as dark as other products do, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> This does give you a nice tan. I use it every other day and it seems to give a nice even color. The smell is not great, but none of the self tanners smell good.</li>
    <li> Great color, love that it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals!</li>
    <li> Noticeable color change after just one application. Nice even color without that super fake looking orange tint. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am pregnant and cant really lay out like I used to. It appealed to me because of the ingredients. This is probably the best self tanner I have ever used. Ive always been a fan of jergens, but this leaves such a natural color and it doesnt have that terrible smell. I would recommend using it sparingly esp on your feet as it can be dark. Lasts quite awhile too. I would purchase this again</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It performs as promised.  My skin is an even healthy color and left it feeling soft and smooth.  It is easy to apply and a little goes a long way.  There are no streaks or lines of demarcation.  So far, there are no reactions to any of the ingredients, and I am super-sensitive.  Thank you for making a product that works and does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for one full day and I&#x27;m in LOVE already! I have been using self tanners for almost ten years and have been searching for a more healthful option. Don&#x27;t be fooled by product packaging. Many brands that look &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; actually contain lots of harsh chemicals. This product actually delivers on this. Other buyers have reported a runny texture and strong smell, however, my product has a thick, creamy texture and smells of cucumber melon. Of course you do smell the DHA after a while, but it&#x27;s really no stronger than other self tanners (a light shower or even body spray take care of that). It left my skin very soft, but it is a little bit tacky for an hour or two. It&#x27;s too soon to really tell how my face will react, but so far it is glowing. Like other buyers have reported, it&#x27;s not as dark as tanners like Fake Bake or St. Topaz, but that&#x27;s something I actually really like about it (and you can get a deeper color by layering applications). A small amount gives a smooth, natural looking color and blurs imperfections. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> This product blends in great!! You have to make sure you rub it into your skin well, basically until it is dry. I use it every 2nd or 3rd evening and shower the next morning to avoid the smell that comes along with sunless tanners. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning product, I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for over a month.  It&#x27;s a little smelly, but like one of the reviewers mentioned I used it at night time.  I noticed a small difference after the first application and it was where I wanted it to be after about three applications.  I have an olive skin, but when not in the sun I look sort of pale.  This adds a nice color to my skin.  I&#x27;m going to try for a &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34; look this summer. I think it will work really well for that.  Plus not brown stuff to wear off on your clothing.</li>
    <li> I like this, but there are some tricks to getting a soft, golden glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it isn&#x27;t a thick cream - it&#x27;s got a fairly runny consistency.  So when you dip into the jar, use the pads of your fingers and put them atop the cream instead of &amp;#34;scooping&amp;#34; it out.  (Gosh, I hope that made sense!).  I&#x27;m not sure why they don&#x27;t put this in a lotion pump dispenser, but they don&#x27;t.  Save yourself brown fingernails by doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, although it is a bit runnier than I thought, it does take some doing to rub in completely.  A little goes a long way!  Keep at it.  Rub in circles vigorously and it does eventually all sink in.  It is unsettling to see a bright white cream sitting on your legs, but it will all eventually settle in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, mine didn&#x27;t have a scent at all when I put it on.  If anything, it sort of smelled slightly like a yeast roll, but absolutely NO overpowering &amp;#34;granny&#x27;s perfume&amp;#34; flower scent others reported.  Perhaps they&#x27;ve changed the formula?  After a few hours, it does give off that distinct &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve just put on self tanner&amp;#34; smell, which is normal.  Just be sure you don&#x27;t apply this right before going on a date or anywhere that you might be mortified if someone smelled you.  :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used mine for the first time last night, went to bed, and woke up with a lovely golden glow.  I am fairly pale and this didn&#x27;t turn me orange or make me look way too dark.  Also NOTHING came off on my sheets or my pajamas - a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it takes a wee bit more work to apply (all that rubbing), I&#x27;m going to continue using this.  It&#x27;s all natural, it leaves my skin feeling super soft and it has a nice color to it.  I&#x27;ll just apply it at night so that the only person who suffers from the telltale DHA smell is my poor husband.  ;)</li>
    <li> Tried after reading other positive reviews, and I love it!  Great natural color for my naturally pale skin, and the color developed with virtually no streaks.  And I was amazed at how long the color lasted - almost 2 weeks for me!  I also tried a bit on my face and it worked well - natural color and no breakouts.  I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite self-tanner!</li>
    <li> I have to admit I almost didn&#x27;t try this product because the smell is pretty unpleasant.  The good news is that after it dries, the smell is very close to nonexistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skinned, and the amount of tan I have is just right ... and it isn&#x27;t orange!  Even my husband commented on how natural the tan looks.  And, he is someone very sensitive to smell, and the odor is virtually gone after the product dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions suggest using for two days and then not using it for two days.  I used it Monday and Tuesday and did not use it yesterday and today.  The color is sitll there.  And, the biggest thrill for me is NO ITCHING!  Every product I have ever used causes bumps and itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad to have found a product that doesn&#x27;t smell (after it dries), doesn&#x27;t turn me orange, and doesn&#x27;t cause an itchy rash!  This product definitely lives up to what it says it will do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>
    <li> best thing ever - natural tan even though i&#x27;m v pale, quick, no streaks, a little goes a long way, AND all natural. life saver. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I waited for several weeks before I wrote this because self-tanners weirdly morph on me.  I have bought and used many high end salon/cosmetic counter tanners that cost well over $40 for a bare 6 ounces and they *pale* in comparison to this product.  First for me, it has zero chemical preservatives, it smells perfectly fine when applying, but the color I achieve is way better then what I get if I&#x27;m in the sun.  I&#x27;m fair-skinned and burn easily, and the results usually aren&#x27;t that great.  When I use this, I get that perfect golden tanned color and it works amazingly well on my face also.  There will always be that self-tanning aroma, but with this product, its very slight.  The tanning process is fairly quick and it has not stained or transferred to my clothing.  I am hoping that this will always be available.</li>
    <li> This self tanner gives a great, natural tanned color. It&#x27;s amazing that it is a natural product. It smells like suntan lotion. I use it on my face at night so I can wake up with a healthy glow in the morning. I highly recommend this, especially for people trying to cut back on all the chemicals in their daily products.</li>
    <li> Goes on very white and pasty, like children&#x27;s sunblock. I am very sensitive to smells and this stuff didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I found it nearly scentless, despite many negative reviews complaining about the smell. I didn&#x27;t check the date on those, but maybe they were outdated?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the color this stuff gives me. It&#x27;s a very natural tan, basically looks like a good day at the beach. Despite how thick it goes on, I have never had streaks from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five for these reasons: I don&#x27;t like the pasty feel of it. I much prefer tanners with tint so I can be ready to go out right away. I don&#x27;t like that it claims to promote your natural melanin production rather than just staining you, which is all it actually does (I&#x27;m pretty sure my sink doesn&#x27;t have natural melanin and it left a washable mark on there). It&#x27;s expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> Really brings out your tan</li>
    <li> Have used this product in the past and really like it.....does a great job..</li>
    <li> Very thick, but is a very nice color! Great natural alternative</li>
    <li> I really love using this self tanner.  I have had no issues with smell or the color getting on anything else.  It makes your skin soft and sun-kissed and I have only used it twice so far.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
    <li> This is probably the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. It is a very natural,  golden glow. My only problem is, it makes me break out. I bought it thinking it was DHA free (it stated in the description when I ordered it was hypoallergenic)However,  it isn&#x27;t the tanners fault I&#x27;m allergic to it, thus the 5; star rating.</li>
    <li> Best tan in a bottle [jar] product !!  No streaks and not orange.  Follow instructions carefully.</li>
    <li> I was really hesitant to purchase this after reading a number of reviews claiming that this product has a very foul smell. A smell so unbearable that some have opted to discontinue use. After giving this product a week to gather my results, I must say..There is no other self tanner that I have tried that compares to this. First off, I&#x27;m Asian and have very pale colored legs. My arms on the other hand are tan since I don&#x27;t wear shorts often. With summer around the corner, I wanted to get an early start on self tanning before I actually stepped out in public. Before applying this product, it is well advised that you should exfoliate in the shower. After drying, apply the product as you would like lotion and blend well using less around elbows, knees and any other areas you feel are rougher than others. The smell was honestly not as bad as I was expecting. When initially smelling the product, it had a light scents of lilac, jasmine and rose in it. The next morning, I was able to see that the color on my legs were showing a darker yet subtle color. I will say though that there was probably 1-2 darker spots where I had not blended the self tanner well enough on my ankle, but to solve this problem, I basically skipped using this tanner after the second day and alternated with my regular go to moisturizing lotion. This product is definitely strong and without a doubt works! You just have to be patient! A little goes a long way with this product!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a self tanner (or any tanner) and I love it. When I first opened the jar the smell was a bit off putting, but it isn&#x27;t that strong or horrid. I saw results after the first time I used it and so did everyone else! I bought this for prom and it is only a week away! I will definitely be completely tan and perfect by then!! Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a change, very subtle and I&#x27;m light skinned so most tanners are drastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is also tough to spread and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant, which is unusual for these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall poor value for the price, you can get twice as much for the same price range with Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion, with better results.</li>
    <li> Best. Tanner. Ever.  I&#x27;m pale, pale, pale, and I was super freaked that this would make me orange, but it&#x27;s very easy to use and the best part is, if you apply just a little, you get just a little tan.  It makes it very easy to get just the amount of tan you want.  No streaking; yes, it will make splotches around bony areas, but all tanners do this - just be mindful of where you&#x27;re applying it and exfoliate/moisturize before using.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to get it to absorb, but it will absorb eventually, and I haven&#x27;t had a streak yet.  About as close to &#x27;idiot-proof&#x27; as a self-tanner can get, really.</li>
    <li> Natural color from a natural product. Very gradual tan.</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use product.  It has a slight sunless tanner smell, but it isn&#x27;t as strong as other brands.  I like that the products are more natural and the color is more subtle, allowing you to achieve that depth of tan you want.</li>
    <li> I am surprised that this really does make me look like I have a tan. I put it on 3 days in a row them stop for 2 days then put it on again.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, natural or not. It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad either.  I don&#x27;t like a dark tan, so I basically just apply 2-3 days in a row every couple of weeks. Now I don&#x27;t blind people with my white legs.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for about two weeks.  The color looks natural on my skin tone.  Easy to apply, like any self tanner, it&#x27;s important to make sure it&#x27;s fully rubbed in or you get streaks.  All ingredients were things I could pronounce :-),  Price was also reasonable.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many self tanners in the past few years and this one is, by far, my favorite! What I like the best is that I am getting an amazing looking tan w/out jeopardizing my health - be it from the sun or a lotion loaded with harsh chemicals.    I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned and this gives me a great, natural looking color! The smell is awesome too! No horrible scent like you get from most self-tanners. There is a LITTLE bit of a self tanning smell the next day, but it fades away. Also, I notice the color about 3hrs after applying, but I feel it reaches it&#x27;s darkest the next day.     Highly recommend and will continue to buy this as long as it&#x27;s made!!</li>
    <li> I found this product through EWG&#x27;s website and had my doubts that an all natural self-tanner would actually work. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes when I first used it, but within hours I was tan! I followed the directions and used it 2 days in a row and am very pleased with my natural-looking tan. My only complaint with this product is that once it dries, it smells really bad. I put on a new dress after applying the lotion and the dress even smells awful now! I would recommend putting it on at night or when you don&#x27;t have somewhere to go right away.</li>
    <li> I was about 5 months pregnant when I bought this--I needed a touch of color because the only thing worse than being pasty white is being pasty white and pregnant LOL So of course I tried to find the most natural and least chemical laden self-tanner I could and this one certainly fits the bill! I only use it on my arms, legs, chest, back, and face and, honestly I&#x27;ve not had a problem with looking orange or streaky. In fact, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more like a gradual tanning moisturizer(like Jergens)-- you&#x27;d have to try really hard to screw up the application of this product. It also has a pleasant smell and, although it doesn&#x27;t always rub in very well, it does absorb eventually after a couple of seconds. It gave me just the right amount of glow and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is my first product review ever, I had to with this one! I have used several self tanners over the years. When I became pregnant, I wanted to continue using but I kept breaking out in a rash on my elbows from the drug store brands. After looking at the ingredient list it&#x27;s no wonder! All those chemicals! Eek! I found this and didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well! I would recommend using it before bed as it is a little thicker than most and following the 2 days on and 2 days off has worked well for me. I just love this product! ;)</li>
    <li> I went to [...] to check on a healthy alternative for sunless tanner (because I care what chemicals I put on my body and in my body - but especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant)!  Caribbean Solutions Self Tanner received a 2 out of 10 (0 being best, 10 being worst).    After trying it out I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  The instructions say apply 2 days and the wait 2 days.  I like the healthy glow it gives my skin.  It&#x27;s very subtle and gradually builds overtime.  I wouldn&#x27;t apply to face however, it caused me to break out (which I never do).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m a pretty pale girl to begin with, but I like keeping a little color during the winter. This is a great alternative to all the other products out there full of chemicals that deplete your skin (and health). I use this once or twice a week, usually overnight. Doesn&#x27;t leave a stain! I haven&#x27;t noticed a smell while applying but after a few hours the standard fake-tan smell does show up - nothing bad or overpowering but certainly noticeable. The tub isn&#x27;t large but a little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> This definitely makes you look tan which is great, but it gives off a weird smell. I could get over it if the smell wore off, but once I put this on I smell it all day long.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the tanners out there. You name it I have tried it. My go to was Bare Escentuals Faux Tan. It really got me dark! I love it. Then I started thinking I should probably look for a healthier tanner. I found this on Amazon and WOOWWW! It gives just the right amount of glow/tan. I&#x27;m pretty pale but if I tan for a couple weeks I can get a base tan... This is perfect for the winter and even Summer. My new self tanner!!! Love it..</li>
    <li> This product is so cool!!! I try to avoid the sun and don&#x27;t use self - tanners because they usually have a ton of chemicals. But this one is so natural! Plus, it works great. Use it 2 nights in a row and you have a beautiful tan. I use it on my legs only because they are super pale. This products gives them a nice glow and doesn&#x27;t look fake.&lt;br /&gt;The smell - it is a bit off especially after a few hours. Once I put this on, waited till it dried, and went to work. I could smell it after a while. It wasn&#x27;t horrible but it may have bothered other people (I didn&#x27;t ask but the smell was pretty strong). I think the best idea is to put it on before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy such products exist :)</li>
    <li> Not only is this product all natural it hardly has the typical sunless tanner smell. Streaks are so light hardly visible. I think I applied in a rush so that&#x27;s probably my fault.  The product gives you a natural subtle color. Looks so natural and I&#x27;m very happy with this product. AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> We have tried many other self-tanners.  After ditching most due to nasty ingredients, we decided to give this one a try.  Wow!  It works perfectly!  It looks natural, no icky smell, just the best self-tanner we have ever used.  We won&#x27;t be without this one!</li>
    <li> It works, doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the other reviews say (it has a slight smell, not strong), turns you a natural color, and doesn&#x27;t make you break out (even in places that I normally break out when I apply lotion). So, good stuff for a great price, considering that a spray tan costs this much for one spray, and this will probably last at least a month.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I researched natural tanning products and this seemed to be the least harmful. No complaints about allergic reaction or anything. I just don&#x27;t like the tanner itself. It feels like its never dry enough to get dressed and it doesn&#x27;t stay for very long. So it feels like u have to put it on everyday, but you don&#x27;t really want to because it doesn&#x27;t let you continue with your daily activities. Smell is unpleasant, but what tanner isn&#x27;t. It took me a lot longer to see color than other tanners and on elbows knees or any other moisture neglected area it collects and looks dirty. I just wish the color made all the negatives worth it. I will use this product until I find a different natural approach to tanning</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but for this product, I wanted to tell about my experience!  I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that this tanning cream leaves a subtle tan that is perfect for those of us who don&#x27;t want to look pale one day and dark brown the next day. After one application it was subtle like I said, but just enough tan to be noticeable. After the second application, the tan was a little darker but still subtle enough to be natural. A little bit goes a long way and it is forgiving if you didn&#x27;t rub it in super evenly. The best part of all for me is that it doesn&#x27;t smell!! I have used it at night after showering, let it dry for a half hour or so and went to bed. No smell, nothing on the sheets, and a subtle, pretty tan in the morning! I won&#x27;t use anything else from now on!</li>
    <li> This product arrived way ahead of time, I tried it, its not greasy on your skin like other products. Its a light tanner. Don&#x27;t expect a drastic change. Good size jar for the price, I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Okay so I may not be the most knowledgable when it comes to tanning products, but I know when one works well. And this product is AWESOME. I am 20 years old and VERY pale. It&#x27;s my 21st birthday this Friday so I wanted to get something to give me a glow so I don&#x27;t blind everyone in a dress. This stuff is just so perfect I can&#x27;t explain. It&#x27;s a white base so you can&#x27;t see where you have put it but that&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s really hard to mess this up! (Even for me and I never apply fake tanner) the cream takes a while to rub in but I think this is the reason why it DOESNT STREAK and I apply this with my fingers! I applied it the first night and went to sleep (NO staining of clothes/sheets) and woke up the next day to apply another layer and this washed it off that night and got a gorgeous natural bronze glow with absolutely no streaks!&lt;br /&gt;Some common cons to address:&lt;br /&gt;So it comes in a container and not a pump. Oh well. You could always try to transfer it over to something with and pump if you wanted to I guess but I&#x27;ll just leave mine in the container cause it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;The smell it&#x27;s NOT.THAT.BAD.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I almost didn&#x27;t get the product because some people said they had to discontinue use because of the smell. Really? It&#x27;s a faint, floral/fake tan smell. And it didn&#x27;t bother me AT ALL. Maybe my nose isn&#x27;t as sensitive as everyone else? It goes away when you shower and apply lotion afterwards so it&#x27;s not the end of the world.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great self tanner. Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews stop you from purchasing, it&#x27;s so worth it!!</li>
    <li> when i tan from the sun, i get this burnt, brownish tint that looks wonderful and healthy. with this fake tan, there is darkening of the skin, yet the tone is not quite the healthy , burned brown one. it has a slightly off tint that keeps you from looking pale, just not wonderfully healthy.  update-  this isn&#x27;t worth it. smells slightly nauseating with this chemical floral scent.</li>
    <li> I am so pale I&#x27;m practically translucent and I used to use L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze or Banana Boat Sunless Tan, but when I got pregnant I did some research and realized that all those chemicals were a no-no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still waited til my first trimester was done to use Caribbean Solutions, but after reading the ingredients, I probably could have used it on day one. It uses a vegetable extract to create the tan, and it gets a fantastic rating on the cosmetics safety database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the best part: IT WORKS. A little bit goes a long way, and I have an even, streak-free, totally realistic looking tan after only one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it came in a squeeze bottle instead of a tub (for the sake of convenience) but I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to others complaining about a smell, it has a lovely light floral scent when you first put it on and I haven&#x27;t noticed the second-day smell that others mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet worn it with white, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not it rubs off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never going back to the chemical-laden stuff!</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it is all natural and it works wonderfully. I agree there is a scent to the product, but I do not find it as bad as other reviewers have stated. It goes on easily, absorbs well, and leaves a natural looking tan. I have sensitive skin and I think the oils in it cause some pimples, but this is easily cured by Burts Bees Herbal Blemish Stick (which is all natural also and Amazing). I have a fair complexion and no one has ever noticed or thought that I use a \\&quot;fake tanner\\&quot;. Reordering after I finish this review.</li>
    <li> This gives no color! I wanted to like it because it&#x27;s natural and that&#x27;s more what I&#x27;m about but it didn&#x27;t change my skin tone at all! I love the scent though, so I will use it up.</li>
    <li> As far as sunless tanning goes, this is by far the very best I have used!! The EWG site gave it a 2, and that alone makes it beat out all the others for toxicity. The smell is light, and doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin like so many do. It blends easily and dries quickly. The color is the most passable as a REAL tan I have her seen. It gets an A+ from this Tanner ;)</li>
    <li> Smell is no different than others however,&lt;br /&gt;its wonderful well made because it does the job it suppose&lt;br /&gt;to do.&lt;br /&gt;:}</li>
    <li> The first two times I used is I didn&#x27;t think it worked at all.  Not sure what I did wrong, but now. Take a shower and apply it after as if it was lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  All these review make it sounds like it smells like a swamp or something.  It smells very over flowery.  Like those cheap candles at Walmart at smell like flowers but its overpowering.  At least that&#x27;s what I smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get tan, and you have it rub it in circles or it will streak, but the streaks are not that bad to begin with.  It gives my skin more of a subtly glow than a full on tan.  I am quite fair Skinned so I notice the slightest color.  I don&#x27;t think this would work if you are already tan.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love! A little truly goes a long way! After taking an Environment Science class at my college, I wanted to find a self tanner that wouldn&#x27;t contain the dangerous chemicals. EWG Skin Deep recommended this one and It is better than I expected. It must be a DHA thing because naturally your going to have some &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; scent. The first time I used it, I showered and exfoliated at night and then put beach colors on, It didnt do anything to my sheets nor did it leave any residue or anything. From there I just use it at night and then shower in the morning so i don&#x27;t have any smellyness coming off of me :)&lt;br /&gt;You do not need a lot of this! while putting it on, I could notice my skin starting to bronze. I love that it&#x27;s white and goes on so well! I just really love how inexpensive (without all the icky chemicals) this is!&lt;br /&gt;When I took a break to let it all fade off, I didn&#x27;t become blotchy or anything. It was like naturally losing a sun tan just in a bit shorter time period! I tell everyone about this stuff!</li>
    <li> Loved this self tanner. It develops slowly so looks natural. Its not streaky, it was easy to apply and its not too heavily scented.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you do get a bit of the DHA/self tanner smell when the color is developing, but that happens with all self tanners, even professional spray tans.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this self tanner. I&#x27;ve been using St Tropez self tanners for years but recently I wanted to try something more natural. i found this self tanner through \\&quot;Skin Deep\\&quot; website by Environmental Working Group and it rated this product with the lowest toxic level among many best selling self tanners. I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s very creamy. When I first put it on I thought, on my gosh, it&#x27;s too thick, but it&#x27;s easy to spread and the  smell is rather light and fades fast. after a few hours it developed a nice natural tan. I love it. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a really great tanner....especially for a lotion rather than a professional spray.  It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t streak and stays for a long time. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is it clogs my pores. I cannot use it on my face at all. And when I use it on my body, I sometimes get clogged pores on my upper body. Could be just me though.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to use more natural products recently and I bought this because of that and also because of all of the good reviews.  It exceeded my expectations, although I have only used it on my legs and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really, really pale.  On top of that, I do not tan.  Rather, I cannot tan, I just burn.  I have tried some tanning products before to try to make my legs less of a topic of summer conversation and have generally ended up orange with brown spots on my knees and heels.  I exfoliated as was recommended on the instructions and applied this and woke up the next morning with a natural looking glow all over my legs.  People at work have actually commented on how nice my legs look instead of telling me how white I am.  I have a small patch of spider vein on my calf, and this makes it much less noticeable.  I reapply every few days to keep the color up, and I think I will never not have this product again.  An added benefit is that is leaves skin outstandingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have commented on the smell and said that it does not absorb entirely.  The cream does not have the best smell, it is kind of a cheap flower scent, but it goes away and the result is definitely worth it.  It can take awhile to absorb, but if you just rub for awhile it will eventually absorb and again, the result is definitely worth it.  Also, like any tanning product, you can get blotches on heavier skin patches like ankles.  However, I just exfoliated and it went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have found that using a heavy moisturizer (I use coconut oil) on knees and ankles before applying this product helps to avoid blotchy darker patches.  I also bought [[ASIN:B001DITLFS Natural Kukui Body Silk Moisturizers 8 oz Caribbean Solutions]], which gives the same intensely soft skin effect without the color.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this self-tanner! It smells so great I just wanna dig in with a spoon! It gives gorgeous natural looking color! The only word of advice I have is that a little bit goes a very loooooonnng way! AMAZING natura product!</li>
    <li> amazing! The ingredient list is so small and know what you are putting on your skin. My least favorite thing about most self tannners besides the smell is the messy color guide that stains everything but this is a white lotion that spreads so easily I love it. I am very fair skinned and this does not streak on me I follow the instruction and apply 2 days in a row and the color is gives me is so beautiful and perfect, not too dark at all.  I also use this kind of as a tan extender when I do spray tans. The scent does not bother me at all and I do not get that awful dha self tanner smell with this the next day. You also cannot beat the value! I have been using famous daves self tanner and I go through that so quickly and it is like tripple the price as this for the same exact result. I am so thankful I decided to try this self tanner! a small amount goes a small way.</li>
    <li> Soooo easy to put on, hard to mess up.  It&#x27;s not streaky or ugly, doesn&#x27;t have that overwhelming burnt sugar smell.  It doesn&#x27;t make me bronze like a coppertone babe, but when you are as pale as me (pasty white), it keeps my legs from glowing like a lighthouse!</li>
    <li> I unfortunately don&#x27;t take time to review items. However, I&#x27;m choosing to sit down and leave a review for this product. I am so happy with this sunless tanner. I am of Irish and Welsh decent and therefore have very fair skin. I&#x27;m am extreamly careful with sun exposure because I have family history of skin cancer. But, I also don&#x27;t want to look super pale in the summer. I have used multiple different brands of self tanner. I did finally find one that worked for me but, I became concerned about the chemicals. So, the search was on yet again. I came across this product and took a chance even though the only reviews were from people who had received the product as a free trial. I thought well, I have spent way more on other name brand products that didn&#x27;t work so, I ordered it. I have been using it for three weeks now and I absolutely love it! It gives me exactly the right amount of color. It&#x27;s light and fluffy and I don&#x27;t need a mitt or a sponge or anything but, my hands. I have had no streaks or any issues. I was surprised how long the color lasted before I felt I needed to reapply. And the best part is the ingredients!!! 100x better then anything you will find at s drug store.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s important to point out this is a definite SELF-TANNER. For some reason I was under the impression it was a subtle glow, much like the Jergens and other store lotions. I thought I&#x27;d apply it over the course of a week for a daily increase in color. NO, WRONG. Be careful how you apply it, I had marks all over my ankles because since I was thinking it would be more subtle I was less concerned with application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I learned to use it correctly, it&#x27;s been a good product.</li>
    <li> I have recently begun switching over all of my products to more natural, organic ones.  I thought I was going to be out of luck in finding a self tanner that fit the bill, but then I came across this one.  I was skeptical, as I am veryyyy picky about my tanners.  I had been a huge fan of body drench aerosol tan and st moritz foam tanner.  This one is a WHITE cream.  It seems so strange that something this milky and light could give you such a nice glow but it really does.  The onlyyy issue that I have with it is that it leaves no color guide- but I have found that even without it, it&#x27;s hard to mess this up.  And it&#x27;s so moisturizing to boot! My skin loves this stuff, and I have very sensitive skin that reacts to 3/4 of products.  There is a smell after a few hours, but that&#x27;s goingt to be the case with every tanner, I&#x27;ve come to peace with that.  After you shower, the smell dissipates and you&#x27;re left with a really natural, awesome tan! I believe the directions say to do it two days in a row, and I&#x27;m sure that you could build the color up, but honestly I&#x27;m fine with just one application -- I&#x27;m not trying to fool anyone into thinking I&#x27;m coming back from the beach or anything, I just want to avoid the pasty, sickly looking color that I get in the winter.  And this does the trick :)  The tan fades away gradually and doesn&#x27;t leave any crazy marks or get blotchy.  I apply it once a week, and am definitely going to be a customer for as long as they make this stuff.  I can&#x27;t believe something that works this well is so natural.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Finally, a NATURAL self-tanner! Although compared to the traditional brands of gradual self-tanners (Loreal, Jergen&#x27;s, Banana Boat, etc.) the 6oz. portion of this is small for the price, it is worth it due to the use of natural, plant-based ingredients. The primary ingredients used are organic aloe and naturally-derived DHA.  Being a nursing mother, I do not have time to lay in the sun, but I would not use any self-tanner I have found other than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another pro is that this lotion does not have an unpleasant odor as do most self-tanners. In fact, there is hardly any fragrance at all. There is also only a minimal greasy residue and does not leave your skin &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and orange after usage. I have sensitive skin (some self-tanners give me a rash) and was even able to use this on my face without breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, this is not a product that gives you a deep glow with 1 usage. Rather, you should re-apply this every other day until you reach the desired level of tan. Since the color is gradual, there is minimal streaking and no strange orange hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this tanner for anyone wanting to add a healthy glow to their skin without using harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great natural product.  Love how it goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t oily or sticky.  I would have given it four stars but I don&#x27;t like the smell, although other people have said I smell good when I wear it.  I think it is a little too floral for me but not strong. Also I wish the tan was darker.  Would work awesome for someone who is very pale.  I have fair skin with olive undertones and the color looks good just not dark enough even applying every day for three days.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most natural looking tanning lotions I have found on the market, and I have tried almost everything you can find at drug stores. The scent is a bit strong so I apply it at night before sleeping, then wash in the shower the next morning. It lasts about four days with one use.</li>
    <li> OK, yes there is the smell  But if you use this on your legs only, the smell will go away pretty fast, and if you use it two days in a row, the color will show up, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about using harsh chemicals on your skin.  Do check out the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s cosmetic data base, and you&#x27;ll see this self tanner is low on the danger scale, while the self-tanners that may not have a bad smell have more dangerous ingredients.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but thought I&#x27;d try it anyway. It actually works - definite skin darkening over a couple of weeks. Looks like I spent a few days on the beach.</li>
    <li> Amazon has the best price for this.  I have used many self tanners and this is by far my favorite.  And it is the safest, acording to EWG.org, which I trust completely.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m poisoning myself in the name of vanity when I use this stuff. Nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> Best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve used. Doesn&#x27;t make you orange looking and doesn&#x27;t get too dark. I love thus stuff. The smell is very good too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this!!!  Definitely can tell after I use it 2 nights in a row I&#x27;ve got a nice glow.  Will purchase again, for sure!!!</li>
    <li> Takes a few applications to develop color, but does work and looks pretty natural on my pale skin.</li>
    <li> Love this self tanner!!! It gives a natural look!!!!</li>
    <li> I used  this all summer for the past two years.  I have to be careful because my skin is very light so it makes it harder to get it look just right.  If I mix this with my vitamin e oil I get a good result.  It helps to dilute it a little bit so it doesn&#x27;t looks streaky and blends better with my natural skin tone. I will order this again. It also makes it last longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the fairest of fair and this product have me a deep glow without all those ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce! If you take the time to rub it in, it&#x27;s not streaky, either. Be careful to go light on dry patches (or moisturize beforehand), my ankles and knees were darker than the rest of my skin. Left my skin smooth afterward as well.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Malibu Sunless tanner with Caribbean Solutions because I wanted:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A)  A tanner with minimal and more natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;B)  The same type of &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; effect - just slap it on, let it dry, and move on with life without all of the orange streaks&lt;br /&gt;C)  An affordable glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think others have exaggerated the smell.  Look, when you sniff it right out of the container, yes, it gives off a punch.  When you put it on though, it&#x27;s lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was concerned that it comes in a 6 oz. jar.  The tanner I&#x27;ve been getting comes in 16 oz.  Good news though!  The cream is so thick that I used barely any to cover my entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked very well for me, Irish skin and all.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy what I did all over again.  No regrets.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing. It&#x27;s completely safe and non toxic and it gives very real color. I use it on my legs and it covers imperfections and gives them a nice tanned glow. The smell is strong when you first put it on but it&#x27;s not terrible. I am on my second jar and I LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> I tried using this product twice and the color turned out orangey and totally fake looking. Very disappointed after reading so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff, gives a nice glow, and more importantly it was rated as being non-toxic in the Skin Deep database.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. the ingredients are all natural, but it is some of the best self tanner I have used- natural or not. I highly recommend it. It also doesn&#x27;t smell weird like some of them do- there is really no odor. Also easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Makes skin feel good. Tan isn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched around for the most natural self tanner (with the least amount of chemicals or ingredients I haven&#x27;t heard of), and this is the best one I can find in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, this is a great product.  Easy to apply.  No bad or overpowering odor. No orange color or streaking.  The color is very natural looking but doesn&#x27;t get you very dark.  I followed the instructions and applied the product two days in a row. I definitely got some color but would consider it a light tan. A lot better than pasty white.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a dark tan, this is not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a light, natural looking, chemical free tan, this is the best option I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Yes, this product works! I already had a slight tan and some weird tan lines, so I was focusing on evening myself out for an upcoming event. It worked wonderfully. The only slight drawbacks about this product are that it goes on clear and may be hard to tell where / how much you&#x27;ve applied and the smell isn&#x27;t the best. It&#x27;s worth the money for a product that contains non-toxic and natural ingredients that won&#x27;t turn you orange!</li>
    <li> Looks natural for those of us \\&quot;pale folks\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothes. I can even use it on my face. I&#x27;ve intermittently tried other self tanners but I always come back to this one... but this is the last time. I&#x27;m permanently a Caribbean Solutions girl!&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it does have an odd melon/floral mixed odor, but it washes away and it&#x27;s not enough to ever stop me from using it.&lt;br /&gt;This will make me at least 3 shades darker on the first application. I&#x27;m not sure how dark you could get as I just want to appear naturally golden; anyone who knows me, knows how fair my skin is/was and that I&#x27;m never going to be \\&quot;tan\\&quot; plus I have no desire for that kind of maintenance! LOL</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned so I really need a boost in the summer but don&#x27;t like the idea of slathering myself with chemicals. This gave good color that would last for several days between applications. The smell was also pleasant, unlike some self tanners I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one piece of advice would be to not put this on too soon after shaving your legs. Even when I waited several hours, it made me break out. I find that if I shave in the morning and put this on before bed my skin does not react and I wake up with nice color.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I actually could not smell anything at all when I opened the jar. It gave me a nice tan color after one application.</li>
    <li> this product is safe effective and cheap. what more would you want? yes, it does smell a bit horrible but as I said there are more benefits to it than down sides. love it.</li>
    <li> This was extremely easy to put on which I always think is the hardest part. Worked just like moisturizer and smelled good. Color didn&#x27;t come until maybe 8 hours later along with the self-tanner smell so I would do this when you aren&#x27;t going to be around other people! I&#x27;m very fair but this looked mostly natural to me, I feel like it&#x27;s a nice tan look without overdoing it.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my lotion so it goes on more even and isn&#x27;t so harsh. I found when I used it by itself it was a little weird in color but mixed with a lotion it tones it down. Equal amount of lotion and this.</li>
    <li> The best self tanner by far looks natural and last a long time....</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that I really liked the results. Not orange and very gradual tanning. Had to apply often becuase I am fair skinned but worth it since it doesn&#x27;t contain any nasty chemicals that I refuse to put on my skin. Smells odd but goes away. Does come off on clothes like all the others but no staining from when I could tell. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> No streaking and I love that it&#x27;s free of parrabens. I had been using another self tanner before that I couldn&#x27;t apply powder on top of, because it would flake. I don&#x27;t have that problem with this. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This does tan nicely, but even though I was careful, I got some streaky and uneven areas. My fault, not the tanner. I will try to put it on more carefully. I have found that a small portion does go on more evenly. Takes about 2 hours to develop. I only needed to reuse every other day to keep a nice light tan. I am pretty pale, and &amp;#34;over 60&amp;#34; so I didn&#x27;t want to look like I had used a tanning bed or heavy sprayer. Those of you my age group remember the baby oil and iodine routine that we all got burnt from using. This is more natural and very subtle provided you do not over do it. Others among you can put it on every day and look great with a darker tan. There are no harsh chemical ingredients in this and I did not detect any smell at all.</li>
    <li> EWG safety rating was great. A bit smelly but natural color....third time ordering.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works. I usually use body drench spray tanner, but wanted to find a lotion that would not spray tan every surface in my bathroom. After reading reviews, I figured I would try this lotion...... OMG  it is the most realistic looking, natural tan I have ever got from any tanner. The lotion is white, so u can see where u put it and it spreads easily, so u can easily get every spot on your body. I used it at night to avoid &amp;#34;that smell&amp;#34; that all tanners have when the are rubbed into your skin, BUT I didn&#x27;t notice any smell at all. The next morning after I showered all I noticed was this lovely, natural looking glow and my skin was SO moisturized, but not shinny, just perfectly soft and smooth and NOT AT ALL PALE !! It is the end of February, snow outside and I look as healthy as I would look in the summer. There is no sign of &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tan anywhere , just healthy glow. This is absolutely my new favorite tanning lotion</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is working or not...</li>
    <li> Works but can turn your skin orange.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply- goes on evenly.  Unpleasant smell as most of the sunless tanning products.  Color natural looking; only use for legs.</li>
    <li> Works great and provides a faster tan than the other products I used.  Very pleased with this product and am replacing it now as my #1 self tanner (and I&#x27;ve tried most of them). Besides this one is way healthier as far as ingredients!</li>
    <li> It works ok for cheap self tanner but overall I don&#x27;t like it. I am very pale with freckles and I always burn. This stuff is a very creamy lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell super great,but it&#x27;s not horrendous, at least not to me. I usually blend my self tanner w/lotion to dial back the intensity of it. I didn&#x27;t with this stuff, after reading all the other reviews, and it went on way too dark but worst of all was that it was quite streaky. I just skipped skirts and shorts while it wore off on my legs because no way am I exposing streaky brown legs to the world. When I dilute it w/lotion, it&#x27;s a little better but still streaky. This stuff is mediocre in my book. I like my Jergens gradual tanner better. It still streaks but not near as bad as this stuff. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed with my favorite self tanner, Clarins, and what i&#x27;ve noted with other highly rated self tanners (St.Tropez) is that they don&#x27;t contain Vitamin E. I think including Vitamin E in a self tanner is a mistake as it exfoliates your skin and hence causes unven results. I would have to recommend Clarins self tanner above all the rest. Sure it&#x27;s expensive but you will be so much happier with the results. Also, I exfoliated vigorously before applying Caribbean Solutions and it still streaked. No thanks.</li>
    <li> Application was simple and the cream is not too heavy or greasy. My main issue with this product is that I did not see a difference in my color after one application. I have a light complexion but can tan outside easily. After two applications I was able to notice a darker color, but I prefer to only have to apply it once to get a nice tan color. I did use it on my boyfriend, who has a very, very fair complexion and prone to burning, and I did notice a nice difference in color on him after one application. I guess it all depends on the person and individual skin tone.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin orangey. Best if used maybe once or twice a week. Not horrible but not great..Meh.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but this cream does not self tan at all. I looked at the jar several times to make sure I did not buy just regular lotion.</li>
    <li> Best tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Excellent, natural color. Smells bad when you first put it on but the smell does go away.</li>
    <li> Love this self tanner!  I stopped going to the tanning bed in August of 2013. When I saw the reviews on this product I was impressed and bought a bottle. Well I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle now and love it! The first time I used it, I ended up with absolutely no streaks and I look tan and not orange. You don&#x27;t need much so the bottle goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been going by the directions and see results every time. Also you will notice a little odor a few hours after you put it on but it&#x27;s not that bad. I am absolutely happy someone finally got a self tanning product right!  Thank you Caribbean Solutions!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Caribbean Solutions produces a nice color, the fragrance is pleasant but a little strong for me.  If you go to www.ewg.org (Environmental Working Group) and click on their guide to cosmetics then enter Self tanner in the search box it will bring up a list of self tanners and their ratings.  Caribbean Solutions get&#x27;s a rating of 2 !  The best (low, which is good) score out of the self tanners they have tested!    http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/search.php?query&#x3D;self+tanner&amp;h&#x3D;Search</li>
    <li> Love this self tanner. Non toxic. Great color. I use it 4-5 days in a row for a darker color and it still looks very natural. No streaking.</li>
    <li> Applies smoothly and tan appears gradually.  It doesn&#x27;t smell either.  Tan lasts several days</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Follow the directions carefully, I used a glove to apply mine, took my time and smoothly rubbed it in evenly. Applied it at night after my bath, in two days of applying it I had a perfect amount of color. Lasted a week for me,  I don&#x27;t shave because I had laser hair removal so it may not last as long for you, I don&#x27;t know though.&lt;br /&gt;Please be careful around the ankles and knees, they liked the color too much so I would skip those parts the next time I applied, or you can put some other lotion on those areas to dilute it. Looked like real tan. Will definitely buy again. Also no smell really, just a tiny bit at first but no lingering weird smell. LOVE this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent self tanner! My favorite by far. I am VERY pale and this looks perfect for my skin stone. Just one application lasts me 4-5 days but someone with darker skin would probably need a couple of applications. I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent but it is much better than all of those chemical riddled self tanners out there.</li>
    <li> Works well, &amp;#34;tans&amp;#34; relatively fast and has a nice color. I love that it has mostly natural, non-toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I found it on ewg.com/skindeep and tried to give it a try. It is the safest self-tanner on that web page. I really like it, it changes the color of my face in a day and does not fade away quickly. A lot better than all other well-known brands I have used during all those years. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that the color around my hair roots remains orange and does not fade away as easily as the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> I really like that this is the most natural product that I could find on Skin Deep&#x27;s website. It really does work well, but I cannot stand the smell. The \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; in it is synthetic. (It has to be. No essential oil smells this terrible.) The awful smell gives me a headache. I can&#x27;t use it anymore. Money down the drain. I wish they would reformulate this tanner to be UNSCENTED.</li>
    <li> The BEST!!! Absolutely the best sunless tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! And doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything- and in my quest to find a non toxic, cleaner self tanner I came across this product  by searching on Skin Deep. a free site that rates all beauty products by their toxicity. I didn&#x27;t expect much when I ordered Carribean Soultioins but was quickly and pleasantly suprised by the results and lack of chemical smell. this is more like a nice lotion and I have had no orange effect or streaking whatsoever! simple to use. only drawback is the lotion is on the pasty side so putting pants/jeans on after lotion application is nearly impossible and uncomfortable if you can get them on. I resolved that by only using it after showering at night and putting the lotion on before bed..perfect! and you can&#x27;t beat amazon prime free and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  I&#x27;ve used self tanners for years and you don&#x27;t need a lot to get a nice, golden tan.  When I use a product like this for the first time, I use it on a part of the body that will be covered the next day - so I did my legs.  Like other posters here, there is a lot of rubbing involved but the good news is, it doesn&#x27;t come off on your sheets, your clothing or wash clothes - at all!  The next morning, I woke up and my legs were nicely tanned - no orange.  Do exfoliate before because like any product, you will get darker areas that are not smoother.  So, I decided to get bold and do my face, chest and arms - just a little and already - four hours later - the color is a natural tan.  Oh, no smell - btw.  I was expecting to smell a flower scent that others mentioned here but there was no odor at all.  The price on this product is much lower than the more expensive products that leave you looking orangy.  Important to note that I&#x27;m English decent - so I&#x27;m very fair!</li>
