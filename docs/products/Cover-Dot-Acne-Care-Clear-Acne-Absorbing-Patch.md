      <li>This product is amazing!!</li>
      <li>These cover dots are a great product, but I do not think they are the &amp;#34;miracle-all-my-acne-prayers-have-been-answered&amp;#34</li>
      <li>My experience with these wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>Great at covering up a spot -</li>
      <li>These work great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s best to remove them after washing your face with warm water, it helps loosen the adhesive of the dot.  </li>
      <li>These are amazing!</li>
      <li>AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>They are amazing with ingrown hair blemishes as well!</li>
      <li>They are also good at keeping your fingers from picking at spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>But it keeps me from picking at my face and that&#x27;s a good thing</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t work at minimizing pimples but good for protecting those areas</li>
      <li>The tapered edges of this product makes it superior to the competition.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s a good thing</li>
      <li>popping/causing more damage to pimples, and these dots are very effective for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these!  </li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>I love them!  </li>
      <li>so I can continue using them and share them with others so they can also try them and enjoy the ease of use and great results.</li>
      <li>They are a nice size, cover well and stay where you put them.  </li>
      <li>effective.</li>
      <li>Maybe airbrush foundation would be more effective</li>
      <li>Stays in place better than others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>Love, love, love.</li>
      <li>I mostly use these to keep myself from picking/</li>
      <li>Although I prefer using a hydrocolloid bandage that&#x27;s thicker (and therefore more absorbent)</li>
      <li>Really love this product.</li>
      <li>OK.  </li>
      <li>The edges are tapered, unlike some of the cheaper ones, which helps them stay on better.</li>
      <li>; but I never did because when you try to layer makeup over them it makes them more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>so I ordered more.</li>
      <li>Way better value than dream dots.</li>
      <li>Helps break the habit of touching an already bothered pore.</li>
      <li>these are ok.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re okay.</li>
      <li>These Cover-Dots don&#x27;t have that problem at all, they stay on for 48 hours or more.  </li>
      <li>but I plan to buy more.</li>
      <li>After reading many reviews I decided to give these a try.</li>
      <li>the tapered edges help it blend better</li>
      <li>I just wish this package came with more of them.</li>
      <li>Then it is much more noticeable.</li>
      <li>The first time I ordered I loved the product</li>
      <li>power is pretty good.</li>
      <li>These things are so amazing because they blend right into my skin.</li>
      <li>other than that, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Perforated backing makes it easy to remove.</li>
      <li>I have adult hormonal acne that I can&#x27;t do much about because I can&#x27;t take hormonal birth control, so I treat it the best I can.</li>
      <li>They are much less obtrusive than a band aid when you want to look your best.</li>
      <li>Seems to work best if you have popped the pimple (though I&#x27;m not recommending you do that), but typically helps with reducing pimple size and recovery as I&#x27;ll discuss next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works well to keep the area moist to heal quickly!</li>
      <li>I love these so very much!</li>
      <li>I had trouble removing them from the backing sheet and keeping them in a perfect circle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already recommended them to friends who also felt they were a really fabulous solution to their breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to experiment with how makeup holds over it, but even without makeup, I have felt comfortable wearing one during the day.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best possible solution for me.  </li>
      <li>They work great on most of my face and for the most part aren&#x27;t very noticeable, but I will say that near my chin and mouth where my skin has a lot of movement from me talking and smiling, the dots will wrinkle at the edges, making them very noticeable, so do keep that in mind.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If a zit has been popped it does help the area stay clean</li>
      <li>The Cover-Dots were much better, and do a great job of helping me avoid squeezing or using makeup that clogs more pores or causes the blemish to crust up and look even worse.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you how good these ACNE DOTS are.........over the last 20 yrs</li>
      <li>you have mild to moderate acne that is aesthetically distracting and don&#x27;t want to keep using makeup to cover it, this could be a good way to handle it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall they are a great product that I have added to my collection of acne products, but understand that it won&#x27;t solve all acne problems due to the way it works.  </li>
      <li>These care dots work pretty well and are reasonably priced for how many you get.  </li>
      <li>As many have said, you really do need to pop/lance the pimple first before putting the cover dot on.  </li>
      <li>its great, just takes a little time.</li>
      <li>You can attempt to put makeup over them, but the smooth surface doesn&#x27;t really allow makeup to stick.  </li>
      <li>These totally work amazing to heal my acne.</li>
      <li>In general, hydrocolloid has been a wonderful discovery for me, for draining pimples and reducing acne-related swelling, although it seems to help to puncture/lance the pimple first, carefully, with a sterilized tool.</li>
      <li>The good news is that with practice of about 3 tries, removing the cover-dots became a lot</li>
      <li>it took some practice to get right.   </li>
      <li>Very helpful in keeping a healing blemish concealed and clean.</li>
      <li>For small acne works great.</li>
      <li>These plus CeraVe, benzol peroxide, AHA lotion, and red box Strydex pads have made a huge difference!</li>
      <li>and it was pretty invisible</li>
      <li>I will admit that I always have the urge to be a &amp;#34;pimple popper&amp;#34; despite the fact that I am aware of the disadvantages to my skin.  </li>
      <li>First off, I will say that they do work in the sense that they do pull the pus out.</li>
      <li>They really are not too noticeable, though as others have noted attempting to cover them with makeup/foundation was not a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about these as compared to other hydrocolloids, you really do have to tear the paper backing along the perforation and bend the backing away to avoid deforming the super-thin edges, otherwise they won&#x27;t adhere smoothly and the edges are more noticeable and the dressing seems more likely to fall</li>
      <li>like them so much I&#x27;ve purchased several more packages</li>
      <li>I find that this is barely noticeable and is comfortable on my face.</li>
      <li>Although I LOVE this product I think I am going to buy the larger hydrocolloid bandages that I can cut to fit smaller areas.</li>
      <li>covers up a pimple so nice, takes about 2 patches to get the pimple down to almost nothing.</li>
      <li>Over all, I really do like the product and will continue to buy.  </li>
      <li>They were very visible, and didn&#x27;t have the tapered edge.  </li>
      <li>I am a really tan indian girl</li>
      <li>Very discreet on the face.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really use them after 2 times because you can see them under your makeup, and i felt</li>
      <li>These work very well for cystic type blemishes, to draw out the swelling.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s really just a guess.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t absorb quite as much as some others.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does a decent job of pulling the oil and gross stuff to the surface. Don&#x27;t expect an overnight miracle though. Not noticeable at all on your skin, I forgot they were even there in the morning</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. These things are so amazing because they blend right into my skin. I wear them during the day and no one even notices. They pull the pus from the pimple and are great at helping you NOT pick at them, which usually causes a secondary infection. True to what the package says, they are extremely waterproof and don&#x27;t come off unless you take it off yourself. I&#x27;ve already gone through several of these and will continue purchasing.</li>
    <li> These are super thin, and if you are careful when you remove them from the sheet they&#x27;re packaged on and don&#x27;t stretch them or accidentally stick them to themselves/fold them over onto themselves, they can be easily concealed with makeup. However, because they are so thin, it is a bit easier to stretch them and accidentally fold them onto themselves, which kind of ruins them or makes them only OK for if you&#x27;re not leaving the house that day. I mostly use these to keep myself from picking/popping/causing more damage to pimples, and these dots are very effective for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think these are great, and I prefer them over the hydroband universal acne patches (the only other one I&#x27;ve tried), which are thicker and have more obvious edges. I can&#x27;t compare them to nexcare or any other patches, as I haven&#x27;t tried them yet.</li>
    <li> These were good!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted really thin ones because I was like, &amp;#34;Oh I could wear them out!&amp;#34; but I never did because when you try to layer makeup over them it makes them more noticeable.  HOWEVER, if you do not want to wear foundation, these look invisible! I would put them on at night and wake up and forget I was even wearing them because they blend in so well and are so thin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they really did suck the stuff out typically and helped me not pick.  I ran out but I plan to buy more. I am going to look into a less expensive brand though that supplies more, even if they are bigger because like I said, I never wore mine out of the house anyways.  I just wish this package came with more of them.</li>
    <li> Love these! Way better value than dream dots.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  The edges are tapered, unlike some of the cheaper ones, which helps them stay on better. They are a matte finish where some of the others are shiny.  The matte finish helps them blend in and become less visible. These really work, even if you want to cover a small cut.  I have used them on my finger, shoulder, leg.  They are much less obtrusive than a band aid when you want to look your best.</li>
    <li> Works well to keep the area moist to heal quickly! I usually wear them over night .</li>
    <li> These work great.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> Great at covering up a spot - the tapered edges help it blend better that some of the other patches on the market. Very helpful in keeping a healing blemish concealed and clean. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Really love this product. Anytime I get a little zit, I go to sleep with one if these things on and it really shrinks it overnight. I will absolutely order these again.</li>
    <li> Never seen anything like it before! This product is amazing!! Sucks gunk right out of any type of blemish! Although I LOVE this product I think I am going to buy the larger hydrocolloid bandages that I can cut to fit smaller areas. Only because I used these up so quickly. I only used them at night unless I had them on a covered part of my body and they REALLY heal up blemishes FAST!! They are amazing with ingrown hair blemishes as well!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these!  I was skeptical at first that these would work, but I have been very pleased with the results!  I will admit that I always have the urge to be a &amp;#34;pimple popper&amp;#34; despite the fact that I am aware of the disadvantages to my skin.  When I have a zit (regular pimples and whiteheads), I apply these cover-dots ASAP.  This will help me to not want to pick the zit and make it worse, keeping out bacteria.  I typically apply these overnight while I am sleeping, and when I wake up, the cover-dot turns from clear to white, and my pimple is severely flattened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have used topical acne treatment to get rid of acne, it tends to dry out my skin, which can become a problem, and even make things worse!  But using these cover-dots, it actually does the opposite! My skin will be moisturized after all of the white puss is &amp;#34;sucked&amp;#34; out of the pimples overnight.  While it may not completely remove the entire pimple completely, it definitely makes significant progress eliminating it! (It depends on the severity of the pimple to begin with)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will mention is that it will take a few tries to figure out how to effectively remove the cover-dots from the packaging without accidentally ruining or pinching the edges!  I had trouble removing them from the backing sheet and keeping them in a perfect circle.  The good news is that with practice of about 3 tries, removing the cover-dots became a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used these cover-dots UNDER my make-up, even though it says that you can.  I just feel like that wouldn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have had issues with acne for years like me, and are sick of trying new products that you think will work, but actually don&#x27;t...then you should definitely try this product!</li>
    <li> The tapered edges of this product makes it superior to the competition. The edges blend in well, and are sticky enough to hold even a moist lesion.</li>
    <li> Very discreet on the face. Helps break the habit of touching an already bothered pore. Perforated backing makes it easy to remove. Holds up to face sweat on the treadmill at the gym. A staple in my purse, locker, and medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> These cover dots are a great product, but I do not think they are the &amp;#34;miracle-all-my-acne-prayers-have-been-answered&amp;#34; solution that everyone else thinks.  As many have said, you really do need to pop/lance the pimple first before putting the cover dot on.  This allows the pus and oils to seep out at a faster rate.  I noticed that when I put it on before poking at my pimple, the cover dot just made it come to a head, but did not actually drain it.  This is not an over-night solution.  I&#x27;ve been wearing my cover dot at night and during the day for 4 days now.  There has been a significant reduction in size and redness, but the pimple has not completely disappeared, and it really has taken several days to get to this point.  Over all, I really do like the product and will continue to buy.  I just want to manage people&#x27;s expectations when they are using this product.</li>
    <li> These care dots work pretty well and are reasonably priced for how many you get.  They are very thin and can be hard to notice you&#x27;ve had them on for a bit.  Be careful when removing them to not stretch them or fold them in half.  Seems to work best if you have popped the pimple (though I&#x27;m not recommending you do that), but typically helps with reducing pimple size and recovery as I&#x27;ll discuss next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To understand how they work, you must know that a pimple is caused by two factors; bacterial infection in a hair follicle and the subsequent immune response that causes inflammation.  Unless I&#x27;m missing something, the care dots only affect the second part by pulling immune cells (which have ate the bacteria and dead cellular debris) into the dot and by partially inhibiting further influx of immune cells into the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So these won&#x27;t necessarily lead to faster clearance of bacteria causing your pimple, but it does help with recovery due to faster clearance of the immune response.  On occasion I have had pimples that stick around for a bit, but are reduced in size.  Another advantage is that it helps prevent picking at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they are a great product that I have added to my collection of acne products, but understand that it won&#x27;t solve all acne problems due to the way it works.  Another product I like to use in conjunction (putting on before I put on an care dot) is salicyclic acid after I have washed the area.</li>
    <li> these are the best! Thinner than nexcare brand and these have really great sticking power! Works best if the pimple is either popped or lanced with a sterilized needle.</li>
    <li> These are freaking amazing!! AMAZING!  I saw this girl on Youtube use something like this and I couldn&#x27;t find the ones she was using.  This popped up and I decided to try it.  I get these cystic blemishes and they take forever to heal plus they are super red or even purple.  These help me cover them up and allow them to heal faster since the wound isn&#x27;t open for bacteria.  Great product!</li>
    <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve updated my rating from 3 stars to 5, because I really hate to be without these things now - I&#x27;ll panic a little if I forget to bring them on trips away from home.  No, they still don&#x27;t heal acne, but if I&#x27;ve expressed a pimple (because I can&#x27;t stop myself), these hydrocolloid dots provide a moist healing environment.  My picked-at pimple will heal faster and won&#x27;t get a dry scab, reducing any scarring.  I get acne on my chest and shoulders in the summer for some reason, and these dots help hide the red blemish, and they blend in well.  They work great on most of my face and for the most part aren&#x27;t very noticeable, but I will say that near my chin and mouth where my skin has a lot of movement from me talking and smiling, the dots will wrinkle at the edges, making them very noticeable, so do keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try the Nexcare brand of acne dots, and those have raised edges that are noticeable, and they also don&#x27;t stay on well at all - each morning I&#x27;d wake up to find the acne dot had come off and was somewhere in the bedsheets or had restuck onto me elsewhere.  These Cover-Dots don&#x27;t have that problem at all, they stay on for 48 hours or more.  Very happy with these Cover-Dots from SMARTMED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;Do these dots make my acne disappear?  No.  I can wear these for 24 hours and they stay in place despite my oily skin, but they don&#x27;t make my acne go away, or suck out pus from an unpopped zit (ew, sorry I&#x27;m mentioning it) or anything.  If a zit has been popped it does help the area stay clean so I&#x27;m not dabbing with a tissue every 2 minutes, and helps it heal that way.  It also keeps me from picking at acne (which is a big problem for me) which is the main reason I use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best to remove them after washing your face with warm water, it helps loosen the adhesive of the dot.  I don&#x27;t have any experience trying to cover these with makeup, as I just wear them around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, an &amp;#34;acne cure&amp;#34;?  Not for me.  But it keeps me from picking at my face and that&#x27;s a good thing (I&#x27;m my own worst enemy).rom picking at my face and that&#x27;s a good thing (I&#x27;m my own worst enemy).</li>
    <li> These are the best hydrocolloid dressings I&#x27;ve found for acne, but I find them rather pricey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to being an acne-haver, I&#x27;m also a skin picker, so I use these on places where I&#x27;ve hurt my skin to resist the urge to fiddle with a blemish or small scab.  I wear these anywhere that might be visible and the cheaper, thicker kinds of dressings by other brands on stuff that will be covered by clothing.  They really are not too noticeable, though as others have noted attempting to cover them with makeup/foundation was not a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about these as compared to other hydrocolloids, you really do have to tear the paper backing along the perforation and bend the backing away to avoid deforming the super-thin edges, otherwise they won&#x27;t adhere smoothly and the edges are more noticeable and the dressing seems more likely to fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly if you work out I&#x27;ve found that sweat + hydrocolloid isn&#x27;t a good combo; I tend to have to change them after a heavy workout because the saltiness trapped beneath seems irritating to my skin.</li>
    <li> My experience with these wasn&#x27;t great. First off, I will say that they do work in the sense that they do pull the pus out. But.. What I didn&#x27;t like was that they only work on pimples where the white head is fully formed. They also didn&#x27;t blend in well with my mineral powder. I can&#x27;t wear them during the day for this reason. I will wear one at night if needed. They&#x27;re okay.</li>
    <li> covers up a pimple so nice, takes about 2 patches to get the pimple down to almost nothing.</li>
    <li> Does not work on excema  skin or deep rooted pustules on face.  For small acne works great.</li>
    <li> I thought these were okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  They are a nice size, cover well and stay where you put them.  They are also good at keeping your fingers from picking at spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  They didn&#x27;t really seem to absorb as well as similar products and because they are so thin it was easy to get an edge to fold over on itself before application, essentially making that dot a loss.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best possible solution for me.  To give a little more background, I have normal/dry combo skin, and I get cystic blemishes at times.  I&#x27;m very pale, so even the regular hydrocolloid bandages on the market are too yellow and visible. I have tried just about every acne solution out there, including pricey systems like Proactiv. Gentle formulas still end up causing me to have dry flaky patches, and sometimes the blemish still has residual oil/pus trapped, which inhibits healing.  I also have a tendency to end up with small scabs that are easily irritated when washing my face, and the use of coverup exacerbates the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using different transparent dressings such as Tegaderm, which is very expensive and tends to appear shiny, and doesn&#x27;t always stay on or gets wrinkles. I also struggle with having to cut it up into smaller pieces as I don&#x27;t need a huge patch for a small blemish.  I discovered the hydrocolloid acne patches when looking for smaller sized bandages, and ordered a few brands. The other brands were thicker, more yellow, and did not stay on very well.  They were very visible, and didn&#x27;t have the tapered edge.  The Cover-Dots were much better, and do a great job of helping me avoid squeezing or using makeup that clogs more pores or causes the blemish to crust up and look even worse. They&#x27;ve reduced healing time substantially, and have helped me cut back on makeup use.  I&#x27;ve already recommended them to friends who also felt they were a really fabulous solution to their breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have mild to moderate acne that is aesthetically distracting and don&#x27;t want to keep using makeup to cover it, this could be a good way to handle it.  I don&#x27;t know how visible they are on other complexions, but they&#x27;re barely visible on my face until you&#x27;re really close up, and far less visible than using coverup makeup in my experience so far.  You can leave them on for a while, even several days, but I usually change mine twice aday, especially when the white area is visible showing that the bandage has absorbed exudate. You can attempt to put makeup over them, but the smooth surface doesn&#x27;t really allow makeup to stick.  Maybe airbrush foundation would be more effective but I don&#x27;t use regular foundation enough to have purchased one.&lt;br /&gt;I like them so much I&#x27;ve purchased several more packages so I can continue using them and share them with others so they can also try them and enjoy the ease of use and great results.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I used them as soon as they arrived. Follow the directions accordingly and leave on overnight and you will immediately see a reduction in the size and redness of any blemish.</li>
    <li> These actually worked better than expected</li>
    <li> These things are awesome!! Luckily my acne days are over, but I always still get a few zits signaling when Aunt Flo is due for a visit. If I throw one of these dots on after squeezing one, within a few hours the inflammation is gone and any excess puss has been pulled out by the dot, leaving it flat and scab-less. The little bit of redness is easily then covered by makeup. Normally it&#x27;s been the never-ending cycle of picking the scab, getting an infection and starting all over. The dots stop the cycle in its tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by how invisible they are. I&#x27;ve yet to experiment with how makeup holds over it, but even without makeup, I have felt comfortable wearing one during the day. I mean, it&#x27;s visible up-close, but not so noticeable that people would look twice in passing. The only problem is that they are somewhat difficult to pull off the backing, and sometimes you ruin the edge in doing so, making it not lay totally smooth on your skin. Then it is much more noticeable. I like that they include way more for the money than other brands out there though.</li>
    <li> This helped to cover up lazered moles or sun spots that were healing on my face. They are better than bandAids and hardly noticeable.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all for me. I think maybe it would work really well for someone who uses foundation and wants to cover their pimples as to not make them worse by covering them in make-up but I don&#x27;t wear make-up like that so it&#x27;s really just a guess. I tried this product two nights in a row, and if anything my pimple was worse.</li>
    <li> these are ok.  didn&#x27;t really use them after 2 times because you can see them under your makeup, and i felt&lt;br /&gt;like everyone noticed something on my face.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you how good these ACNE DOTS are.........over the last 20 yrs I&#x27;ve spent approx $1000 + each year on acne products.  I could not stop picking, squeezing zits them to save my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do these hide even the biggest pimples, but it sucks the junk out of your pore overnight.  I almost wish I was 13 again, life wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad if I had these acne dots when I was a teenager.  Don&#x27;t just buy 1 box, trust me your gonna use these for the rest of your life and pass them out to everyone you know.</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered I loved the product so I ordered more. I work in restaurants and the dots keep existing blemishes from getting worse due to the grease, heat and sweat. The second package had the dots all on one sheet with no perforations to get them off the edges rolled up every time and then they wont stay on. After communicating this issue I received replacements for the ones I didn&#x27;t like and I have since tried some other Brands, (Nexcare is horrible) these are fabulous as long as the sheets are perforated.  I will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Without going into a lot of detail, these definitely will help bring cystic acne to the surface (in as little as a couple hours). I was very impressed!</li>
    <li> Although I prefer using a hydrocolloid bandage that&#x27;s thicker (and therefore more absorbent) and I&#x27;m willing to endure a bit of hassle to cut those thicker bandages into little squares, here are the pros of this product: these acne care dots are easy to use (thanks to perforated backing) and seem to do the job, and they don&#x27;t seem to leave a residue after removal. Depending upon the severity of your acne, these dots can get expensive. Usage tips--I do think they are a bit too conspicuous on my cheeks (as they don&#x27;t move with my skin when I smile or make other expressions). When I am out in public, I like them for my forehead, with my bangs for cover. In general, hydrocolloid has been a wonderful discovery for me, for draining pimples and reducing acne-related swelling, although it seems to help to puncture/lance the pimple first, carefully, with a sterilized tool.</li>
    <li> its great, just takes a little time. so be patient.</li>
    <li> Works great! Stays in place better than others I&#x27;ve tried but it is super thin so it doesn&#x27;t absorb quite as much as some others.</li>
    <li> I love these so very much! I tend to be a picker which is not doing my poor skin any favors. I have adult hormonal acne that I can&#x27;t do much about because I can&#x27;t take hormonal birth control, so I treat it the best I can. These plus CeraVe, benzol peroxide, AHA lotion, and red box Strydex pads have made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> I used this and it actually works, it covers the white heads in a way that if you wear it to work you can not see the white head and I am of ethnic skin tone, it some how sucks the pus out of the white head...i have used 2 so far and it helped me not to pop them and not to get a scar...</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product!  It does what it says.  After awhile it seems to start curling up around the edges so it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day . . .but other than that, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have horrible sebaceous acne and these are lifesavers! I can hide some pretty nasty puss filled bumps. I can actually go to work. It is a little visible but a million times less visible than the actual zit. It draws out all of the puss while I sleep. Within two days the zit is on its way to healing.</li>
    <li> OK.  After reading many reviews I decided to give these a try. I love them!  I use it at night and wakeup the next morning to a softer,  healed area.  With that said I was a bit bummed that it shows under makeup. No matter what I did I couldn&#x27;t get it to be unnoticeable (see photo)  But oh well. . They still rock!</li>
    <li> I find that this is barely noticeable and is comfortable on my face. (I&#x27;ve tried another brand prior to this one, which was visible on my skin while this brand is thinner and blends in.) I use it overnight to cover if i get the occasional pimple and then completely forget it&#x27;s on my face. (Others around me were surprised when I told them I had several on my face so no one else noticed them either!) It doesn&#x27;t come off when I wash my face in the morning, or in the shower unless I peel it off, so it&#x27;s staying power is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work at minimizing pimples but good for protecting those areas</li>
    <li> Not as fast working or as absorbent as some of the less camouflaged versions by 3M. Also they are quite tricky to apply being as the edges are tapered for a flush and almost hidden appearance. But because they do blend in so well, I do like them for hiding inflamed spots.</li>
    <li> These totally work amazing to heal my acne. They are almost invisible...  but not quite enough for me to want to wear in public. i couldn&#x27;t blend with any makeup i have without showing the outline of the circle. Also, they are kind of difficult to unstick from sheet &amp; apply without getting messed up. it took some practice to get right.   5 stars if they get it right in the future because i will likely order these again.</li>
    <li> These work very well for cystic type blemishes, to draw out the swelling.  Not quite thin enough to wear out in public in my opinion, but much thinner than other brands I&#x27;ve tried such as Nexcare, and they stay on very well.  I wear them overnight and find the blemish will be dramatically reduced in the morning.</li>
    <li> I am a really tan indian girl and it was pretty invisible ( the dots are white/translucent) so if you&#x27;re any paler than this, its perfect. Reallly big area, but the tapered edges make this last a lot longer than the asian acne dots.</li>
    <li> effective. i used this before going to bed and the next morning, my pimple reduced in size</li>
