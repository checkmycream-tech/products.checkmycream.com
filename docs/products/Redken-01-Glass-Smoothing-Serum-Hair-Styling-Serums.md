    <li> This stuff is amazing. It takes so little and makes such a difference in my hair. So soft and manageable! I cannot be without it!</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist. I work in a Redken elite salon. If you want to by your products online you should look up diversion with salon products first. This packaging is at least 6 years old. It&#x27;s been discontinued for about 3 years now. If you liked glass redken has many other oils that you will love. Just check with your local redken salon. They can help you out. Also, if you think your getting a deal buying online, your wrong. I was extremely surprised at the high prices they are charging for these out of date products. They might not even the product the bottle says it is!!</li>

    <li> Had a perm wave done at a salon &amp; I&#x27;m lucky to have any hair left. The technician really fried my hair and the brutal, dry winter air made it worse. A different hair dresser recently told me about putting this in the ends only. I use it on wet hair. I also use it on my excessively curly haired dog. She gets quite dry in the winter. This stuff helps her fur stay soft. The product works great! I gave it 4 stars for the high price. However a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I may be in my sixties - but using Redken products - my hair doesn&#x27;t know it!  JUST A DROP of this Serum rubbed into palm and applied to wet hair before styling - completely banishes anything even remotely resembling frizzies.  LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product, I have used alot of different products but this one rules. Would not used anything else</li>

    <li> I like this product.  Received it when the site said I would.</li>
    <li> the lady that cuts my hair used this after cutting my hair and I liked the way it made my hair lay.</li>
