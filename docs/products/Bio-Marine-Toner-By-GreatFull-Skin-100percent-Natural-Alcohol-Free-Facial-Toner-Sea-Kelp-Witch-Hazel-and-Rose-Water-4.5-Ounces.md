<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So...this toner is great!  As soon as I hear the word &#x27;toner&#x27;, I think of those alcohol-based drugstore ones that burn your face.  Not this one!  I wash my face in the morning and at night with my Clarisonic.  My skin already is pretty darn clean after that, but I have been following up with this GreatFull Skin Marine Toner.  It feels very soothing!  It does have a witch hazel type smell, but that does not bother me in the least, as I use witch hazel for other things.  I have combination skin (oiliness in the t-zone), and this toner seems to help control that oil.  And I absolutely love that this is 100% natural.  Try this...I think you will love it  :)  I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback. All opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s best skin toner.</li>
    <li> Smells like roses! Leaves my face clean and refreshed! I would recommend giving this toner a try.</li>
    <li> So cool skin water. The scent is very good , mild and cold. The bottle is kind of smaller than I thought , but the toner is good. I recommend.</li>
    <li> It is really nice. I listen to my heart.&lt;br /&gt;So as to purchase frequently in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you.</li>
    <li> it helps with some of my acne, but hasn&#x27;t cleared it all up yet, still using, &amp; still hoping for more improvement</li>
    <li> Just ordered for first time..  Can&#x27;t wait to try it out...  By the reviews. It&#x27;s sounds amazing...  Have to get it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Greatfull Skin Toner for about a week now.  I like the fact you only have to use a few drops and message into your face. It works really well with my moisturizer which is a good thing.  In only a few days I can tell a difference.  I am surprised how well this works.  I am always skeptical of trying things like this but I have not been disappointed in this product at all.</li>
    <li> First, thank you for the opportunity to use this great product . It is perfect in every way .</li>
    <li> it is very good i&#x60;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> it is good for me. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love it and at least it works for me.</li>
    <li> Cool and refreshing on my skin. Use nightly to clean all my make up away</li>
    <li> Thanks, it was good choice for me.</li>
    <li> I love it. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Cool Breeze (check)&lt;br /&gt;Soft Scent (check)&lt;br /&gt;Does not burn like alcohol based astringent (check)&lt;br /&gt;Natural Ingredients (check)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this out after an good exfoliate wash and expected that burn you normally experience with other astringent toners and surprise surprise this one does not burn. It removes dirt and unclogs pores without the burn; leaving a cool feeling on your face. This toner smells like the beach and is made right here in the U.S.A. I have really sensitive skin and I used the toner for a week in my nightly facial wash routine. I experienced no dry skin or skin irritation. It&#x27;s a pretty good product and definitely a bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> Great!!!! I like this product</li>
    <li> after showering it made my skin feel so clean, and fresh. it smells so good too, i haven&#x27;t used it for too long yet, but i will definitely do an update when i used it long enough to give my skin an even skin tone.</li>
    <li> This is a great toner! It is the best one I have tried. I love the scent. The fact that it is alcohol free influenced my purchase. The ingredient list is very impressive! I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful about every product I use. This toner leaves my skin feeling very refreshed and hydrated. It also seems to soothe my skin irritation/inflammation. I will be back to buy more!</li>
    <li> Not a good product for me  - I even ordered another for my husband thinking it would help his eczema - very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased this with toner. It has a light scent. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either. My skin feels even cleaner after using this. I can clearly see on my cotton round the remaining dirt that was left over even after cleaning my face. I can say that this is a toner is definitely on my list of &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> LOVE that all the ingredients are natural and reallllllly love that there are probiotics in the mix!</li>
    <li> Choose the right !&lt;br /&gt;A good product&lt;br /&gt; Do not regret choice&lt;br /&gt;For smooth skin!For smooth skin!</li>
    <li> This toner is amazing!  It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Is an excellent product. Fits my skin and soft  I can feel that the skin is healing.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product! I use it after washing my face and before my moisturizer. I love the way that it makes my skin feel. It smells great too!  After i use it, it&#x27;s almost like i can feel it working to remove the dirt and oils trapped in my pores. This toner has definately started evening out my skin tone and and has made my skin much brighter. I love the fact that the ingredients are all natural and it has no alcohol in it. I am very pleased with the Greatfull Skin Marine Toner and i am very happy that i have added it to my skincare routine!</li>
    <li> Has a lovely, clean scent, and is gentle and thorough on face. Have only used it a few days, but I do like it very much....and I usually stop toners immediately because they&#x27;re too much work lol&lt;br /&gt;I am actually using, and enjoying, this one.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT TONER I REALLY ENJOY THIS. IT DOESN&#x27;T BURN MY SKIN AND HAS REALLY HELPED TO CLEAR MY SKIN UP. IT HAS A DIFFERENT SMELL, NOT BAD THOUGH. I REALLY WILL CONTINUE TO REPURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AS IT HAS DONE WONDERS FOR MY SKIN~!</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal. I was reluctant to buy and use because my skin is obscenely sensitive. The first thing I noticed was the ingredients list... it looked ok but not all natural ingredients equate to high quality. Next thing I noticed about this product once I opened it was the smell. Sooooo awesome. It smells and feels like a holistic product. Very high quality. Did I mention how much I love the smell???  I would soooo love a body lotion or oil in this fragrance. Absolutely zero irritation when used alone or in conjunction with my other facial regimen. Good stuff! Thanks :)</li>
    <li> A nice toner. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or dry. I will buy again. GreatFull Skin has many wonderful products. I have used many of them. If you want less chemicals, and to have beautiful skin, please try their products.</li>
    <li> This produce is so comforting and hydrating. I use it morning and evening after cleansing.I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and can already see a difference. My skin is smoother, and my completion is clearer. The scent is light but very refreshing.</li>
    <li> First, I LOVE that this toner is a natural product. It has a very...calming scent that almost feels like aroma therapy. The toner gets all the left over dirt and product that is left AFTER washing your face. The stuff you don&#x27;t see and think you got rid of with face wash and water. It is not harsh at all. It is not drying to the skin. I enjoy using this twice daily after cleansing and before applying a moisturizer. It&#x27;s currently my fave facial toner that I have not made myself. The company had great customer service and I received the product faster than I thought!</li>
    <li> Product had no seal and leaked in package. It has a very strong smell that does fade. I do like that it removes makeup residue that was left behind after washing my face. I haven&#x60;t used it long enough to say if it is improving my skin. It hasn&#x60;t caused me to break out though.</li>
    <li> I was able to test this product via BuView and I am thankful that I could try it. Bought it on Jan. 6th and received it on the 12th which is not bad, especially since it was shipped through lasership (according to their reviews, I got lucky). At first when I opened up the bottle the scent hit me with vengeance, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to be able to handle it. But, once you put it on your face the scent somehow changes into a lovely fragrance that isn&#x27;t over powering or irritating. You can definitely tell that this product is made with natural ingredients. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a natural skin toner that works! Will buy in the future!</li>
    <li> I love GreatFull Skin and happily try all of their products.  The product always arrives quickly and packaged nicely.  This toner met and exceeded my expectations.  It is a great quality toner and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> You can feel it work right away! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the look out for alcohol free toners and wanted to try and review this one that I received for free* to see how it compared to other toners. I marked this one down one star because after using it for several weeks I&#x27;m not seeing any major improvements or changes to my skin overall. Skin tone, pores, acne are all still the same. However that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t like it and that it is not a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about the product is that I can see that it does remove dirt, I use it after washing my face and it removes anything that my facial soap had missed. It&#x27;s there and obvious so I know it is doing it&#x27;s job that way. The other thing I really like is that it is alcohol free and made with natural ingredients. This is a big deal to me because I have both sensitive skin and combination skin so alcohol can be both very drying and irritating to my skin. Often products with alcohol have a burning sensation while I am using them. Using this one it has a cooling refreshing feeling not a burning. In my oily spots it helps to clean the greasy feeling off my face without overly drying that area or my dry areas out even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I want to point out is the smell. It is very strong, I&#x27;m pretty indifferent to it though. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it either. It doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to make me stop using this product, however if you are someone sensitive to scents just be warned it is very strong. It&#x27;s only while your are directly in contact with the product. As soon as I close up the bottle and throw away the cotton ball the smell is gone and does not linger on your skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of receiving this item for free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Scent is very powerful. use little by little .</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Wasn&#x27;t sure at first but now... it smells really good &amp; leaves my face feeling refreshed.  I use after washing with castile soap &amp; before applying my coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product.&lt;br /&gt;Good price.</li>
    <li> I have heard others talk about skin toners and all of the bad stories about them burning , irritating or drying their skin out so I have stayed clear from any toners until I ran across this toner. A premium 100% all natural product. After reading some of the reviews on this product I definitely wanted to try it and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. My face not only looks better but it feels cleaner too. I normally would just wash my face with my regular cleanser and then moisturize and I thought my skin was fine until I started using this toner.  I really have a hard time trying out any new facial products  because nearly everything breaks my skin out but , not this toner. This product works on all skin types and will not dry your skin out or irritate it and no burn because it is 100% all natural !&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> When the toner makeup on my face after I was shaving, my skin does not hurt, I feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> Noticeably tightens my pores. I appreciate the all natural ingredients of this product.</li>
    <li> Good choice for my skin. I love it</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to find an all natural toner that works. Most toners are filled with ingredients that I would never allow to touch my skin. This product has no scent, which I really liked. It is light and refreshing. I will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> A small item but I feel this skin toner&#x27;s good to my skin myself.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this toner - it isn&#x27;t too strong - and leaves my skin feeling great!</li>
    <li> Fresh clean scent, leaves my skin soft and clean.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> Also good quality products and excellent usability.</li>
    <li> All the toners that I have ever used smelled like alcohol. This one doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. I love how it makes my skin feel soft and firm at the same time. It&#x27;s great that I can use it on my dry forehead and the rest of my face that isn&#x27;t dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product to others? Yes It&#x27;s the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product for free to review. I state my own opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the way it feels on my skin. I was a little skeptical at first because it was so liquid-y but found that I like this better than most serum-y kinds of toners and such and love it so much more for that! It goes on easy and melts into the skin, an absolute must-have for your beauty and/or skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> Really nice.  Good for cleaning and moisturizing makes my skin really smooth.  Love the smell it&#x27;s not like other toners with the alcohol smell.</li>
    <li> I really like this toner.  I use it every day after day after cleansing.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft, never stripped.  I also like the scent, very clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This is a great toner! First of all it smells great. I absolutely love how refreshed it makes my skin feel. I use a sonic facial brush to cleanse my face so I feel that my face is pretty clean. After I clean my face I use the Marine Toner on a cotton round and I&#x27;m amazed at the amount of dirt and make-up that is on the cotton round. The Marine Toner really does clean out my pores. It even gets rid of the left over eye make-up too. I have combination skin. Some times it&#x27;s on the oily side and some times it&#x27;s on the dry side. My skin is also sensitive. I like that this toner balances my skin. I struggle to find toners that balance my skin. They either dry out my skin or keep my skin too oily. This toner keeps my skin just right! At the same time it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin since I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a toner that is going to balance your skin you might want to give this toner a try. It&#x27;s also great if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I suffer from very dry skin, yet a few spots on my face can get oily especially near the T zone. I always have a tough time treating the clogged pores on my face because most of my skin is so dry. No lie, every toner that I have ever used has always either irritated my skin and/or dried out my skin to no end. I basically gave up and up until now haven&#x27;t used a toner in a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to lie, I was very skeptical about trying out this product on my skin. I already had it pictured in my head that my face would sting, burn, be firetruck red, and turn out being drier than before I started. But I gave this Marine Toner by GreatFull Skin a try and I am so thankful I did. I used this on a cotton round, and started cleaning my skin. I was baffled when I didn&#x27;t feel any stinging or burning sensation. My face wasn&#x27;t turning fireball red. And the best part, the toner was removing all the yuckies that my makeup remover had missed. After I was done, I waited 10 minutes to see how my face would look at feel. I was surprised when I didn&#x27;t see flakes, and irritated skin. My skin felt pretty normal. It wasn&#x27;t babys bottom soft, but it was normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s it. I am sold hook, line and sinker. I use this now about 2-3 times a week. A little goes a long way with this, so you will get a good amount of uses out of this bottle. It does have a scent to it, witch hazel meets ocean kinda scent. It is strong at first, but it goes away. Nothing too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am beyond pleased with this toner. I cannot recommend it enough if you have skin like mine and are fed up with toners that wreck havoc your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> This toner has very little scent &amp; makes my skin appear bright, youthful &amp; luminous. It also makes my skin feel super soft. It&#x27;s great that it has no alcohol &amp; contains all natural ingredients. Love that this comes as a spray bottle. All you have to do is quick spray to your face and rub it in with your fingers or simply just let it dry while you are getting ready for the other steps. It really helped my skin absorb serums much better, and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> I love this skin toner, it really makes a difference. I use it in the morning and at night. I have noticed it helps my pores and makes my skin feel so clean, its amazing how you think your skin is clean after washing it until you finish with this Marine Toner.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this product, being made of all natural ingredients. I enjoyed the way it left my skin feeling, clean with only a slight tingle from the witch hazel extracts in the product. The product wasn&#x27;t overly drying, and it seems to work very well. My only complaint is the scent, which actually draws me away from the product. I could not stand the scent. Very perfumed /overly fragrant, and I don&#x27;t like that , especially in a product on my face. I will be trying the product in my hair to see what it does,  but unfortunately I just couldn&#x27;t take the scent. I tried for several days and it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This is cool I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Marine Toner.  Being a middle aged woman I have seen a positive change in my skin.  After washing my face I apply the toner before my moisturizer.  The toner has a very pleasant scent.  It does not have any burning/tingling effect like others that are mostly alcohol.  It has evened out my skin tone from all the little red blemishes and closed up the larger pores are the nose area.  Being that the ingredients in this Marine Toner is all natural makes me feel better about using it on my face.  I&#x27;m very happy and would definitely recommend this toner.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this toner that much at first, however I really impressed. It&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner for about a week and my skin feels amazing! There is no stinging and it does not dry your skin out. I just apply a little after washing my face and then follow up with a good moisturizer and my winter skin is a thing of the past! I have been very happy with all of GreatFull Skin&#x27;s products!! Quick shipping and great customer service. I will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I love this product..leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed, and smells great!</li>
    <li> I use this in between my normal face routine. I love it. It does aid in my skin care. It helps remove makeup better and it acts as an extra step personally for me after I wash my face. It&#x27;s not drying like some other toners may be  and doesn&#x27;t really have that alcohol like smell to it that you may find in others. With also I reduced amount of stinging.</li>
    <li> This is awesome because of its convenience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 10 days and I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.  A recent pregnancy has wrecked havoc on my skin - excessive redness and oil in my T-zone, stubborn whiteheads and under-skin zits, not to mention the overall dullness.  With this product, I noticed a result almost immediately.  I use it in the morning after I wash my face, and at night before I go to bed.  By day 6 I noticed that the whiteheads were greatly diminished.  By day 10, they are all but practically gone.  The redness and shine in my T zone also improved, and my skin feels clean, fresh and supple after each use.  The great smell certainly is a plus.  I will definitely keep using this as part of my regular routine from now on!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time tonight. It made my skin feel clean and fresh but not tight. I think I am going to LOVE this toner!</li>
    <li> great quality! good price!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and residue free. I love the light scent of this toner, it smells slightly floral and citrus-like. This is a gentle toner since it is alcohol free which is great for me. Sometimes toners are excessively strong due to alcohol and they will burn if there is an opening on your skin (a pimple that has opened for example) which is the worst feeling! This toner makes my skin feel clean, moisturized with no stinging or unpleasant scent! This stuff is loaded with beneficial ingredients too. It is an all natural and cruelty-free product.</li>
    <li> Great product , smells great . Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean .</li>
    <li> Great product!! Love using it and it has helped my skin.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion.... i like this product. It&#x27;s hard to find different products that work will for your face. This toner is alcohol free and I love that. It makes my face feel nice and smooth. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how I look younger.  I will definitely continue to use this toner on my face.</li>
    <li> Love how my skin feels with this! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love this product more than any of my others. The smell is great and it has made my skin super soft. I use it twice a day &amp; my skin has never looked better. This is the 3rd product I&#x27;ve ordered from Greatfull Skin and that on its own should hold merit to the quality of the products this company offers, but my best advice is to try it yourself. You will not be disappointed and products you currently use will soon be replaced by those bearing the &#x27;Greatfull Skin&#x27; logo :)</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:47dca5acd9ceebb7b3a2ea7eb51deadb]] The Marine Skin Toner is amazing and worth the money! If you have pimples or acne just apply the toner on your face. I saw results the very next day. Looking in mirror to see it was clearing up was a shock.</li>
    <li> I loved the  Marine toner. I hadn&#x27;t used a toner previously, but had been thinking about adding one to my skin care regimen. I loved how fresh and clean this made my skin feel. Like a breath of fresh air.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here . Same as my other toner yet more expensive and less product.</li>
    <li> Excellent toner!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> My skin felt amazing after using even without following with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and feels wonderful on my face!</li>
    <li> Perfect in the morning!</li>
