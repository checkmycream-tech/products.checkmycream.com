      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I feel clean and soft .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it needs a little more scent to it but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth losing a star over!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all positive...</li>
      <li>I actually first picked up a bar of this soap at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please if you suffer from moderate acne stop whatever your using and just try the simple way,this soap and a good serus (i use pure rose oil) and also cut out dairy products and white sugar, you&#x60;ll thank me later</li>
      <li>If you read labels, you&#x27;ve certainly seen sodium lauryl sulfate, a chemical surfactant to increase lather, and propylene glycol,a penetration enhancer.  </li>
      <li>Each bar is huge, and will definitely last you a while.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this soap!</li>
      <li>I have very skin.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap because I have dry and sensitive skin and this soap has really helped me in keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>Her effusive raves led me to try them myself, and I found a whole new experience.  </li>
      <li>Lasts so much longer than regular brand soap and is totally worth it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x60;ve tried every soap and acne medication both topical and oral on the market(except for accutane, i refuse, too many side effects especially for women)nothing worked permanently.</li>

      <li>Love this soap and it last a heck of a long time....</li>
      <li>It is the first soap that I have found that does not dry out my hands.</li>
      <li>Soap seems nice but havent had enough time to use it long enough to see any results yet.</li>
      <li>I originally bought another brand of dead sea salt soap thinking that because it was more expensive, it must be better.  </li>
      <li>last bonus, this, like other natural soaps, is good to the last sliver.  </li>
      <li>But this soap leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of soaps.  </li>
      <li>my husband say my skin is not my age by far</li>
      <li>Something I need for my highly sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x60;s just wow.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate and this soap really helps.</li>
      <li>I have never spent as much money on a bar of soap--but I have no regrets as this soap has so far performed well in moisturizing my mother&#x27;s 93 y/o dry itchy flaky skin when she takes a shower/bath</li>
      <li>This soap seems to clear up the &amp;#34;detoxifying effects&amp;#34; of the other soap, so I am very grateful for it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a recent convert to natural and organic soaps, having bought them for my daughter who&#x27;s into all that stuff.  </li>
      <li>Some things, like One With Nature Dead Sea Mineral Soap, are worth the additional cost.</li>
      <li>Does not dry your skin, even in winter!  </li>
      <li>Much longer than the other brands that I&#x27;ve tried</li>

<ol>
    <li> I love this soap!  I think it smells great.  It has been wonderful for my dry skin and eczema in New England.  The liquid hand soap and lotion are also great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Long time user, excellent product!  Does not dry your skin, even in winter!  Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have intolerances to many things perfumed any thing gives me migraines. Many kinds of soap make me sick this does not and makes my skin so soft and nice my husband say my skin is not my age by far</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good soap, leaves skin soft, even i don&#x27;t like the smell too much.</li>
    <li> This soap is one of the best bars of soap I have ever used. It&#x27;s now also the only brand I use, the dead sea salts and Shea butter truly benefit the skin.</li>
    <li> got on time-2 days. Soap seems nice but havent had enough time to use it long enough to see any results yet. I do like the way its all natural and it leathers great.</li>
    <li> This product is very high-end, cleans my skin well and leaves it at a perfect PH level.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this soap.  I love this soap because I have dry and sensitive skin and this soap has really helped me in keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> My husband and daughter love this soap. No strong smell. Which is good because we are all sensitive in that respect. It holds up well in the shower and doesn&#x27;t get mushy.</li>
    <li> Love this soap and it last a heck of a long time....Much longer than the other brands that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. I feel clean and soft . There is no soap residue and the bar last a long time. If you like bar soaps, you need to try this one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great soap. And seems to last a long time.</li>
    <li> The soap was like a bar of lotion, without the chemicals and additives, I don&#x27;t want. I was turned on to the Dead Sea Minerals some time ago, by accident, by mistakably making eye contact with a mall vendor, No mistake, the additive has some real properties, plus the shea butter, is needed in the winter, when the weather is cold.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Bought the pack in December for Christmas and we are on the last bar now.  Lasts so much longer than regular brand soap and is totally worth it.  I&#x27;d say it needs a little more scent to it but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth losing a star over!  I just bought the Lavender bars and will try that soon!</li>
    <li> What more can I say, gentel, moisterizing, great quantity, great price. Did I mention it helped me calm my eczema in the horrid winter months AND summer too?!? I stopped using rx topicals bc of the side effect and only use Eucerine, Cetaphil body wash for eczema, this soap and the sun rays (soaking in the sun for about 20mins does wonders along w these other products). Im sick of medications to control my eczema This soap works 10 times better w out the medication. And the bars last FOREVER Im sold!</li>
    <li> Great soap, worth the price.</li>
    <li> Today I received my 3rd box...18 bars total! I am so sold on the One With Nature soaps, I&#x27;ve ordered a couples others just to try. I have a bar in the shower and one at the bathroom sink...last? Oh my goodness, these soaps last forever. They are a bit Expensive when compared with other soaps but in the end, you will actually save money. They are non drying. It&#x27;s all positive...can&#x27;t think of one negative to say about this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent! I have hard water and most soaps do nothing to combat the dryness hard water causes. But this soap leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized. I highly recommend this soap!</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome!  I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of soaps.  My skin was very dry and itchy when I started to use this soap.  It has rejuvenated my skin!  My skin still has a few dry patches but is getting healthier every day.  I will keep buying this soap and it does not have a bad scent that makes me sneeze either.  If you have skin allergies or scent allergies, buy this soap!</li>
    <li> A high quality soap and good value. Each bar is huge, and will definitely last you a while. Skin feels great after use!</li>
    <li> Love all their products, never a disappointment</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It is the first soap that I have found that does not dry out my hands. All of the soaps by this company are quite nice. But the ones with Shea Butter definitely work best for me.</li>
    <li> Always bought this soap at World Market but got it for a much better price. I live in a very dry climate and this soap really helps. It came very fast and in great shape.</li>
    <li> Have not use as yet but I&#x27;m expecting I&#x27;ll be very pleased!👍</li>
    <li> Some things, like One With Nature Dead Sea Mineral Soap, are worth the additional cost. I have never spent as much money on a bar of soap--but I have no regrets as this soap has so far performed well in moisturizing my mother&#x27;s 93 y/o dry itchy flaky skin when she takes a shower/bath; even I use it and I have no need for moisturizing my skin. Previously I would have to apply something like Aveeno to mom&#x27;s legs after she came out of the shower/bath. Now such applications are once in a while. The bar is larger than usual and lasts a long time. I don&#x27;t know what the minerals in it are but the shea butter moistureizer works wonders to help preserve mom&#x27;s aged anatomy. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Where do i begin...this soap is IT. I&#x60;ve had moderate acne since i was 14, never severe but always present. I&#x60;m 27.  I&#x60;ve tried every soap and acne medication both topical and oral on the market(except for accutane, i refuse, too many side effects especially for women)nothing worked permanently. I resently decided to stop everything i was using, and just try a natural soap followed by a good serum. I came across this one and omg, let me just say its only been 2 days but it evened out my skin tone, i have alot less acne alomst non existant my face feels cleaner. It&#x60;s just wow. Ill keep you guys posted after a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please if you suffer from moderate acne stop whatever your using and just try the simple way,this soap and a good serus (i use pure rose oil) and also cut out dairy products and white sugar, you&#x60;ll thank me later</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to natural and organic soaps, having bought them for my daughter who&#x27;s into all that stuff.  Her effusive raves led me to try them myself, and I found a whole new experience.  If you read labels, you&#x27;ve certainly seen sodium lauryl sulfate, a chemical surfactant to increase lather, and propylene glycol,a penetration enhancer.  These are just 2 of many ubiquitous \\&quot;soap\\&quot; ingredients in these petroleum based products that would more accurately be called detergents. You won&#x27;t find them here, and you won&#x27;t miss them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s 9 ingredients listed on this label, each one recognizable.  No need for lather enhancers, as the natural soap ingredients make a wonderful cleansing lather that doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  This one even leaves my skin \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean while still not drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last bonus, this, like other natural soaps, is good to the last sliver.  Having been used to soap that just didn&#x27;t work when it was worn thin, this was a very pleasant surprise.  You can use this soap until it disappears.</li>
    <li> I originally bought another brand of dead sea salt soap thinking that because it was more expensive, it must be better.  Boy was I wrong.  The &amp;#34;acne soap&amp;#34; I bought ended up having coconut oil in it, which is a three or a four on a comedogenic scale of five for likeliness to cause pimples.  I ended up giving it to my mom and trying this one instead.  I&#x27;m very happy I did.  This is a simple soap.  Something I need for my highly sensitive skin.  I use it in conjunction with raw black African soap to stave off the dryness and it has helped tremendously with some of the skin problems I&#x27;ve had, including horrible itching, acne and eczema.  Although it has helped with the eczema, it hasn&#x27;t entirely alleviated the problem.  I realize that the problem is an internal one as well and attempting to attack it with diet as well.  My skin is still a bit dry at times, which may not be this product at all, but the African black soap.  I will tell you though.  This soap seems to clear up the &amp;#34;detoxifying effects&amp;#34; of the other soap, so I am very grateful for it.  My skin continues to get clearer and clearer every day.  I will purchase this soap again.</li>
    <li> I have very skin.  This soap really helps keep skin soft and from forming winter rash. It is best soap I&#x27;ve found for my skin</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best soap that I have ever used.  It is unscented so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my lotions/cologne.  It is great at removing odor.  It cleanses my skin and moisturizes.  This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I actually first picked up a bar of this soap at Whole Foods. Frankly, I did not feel like paying their prices for several bars. I was very happy when I saw this six pack on Amazon. It is a great soap that lathers well and rinses clean wit no overwhelming perfume.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a dead seal salt soap ever since I used the last of my Cosmyl Spa soap, which was very expensive but no longer available.  This soap is not only wonderful, it is reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Wow. I was buying this soap for a little over 5 bucks.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this soap. It  smells great and it is not drying at all. Nice and moist. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Lovely soap smells great. A light scent, nothing too strong. Nice big bars too. Even the men will like it, not too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Very nice - seems to last longer than most Shea butter but just as moisturizing, nice fragrance as well.  Thanks!</li>
