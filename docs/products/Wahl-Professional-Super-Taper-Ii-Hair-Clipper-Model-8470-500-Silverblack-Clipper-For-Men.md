<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These cut very well and the construction appears solid.</li>
    <li> lightweight works great!!!</li>
    <li> Buy this hair trimmer if you never want to have to buy another one again.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers. These have to be the smoothest set of clippers I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. really powerful motor&lt;br /&gt;2. Many comb size options&lt;br /&gt;3. Combs fit nicely and do not fall off when using clipper&lt;br /&gt;4. heavy duty extension cord&lt;br /&gt;5. nice heft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The clippers get rusty (or some other form of oxidation) if you do not maintain them&lt;br /&gt;2. the cord could have been a bit longer (this could be due to my bathroom arrangement though)&lt;br /&gt;3. Plastic body (it would be better if it were an all metal construction)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would buy again but also buy a good supply of clipper oil to prevent rusting.</li>
    <li> These are the loudest clippers I have ever heard. I can&#x27;t use them. Adjusted by a professional and they are literally as loud as a freaking jackhammer. I have no idea how they actually work because I can&#x27;t stand the noise. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my head, I use it on my chest (don&#x27;t judge!) there are many combs for many lengths, the motor seems quite powerful and it&#x27;s nice to hold in your hand. A good piece of engineering.</li>
    <li> This is it. I always wanted a hair clipper. So i got this one. I started cutting my nephew&#x27;s hair. After a couple of times, I started to get good at it. The clipper does not over heat, the price is cheap, it does not pull the hair, it just cut it fast, balance and easy. It is cheap, but NOT CHEAPLY made. This is as professional hair clipper.</li>
    <li> Horrible do not buy!!! So cheaply made.  Leaves lines in the hair.  I wanted a set just for my house( I&#x27;m a hair dresser) I will never buy Wahl or cheap clippers ever again.  Sad people can&#x27;t make good quality products anymore. Gets jammed easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to thin on top and therefore wanted to invest in a clipper where I could buzz my head once every 2 weeks or so. These clippers work fantastically. If you&#x27;re like me and reading reviews on every clipper on the market, save yourself the trouble and buy these. They&#x27;ll pay for themselves in a handful of haircuts. Keep them oiled and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Had a Wahl when I was in the military and it even lasted way after I was out.  Gave out recently and had to stay loyal to the brand.  Great product..</li>
    <li> I cut my sons&#x27; hair using this.  It&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it doesnt work at all.</li>
    <li> Very good product and good seller recommend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 months since I bought this clipper and i&#x27;m quite pleased with it. Cuts like a hot knife through butter and does not heat as much as some people say.&lt;br /&gt;it seems pretty robust and solid and the 8 sized combs are much more than needed to me.</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick hair. Other cutters I have used have burned out their motors.  this item as worked well for 6 months.  buy this item.</li>
    <li> This certainly cuts hair WAY better and faster than the $15 Conair clippers I&#x27;ve been using the last several years. My one complaint is that these clippers are quite heavy and they vibrate so intensely that it honestly makes it kind of uncomfortable for me to hold. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal and just something I need to get used to or...? I only cut my husband&#x27;s hair (once a month or so), so I can&#x27;t speak to how it works with heavy use.</li>
    <li> Writing the review after using for couple of times in 4 months duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and saves me the money that I would end up paying the the hair saloon.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Its powerfull.&lt;br /&gt;Good number of clippers of different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts the hair well.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat heavy so it is bit difficult to cut hairs on the back of your head when you are doing it by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves some hairs un-cut even after running over multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;I would have loved it if we had a more bigger size clipper from the biggest size provided</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past two years and it&#x27;s great! I love it!</li>
    <li> never go to the barber anymore, great product</li>
    <li> Worked well, have only used once</li>
    <li> Powerful. Relatively quiet. Good range of attachments.</li>
    <li> Makes a great clean cut!  Great price for this clipper will buy from them in the future I use it every 4 days and it cuts great.</li>
    <li> I bought these about 6 months ago, I have my wife cut my hair almost weekly with them. After each use all I do is brush the clippers with the provided cleaning brush and then put a little bit of the oil on it and I have no complains. They work great, clean up is easy, and with as much use as I have gotten out of them they still work like brand new. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wish these got closer to the head. I have had other tapers that can get almost bald.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews. I&#x27;m actually very impressed with this product. I had the 20$ clippers from Walmart a few years back and used them on my three sons for a while. Gave up on that for their sake. Spending the extra money on this product was well worth it. these nicer Clippers alone made their haircuts look damn near professional.</li>
    <li> Would give this more stars if I could.  Does a great job trimming, and does a bang-up job in maintaining 1-2 days of stubble with no comb attached.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I save a ton of money by cutting the hair of the men in my household.  These clippers are great!</li>
    <li> Works very well for cutting my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Could get more for the money...</li>
    <li> Cuts great! Comes with many attachments. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Great clipper and excellent delivery.  More than satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a long time. My first set of Wahl clippers which I&#x27;ve had for years were starting to get worn out but I knew I wanted to replace them with Wahl again. The Super Taper clippers are an excellent replacement. They cut through thick hair very well and leave me with a great cut.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this clipper for about a year and a half. Blades are still nice and sharp and the guides haven&#x27;t bent or snapped. I bought this because of the taper feature and my ild clipper guides bent and made uneven cuts. The taper feature is very nice for removing the line from the cut length between the size difference of the guides. It does get pretty hot for extended use to the point of burning your scalp. So make sure you turn the unit off every time your finished cutting. My only gripe is the taper lever. Would like to see a scrolling wheel to adjust the blade height. The lever often moves on its own while cutting and mines getting a bit lose. Im not a barber so maybe thats the intended design. I just don&#x27;t like it. Otherwise mu favorite clipper over the years so far!</li>
    <li> Used on my sons hair.  He has very thin hair 4 year old.  Cut it no problem.  Seems solid so far.</li>
    <li> they work just like they should</li>
    <li> So far so good- seems to be well built .</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
    <li> good machine will last a long time. just oil it when done</li>
    <li> Blades came out of alignment after first few uses.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. These clippers are a step up from the clippers we bought at WalMart. Very solid feel to them. Cuts hair without \\&quot;snagging and pulling\\&quot; your hair. Attachments for the end of the clippers snap on and off very well.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I bought this! Does the job easily and nicely. I absolutely hate going to go get a haircut. You have to wait, you have to listen to the stylist try and make conversation with you. I just want a haircut but every time I went to Sports Clips they stylist would ask me 20 questions: What do you do for a living? How was your weekend? What are  your plans for this or that holiday coming up? UGG! Please just cut my hair and stop asking me questions! But I don&#x27;t have to worry about that nonsense anymore - plus I am saving lots of money and TIME by doing it myself. I use th #5 attachment, run it over my head for a few minutes, then trim up the sideburn edges and blam I&#x27;m done. And I&#x27;m also done with going to Sports Clips and paying somebody to cut my hair. I don&#x27;t need to pay somebody to brush my teeth, or shave my beard, and I don&#x27;t need to pay someone to cut my hair either! I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Very high quality. Does great job at trimming hairs evenly. Like the assorted combs that come with it too. Will last a long time, very powerful.</li>
    <li> I purchased a set of Wahl Super Taper II clippers eight years ago and I am extremely happy with them. Over the last eight years, I&#x27;ve probably averaged two and a half haircuts per month (I cut my brother&#x27;s, my son&#x27;s, and my own hair). It&#x27;s safe to say that I&#x27;ve used these clippers over 200 times, and they are the best that I&#x27;ve owned in 25+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are heavier duty than the average home clipper set, which means that they are heavier and more substantial than many that I&#x27;ve used over the years. They also vibrate more. Others have complained about one or more of those three characteristics, but none of them bother me as my priority in purchasing these was a set that worked well and lasted a long time. I actually prefer the size and feel of these clippers, and although looks weren&#x27;t an important consideration, I like the retro styling. These high-quality, reliable, American made clippers have not disappointed me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger, stronger motor and great cutting blades make cutting even the thickest hair a breeze. After over 200 uses these clippers are still cutting as well as they did when they were new. I&#x27;ve never had to do anything to them other than oil the blades with each use. Occasionally, when I first turn them on they produce a clattering noise, but this isn&#x27;t a problem because adjusting the taper length eliminates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this package is that the set of clipper combs didn&#x27;t include diagonal pieces (for around the ear trimming). The eight that are included are great, but I ended up purchasing the [[ASIN:B00065XNMQ Wahl Hair Clipper Guide Comb Set (10 pieces)]] - just to get the two diagonal combs that I needed (that set was cheaper than I was able to find the two individual combs alone). My previous combs were the type that only clamped onto the sides of the cutting blades (and often fell off while in use). I prefer the type that Wahl uses, which are held in place on the top, on the sides, and clip on at the bottom. I&#x27;ve never had one of these combs fall off while using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL GRADE: 4.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clipper: 5 stars - Great cutting ability and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comb selection: 3.5 stars - Missing the two diagonal pieces (for trimming around ears).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY: I highly recommend these near professional grade (American made) clippers at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Updated 11/12/13)had one of these combs fall off while using them.  OVERALL GRADE: 4.5 stars  Clipper: 5 stars - Great cutting ability and reliable.  Comb selection: 3.5 stars - Missing the two diagonal pieces (for trimming around ears).  SUMMARY: I highly recommend these near professional grade (American made) clippers at a very reasonable price.  (Updated 11/12/13)</li>
    <li> Cuts very well, it glides like butter to me. It does a wonderful job and I have no complaints. It works better than the cheaper styles I have used before, you can tell the difference. It doesn&#x27;t pull hair either, like some of the cheaper clippers.</li>
    <li> Nice weight, comfortable to use. Does a nice clean job.</li>
    <li> Feel great handling and cut smooth and fast. Love wahl.</li>
    <li> They were great in the beginning, but in less than a year they got really weird on me. Started to buzz strangely, out of no where started to cut my skin. It&#x27;s like the poltergeist invaded my clippers. Moving on to the next pair.</li>
    <li> Great machine very professional same as&lt;br /&gt;My barber shop. Nice kit, very heavy feel and heavy duty, I would recommend it to all, great price too</li>
    <li> I have been a LONG TIME  Wahl clipper user for over 20 years, cutting my hair since college, averaging every other week of clipping my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian and my hair is thick, coarse and it grows fairly fast... hence the requirement to cut every other week.&lt;br /&gt;Well this past month (August), my old dependable 305G (Homecut Adjustable) started to malfunction within the electromagnetic motor.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to fix it with no luck.  So the hunt was on for a new clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My requirements...&lt;br /&gt;1, durability&lt;br /&gt;2, overall design (fit in my hand nicely)&lt;br /&gt;3, weight (not a big deal, since I am cutting my own hair - lighter would be nice).&lt;br /&gt;4, rating from other people (greater than 4)&lt;br /&gt;5, noise level (it would be nice to be quiet, but with an electromagnetic motor, it is hard to get one).&lt;br /&gt;6, motor (electromagnetic of course)&lt;br /&gt;7, cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after reading hundreds of opinions from many other models, I took the plunge for the Wahl Professional Super Taper II.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0018C0MJS WAHL Professional Super Taper II Powerful Clipper with Taper Lever (Model: 8470-500)]]&lt;br /&gt;I was really close on getting the 8110 5-star Balding, but the comment that someone experienced the clipper cutting their scalp bugged me.&lt;br /&gt;So after ordering the Taper II, it arrived and this past weekend, I put it to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair cutting: Cutting was super smooth, the Super Taper II cut my hair fast.&lt;br /&gt;THe multiple attachments is cool, my old Wahl only have 4 attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I was actually able to use my old ones.,, The new multicolor versions will make it super easy to identify.&lt;br /&gt;So next time, I will try the new ones and maybe different lengths to see if I like the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noise:  It was similar to my old Wahl clipper on noise level.&lt;br /&gt;What did you expect from an electromagnetic motor... it buzzes because of the AC current that runs through.&lt;br /&gt;Virtually no moving parts or parts that could wear or break.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that could cause a failure is a busted winding around the motor or the gap between the magnet and metal increases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Design:  Like others mentioned, the chrome piece is made of plated plastic.&lt;br /&gt;There are some sharp edges on the chrome plastic, you notice it and feel it but not an issue during the operation of the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion, would be to modify the plastic mold and add more of a radius.&lt;br /&gt;Or just get rid of the chrome insert and add the style lines to the body.&lt;br /&gt;I would be cool with just a brown body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handling of the clipper was way better than my old clipper.&lt;br /&gt;It was easier to hold onto when clipping the backside of my head.&lt;br /&gt;I like how the body slims down about mid-way to give you a comfort palming of the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electrical cord is also designed better than my old clipper.&lt;br /&gt;My old clipper&#x27;s cord looks like it came from a lamp.&lt;br /&gt;The Super Taper II looks more like a power cord extension, that contractors use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adjustable lever is okay... it is not as smooth as my old clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I actually can feel it stutter as I move the lever.&lt;br /&gt;But that may be due to that my old clippers are worn out due to 20 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are a better design, there are grooves (3/4-inch) from every leading edge, this allows the cut hair (small pieces) to be guided away from the cutting edge.&lt;br /&gt;My old clipper grooves were very short say 1/4-inch.... though I have never had any bogging problems with my old clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight is similar... I could not tell a real difference in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost, well this one I know costed way more than my old clippers.&lt;br /&gt;But it is well worth the extra coin, because of the money I save will have a  payback within 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;This one costed $ 49.98 (free shipping  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I will give 5-stars.&lt;br /&gt;I have a great feeling that these clippers will last well past 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the chrome plastic insert, I really can not find any issues with the Professional Super Taper II&lt;br /&gt;As time progresses, I will post up updates.</li>
    <li> Does the job, we will see if it is built to last and that will be the true test....</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed to keep my natural hair neatly trimmed. The color coded attachments are great for different lengths of hair. This was the very first time I had ever used clippers.</li>
    <li> This wahl trimmer is exactly what you want in a trimmer. Another great product from wahl, for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Have used it for 3 hair cuts so far. Easy to use and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and Professional product my guys love it because it does not pull their hair and it gets the job done right the first time</li>
    <li> I tease one of our sons that he has hair like a bears as it is SO thick. (Yes I know bears have fur but hopefully you get my drift!) I always buzz cut it on a #2 (1/4&amp;#34;) but with the previous Wahl clippers we had that finally died, I always had to go through his hair twice as they just could not cope with the thickness. These new clippers are WONDERFUL! They went through his hair like a warm knife through butter. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Yes I was impressed and just short of doing a little jig around the kitchen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else do I like about these clippers? They are quiet! I absolutely LOVE the the color-coded attachments! Each one has the number &amp;#34;punched&amp;#34; through on it so no more holding it up to your face to see what each one says, like the black attachments used to be like. Please note there are NO scissors in this package but I would rather use my own, better quality pair, anyways. However there is a VERY thick comb, the quality about which I was very surprised! You are also provided with a small cleaning brush, a bottle of oil and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One happy customer here along with three boys/men who no longer go &amp;#34;Ouch!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have had about 5 clippers.  This is the best, by far!  I would say no comparison.  It glides thru the hair cutting evenly and without pull</li>
    <li> Very high quality, I have been using it for months now.  Comes with the attachments for close or long hair, I tend to use the shortest two.  Only nice addition would be some form of bag to hold the entire kit, I made do with something else I had at home already.  Looks like it will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> works great and i love the wide variety of guides</li>
    <li> Unable to use. Makes too much noise and vibrates. Gave it away to a barber overseas to fix and keep.</li>
    <li> love these clippers thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased Wahls Clippers and years ago I trimmed my own hair! So after browsing through various Clippers on Amazon and E-bay I settled with Walh&#x27;s Professional Super Taper II Powerful Clippers,since I gave my old ones to my Son. These Clippers worked like a charm and No Regrets!! I only wish that these Clippers came with a box or container so to store it in but i can always find something!! Hope this review helped!</li>
    <li> Bought because it was new and improved.  I have always bought WAHL clippers but these arnt as good as usual.  They would pinch and pull my hair on my chin unlike the others I have had.  I ended up sending them back and getting another kind. Still WAHL though.</li>
    <li> It took me about 1 week reading reviews on Amazon to decide which clippers I was going to buy, I really wanted something above my expectations after the many clippers I tried so far and finally I ordered this one. Well, after I performed my own first cut, I can say I was expecting a bit better for the price, but I guess these clippers are actually slightly better than the cheaper ones I had so far. If they are worth it to pay more? Honestly I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;It takes me a while to finish my cut and after 25 minutes they heat up like HELL, as much as that you can&#x27;t keep them in your hands anymore. There&#x27;s a warning for this in the instructions as well. Also, there&#x27;s no box where to store all the various guides. Machine is not bad, it&#x27;s powerful and I am okay with it, but I don&#x27;t consider it a 5 stars machine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wasted years using garbage clippers on my son and husband. Most of them would cut unevenly or pull their hair. This clippers are amazing! They cut so smoothly and quickly, my husband head was done in less than 10 minutes! I have been looking for a good pair of clippers and asked a local barber what he used. The answer was Wahl. Reading reviews on Amazon, I found one that said, &amp;#34;buy Wahl and spend at least $50&amp;#34; so I took that advice. I am glad I did!  My husband&#x27;s hair is very thick on the sides, and very thin and fine on the top. These clippers made short work of both kinds of his hair (other clippers wouldn&#x27;t touch the fine stuff). I did not find them any heavier or louder than other clippers I have used. I love the mulitiple combs. I just wish it came with a case, but that really didn&#x27;t matter, because I dumped the last pair of clippers that I bought and used the case that they came in. If you buy these clippers, you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this clipper! It has smooth lines and doesn&#x27;t not jam up or turn off. He loved it.</li>
    <li> Very good article I recommend</li>
    <li> best deal for the money. local shop wanted $20 more for these and would have had to order them. great quality and dependable brand make these ideal for the occasional user or any at home barber.</li>
    <li> After a year of having barbers and hairdressers not cutting my hair the way I wanted it to be cut, I decided to purchase hair clippers and cut my own hair. I am glad that I ended up choosing this model. The Wahl Super Taper 2 is a professional-quality clipper (the successor to the original Super Taper and a lower-power, non-metal version of the Senior)with the v5000 electromagnetic motor and an adjustable blade. This product comes with a small operating booklet, 5 mL of clipper oil, 8 guards (1/8 inch - 1 inch), a blade guard, a cleaning brush and a white comb. Shipping was faster than expected; I am very satisfied. Out of the package, everything included was in good condition and the blades smelled freshly oiled. The sound of the clipper turning on is really something special to hear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper was cutting just a tad longer than what the 000 position should cut at, so I zero-gapped the clipper (check out youtube for tutorial videos)by loosening the blade screws slightly and pushing the bottom blade closer to the cutting blade. If you do this, make sure that the two blades aren&#x27;t actually touching each other, and the cutting blade should never pass in front of the bottom blade. Make sure there is a slight gap between the blades that isn&#x27;t visible from a distance. When you&#x27;re satisfied with the adjustment, firmly hold the bottom blade by its sides and carefully tighten the screws. If the blades are zero-gapped but misaligned (the far left tooth of the cutting blade should overlap with the 2nd tooth of the bottom blade), try this procedure again. Turn on the clipper for a few seconds and then turn it off and check to make sure the blades are aligned. If they are not, adjust the power screw until the cutting blade is properly adjusted. By performing these steps, I was able to zero-gap the clipper and align the blades. Needless to say, it cuts through hair like butter now; the length is also closer to a true 000. Be careful with a zero-gapped clipper: if you don&#x27;t press the blade flat against your scalp and use the teeth instead, you&#x27;ll get a minor cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve only done one haircut with these clippers (a high-and-tight variation with a #2 on top, bangs in the front, a #0 everywhere else and #1 blend between the crown and temples) and it turned out great. If you&#x27;re cutting your own hair, you have to be careful and slow, especially when it comes to tapering (don&#x27;t use the clipper for too long though). The Super Taper 2 does not pull hair when it cuts and it cuts evenly. With proper adjustment, it is not too loud. The taper lever can allow you to blend from #000 (closed, up) to #1 (open, down) in length if the clipper is zero-gapped. The guards are of decent quality. When you&#x27;re cutting your own hair, use at least two mirrors to see the back of your head and feel to make sure everything is proper. Ideally, get someone to make sure you are cutting the back accurately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are cutting the hair of multiple people, I recommend purchasing clipper disinfectant spray such as Clippercide. This will prevent the spread of blood-borne illnesses. Also, once you are running low on oil, buy a large bottle of Wahl clipper oil; they last a long time. If you don&#x27;t oil your blades, your clippers will perform like junk. Oiling your clippers is not necessary after every cut, but maybe after several (clean the hair off the blades too!). If the clippers are behaving strangely, you may have to oil them, adjust the blades or fine-tune the power screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the guards snap onto your clipper; many people find their guards detaching in the middle of a cut. Make sure the blade doesn&#x27;t chew the guard and don&#x27;t use the clipper too roughly during a haircut. When the clipper is not in use, keep it unplugged and away from moisture while leaving the blade guard on. If you receive a damaged or defective product, contact Wahl; the clipper has a one-year warranty and customer service is great. Do not drop these clippers; the frame is plastic. If you want more durable clippers, get the Wahl Senior or another metal-body clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you are interested in cutting your own hair or someone else&#x27;s, or if you are a barber, these are great clippers to purchase. They will last a long time with proper maintenance and are a great step between cheap clippers and expensive, powerful clippers. I recommend this product to anyone who is interested in hair cutting or simply needs an affordable, reliable clipper.

    <li> My old Remington hair trimmer was falling apart, and the blade was so dull that it kept getting stuck in my hair. It was clearly time for a new model. The Wahl 79300-400 was available on Amazon for much less, but I decided to spring for this model in the hopes that it would be more durable. After all, I&#x27;m still saving money in the long run by cutting my own hair.  Compared with the Remington, it is much more powerful and higher quality (steel instead of plastic). It does get warm, and it is somewhat loud, but not intolerably so. After seven months, it&#x27;s still working fine. Considering how lightly I&#x27;m using it, I expect it to last many years.</li>
    <li> My youngest is a swimmer and we would spend a lot of time and money getting his hair trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore.  We love the buzz cut ability of these clippers.  They don&#x27;t snag or pull and are quiet&lt;br /&gt;compared to others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> After just five cuts, these have paid for themselves. The quality is great and the blades are easy to clean. All the size clips are color coded which helps.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is an excellent buy. Have used cordless trimmers in the past, but none of them can match the power of the Wahl corded clipper. Have not noticed it getting hot even after using it for complete haicuts lasting over 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Definitely gets the job done for the price!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is powerful as you would expect from a professional grade product. It needs to be plugged into mains power which means that the power is consistent. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Cuts nice and smooth. No hair pulling. I haven&#x27;t noticed any missed hairs with it yet. I use it frequently on my husband and my two boys. Two of the three have really thick hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband &amp; he likes it. Doesn&#x27;t love it tho. They work good but the machine gets really hot after awhile. I had to put it down &amp; turn it off a few times to be able to finish cutting his hair. It did the job tho.</li>
    <li> A GREAT PRODUCT!  I purchased this primarily for beard maintenance. The first time I used it, I asked myself WHY have I been dealing with beard trimmers all my life??? Because this Wahl 8470-500 Professional Super Taper II Hair Clipper performs better than anything that I have ever used in the past.  A very well made product!  I am looking forward to many years of use. I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I had the same clipper for 20yrs, &amp; been perfectly satisfied with it, after which it required more labor-$ to fix than it  cost. The brand isn&#x27;t around anymore, so I got a &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34;, and -man-, now I know: My old clipper was a big Buick V8, but this is a Mercedes V12!  Heavy, yes, but I -like- that, it makes me confident that the big motor won&#x27;t be overworked. When I used it, my confidence grew: This thing purrs when the other one growled. I expect it&#x27;ll last 30 years.</li>
    <li> Wahl does excellent quality trimmers.</li>
    <li> This is the one that the pros use. Remember, though, it&#x27;s not cordless or rechargeable. I&#x27;ve had those, and they become unchargeable.</li>
    <li> excellent choice, excellent service</li>
    <li> nice weight to it gives smooth cut without biting skin run quiet and cool.&lt;br /&gt;Great for general cut and tapering not so good for shaping up the forehead area or the neck area.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a wonderful product for my husband. Now he always looks well&lt;br /&gt;groomed. Some of the barbers out there aren&#x27;t real good but no more worries&lt;br /&gt;about haircuts for us.</li>
    <li> These clipper cut through my hair like butter, and I have worn out quite a few other pairs of clippers. My hair is fairly thick, and these clippers don&#x27;t even bat an eye going through the thickest part. I would definitely recommend these to anyone! Does medium fades easily</li>
    <li> I have three \\&quot;boys\\&quot; in my life if I count my husband, and I use this clipper to cut the hair of all three of them on a monthly basis. I bought two longer attachments for my middle son&#x27;s hair because he wears it longer, but my oldest and my husband have military \\&quot;crew\\&quot; cuts. I love the taper feature because I can cut my husband in his high and tight (zero on the sides and 2 on the top) and it gives a perfect fade if I go from 0, .5, 1, 1.5, 2. Add a set of good quality hair scissors to this purchase, and maybe a plastic cape, and you&#x27;re all set to cut the hair of your favorite boy or man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement would be for WAHL to include an instruction book or video with some tips on giving a good hair cut. But a quick Internet search helped me in that department.</li>
    <li> I have had this pair of clippers for about a year a half. They are no longer quiet or cut that great. They were good for the first year and then quickly went down hill from there. I used them maybe 5 times a month and kept them clean and oiled when in use. Would not purchase again or recommend especially if they will be used frequently.</li>
    <li> A Great set of clippers. Solid steel casing and heavy. It gets the job done beautifully. This is no Drugstore brand of clipper but the real thing!</li>
    <li> Looking good with my haircut</li>
    <li> Was not as good as I expected. Seemed to cut no better than my old Walmart type clippers. Maybe it is because I have very short hair. Ended up returning them.</li>
    <li> Might be good for at home but not the best for professional use.  Dense hair doesn&#x27;t feed through the blades fast enough.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for a great price. They are great for cutting fades. The adjustable blade provides appropriate blending range. I have not adjusted the blades in regards to making it a balding clipper or for line ups. I use the Andis T Outliner for that. Again, overall great clippers for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who likes to buzz cut his hair.  He reports they work great, so I am happy.</li>
    <li> This isnt the best pair of hair trimmers Ive ever owned. My old pair of Wahl trimmers died and they dont make it anymore. I wish they did because its much better thanthis pair. Its gets the job done but I have to go over my hair multiple times to make sure its gets everything. The worst part is they dont work as well as my old pair on already short hair like my beard. I like to keep my beard trimmed and these just arent as great as my old Wahl trimmers. Still, they get the job done for a middle of the road priced set of hair trimmers.</li>
    <li> It is heavy, but works fine.  I think that with good maintenance the unit last. The plastic based options are limited in number but are OK.  The unit is bit noisy and vibration may be too much for some.  This review is asked by Amazon very early, I would hope Amazon would take the habit of asking for a second review at end of warranty.</li>
    <li> I purchased one the same brand name at walmart . But it did not work after open the package . I purchased the second one this time work very well . Thank for your business</li>
    <li> Nicely designed ,fits well in hand.Runs very smoothly and cut my hair very short quite easily.I would recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> Works well, does just as description says. Made well, heavy, solid feel. Includes a number of various size combs for hair length. The cord is plenty long. Price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> seems to be great quality for the price, but the vibration is more than I expected. Wouldn&#x27;t want to use this all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: A year later still works great, no corrosion. Good cord length, good attachments, and I guess I got used to the vibration. Wouldn&#x27;t want to cut hair for hours with it though.</li>
    <li> best clipper I have ever used!  I have used so many in the past and none of them compare.  I clip my husbands hair at home on a weekly basis and he always complains it pulls on his hair.  these are by far the best, if you are considering buying some,  buy these and look no further.  they are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the second Wahl Super Taper I have owned. The first one I bought when I lived in the UK and unfortunately could not use it in the US because of the different plug/voltage. I use clippers to shave my head and beard every other day or so, so when I first got the the US I bought cheap clippers at Walgreens and used them for about a year. But these cheaper models (I have owned quite a few of them) inevitably deteriorate quickly under heavy use and simply don&#x27;t shave as well any more, with the whole process taking longer. So I ordered myself another Wahl and it&#x27;s as good as my first one. It&#x27;s super-solid and feels as if it could survive anything. The Supertaper is a great investment if you use clippers regularly and frequently. The only downside I can see is that the weight and bulkiness (compared to some of the more cheaper models) make it less convenient for traveling. On those occasions I prefer to take a cheap but lightweight model but the Wahl is the weapon of choice for everyday use.</li>
    <li> For trimming without an attachment, I found this did not pick up hair very well at all and required me to go over the same spot repeatedly on my neck.  I have an old ~$20 Remington that was WAY better at the &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock&amp;#34; shadow trimming so this one disappointed in that area.  But for normal haircutting, this is a great unit and very solidly built.</li>
    <li> Works great, and the adjustable screw makes it possible to use it properly (using a step-down converter) in 220V. It&#x27;s sturdy and powerful and seems like it will last a couple of decades. The only thing that would make it better would be if it automatically switched to 220V from the original 110V, but other than that, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> does a really good job, too bad i cant line my hair though</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. Heavy and sturdy.  Cuts very well.  Very reasonable price.  Replacing an old Wahl trimmer that lasted more than 20 years.  This one looks as well made as the last one.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for about two years, and this thing is awesome. I&#x27;ve used many over the years that have gotten clogged with hair or otherwise just stopped working. This one appears to be more resilient. It also weighs more than some that I have used, so you feel like you have more control over it in your hands and it doesn&#x27;t constantly feel like you&#x27;re about to drop it and accidentally buzz off most of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use to it to cut most of my friends&#x27; hair and I&#x27;ve yet to make any critical errors, but I imagine that attests more to my amazing talent than the clipper itself. :)</li>
    <li> Does what it was designed to do!</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best trimmer we&#x27;ve owned. It is very easy to control, cuts precisely, and doesn&#x27;t heat up as our old cheap trimmer did. The color-coding is most helpful, as well. (Wahl also has online video tutorials, adding to my confidence as the family barber.)</li>
    <li> Have 4 boys and this works great, comes with everything you need. Feels solid and made with good quality.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic trimmer. Well worth the money. I bought a cheap pair from ConAir but it was fickle and stopped working after six months and you had to be quick about using it or the metal plate would heat up and could burn skin while being used. This trimmer is well weighted, has a sturdy cord and stays cool enough even during long hair cuts. The colored guards are a nice touch too. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking at them.</li>
    <li> Cuts through hair like butter, feels like a solid professional cutter in your hands even if a bit heavy but you do get used to it.</li>
    <li> My old Wahl finally died after 20+ years.  I have tried four or five different models/brands to replace it, with mounting frustration as I went along.  This unit finally works as expected!  I have only used 4-5 times but it has been great for cutting my husbands hair.  The unit feels right (not too cheap, not too heavy), and it runs well.  Very smooth cut.</li>
    <li> I always liked Wahl products, I had an old Wahl clipper that lasted for a good 10+ years and never did me wrong... that is until i accidentally cut the cord then it stopped working.. MY FAULT! So I bought this clipper, this thing is a breeze to cut hair, like butter.. you can tell its quality right when you pick it up, and they improved their cord so it&#x27;s stronger and much more flexible.. Love this thing, worth every penny..</li>
    <li> These clippers are definitely professional grade, very sturdy and well made. I have already used them several times already and have been very pleased with the results. I would definitely recommend these clippers - they are worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that this shaver would be strong enough to cut through my coarse hair, but it makes light work of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with a few sizing clip on guides, a bag for the accessories, some oil and a small brush to remove hair from the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned 25 minute haircuts into 10 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, clean cuts and while sturdy, it isn&#x27;t too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This clipper works better than some other ones I&#x27;ve tried that were more expensive.  This really is a great clipper!</li>
    <li> We purchased these to replace and older, worn out Wahl.  We made this purchase based on the reviews, and they have not let us down.  We do about 6 haircuts a month and these clippers work great and never lose a beat--even in very coarse and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do get a little warm after extended use (3 haircuts in a row), but that is a minor inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely easy to clean after use, and we expect these to last a long time if we take care of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one for about 7-8 years before it finally quit.  I cut my hair approximately once a week with these clippers so I&#x27;ve had several hundred haircuts and it always performed well.  When it finally broke but to my delight they still had these and so I purchased again.  Works great but does get hot when using for extended period of time during warmer weather.</li>
    <li> Nice hand feel, good, clean and even cut cut, easy to use, plenty of guards (including #1), high quality.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace rechargeable clippers which were always breaking.  This seems constructed to last a long time.  It cuts very well.  It does get a warm after using for a while, but not too hot to hold.  The only drawback is the weight.</li>
    <li> Got this to start cutting hair so far no complaints. I also purchase the Wahl hero liners both amazing products</li>
    <li> We use clippers about twice a month and these replace ones I dropped. The clippers are the same brand as our old ones and work very well. The pieces that clip on aren&#x27;t as good as the old ones so I am using the old ones. Think they would be ok but aren&#x27;t as sturdy.</li>
    <li> Professional smoothe cutting.instrument.A must have...at a fair price Wahl has always been a trusted product in our family since forever.I could not be more pleased with my purchase. A great value!!</li>
    <li> LOVE! Use it to shave my flat coated retriever works great!</li>
    <li> These clippers are great for cutting your own hair.</li>
    <li> Saving me tons of money, since I am able to avoid the barber and still look decent (I think!).</li>
    <li> these clippers cut well and are nice quality material great for touch up to keep hair looking nice i would recommend these</li>
    <li> I had previously bought a Wahl 25-ish dollar battery powered hair clipper set. Used them just on me. They burnt out in less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this one seems much much nicer. Its got a nice heavy feel to it, a nice hum, and cuts really easily. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it overheating, as some comments mentioned.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these.  Bought a cheaper pair from a name brand and was very disappointed.  These Wahl clippers make the job easy.  Hair cuts in half the time because you don&#x27;t have to go over spots again and again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth paying extra money for quality American made clippers that will last for years.  These are much better quality than the cheaper $15 models from other manufacturers.</li>
    <li> My son has been to a professional barber once when I was down with back surgery.  In the last fifty years my husband has been to a professional barber only once while I recuperated from back surgery.  Wahl has been the only clippers I will use.  My son bought me an Oster as a birthday gift for the family, but after the head fell off the fifth time I decided it was not a good product and returned it.  If it hadn&#x27;t been for [...] and a terrific gentleman who told you how to put the head back in a calm clear manner.  It should be Wahl and we purchased a new model and so far the tool has performed absolutely perfect.  East to clean and care for.  Wahl makes a class product and I&#x27;ll swear ti that.</li>
    <li> Very  professional tool. I recomand !</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, which is a plus since my husband wanted his head shaved before vacation. They work great and are quieter than the last set we bought. Only thing I think needs to be added is a carry all case to put them in; however I was able to use the one for the last pair so it worked out just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I purchased this. It&#x27;s simply amazing. After dealing with many cheapo $20 hair clippers from various outlets, hoping to find one that didn&#x27;t tear my hair out, I eventually got tired of it and wanted to get a decent pair of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price range, this clipper cannot be beat. It cuts through thick hair like nothing at all, such a refreshing alternative from squinting from getting my hair pulled constantly with bad cheap clippers. I&#x27;m so very glad I got this, and wish I would have sooner. Cutting my hair is now a breeze.</li>
    <li> hey everyone,&lt;br /&gt;At first I gave these clippers 3 stars...&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great for doing specific things but I don&#x27;t recommend them for use as a primary clipper. However I adjusted them via the Philips pin on the side. Now they are smooth as a whistle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;they are smooth, they cut through my hair evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;they over heated on me after 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;they get pretty heavy. if u plan on cutting your own hair.. fast feeds are lighter.. and Andis masters have more maneuverability</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t use it on damp or sweaty hair, and use some good clipper oil to protect it, there sprays that work well also.</li>
    <li> I love these. I use them twice a week, and I&#x27;m a girl. Yep you read that right. I&#x27;m a girl who shaves her head, and with the number one attachment. I like the weight of this in the hand, I find it smoothly, cleanly and evenly shaves the hair, without doing any pulling or tugging of the hair. It comes with plenty of attachments and goodies to do some magic, and save yourself a trip to the cheaply skilled, but not free chain barbers. They last a long a time, and have plenty of power. I find Wahl to be the best.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the ones I dropped on concrete. Concrete and blades don&#x27;t work real well together. My wife cuts my hair on a number two everywhere and these work smoothly without any pulling. Great product</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the weight of this thing. You don&#x27;t want to drop it. And you surely don&#x27;t want to drop it ON anything. But it&#x27;s clearly a quality piece of equipment and does a fine job. Tons of attachment lengths too, so it&#x27;s hard to imagine a cut it can&#x27;t do. Very professional.</li>
    <li> the razor works perfectly, as is expected. I am completely satisfied with the product acquired. Please excellent product completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have owned several other clippers that cost less than this one,  None of the cheapies did the job properly.  The Wahl 84701 does a fine job.  When you hold them in your hand, you can feel quality.  They do not bog down.</li>
    <li> Excellent clipper, same as the barber uses, cuts through hair like soft butter, even comes with a little container of clipper oil to put on the blades.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent clipper for the price.  I am not crazy about all the plastic on the handle but that&#x27;s why&lt;br /&gt;this otherwise hefty and powerful clipper can be sold inexpensively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the taper level as I find that it makes it safer or easier to cut my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with easy to attach combs and a quality 8 foot long cord, so you do not need and extension cord.  Really, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  I bought an extra bottle of oil (it comes with a tiny bottle) since lubrication is important.</li>
    <li> Used the clippers for about 2 months, they worked fine. Last time I used them I was putting them away and noticed the blade was offcenter, upon removing the guard I found that the metal piece that connects the blade to the motor was broken. Now, I can understand that a product might break and the damage should have been covered under warranty. I was willing to just contact customer support and get a new product, no worries. But Wahl customer support is slow to respond, if they respond at all. I could tolerate the item being poorly manufactured, it happens, but the customer support sealed the deal. Will not be purchasing Wahl products in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pic related, the damaged clippers. The piece that broke is the bottom right, metal piece with the plastic white top.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a couple years, and now my two boys. I needed an upgrade from the below average clippers I had, so I snagged these. Sharp, fast and no tugging. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I will buy again from this merchant. Further, and very important.

    <li> Very low quality clippers, they snag your hair when cutting and blades are not sharp at all.&lt;br /&gt;Returned them back for the Andis Master Clipper which are great.</li>
    <li> Wanted one with the clips attached to the razor, not what expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;sent back last Friday afternoon.</li>
    <li> We replaced our dying battery powered hair clipper with this clipper and are very happy with the performance. As other reviewers have mentioned, this thing cuts through hair easily. The only downside is, my wife (who cuts my hair with it) has complained about the vibration. For sure it vibrates a lot more than our previous clipper (it is also is a lot more powerful). If you are doing one haircut, it is probably nothing to concern yourself with, but if you are doing several in a row - it could be a problem. Also, it did not include any case but we re-used the case from our old clipper.</li>
    <li> Huge improvement over my old clippers - wife cut my hair in a fraction of the time it took her before.  Sharp and accurate and easy to use with a good variety of attachments.</li>
    <li> I used to use an older version of this clipper. I moved, so I got my own.&lt;br /&gt;Solid and powerful, no suprises there. This machine gets the work done.</li>
    <li> love this trimmer.  first and only one i have ever owned.  love the guards for different lengths.  I had my autistic son&#x27;s hair cut in about 3 minutes - who has sensory issues and can&#x27;t stand noisy clippers by his head.  and it looked pretty darned good!  it will pay for itself in about 4 months!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very quiet!!</li>
    <li> Great addition to the line of excellent machines produce by whal. Would of love if  it would give a closer shave and operated more silent. Besides this, the machine is outstanding for the price</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied with these clippers, lots of power with the big cutting surface, I can get my head shaved in no time.</li>
    <li> I purchase these because I started having my hair buzzed, and paying $15 for a buzz cut seemed a little over the top for me. So with a little persuasion, I got my wife to cut my hair. We did a #4 on top, #2 on back, and used the #3 to get the blend, and I have to say it looks as good if not better than going to a professional hair dresser. So with a little research on how to get the proper hair cut your looking for, these clippers, and a good detail trimmer to get around the ears and the back of the neck, you can have your haircuts for pennies in no time.</li>
    <li> Now I can be just like an Army barber and shave my head.  Well constructed, quiet operation and all the accessories.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these clippers the work great cut well dont get hot so glad i made the choice for the super taper 2 as a professional I couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice !!!!</li>
    <li> Did  not work from out of the box amazon new it was selling to Australia sold with wrong plug. Recommended if you don&#x27;t want cut your hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing for months after my old clippers died. I wish I had bought these sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t even compare these Wahl clippers to the old model I had (a $30 model from a big box store). This thing cuts through hair with an unbelievable ease. It seems as effective as any pro model at the barber shop. It even has that authoritive &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; sound when you turn it on. Raw power!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy this thing, you won&#x27;t regret it. It has paid for itself many times over.</li>
    <li> Clippers work good.  Don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s as good a quality as the other pair of Wahl&#x27;s clippers that we owned but still did the job.  Of course, paid more money for the first pair than we paid for this one.</li>
    <li> Works great for husband&#x27;s flat top and my boys&#x27; haircuts!  Powerful and sharp.</li>
    <li> I picked up my clippers yesterday from a 7-Eleven box, which is good if you don&#x27;t want items delivered to home or apartment. They are medium weight to me, not too heavy. I keep my clippers and smaller trimmers on a hook next to w/d. I have not used them yet, but they seem to be in good shape and not too loud. I seem to buy new clippers about every 4 months. I keep them oiled and vacuum any littler hairs that may be left on them. I put one plastic stretch trash bag in sink for hair and cut out holes for arms and head in another one to keep hair off me and still come out a lot cheaper than going to a barber. At one time, I was just spreading newspaper over sink to keep hair from going down the hole. I finally stopped going to barber years ago when I told a different barber to cut half of my bush off and he cut it down close to my scalp. Believe me, I was angry and he did not get any tip! When my nephew said he was cutting his own hair, I decided to start doing the same thing. UPDATE: AFTER USING CLIPPERS FOR THE FIRST TIME, I LIKE THE SWITCH, WHICH IS EASY TO CUT ON AND OFF. THE WEIGHT IS ABOUT MEDIUM, NOT TOO LIGHT AND NOT TOO HEAVY. IT CUTS VERY WELL, EVEN THOUGH MY HAIR STILL COMES OFF IN TINY PIECES BECAUSE IT IS THIN AND I CUT IT EVERY 6-7 DAYS. I ALSO LIKE THE RED COVER TO USE FOR TOP OF HEAD BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO FIND, EVEN THOUGH I KEEP IT ATTACHED WHEN I HANG CLIPPERS ON WALL. THE CORD IS A LITTLE THICK AND I WRAPPED A VELCRO AROUND SOME OF IT SO IT WILL NOT BE SO LONG. MY SMALLER TRIM CLIPPERS HAVE A THINNER CORD AND I USE ONE OF THOSE THINGS FROM AMAZON TO WRAP IT AROUND. ALSO, THEY ARE NOT TOO NOISY! I RECOMMEND THESE CLIPPERS.</li>
    <li> I bought as a Gift for a friend, and he liked very much!!</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers. I use it for buzzing my head and buzzing/trimming my beard and mustache. Beats heading to the barber and I get to do it whenever I want. If the clippers stopping staying in their properly aligned position properly you just need to tighten the screw on the plates.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great.  I cut my sons hair for the first time and they worked as advertised.  I also love the color coded gaurds that come in the different sizes.  No bag, but you can use any small bag to keep everything together, or put it back in the package that they came in.</li>
    <li> Had previously purchased this item locally for $75.00 and that was 15yrs ago.  Found same item, an upgraded version I might add, on Amazon for $50.00.  Substantial savings even though it was from the same manufacturer of the product</li>
    <li> Cuts great,quiet as well</li>
    <li> The previous one I had for a long time (years) finally wore out.  The replacement is very similar if not exactly the same and is excellent as well.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Prof Super Taper II Hair Clipper 8470 gives a professional cut. It is well-constructed. Fits well in the hand.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to use. Thanks for the efficient service!</li>
    <li> was not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These hair clippers work amazing and they don&#x27;t pull and the cut that you get is superb :) I bought these because a regular hair trim with these types of clippers costs 15 dollars and they will pay for themselves in a little bit more than three uses :) no reason to do any more than a simple trim to pay more is absurd but then again I&#x27;m cheap LOL.</li>
    <li> Works great, saves me a lot of money doing my own hair.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent electric clipper. The taper adjustment allows to get a very even and smooth end result when free handing. The motor is easily adjustable and barely gets warm. It&#x27;s relatively easy to clean, all you need to do is pop out a couple screws and blades come apart. The blade attachments don&#x27;t feel cheap and gather hair effectively.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers! Reliable and effective, no more getting low powered clippers stuck in my children&#x27;s ultra-thick hair. OUCH!!!  And, These clippers do not get hot after three consecutive haircuts, and never wimp out like the cordless clippers they replaced. Good deal!</li>
    <li> This Clipper is amazing. Excellent for pet grooming.</li>
    <li> Yup, two hair cuts and it&#x27;s paid for itself.  I cut my own hair and with the Taper Blades it does a wonderful job.  Super nice and I have no cons to mention!  Made very well.  Edit - After having this for several months, I still love it.  I have read a few complaints about it heating up, remember that it is essential to keep the blades oiled and cleaned as with any hair trimmer. The motor and the friction of the blades moving back and forth at high speed will always heat up. I have never owned a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t.  Military since 1980, This is my third Wahl hair trimmers and this has always been the case, it is not unusual.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my parents.  My mom said it&#x27;s great and just what they needed.  No issues with it so far, and it&#x27;s been almost a year.</li>
    <li> bought a cheaper one before and it worked as well, if not better....blades tend to rust more than the cheaper one and cut about the same...unfortunately the blade on the cheap one went dull after a year of light usage...the motor on the cheap one also seemed to be going so i opted out of replacing blades... hopefully this one lasts a long time..I have been using this Wahl 84701 for about 7 months now and am happy with it overall..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl makes good products and I am not using this machine as a professional.  My advice: for light usage buy as cheap one for $30! They&#x27;re great for the money.</li>
    <li> Bought the clipper and used it for the first time.  Great product!  Not too loud, felt very comfortable to hold.  My son&#x27;s hair is extremely thick and wavy and it went through his hair without pulling and gave him a great cut!</li>
    <li> This is a great unit. I have used several that were much more expensive that did not last or do a good job. This is fast and sharp. My husband also said that this did not feel &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; like the others.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t wait for our old clippers to die. I was tired of taking so long to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and threw the old one away. Then read reviews and decided on this one.  Wow what a difference! Great choice and I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long. My husband loves it too.</li>
    <li> I have no experience with cutting hair (and was quite nervous about doing it) but these made it so easy, even the first time.</li>
    <li> This clippers does a wonder job. This doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise and it goes through thick hair with no problem</li>
    <li> Cuts hair and has a solid feel,  Wish blades were sharper or maybe a more powerful motor, but does the job.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair clipper.  Got the job done in nothing flat and it looked great!</li>
    <li> Everything is stylish and professional with the clippers themselves, but the attachments are a rainbow of disappointment. No case is pretty lame as well, luckily I dumped the trashy old clippers I had out of their case and commandeered it for this nicer set. The clippers will help you get trim, and cut your hair as well!</li>
    <li> these work great they cut through my hair very easily and and it felt like i was done in ten seconds</li>
    <li> a little noisy but it cuts very well</li>
    <li> I am a barber. I own a salon, and I cut hair everyday. I had used many different clippers already. this one is the worse.</li>
    <li> Works great! Didn&#x27;t overheat or get caught in my son&#x27;s hair while I cut.</li>
    <li> Have used the clipper 2 times and find it does an excellent job. I don&#x27;t have alot of hair mostly on the sides and back of my head. I find the attachments very useful as I keep my hair longer in the winter than in the summer.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. A little heavy but does a good cut. Had to buy a different set of comb gaurds to get the cut I wanted. All and all happy with my order.</li>
    <li> Huuuuuuge improvement and money well spent over the plastic Norelcos in my opinion. I t not only takes less time and doesn&#x27;t hurt but I didn&#x27;t realize before that those cheapies were actually not cutting very uniformly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a couple small gripes I have:&lt;br /&gt;the difference between a 1 and 2 on the attachment guides seems pretty large  (I imagine many novice home consumers are cutting variations of &amp;#34;pretty close&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is a little lever for dialing in height adjustment on the actual clipper that doesn&#x27;t seem to stay put, so if you&#x27;re not careful, you may slowly start cutting variating heights.</li>
    <li> Best Clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned have had them for about two months now and holding up great. If your looking for Clippers to do a great job no matter your hair length these are the ones to get.</li>
    <li> Works great! Excellent shipping.</li>
    <li> First of all, Im the kind of guy who hates bad reviews. Its a great boomer to find a product that you think it will be the perfect one and see a bad review. But in this case, theres no another option&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: yes, it cuts the hair like butter and with all the plastic heads you can manage easilly the lenght of each cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: here comes the dissapointment. It vibrates..,A LOT, making unconfortable to use it for more than a minute. The motor is really potent, but also this means this clipper is noisy as hell ( goodbye early morning haircuts)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch doesn&#x27;t work properly, having to struggle to find the right position to make this thing get working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it rust easilly, and when you use it to shave your face with the minimum lenght you will get cuts, I guarantee it</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described, good price, quick shipping. A+++ seller. Also, my first haircut by my wife was a success. If you&#x27;re a male looking for the right tool to put in &amp;#34;her&amp;#34; hand, congratulations you&#x27;ve found it!</li>
    <li> In my opinion they are great clippers. I would of liked a little bit of a closer cut with the number guard but all together I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> The best hair clippers I&#x27;ve ever used, by far!  I used it yesterday for the first time, and it clips hair like a hot knife through butter.  Or a knife through hot butter; whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are every bit as good as the clippers barbers use, although of course they are not built for tough action, day after day, year after year.  But we&#x27;re not professional barbers, and these will serve anyone but a barber extremely well, and it&#x27;s built to last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice transaction, speedy delivery.  Based on this experience, this is a good seller indeed.</li>
    <li> Was absolutely sold by the reviews and 4+ star rating, however I was disappointed by this product. This doesn&#x27;t feel like a professionally built clipper, from the sound, to the blade variety, to it&#x27;s overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is certainly not for African type hair. The blade sizes don&#x27;t include a 0 (zero) or a 1/2 (half), just a 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8. You don&#x27;t get that close barber-type cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taper tool is pretty pathetic. Not sharp at all. Not worth $46+ let alone $80+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I was able to do an average job using this product, but more comparable to a cheap trimmer than what I&#x27;d expect from a &#x27;professional&#x27; grade clipper.</li>
    <li> Does what is suppose to do and does a great job at it.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the extra $20-25.&lt;br /&gt;Taught my wife how to use this thing and save hundreds of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Get my haircut every other week.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me. You are looking at the best clipper for under $50.00&lt;br /&gt;And yet proudly made in the USA. I respect that</li>
    <li> No more yanked hairs. Happy son, happy husband, happy me. -AG</li>
    <li> SOOOOO much better than my old cheaper Wahl that I got at Wal-Mart. Cuts fast, cuts clean. Worth Every Penny...</li>
    <li> Purchased for wife to cut my hair.  She is a retired beautician who has used clippers at work.  She now states that she can do a nicer cut faster than the clippers she previously used to cut my hair.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.</li>
    <li> it was everything I expected</li>
    <li> This set is a duplicate of one I had bought for my Father, for home hair cuts. I&#x27;m sure it will be as good, as the other WAHL set.The different sizes gives you a choice of hair cut length. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a couple months ago and have used it 5-6 times to cut my own hair.  I have never owned one before so can only reference against the barbers I have had and this seems similar in quality.  So far, I am extremely happy with purchase and it has already payed for itself in haircut savings.  Only once did my wife shave &#x27;ND&#x27; into my head, but it was a Saturday and I had to let it happen!</li>
    <li> Reliable product and really good price combined with super fast shipping...very pleased.</li>
    <li> Very strong motor... Does an amazing job</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> it skips hair.  its harder to blend fine hair especially the shorter you go.  its not really for a busy hair dresser.  and it has a key on the side which i didnt know about so every once in a while you have to turn it to fix the power other wise it will get real loud or start grabbing the hair....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good machine. A bit lighter than one I was replacing of the same make/grade. At first, it was very loud and I was thinking of sending it back, but towards the end of the second cut with it, it seemed to &#x27;shake&#x27; into it&#x27;s normal, much quieter vibration. Now, I am more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers about 6 months ago.  They have worked great.  I use them on my hair and my son&#x27;s hair and have not had any problems.  They are quieter than my old clippers and cut a lot better too.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for over 20 years and these are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I always spend about the same, and these are a great deal.  I have really thick hair and always had to go over my head 2 or 3 times to get all the hair.  These clippers went right through it on the first try.  You should get these!</li>
    <li> Cuts hair like butter</li>
    <li> Cuts smoothly in one pass</li>
    <li> The transaction went smooth as expected and the product worked out perfect. Seller did an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Ordered them for my husband, he was tired of the ones that buy in the stores and was buying a pair every 4 to 6 months, very pleased with these. He says he can tell a difference in the clippers from the store brands. Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband...he was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start out with the most important bit of information, and the only significant negative thing I have to say about these clippers:  These use the V5000 motor, not the newer and superior V9000.  Further, the latter can be found in other Wahl models that are the same price.  The Wahl Icon, for example, is the same price and has all the same specs except the better motor.  I wish I had done a little research and gotten that instead.  Wahl has several models of near equal price, differing only by whether they have the better motor and whether they are intended for &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; hair (the latter being referred to as &amp;#34;five-star&amp;#34; models).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this is a very superior set of clippers.  The V5000 is far beyond normal clippers.  If you are used to regular, consumer-grade clippers as I am you will be blown away at how these sail through hair without leaving a single stray.  They are quiet and cool but clearly very powerful.  This is one of Wahl&#x27;s professional line and intended to be used by professionals or by consumers who want a higher level of performance.  This isn&#x27;t your mom&#x27;s clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like all the guards.  Each is a different color.  This comes with guards 1-8.  There is no 1/2, strangely (I saved the one from my old clippers and it fits, though I never use it in practice) and there are no angled ones for doing around ears.  That&#x27;s also fine by me...I always thought those were a waste.  The set comes with a little brush for cleaning the clippers, a little bottle of oil, and a comb.  There is no case to keep it in, which is a little bit of a bummer.  I keep mine in a gallon-sized ziplock bag.  I guess that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so nice that these clippers have a power cord (and it&#x27;s pretty long and very heavy duty).  Batteries are always the first thing to go in battery-powered clippers.  A/C powered clippers are the only way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are clearly more than satisfactory.  They do a great job and I think they will last a very, very long time.  I do wish they had the better motor, but not because I think I need it, just because I could have had it.  Not worth returning something that works perfectly and does the job I require, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, you will certainly be satisfied with these clippers, but if they are still the same price when you are shopping for them, get the Icon or another V9000 model isntead.I think they will last a very, very long time.

    <li> This clipper worked well until it died suddenly, i had it for less then a year. and would use it about every other week sometimes less.</li>
    <li> its ok I wish it came with a case , that is alittle bummer but I used my case from my last cheaper clipper  to store it in hope I can sharphen the blade , I wonder couldnt on the last one .</li>
    <li> All i can say is that, it&#x27;s crisp, it&#x27;s clean, it has a GREAT weight to it, fits real well in my hand, feels really comfortable, handles long time with low-med heat. Serrated blades for better hair feed to the clipper, solid 5000v clipper. Tapers REALLY well, just know how to fade, and this clipper is so GOLDEN, if you just trim your own this is  definately no look further, but as for me a barber, i will upgrade again, BUT this is one strong tool that can hold me off till i make the professional purchases.</li>
    <li> I Use to have a Wahl clipper when my 4 boys were little.  I cut their hair until they were grown.  Now I cut my grandsons.  Had other clippers here but they were not as efficient as a Wahl and this two year old boy is not going to set still for you to have to go over the same spot to catch missed hair.  But with these clippers it takes no time and he&#x27;s got a hair cut and on his way to play.  He like playing with the attachments as I cut for they are colorful but I like them because they are precise.  Everything about these clippers are easy to use.  The attachments nap on and off easily and the cutting adjustment moves the blades smoothly to allow an accurate cut.  The motor is very quiet compaired to my old one years ago.  I am very pleased with these clippers.  Glad I was able to purchase them.  I don&#x27;t think you will not be disappointed either.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave my head very often, but when I do, I use Wahl.  Stay cool my friends.</li>
    <li> Great product just as described everything arrived in super good condition and worked as its suppose too..</li>
    <li> Finally took the plunge and had my hair cut to 1/4 inch and my wife said she liked it.  Purchased the Wahl 84701 from Amazon and it works easily and makes keeping my hair short an easy task.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned clippers before or used a pair, but I just used the Wahl for the first time and they were great. I used the biggest clip that came with the Wahl (an 8 which is 1 inch) on the sides and back of my head and it looks pretty good to me. The pacakage came with the buzzer, a special looking comb, oil, a micro brush to clean the buzzer, and 8 clips 1-8. I&#x27;ll try to update on my next cut, which will be the top and sides.</li>
    <li> Works great, maybe not as close as my old one, but no nicks ever. where my old one could nick you once in a while</li>
    <li> I had to replace my clippers that I had used for 15 years. A lot of more budget friendly clippers wouldn&#x27;t give me as clean a cut and some even pulled hair as I was cutting. This model came highly recommended through amazon reviews and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Definitely gets the job done properly and worth paying the extra money to get a quality product that does the job it claims to do.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly and love them use them all the time on my male clients</li>
    <li> Very nice, work very well</li>
    <li> Good quality product.  Everything you need to cut men&#x27;s hair...you only need to provide the hair cutting skill...hmmm!  Wahl clippers are among the best available.  These worked great right out of the package.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our 16 year old son whose hair seems to grow so fast that we were taking him for 30 dollar trims twice a month. We watched the Wahl videos and other hair-cutting videos on line to master how to use it - it&#x27;s a lot easier than you would think.  He&#x27;s very self-conscious and yet loves the results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not work that well on other body parts (chest for example). It also doesn&#x27;t do edging and tidying well at all.  We just bought a Wahl Peanut for this - i&#x27;ll post a review on that when we get it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final word - this isn&#x27;t bulky and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of storage (despite the generous power cable).  We keep everything in a zip-lock bag and leave it in a drawer.</li>
    <li> Does the job. I suggest keeping blades oiled as decribed in users manual and you should enjoy it too. Runs smooth with power. Does not get hot like some do. That hasn&#x27;t been my experience,the multiple that i have used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long used cheap clippers, but if I had known the difference, I would have upgraded to this one a long time ago. Cuts through hair like butter.</li>
    <li> Welcome to the World of Wahl!  I&#x27;ve owned a number of hair trimmers.  My thick beard usually ruins them in six to nine months.  When I took the Professional Super Taper II out of the box when it arrived, I felt like a barber.  It is a solid, well built machine.  The first time I used it, I experienced clean trimming with no hair pulling.  I expect this Wahl will still be standing long after the usual nine months.</li>
    <li> these clippers are absolutely fantastic. they really do go through hair like a hot knife through butter, have a lovely, substantial heft to them, and couldn&#x27;t be easier for first-time haircutters. they&#x27;re perfect. look no further.</li>
    <li> I love it, n such a GREAT buy!!!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m so happy because it came on time, and everything was right.</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best hair trimmers I had ever owned and I bought hundreds of clippers over the last 25 years. Tapers are super easy to do with these. All I need to get now are some good T-outliners and I can open up me a shop! These were a great surprise gift!</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Nice and quiet. Incredibly accurate. I do wish they came with a case, however. The bag just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. Quick shipping though.</li>
    <li> Get product. Works like a champ, unlike the Remington that snags and pulls hair out instead of cutting.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:ab8d01da6799a4a25a5286e395ac5be5]]a terrible noise maker! just tried it a while ago after a while it failed to power on. really can&#x27;t  give a conclusion whether its still in good shape.the fact is this situation may not apply to other product product of the same kind.I consider this item exclusively may have a manufacturer defect.it is yet to power up.</li>
    <li> I usually wait 4 my son to visit to get a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Now...all by myself. Great handling and a little advice from my son and...&amp;#34;I did it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my son&#x27;s hair. It does an excellent job. I do it while he is watching tv on his high chair. Its very quiet, so it helps tremendously as he does not keep looking up wondering about noise. Plus I save tons of money by doing hair at my place and not a salon. Its easy to clean and i know it will last me for many years. It is a bit on the heavier side, but I&#x27;m willing to compromise for its quietness.</li>
    <li> I think these are a good clippers nice an quite an they work great the only thing that would have had made them  better is if they had a storage case for the clipper an combs.</li>
    <li> They are ok for buzzing with no guard. If you are balding or bald these probably wont cut short enough to your liking with no guard.</li>
    <li> This product is a great trimmer, the only downside for me was its weight. I was not expecting it to be as heavy as it was. I only bought this as a beard trimmer, and although it trims very well, it just isn&#x27;t light enough.</li>
    <li> It cuts hair well, but there are several concerning points. 1- I keep my hair short. So, I need trim that changes in small increments.  The smallest one is too short and the next size up is too long for me 2- Vibrates a lot.  My wife cuts my hair and she doesn&#x27;t like to use it because it makes so much noise and vibrates so much 3- Typically shavers I have used work 110V-220V AC power.  This one only works with 110V.  So, if you go to Europe and take it with you, it is useless.</li>
    <li> I have had Wahl clippers for over twenty years and have been satisfied. These new clippers are the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> el producto es la calidad que describen y el tiempo de llegada del producto es el estipulado en los parametros</li>
    <li> Awesome clipper! Cuts clean, easy, smooth, and sharp. Wish I baught this sooner! I use to use a cheap conair clipper and that thing broke within a month its horrible. But this wahl clipper is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Shave my head 12-15 times a year.  So far this trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Gives an even cut, lightweight, and has a long enough cord.</li>
    <li> If you want a good hair clipper you should buy this one.Works great, powerful machine.I use this machine for 30 minutes and it remains ice cold babe.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fantastic these clippers work. I&#x27;ve recently had surgery above my left eyebrow, and I&#x27;m required to wear a bandage around my head to keep the area compressed. When my hair gets too long, it curls over the bandage, giving me a mushroom-head (more like penis-head) look, which is quite embarrassing. I don&#x27;t like going to get my hair cut at a barbershop since my eyebrow region is a complete mess and I don&#x27;t like having to remove my bandage in public. So these clippers have really been a life-saver for me. I can cut my hair whenever I want, wherever I want, at my own leisure, and in the comfort of my bathroom (it&#x27;s a pretty comforting bathroom). I&#x27;d highly recommend these to anyone who typically keeps short hair and can&#x27;t be bothered going and paying a barber however much money every few weeks to keep your hair in a nice, trimmed state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best buy I&#x27;ve made in a long time, for sure!</li>
    <li> Works on 110V only. Good piece of cutter. Silent.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer, it does the job!</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my hair for a few months using this item and I could not be happier. Easy to use and the clean up is simple.</li>
    <li> These are great. Cut clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I use it at home but it is the same one they used at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> works great, have an issue with it but my wife dropped it and now the blade is crooked still works but cant seem to get it to straighten out even when disassembling it.</li>
    <li> Since I retired &amp; moved from my favorite hair cutter, I bought this for my wife to use on my head.  Very easy to use and appears to be well built.  I love the choice of tools.  Since i like my hair very short this accomplishes the task and saves time &amp; money!</li>
    <li> I had been using cheap battery driven cutters and if you didn&#x27;t wash your hair right before cutting, they would lock up.  Now with these cutters, they are awesome.  Somewhat quiet and very sharp and powerful.  I did not experience it getting really hot (got a little warm near the end but that&#x27;s acceptable).  Overall, a great buy and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> -easy to use the first time.. Now my wife can cut my hair like a pro, saving money and trips to the barber.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of clippers for the price. Quiet, looks and feels like professional clippers! Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever owned.  I use them at the lowest setting so I do not use any attachments.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and my prvious clippers needed multiple passes to get even cuts....&lt;br /&gt;these wahl clippers have a stronger motor and cut my hair very smooth and fast.</li>
    <li> In the Discription did not mention that these came with a set of combs.  Well now I have two sets.  Great!</li>
    <li> Ask my wife, she cut the first cut, and she likes what she sees - that works WELL for me Seems to cut like a barber would do.</li>
    <li> the clipper are good they dont heat up it cuts quick as long as you do maintence like putting oil on it and cleaning it runs good my hair cuts comes out 100% better my customers like how the hair cuts come out with the new clippers</li>
    <li> HAD FOR A YEAR-SHAVE HEAD TWICE WEEKLY , STILL WORKS FINE</li>
    <li> This is by far the best trimmer I have ever owned. Lots of power, plows through hair like a hot knife through butter. Attachments fit well just make sure you start with one that you may think is a bit to large because you may be surprised at how close you can get with some of the smaller ones.</li>
    <li> Outstanding clippers!  They slice right through my thick hair quickly and efficiently without pulling.  They run circles around the cheap crappy conair clippers I had previously.</li>
    <li> Good comes with 4,6,1.3,8 etc clippers</li>
    <li> Item as described, good transaction</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift to  my son. He really enjoys it and uses it very often. With his job he doesn&#x27;t always have the time to get his hair trimmed,so this helps and gives his the extra grooming he needs.</li>
    <li> This is quality stuff. I can now save money on Haircuts cuz i know people that will do it</li>
    <li> These clipper cut through my hair like butter, and I have worn out quite a few other pairs of clippers. My hair is fairly thick, and these clippers don&#x27;t even bat an eye going through the thickest part. I would definitely recommend these to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Update: Have used these about 6 times to trim my beard/hair. Still work great and cuts as good as the first time!!</li>
    <li> What else to say. It does the job easily and stays cool when cutting hair. We will see about longevity though.</li>
    <li> These clippers are amazing, finally clippers that work like brand new after a dozen haircuts. Been using these most of the summer and I love them, I cut my hair twice as fast. I can even get a pretty decent fade too, only problem for fades is without a guide they don&#x27;t get real close, but I have separate clippers for that so these are great for everything else.  These are definitely worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Maybe this a five star product, but I have not owned it long enough for it to earn the test of time 5 stars. It worked wonderfully cutting easily, and my cut looks like a sporty rather than a military (using the #8 and #4 combs).  One benefit is that it comes with a set of eight combs, sizes #1 to #8.  Other products in the price range include just the #1 through #4 (and I think that is ok for balding and military cuts, but if you want a little more length, then #8 is good). Also this model has an adjustable blade to get closer to the skin.  I bought this because world wide austerity is forcing me to go on a budget, and after one more hair cut with it, I am at the break-even point on costs compared to going to the stylist, and although my new style is a shorter than before, after all the experienced stylist uses scissors and combs etc that I cannot match, I am nonetheless happy with it. If you are trying for a longer cut than a #2 or #4, then it may be better to get a friend/loved one to do the cut for you, rather than trying yourself.</li>
    <li> Had a set just like these only mine were not super taper 2. I like these 10x better then my previous clippers! They get closer to the head. I LOVE them!!</li>
    <li> Never cut hair in my life. But circumstances forced me into it. Being a caregiver for my 80+ year old parents and them not being able to visit the haircutters as usual I had to make the move.. These shears made the transition easy as pie. Just take your time to size things up and voila ...  it happens as expected. No complaints. Buy these.</li>
    <li> I am a stylist and I use these clippers any where from 2 to 14 times a day. Never have had a single issue, but I always clean, lubricate, and change the head when necessary. I absolutely love them. They are quiet and cut through just about anything. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for buzz cuts. As someone in the military it is far easier to just buzz everything off. Used it 4-5 times now. Great product for the price. Cuts perfectly on the first pass.</li>
    <li> Bought this clipper to cut my husband and son&#x27;s hair. This is the first clipper I have purchased. I have been using it for 6 months now. It cuts hair great. Both my men (my hubby and son) have very course thick hair and the clipper doesnt skip a beat. I really like the color coordinated attachments. Makes it easier even though the numbers are written right on it. I hope this clipper holds out, but so far I am very impressed. I use it every two weeks for both guys. We save $70 a month on hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Got these to replace a worn out Wahl clipper we had for over 12 years that was on its last leg. These ones are super quiet and cut very very well. They work great on wet or dry hair. The color coded sizes are nice. Only down side is no case/bag to put everything in. Luckily we kept the old bag we had for storage of the new clippers. And a side note, I think the cord is a little bit shorter than the old clippers, but thats not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I ordered one before and the machine is so good i had to ordered again.  So i recommended this clipper to anyone for personal or professional use.</li>
    <li> I bought this Wahl clipper to replace a Wahl that was about ten years old (unfortunately the old cord wore out). This Wahl is good, but cost more and does no better than the old clippers. Amazon had something similar to the old clipper, but the model number was different and it looked a little different (my old clippers had a face that was all silver colored).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers might actually be a little better cutting, but the results are not as good. My hair gets cut fine, but I get a couple uneven spots, which did not happen before. I&#x27;ve only used them twice, and last time was better, so hopefully I just need to adjust. That said, the older, less expensive model needed no adjusting. I also like the attachments on the last set better, which may be the reason for the uneven cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still optimistic they are good clippers, but you may want to get the less expensive set.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas Gift for my Hubby. I must say that he is very pleased with the look, design and its functionality. After doing a little maintenance on the clippers to reduce the noise, he is extremely satisfied with the finish these clippers provide.</li>
    <li> great even trim. very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The clipper was just as described. It has good weight to it and it does an awesome job of cutting hair. I have used it several times. There is no pulling and the motor has a strong sound, without being overly noisy . It is nothing like the cheap version my husband brought home.</li>
    <li> It is not quiet as the first generation. The close and open lever fastened screw turned counterclockwise every time I closed the blade. Therefor, the blade moving either up or down while the clipper is operating. This will not giving precisely cut.</li>
    <li> 5 star Reviews are true.&lt;br /&gt;Just got it and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use, works just like you would want it to work. Smooth and powerful.</li>
    <li> Heading into retirement, I&#x27;m trimming costs as well as hair.  I&#x27;ve tried cheaper versions of hair cutters: Bleck!  This instrument is solid in the hand, quiet, doesn&#x27;t bog down in my very thick hair, doesn&#x27;t tug and yank while doing it&#x27;s work, and comes with great accessories. The accessories, basically attachments that allow one to choose the length of the hair one wants, are easy to comprehend, easy to attach/detach, and leave a smooth and natural looking head of cropped hair,  It looks to last for years, built like a Mack truck.  Complaints?  Well....if they could have made it cordless it would be the perfect product!</li>
    <li> Quality product. works very well! i do my boys about every 3-4 weeks and now i got  my wife to do my hair. it has paid for itself already and that was the point. im done paying 12-16 x 3 people for the same thing in a a barber shop</li>
    <li> Very good and it seems like it will last for a long time... be prepared though.. It is very loud.</li>
    <li> works great, love this.</li>
    <li> These are a really good value.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome, just wish I could get a comb for it that had a longer length, but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace a older wahl clipper I had been using for quit a while this unit cuts great. It did not come with as many attachments as my older unit but the ones from my older unit fit just fine!</li>
    <li> This product delivers perfect service.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this clipper! It is the best that he&#x27;s had so far. Very sturdy and good quality. Pleased.</li>
    <li> I first purchased the Oster Fast Feed Clippers and returned them shortly after receiving them because I was not impressed at all. I went with these Whal Clippers for a cheaper price and they work great.</li>
    <li> very good hair clipper.  Solid, seems well made and sits nicely in my hand.  I had an old Wahl that was significantly less expensive and I didn&#x27;t realize how it was laboring to cut hair until I bought this one.  very powerful, and comes with all the guiding attachments I needed.  also comes with styling comb and small plastic bottle of lubricating oil.  have used five or six times and am pleased with purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I have four boys (so far), and I cut their hair. (In fact, I cut pretty much everybody&#x27;s hair in my house.) Come summer time, it&#x27;s time for the buzz cut, both them and me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few years now, I&#x27;ve been struggling with my trimmer. Admittedly, it was designed more for beards than heads, but I managed to make do.  The thing was, it took, even for a simple buzz cut, way too long--multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I got fed up and decided that I should invest in a better option.  After poking around here on Amazon and reading the reviews, I opted for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. Just wow. I mean, talk about night and day. One pass and it is done. I&#x27;d guess in the time it took me to do one boy&#x27;s hair with the old trimmers, I got all of us done with this one. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some pros:&lt;br /&gt;- cuts awesomely&lt;br /&gt;- looks nice&lt;br /&gt;- easy to maintain&lt;br /&gt;- plenty of guards that snap on/off easily; color coded to make it easier to find the one you want&lt;br /&gt;- comes with oil and cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- it is a tad heavy (not that I mind); I assume this is normal for trimmers in this class. I did all of us, though, with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;- it gets a bit hot--I was worried the boys might complain, but it seems only I noticed; even trimming with no guard on the neck caused no complaints (just tickles)&lt;br /&gt;- corded - again, I don&#x27;t really care, but it does get in the way here and there a bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as one can be in love with clippers, I am in love with these. I actually am looking forward to trimming my hair again.  I also used it on my full beard for an even cut. Of course, no probs. I still use my trimmer for the detailing.</li>
    <li> These clippers work well, but mine vibrate really hard.  I my three little boys hair and mine all in one setting, by the end my hand hurts.  It has a thick gauged cord on it as well.  In the past on previous clippers the cord at the base has gotten hot after 4 hair cuts in a row.  I would recommend this for a family, maybe mine are just unique on the vibration.</li>
    <li> Enjoying this set of clippers so much, cuts right through hair with ease. I recommend them to anyone 100% don&#x27;t be afraid of the weight or per-scission of the blade.</li>
    <li> Saves money over the barber shop.  I can get my hair cut at home in the same amount of time and save a bunch of money.  The cord is a bit limiting, but it has much more power than my battery operated trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended these to my brother because he gets his hair cut at home, but is using an inferior product that does not cut through hair as fast as this does.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.. feels just like the electric tool used in the barber shop and cuts the same - happy customer</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper as a replacement for another much older Wahl clipper that had a frayed power cord due to years of use and storage. That clipper was at least a decade old and was still working, it just would intermittently stop running depending on the angle of the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because the Wahl had served me so well in the past, and I must say that I think this set is even better than the last. It has what seems to be a metal body that feels sturdy and solid in your hand. The blades are tight, cut well, and have an adjustable length lever on the side. When turned on, the motor runs very smoothly and I don&#x27;t foresee and problems from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper comes with a set of colored guards which snap onto the blade area and allow you to trim your hair to a specific desired length. The guards are plastic and each one is a different color to help distinguish them when you are looking through the pack trying to find the right one. That is an improvement over the old one, since all those guards were colored black and it was difficult to shuffle through them while telling them apart and finding the appropriate size. The guards are also marked in easy to read numbers with what length in inches you want the hair to be trimmed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my job, I have to keep my hair trimmed to a certain length due to policy. I also don&#x27;t like wasting money on hair cuts. I am a guy and my hair style is not that complicated. When my hair starts to get a bit long, I put the half inch guard on the clipper and run it along my head until I have trimmed it all up. Easy as can be. It is also great for trimming the unruly hair around your sideburns and ears that can be difficult to get with scissors. My girlfriend can use this on me to trim up and straighten my neckline after I get the rest of my head done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with a small brush and a bottle of very thin clear blade oil. Once done using them, take the brush and brush away the small pieces of hair left in the grooves of the clipper blades, then turn the clippers on and put a couple drops of oil on the blades themselves. The blades movement and vibrations will move the oil and coat the blades protecting them and making sure that this product continues to serve you well for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional when it comes to hair cutting, but even if I was I think this product would serve me well.

    <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with this clipper and its accessories. The function and performance leave much to be desired. The clipper isn&#x27;t ridiculously loud, but it&#x27;s noticeably louder than the (much less expensive) dog clippers that I use on my pooch, for example. The vibration level is surprisingly high. I felt more hand/wrist numbness after 10 minutes of using this clipper than I do after an hour and a half of pushing a mower around my lawn. The clipper fits in the hand well enough, but is on the heavy side. The included guards leave much to be desired. The lengths printed on them aren&#x27;t accurate, and between that and the fact that there are multiple &#x27;styles&#x27; of guards means you don&#x27;t get a consistent scale when switching between guards (e.g. the length difference between the #1 and the #2 is not the same as the length difference between the #2 and #3, even though according to the lengths printed on the guards there should be a 1/8&amp;#34; difference in either case). Whether it&#x27;s the guards or the blades themselves, I also found that a lot of stray hairs (hairs longer than the rest around them) are left behind, even after passing over an area multiple times from multiple directions. Overall I&#x27;m very disappointed with the clipper. I may use it once or twice more just to be able to say that I got my money&#x27;s worth out of it, but this will not be my long-term clipper.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time was exactly as described. Thanks I can&#x27;t wait to do business in the future.</li>
    <li> I have only used these clippers three times so far, but the appearance, weight, and overall feel while clipping is exceptional - much better than the cheaper and less expensive product I purchased at my local Walmart several years ago. I purchased these clippers to replace the ones I wore out (just stopped working after finishing a cut one day while I was cleaning it). The only con is the lack of tappered Left/Right ear guides, but I still have those along with the full set from my old clippers so I&#x27;m good. I cut my own hair and these are the only way to go  8-^)</li>
    <li> Quiet, smooth cutting clippers. My husband used them and says they do not get overly hot. Other reviewers spoke about how loud and unruly the clippers were. We must have gotten a really good pair. Would recommend this brand and style.</li>
    <li> These are an amazing pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> Love it. It is not loud and cuts great!!</li>
    <li> I just used these clippers for the first time and I&#x27;m very pleased and impressed. The clippers are quite heavy and large but the bulk makes them easy to hold. When I ran the #4 guide through my head it didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing anything but it was cutting easily with absolutely no pull. These will also give you a bonus brain massage as the vibration is pretty intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are saying the clippers are unbelievably loud, I thought the same at first - there is a &amp;#34;power screw&amp;#34; on the side of the clippers. Just turn it counterclockwise with the clippers on until the noise stops. Once I did this they were very quiet.</li>
    <li> Great Clipper! Also great for my short beard trimming. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good product, would buy again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It a good set of clippers. There nothing special. Honestly I had a pair of $30 wahls that worked exactly the same way. I would save your money on this set and look into a regular pair of wahls</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to purchase my second clipper in this model.  It&#x27;s a wonderful clipper, but ignore the post saying it&#x27;s crap because it clogs clipping a dog&#x27;s coat.  He bought the wrong clipper for the job he wanted it to do. I also clip Standard Poodles, and I use Walh  brand clippers as well as Andis and Oster, but ones made for the texture of an animal&#x27;s coat.  Plus, with an animal you have to clean the hair out as you clip, or it will clog and DULL the BLADE in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For human hair, I love this clipper; and especially because it has the adjustable blade lever on the side.  With the lever (AND the blade combs) you have multiple cutting lengths to fine tune your haircuts.</li>
    <li> Plenty of power,easy to clean, and the attachments work great at cutting hair to specified length.This is a quality machine.</li>
    <li> So far I like this Wahl very well.  Seems to work almost as well as the Wahl I bought in 1962.</li>
    <li> First impression: Very beautiful. Looks very professional. It&#x27;s quite heavy and feel very solid in hand.&lt;br /&gt;Using it is very easy, especially if you just use the plastic guiding attachments, which are all well made and not cheap at all. Although for use for children I suggest making the attachments less pointy using sand paper.&lt;br /&gt;Also it is surprisingly quiet and is extremely cost-effective in the long run.</li>
    <li> i used to own wahl professional hair clippers and it died after over 10 years of use. this one is lighter and has the same powerful motor.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend as a valentine&#x27;s day gift and he just loved!  He can take care of his hair on his own without missing a spot. I&#x27;ve never bought a hair clipper before and was concerned about which one to buy. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I use my clippers about once a month to cut my hair at home and these work great! I have not had any issues.</li>
    <li> Very beefy, cuts sharp, no tugging, long tough cord. Only wish it came with a fabric zipper case. I have two sons and a husband and they all have no issue with me cutting their hair at home with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> A Christmas present for my son.  But quality was what I wanted and that is exactly what I got great quality.</li>
    <li> This thing is a life saver. The wahl I bought before was okay but this one was more professional, let me tell you it cut hair really good I use this on myself and on my friends. This is worth every penny save up $45.00 and get this bad boy!</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair because he is such a procrastinator that it would be way too long before he would make it to the barber.  I was using some $10 clippers I had purchased from Family Dollar.  They stopped working so I searched and found this Wahl clipper.  Have used it once and it made &amp;#34;all the difference in the world&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Buen producto y entrega lo recomiendo a cualquiera q este interesado, buena maquina por un buen precio vale la pena</li>
    <li> this is the second wahl I have bought for myself. It is the 4th one i have used. I have cut all kinds of hair including dogs, so far real good.</li>
    <li> Just got this item and used once. Worked pretty well.I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. I&#x27;ll see how long it can last.Hope it would last long.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper.  I have used lesser quality for many years and I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing.  I love the balance and the feel of the clipper...And, Oh what a difference in the acutal cutting.  It cuts quickly and I did warn my hubby to not make any quick turns of his head! The results were a smooth, clean cut.  I highly recommend this clipper.</li>
    <li> So good! I wish it came with a carry case.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product! Compared with the cheap &amp;#34;Wal-Mart-style&amp;#34; clippers I had before, these are on a whole different level. I used to have to go over the same section of hair repeatedly, but this product gets the job done with just ONE pass - even when trimming hair to an inch long. The machine is fairly heavy, but not too heavy to hold. Comes with a great selection of attachments (up to 1 inch length) and doesn&#x27;t get clogged up like the old one did. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair, and these clippers didn&#x27;t even flinch. I went back with a hand razor to clean up, but I couldn&#x27;t get it any shorter than what these clippers already did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside for me (not the clippers) is that these are pretty powerful. They consistently trigger my bathroom outlet&#x27;s breaker, so I can&#x27;t use them in that outlet.</li>
    <li> Quiet, runs cool, no problems.  Happy with these clippers and would buy again though I don&#x27;t think I will need another pair - these appear that they will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Good product. Worth the money. The only thing that would make it better is if it came with a case.</li>
    <li> Replaced a cheap pair of clippers and I am glad i did. These work great and buzz right thru the hair.</li>
    <li> Bought these since I have 3 boys to give haircuts to and they did not like the feel of the robocut that I had been using.  Seem to be built very good,  run quietly with very little vibration, and do not get hot after giving 3 haircuts in a row.  Attachments fit well and work just fine.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has thick facial hair and has always had a hard time finding a good trimmer that works well to trim his hair. This product was it---he&#x27;s been happy with this product. Another suggestion---straight razors. He bought one off of amazon, you save a tremendous amount of money on cartridges...just tricky to use at first. Worth looking at!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these clippers .They are a slight bit heavier than most, but are made the way Wahl clippers used to be made...Very Solid!! I expect that these clippers will last for years. This model would be the only model that I would buy if I ever needed another one.</li>
    <li> Like it but it gets hot after one cut. I can&#x27;t cut two kids hair back to back it gets too hot in my hand.</li>
    <li> Used it to cut my hair by myself -  and I didn&#x27;t screw it up!!&lt;br /&gt;Very well made, professional grade clipper.  Will probably be the last one I buy.</li>
    <li> have bought many 20-30 dollar clippers that only last about a year this was not much more and the quality is obvious very happy with this.</li>
    <li> The clippers cut my sons thick hair with no pulling or stalling out. Did a great job. My old clippers would stall out and I could only clip half the width of the clipper at a time</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a Wahl 30 dollar model to this one. This one is much better. It cuts my hair so fast that it doesn&#x27;t have time to overheat.&lt;br /&gt;Most certainly worth the $50 price tag!</li>
    <li> Awesome set of clippers.  Blades are sharp, but not in away to cut skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp design, and reduced cutting times tremendously.  Engine is&lt;br /&gt;very powerful, doesn&#x27;t get hot easily.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is excellent. I did a lot of research before buying it. It is built very well; rugged and sturdy construction. Has plenty of power to cut through any type of hair. Easy to take apart to clean as well. The price on Amazon is very good.</li>
    <li> Just did my first buzz with these clippers a couple days ago. I was blown away as soon as I turned it on. The sharp click of the blade kicking in and then just a smooth hum. It made quick work of my fairly thick hair. It handles nicely but the weight of it will take some adjusting if you&#x27;re switching from a cheaper clipper as I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color-coded combs are really handy and snap on firmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the kind of product I wish I had bought sooner. I know it&#x27;ll last for years and its a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> Sons birthday present, wanted one to last, and do believe this one fits the  bill, nice heavy pair of clippers, like the barber shop, Love them</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly and had all the attachments I need. Ordered from ForeverYoung and it arrived quickly. I use it on my beard as well :)</li>
    <li> So far so good. Cuts really close with no pulling of the hair.</li>
    <li> Cuts fine, I suppose. I don&#x27;t really feel the difference between these and the lower end/cheaper Wahl clippers I still have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge downside is that the length adjustment lever is LOOSE. I&#x27;d set it at the highest level and begin cutting the back of my head, only to realize that it had somehow ended up at the lowest length. After some testing, it appears that using any sort of pressure will force the lever into the lowest length, which is an issue to say the least.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son to take to college with him.  Works well but motor has a loud vibration as reported by my son.  Hopefully it will last.</li>
    <li> I like it and it is adequate, does not get close enough though</li>
    <li> These clippers are super heavy and quality is awesome. These were half the price compared to Sally beauty for the same exact thing. Cuts clean and fast!</li>
    <li> brand new and in perfect condition Clippers work great</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with &amp;#34;Wahl&#x27;s&amp;#34; representation of this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I require a clipper that is more heavy duty than what I have and was pleased to find this listed as having a &amp;#34;motor&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand classifying a &amp;#34;vibrator&amp;#34; as a &amp;#34;motor&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s what this device is, pure and simple; hence my rating.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once since receiving it and the cut was acceptable.</li>
    <li> Bought the Wahl for my bf and he loves it! He&#x27;s gone through 2 other prior to this set and he finally satisfied</li>
    <li> I did not realize that the clippers I had were almost exactly like this one. I am glad because my old set is about 8 years old and has been used alot. If you want a very good priced clipper that works great and is reliable this is the one for you. I am sure I can have this for another 8 years, but I also take good care of them. I make sure and oil at least every other use and sometimes use alcohol and wipe down really well.</li>
    <li> really easy to use and cuts clean just like getting your hair trimmed or cut at the barber. attachments are easy to install</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own hair for well over a decade and have used a number of different types of clippers. Now my son and all of his friends have me shaving their heads as well for football season. The Wahl clippers are far and away the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Powerful, they cut the time involved almost in half. They arrived promptly, before the expected delivery day. I can&#x27;t say enough about them. If you&#x27;re considering this set, look no further, you&#x27;ll not find a better one.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair like a pro, not too loud, and gives a nice close trim.</li>
    <li> No more making appointments and paying 15-20 dollars for a 5 minute haircut. And on the Wahl  the very same unit was selling for over 100 dollars. Thank You Amazon.</li>
    <li> Nice quality for those who cut theri own hair, a little heavier than my old wal mart cutters but much better quailty. I will write back to see how they hold up.  Right now just a couple of haircuts. I had to adjust the blade a little because it wasnt close enough and thats about it, all the parts fit great.</li>
    <li> I was a beginner who had decided that enough was enough! I decided that I would rather learn to cut my own hair rather than spend $15 of my hard-earned money on a lousy haircut. As a beginner, not only was I impressed by the excellent quality of the clippers, but I was amazed by the sense of bravery and confidence I got to cut my own hair. As a beginner, my first haircut was not so bad. I strongly recommend the Wahl Taper II Clippers to all beginners who want to take control of their own haircut. It is a great investment and in the long-term you will NOT be disappointed. And do not be afraid to cut your own hair! JUST DO IT!</li>
    <li> Happy! It is my second Wahl clippers. Glad to see that they are still making a good product.</li>
    <li> worth the extra money over the basic line of wahl clippers. Much bigger motor, more accessories , color coded sizers make it much easier to remember what length everyone likes.</li>
    <li> I actually received this product broken, the blades in which are suppose to cut the hair were crooked or in this case also broken, it is not cordless so it&#x27;s yet another inconvenience, so the worst part has to be that this products plug works for a certain type of outlets.</li>
    <li> The motor got blown. what can i do?</li>
    <li> High power setting vibrations are a worry and rather unnecessary. They could look in to vibration dampeners for next upgrade. It does have a V8 engine. Good idea to start with lower power setting and larger trim piece. Great product overall. Been a while I bought USA made product.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my husband&#x27;s head for years and this is my favorite clipper so far.  A little heavy, but works very smoothly.</li>
    <li> Is everything I wanted. Now I cut my hair wheni I want it and do a good job have had great compliments from complete strangers.</li>
    <li> A pro tool, well worth the money paid</li>
    <li> Horribly loud!! Used one time then threw them away. It was like getting a hair cut with a chainsaw.</li>
    <li> Love the color coded blades--makes it easy to find the right one.  I have saved hundreds on haircuts for my boys.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I watched a number of videos on the Internet to learn how to use it.  They were better than the instructions.  But the instrument is great and works as it should.</li>
    <li> Happy costumer ...the best</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a professional set of clippers at a good price, look no further. Before I bought these, I asked my buddy (who&#x27;s a professional barber) what his recommendation was as far as brands go and he suggested these clippers specifically. I purchased these, looking to cut my own hair and avoid paying $20 every other week, as I&#x27;ve been doing the past 10+ years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build Quality&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is definitely one of the things that stand out. These don&#x27;t feel cheap like some other brands. In comparison to other cheaper clippers, the noise level on these is very manageable. Even with the guards on them, the noise level on these is still pretty good. They don&#x27;t have a whispering motor or anything, but they won&#x27;t burst your eardrum when cutting your hair either. When cutting, these feel great in the hand. I&#x27;ve had issues with some clippers that didn&#x27;t have good grip or the shape of them made them a pain to hold while cutting my own hair. These don&#x27;t have that problem. Whether I&#x27;m cutting my hair or someone else&#x27;s, these feel pretty good in my left or right hand. The cord on these is also pretty lengthy, so no worries about a short cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance&lt;br /&gt;These clippers slice through my hair effortlessly. With some other clippers that I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ve had issues with them getting stuck and skipping over some parts of my hair. Haven&#x27;t had that problem with these whatsoever. As I follow through cutting from back to front or front to back, these remain on course, slicing through my hair, not skipping a beat. My hair is a bit thicker than most peoples, so the powerful motor on these and sharp blades allowing them to cut easily has been amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I have with these clippers is the fact that they do not come with a 1 1/2 guard. BUT, Wahl does sell this separately for about $5 (which isn&#x27;t bad at all). I&#x27;ve been using the #2 guard that came with the clippers for the past month and I&#x27;ve liked it. I just want my hair a tad bit shorter. That is a personal preference thing though and I&#x27;ve just ordered the 1 1/2 guard for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for a little over a month now and I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with my purchase.my hair a tad bit shorter. That is a personal preference thing though and I&#x27;ve just ordered the 1 1/2 guard for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for a little over a month now and I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great price and he used them all the time. They are recommend by a barber and I found them at a great price here.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older Wahl that I had dropped--that one was never quite the same after that.  This updated clipper is quiet and steady, and I immediated wrapped it with gripper tape to avoid a repeat tragedy.  I use this in conjunction with the Andis T-liner trimmer, and my husband loves his custom haircuts from &#x27;his personal stylist!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Very professional product built with high quality materials.</li>
    <li> Works good, but honestly very over priced.</li>
    <li> Good deal for my wife.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my hair at home for approx. 15 years. (Actually, it&#x27;s me cutting the sides and my wife cutting the top and doing the final trim.) This is my third electric cutter in that time period and, without a doubt, the best one to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picking the cutter up, you will notice the weight of the unit. It is heftier than the typical retail unit. Flip the switch and you will hear the same &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; that you hear at the barber shop. Snap a comb over the blades and run it through your hair. You&#x27;ll find that it cuts your hair with far fewer repetitions. One side note: when cutting for the first time, go with a comb number higher than you would normally use. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, combs from my old Conair cutter fit this Wahl Super Taper 2 perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars instead of 5? I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that the power switch is built to last. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it right now, it just feels like it&#x27;s the weak point of the unit. Also, there are a lot of parts(8 cutting combs and regular comb) and no storage bag. I kept the bag from my Conair and that works for me. If this is your first cutter, you may not be lucky enough to have a decent storage option available.</li>
    <li> Great clipper, its powerful and easy to use. I think these clippers are better than andis masters, because I don&#x27;t experience the hair pulling. these clippers are sharp and cuts well for home use. I will never spend another dollar at the barber shop.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several hair clipper sets over the past fifty years, including this same brand. But these are the best. I&#x27;m sure you could find better clippers for a lot more money, but unless you cut hair every day, these are all you will need. They have the feel of pro quality and have more power than any I&#x27;ve owned before. The cord is also heavier and longer, and I was surprised by how a couple more feet of cord expands movement and flexibility. The kit comes with the usual attachments you may need or want, all sealed in a blister pack. What you won&#x27;t get is a case in which to store everything. Otherwise, five stars!!</li>
    <li> My husband loved it!!</li>
    <li> According to my mom that has now used it to cut my and hair and my brother&#x27;s, this thing is very nice.  Immediately she exclaimed how nice it worked.  She has been for years cutting the hear with various Con-Air or other products obtained either through a local merchant like Target, or a hair store.  I would generally buy these for about 50$, give or take 10, and they would often feature things like cordless op, etc.  They would generally last couple years and no one would make a fuss about how well it worked, or how sad they were that it was gone.  What I really did not know back then is the difference between a Home product and a Salon product.  Well this one above is the the latter while all previous ones were the former mentioned.  It feels very sturdy and heavy, and professional.  It features a powerful but loud motor.  No useless features that will not last anyway.  Cuts like a pro and I loved using it for my overgrown beard.  The attachments are much like the ones that came with my other ones but a cool add-on is the color-coding.  Unfortunately, unlike the cheaper, annoying machines I previously owned, this one does not come with anything else, most notably a carrying case.  It comes packaged in a cheap see-through plastic casing.  I actually loved the perceived philosophy behind this product - everything that is unnecessary is either not there or is minimal making the product itself of utmost value.  Other accessories are the comb, the tiny brush and oil.  I plan to properly maintain this machine for prolonged use.  The accessories woes could not chip away from a clearly deserved, stellar 5-star rating.  Cheers...</li>
    <li> Great product for value!</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper set. My only issue is that the motor is VERY powerful and has a strong vibration. It may tire your hand during prolonged use.</li>
    <li> My husband decided he was tired of expensive haircuts and researched clippers online for two days.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice model with a lot of attachments for various hair lengths. The only thing I would change about it would be the weight. It is a little heavy for me (must be all that power) . Other wise, my husband and I are happy with this clipper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buzzing my hair for 16 years now and these are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I have pretty coarse hair and this cuts through it ALMOST like butter with a #1 guide. I&#x27;ve only gotten better cuts with the pros. I don&#x27;t know what they use but it looks expensive and I&#x27;m fine with the $40-50 I paid for the Super Taper II. I&#x27;ve gone through too many rinky dink Wahls and Remingtons (crap) and Con-Airs (crap) and now I&#x27;ve found my set that I think will last me a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to always oil your clippers before and after! Take care of your clippers and they&#x27;ll take care of you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since 1997, and I&#x27;ve used Wahl, Oster, Remington, and Andis. Wahl is the best of the bunch. I wear my hair in a flat top, so can&#x27;t say how the clippers do with longer hair. For me, there&#x27;s no pulling; the clippers clip. The plastic guides are easy to put on and take off -- but they don&#x27;t fall off in use -- and having different colors for the various sizes makes it easy to grab the one you want. The slide lever lets me get an &#x27;in-between&#x27; size when I need it. The body gets warm, but not overly so; it&#x27;s never hot to the touch. This set came in the kind of plastic packaging I always cut myself on, with no case. However, the carry case from my last clippers -- Andis, which died on me in mid-use -- works fine with this set; even the guides fit in nicely. I would buy again... but I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll have to any time soon.</li>
    <li> It has its good and its bad I guess.  It does give the different length option and it is durable.  However, I really dont see anything special about it.  Oster makes better clippers, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great and are very sharp. Cutting is very precise and the guides work very well.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These clippers are outstanding for the at-home barber. They are powerful &amp; relatively quiet. Cut with out the guard or with it; doesn&#x27;t mater.</li>
    <li> Super sharp, lots of different size cutting heads, I save money by cutting my own hair for which I used to have to pay a barber for every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Professional feel with all the attachments.  Very smooth.</li>
    <li> The clippers are some heavy,but do a good job.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there was a problem with my old clippers until I got this one. It was always snagging and pulling my hair.  This clipper is as smooth as glass.  One more hair cut, and it will have paid for itself.  It only takes 3 hair cuts at $16.00 a pop to break even.  No more Sports Clips.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair with these clippers. Ever since she has been using them she has cut my hair perfect each time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few clippers over the years and finally decided to dish out a few extra dollars.  Well worth the price.  Very solid design and does an excellent job cutting my hair.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great buzzer, cuts fast and even though it brings clips, replacements and additions can be easily purchased at the Wahl store. I just got a 1.5mm one myself since the shortest one it brings is the 3mm one.</li>
    <li> Very professional grade clipper. The combs are perfect for whatever depth you like.  I have an original Wahl from the 1960&#x27;s but it&#x27;s pretty dull now...still works though.  Consider the numerous other positive reviews, this one will likely last the rest of my life !  What appliance product can you find these days lasts that long ?  PS. like one other review noted:  Put the clipper, combs and OIL in a shoebox for safe storage.</li>
    <li> These clippers seem to get clogged or stop working quick. I have prob have had 10 pairs of them in the last 7 yrs. They random just stop cutting hair and just pulls it. I refuse to put anymore money in these clippers.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair clipper I have ever buy and used...cuts my hair evenly. I will be ordering for another.</li>
    <li> Works great. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a year and it does a great  job of  cutting my hair and my beard. Love all the comb  attachments to get the length just right.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  No hair pulling.  Very smooth and powerful.</li>
    <li> Cheap but charge to much</li>
    <li> i shave my head all the time and this thing just cuts so nicely, i have thick hear and this thing handles it no problem.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Works fantastically. It paid for itself in a month. Best one I&#x27;ve had and I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15 years.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I am a fan of Wahl brand clippers, they cut amazing!!</li>
    <li> The 3rd set of Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve owned over the years.  Best one yet.</li>
    <li> I am from Spain and didn&#x27;t notice of 115V thingy (our electrical supply is 230-240V) in this brutal machine. I am using it with an old 220-110 V transformer but it&#x27;s getting 50Hz instead of 60HZ, so maybe my experience is not exactly the same as other costumers . First of all, it is robust, good weight, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone who is going to buzz more than 4 or 5 heads in a row, but for 2 heads it&#x27;s not a problem. It is very powerful, it cuts right through, one pass is enough, no matter how your head is. I insist, very powerful, my hand moves a little on it&#x27;s own while using it. Combs are made of high quality plastic, seems like they will last forever, there is a wide range of lengths, widest I have ever seen. As I said, I like it, it is awesome. May this tool of madness last forever.</li>
    <li> Quiet, smooth cutting.</li>
    <li> Bought this so I could buzz my husbands hair at home to save a few dollars (plus he doesn&#x27;t like strangers touching him haha) It&#x27;s nothing spectacular but it does what we need it to do which is cut his hair. I&#x27;ve only used one cover as he always just wants a #2 all around.</li>
    <li> Quality product that feels like it is built to last. Already earned back the cost in just 3 haircuts.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Way more powerful than any other ones I&#x27;ve had over the past 20 years. You could probably shave a sheep with it! The attachments are easy to identify and clip on easily and securely. I&#x27;m glad I finally splurged on a quality clipper, and it feels like it&#x27;s built to last. Great investment if you want to save $20/mo. in barber costs.</li>
    <li> They work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very powerful clipper! I&#x27;ve had this for three months now and so far it is still working as good as it was from Day 1. And there&#x27;s almost no maintenance required; just add a drop or two of blade oil to the clipper in between haircuts.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a pair of clippers to cut my son&#x27;s hair. I had purchased cheap sets sold at Walmart and Target to be utterly disappointed. So I decided to go out and invest in some clippers that would provide a sharp pain free haircut. I must say these clippers are relatively quiet and very smooth. They work great and the most important thing was that they cut his hair like a razor to paper. He has thick straight hair and in the past a cheaper pair would pull his hair and miss spots even when moving the clippers very slowly. Not only was it uncomfortable for him it prolonged the time it took to complete his haircut. I am look forward to many years of use and would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a barbershop type precision cut.</li>
    <li> These clippers rule!! Absolutely amAzing. I use the oil to upkeep about once every two months and they are working just as good toys as when I first bought it. Top notch quality and the blades are color coordinated so you know which is which fast. I use this on my face and my head at different lengths and I love this. Wahl nails it with this one</li>
    <li> I am a barber of 10 years and this is my best clipper yet. Although I have small hands it is a little heavier than others I have used, it is a great product and I am very pleased. There is one problem I have found, after a couple years of usage, it skips after I turn it on, but only on occasion, like every few months. I am not sure if it is from the outlet or the product wiring but it&#x27;s happened in 2 different shops. Also, as with any clipper, they need to be oiled regularly.</li>
    <li> I didnt keep the hair clipper because I was supposed to buy a beard trimmer as a Christmas gift but when his hair trimmer dies, I will purchase the 8470.</li>
    <li> This is excellent!! I just received this about a month ago.  It&#x27;s quite the device. It feels like quality and like an important tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I wanted to try buzzing my hair (starting to get a little thin in the back..) although I had never tried to do my own hair before, and so far I have buzzed my head with it twice, and it is easy and works perfectly.  It is heavy, but not overly heavy with minimal vibration.  There is a nice set of strong plastic guards for cutting different lengths up to 1 inch in length. It also comes with oil for it. I think I should have bought extra oil for it as the container is very small.  I even now use this Wahl to shave with, and it gives a nice consistent stubble.  Was hoping to use it overseas..voltage is only for North America though.</li>
    <li> excelente el producto llego en la fecha acordada sellada sin detalle el vendedor responsable 100% se lo recomiendo muy bueno</li>
    <li> I am very glad that after reading MANY reviews on similar products, and the reviews on this Hair Clipper, I trusted my insticts and purchased this one. It is a strong clipper with high motor speed that won&#x27;t fail you with thick or wet hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull hair, something that annoyed my children on previous clippers that I purchased on local chain stores at $30 or so. It does not operate on battery, which I consider it a feature, as batteries die in a few years and you find yourself buying a new Clipper again. Even before they come to their life time, their power reduces which affects the overall clipper performance and motor speed, something that happened to my previous clippers and lead me to purchase this one. It has a relativly long cord that relieves you from an extension cord within reasonable distances. The cord wire is of high gauge (thick wire) which is suitable for providing power to the device. The variety of combs is also enough and no complaints on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you consider having a Clipper for home use, go with this clipper, you won&#x27;t go wrong. It is a life lasting clipper.</li>
    <li> I like these clippers. I bought them for my boyfriend and it gets his hair really low for his to shave his head. They&#x27;re worth the money.</li>
    <li> It needs guards with more teeth closer together, to many of the hairs slip through and I end up having to make way to many passes.</li>
    <li> The only thing I thought was a  waste for this was all the extra cipper cones that came with it. I loc\ve the clippers, they are powerful and do a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this clipper 3 times and each time I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  I&#x27;ve been buzzing my head for 13 years.  Most of that time, I was using an Oster or a Wahl which I bought for around $20 at Walgreens.  But the last time I needed clippers, I couldn&#x27;t find any Wahl clippers for less than $40.  So, I decided to try give Remington a try.  Big mistake.  From the first time I turned it on, I knew it was crap.  The motor was weak and the clippers would pull on my hair.  It would take several passes over the same spot to get the job done.  I trashed it after a few months.  Not with this Wahl.  The difference between the Wahl and the Remington is like a Ferrari to a Fiat.  It takes me half the time to buzz my entire head.  Powerful.  Smooth.  Clean.  Money well spent.</li>
