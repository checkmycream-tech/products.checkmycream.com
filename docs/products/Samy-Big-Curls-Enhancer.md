      <li>but I love this product.</li>
      <li>I then work it through all of my hair, making sure not to concentrate it all on top.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and came in a flash!!!</li>
      <li>and it would curl beautifully on its own, but as it grew longer it started to weigh my curls down</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair with curls that need a ton of coaxing in dry weather or they fly away and straighten out.  </li>

      <li>Doesn&#x27;t elimnate frizz as much as I had hoped, but does make nice curls.</li>
      <li>Run this through my hair until it is lightly coated.  </li>
      <li>My hair is pretty healthy.</li>
      <li>and it was on a bogo special.</li>
      <li>The best reasonably priced hair product to give my naturally wavy hair soft defined waves.</li>
      <li>I still have the full bottle in my bathroom cabinet</li>
      <li>The reactivator is also good on second day hair because it&#x27;s so light.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s greasy,sticky, smells funny and leaves your hair crunchY!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what it reminds me of since it smells exactly like an orange.</li>
      <li>, i highly recommend this product yay!!</li>
      <li>But they do work very well together!</li>
      <li>I have to order on line though because I have not been able to find this at any of  my local stores...</li>
      <li>and I have scrunched a little more of this in just for the smell!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This creme is oil-based, which I love because it hydrates my hair (as opposed to mousses, which dry it out).</li>
      <li>The only problem  with it is, it&#x27;s a squeeze bottle with a huge opening, and too much product squeezes out for the amount of hair I have.</li>
      <li>If you use to much it leaves your hair sticky and greasy.  </li>
      <li>: I dont know if this is relevant, but after reading the \\&quot;suggested tags\\&quot; maybe I should mention that I am white??  </li>
      <li>My daughter has much straighter hair...</li>
      <li>I have blah straight hair</li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>It has a LIGHT orange scent that I can&#x27;t even smell once my hair is dry.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended~</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this product is that once its dried, my curls are bouncy and touchable.</li>
      <li>This product works very well on my naturally curly hair, helps keep the frizz down and makes my  hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>This is actually THE FIRST review I&#x27;ve ever written on a product.</li>
      <li>This product does a decent job with it, right along with my more expensive hair products.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly \\&quot;white\\&quot; hair.</li>
      <li>Went natural 4 years ago.</li>
      <li>The smell may be a little strong--it smells exactly like orange oil, but the smell does fade considerably once the product is worked through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I brush my wet hair straight.  </li>
      <li>My hair is difficult, it is very fine and soft.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d end up with flat usually barely there waves.</li>
      <li>My hair is loose curls/waves, not a tight curl.</li>

    <li> This is actually THE FIRST review I&#x27;ve ever written on a product. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, because this is helpful to me, I&#x27;ll let you know that I am Hispanic, I have long thick wavy hair, prob around a 2C-3A type. My hair is pretty healthy. I stopped flat ironing and such long ago, but I suffered from random frizz and flatness as my hair grew out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this stuff on a whim at a drugstore and it was on a bogo special. I purchased this and the reactivator and use them together.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE LOVE this gel! I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can hate it, the results it provides are amazing! I used to have heavily layered hair and it would curl beautifully on its own, but as it grew longer it started to weigh my curls down and I&#x27;d end up with flat usually barely there waves. This gel creates the most beautiful defined curls and waves I have ever seen in my hair! And the smell is amazing! Well if you like citrus. I think it&#x27;s the most amazing orange-y smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing and using a leave-in conditioner, I use the reactivator which I also love because it goes on like water so it doesn&#x27;t create any stiff sticky weight. Then I scrunch this gel in. I DON&#x27;T use alot, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing so. That may be the problem others have. I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily so I don&#x27;t like to load up on product or have stiff crunchy hair. It is a thick cream gel and you don&#x27;t need alot like you might with other hair gels. I let my hair air dry and I have the most beautifully defined bouncy hair that smells so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I just spray water into my hair and I have scrunched a little more of this in just for the smell! Once again, I use very little and add if I need to. And my hair has never been sticky or weighed down. The reactivator is also good on second day hair because it&#x27;s so light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never loved a product so much! If you&#x27;re debating between this and the reactivator I&#x27;d buy this. But they do work very well together! Thisone just smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use alot. Don&#x27;t coat your hair with it. Don&#x27;t touch curly hair until it dries! You will love it.</li>
    <li> This product works very well on my naturally curly hair, helps keep the frizz down and makes my  hair smooth and shiny. I have to order on line though because I have not been able to find this at any of  my local stores... not sure why. :(                     AWESOME PRODUCT!!! Highly recommended~</li>
    <li> I have random curls--some tight, some loose, some merely waves. Left product-free, my hair is insanely frizzy. This product is the best I&#x27;ve used so far because it defines my curls without making them look overstyled. I wash my hair, comb through with a wide-tooth \\&quot;shower\\&quot; comb, and squeeze about 2-3 quarter-sized dollops of the curling creme into my hands. I then work it through all of my hair, making sure not to concentrate it all on top. I then flip my hair and scrunch up loosely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This creme is oil-based, which I love because it hydrates my hair (as opposed to mousses, which dry it out). Because it&#x27;s oil-based, it can feel heavy on your hands, but as long as you&#x27;re not using too much and distributing what you do use evenly through your hair, it won&#x27;t feel or look oily on your hair. My favorite thing about this product is that once its dried, my curls are bouncy and touchable. Not crispy, crunchy, and the product doesn&#x27;t dry up and flake off like a lot of mousses and gels. The smell may be a little strong--it smells exactly like orange oil, but the smell does fade considerably once the product is worked through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried tons of products, and none of them have given me results like this creme. My curls look great and I get tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite product for sure!!!! keeps my hair soft &amp; curly, I&#x27;m half jamaica &amp; Paraguayan and this works for my hair, i highly recommend this product yay!!</li>
    <li> My hair is loose curls/waves, not a tight curl. Summer humidity makes my waves go flat. Using hair spray or mouse was not holding the curl. It was hopeless. Until I gave this a try. It has the feeling of a conditioner, not sticky like a gel, and doesn&#x27;t create crunch like a gel or spray. But it defines and keeps the curl curly. I shampoo and condition (any brand it doesn&#x27;t matter), then put a quarter size dollop in shoulder-length, damp hair. It has a LIGHT orange scent that I can&#x27;t even smell once my hair is dry. The only problem  with it is, it&#x27;s a squeeze bottle with a huge opening, and too much product squeezes out for the amount of hair I have. I put about half the product back in the bottle every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Favorite curl creme! I have tightly curled hair. Used to relax it as a child and through college. Went natural 4 years ago. The only curl creme that&#x27;s yielded consistently great results for me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greasy,sticky, smells funny and leaves your hair crunchY! eww. I still have the full bottle in my bathroom cabinet and i don&#x27;t know what to do with it. I will def not be putting that in my hair again, i don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.</li>
    <li> The best in combination with catwalk tigi leave in conditioner. Just a small amount of both mixed together in palms and rubbed through my damp hair. When it&#x27;s nearly dry, add a small amount of curlsrock amplifier. Fluff/scrunch and go! Not crunchy or frizzy. I have very fine hair with curls that need a ton of coaxing in dry weather or they fly away and straighten out.  I know it&#x27;s three products I use, but I have also used this one alone to good results - I just need a conditioner and amplifier for my sorry mane to have more body. Either way, I don&#x27;t need to use more than a dime sized amount, so it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy/frizzy hair.    I brush my wet hair straight.  Run this through my hair until it is lightly coated.  brush my hair through, again.  let it air dry.  i scrunch it a little so it doesnt look like a wet mess, but it is not necessary,    I get perfect spiral curls.  It is not greasy (a bit waxy, but that is to be expected) not heavy, not crunchy, touchable    I would recommend this to ANYONE!!!    ETA: I dont know if this is relevant, but after reading the \\&quot;suggested tags\\&quot; maybe I should mention that I am white??  I don&#x27;t even know... it kept suggesting \\&quot;black hair care\\&quot;, \\&quot;nappy hair\\&quot;... I just want people to know what to expect!      &lt;3</li>
    <li> I have blah straight hair but I love this product. I put a dab on my hand and rub it in and it takes away all tangles and leaves my hair smooth and nice. My daughter has medium curly hair and she uses it and it gives her beautifully defined curls that last all day. She also uses a small amount so the bottle has lasted us a long time. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> The best reasonably priced hair product to give my naturally wavy hair soft defined waves. Not heavy and smells wonderful. I put a nickle size in my hair after washing it. The trick it to not brush after washing, just wrap a towel around to get excess water. then use the cream and scrunch with the towel. Don&#x27;t rub, only scrunch.</li>
    <li> Several times I had bought this product for my wife, always been on time, product as I expect, no problems at all. I&#x27;ll recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff wouldnt use anything eles. Just wish he would come out with a spray of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the great reviews, but I think it is horrible. The curls look weighed down, and my hair feels sticky. Almost as if I soaked my hair in orange juice. That&#x27;s what it reminds me of since it smells exactly like an orange.</li>
    <li> I use this along with some prestige products.  It stands up well.  My hair is difficult, it is very fine and soft.  This product does a decent job with it, right along with my more expensive hair products.</li>
    <li> If you use to much it leaves your hair sticky and greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t elimnate frizz as much as I had hoped, but does make nice curls.</li>
    <li> much the same as curly sexy curling creme but a little less expensive.  works just as great but nice to switch up products every now and again. love getting it for no tax and no shipping so the cost is even better</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and came in a flash!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years and LOVE it!!! I have naturally curly \\&quot;white\\&quot; hair. I used to straighten my hair nearly everyday, but I have finally came to terms with my hair. I have tried every product at the drugstore and then some, and this is the best to control curl, eliminate frizz and not leave that crunchy sticky feeling. I personally like the citrus-y smell that others have complained about.</li>
    <li> If you want the softest hair ever..this is for you.  I was told about this product from a friend, who has curly hair like me.  My daughter has much straighter hair...and I had to buy her a bottle.  It smells DELICIOUS, and it leaves your hair soft and VERY easy to brush.  Big help if anyone&lt;br /&gt;has little girls who don&#x27;t like their hair brushed.</li>
