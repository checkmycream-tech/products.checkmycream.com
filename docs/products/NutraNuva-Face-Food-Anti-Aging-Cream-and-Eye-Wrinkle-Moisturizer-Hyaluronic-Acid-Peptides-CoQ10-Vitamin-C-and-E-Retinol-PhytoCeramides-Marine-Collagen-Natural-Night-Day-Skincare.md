<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Living in the desert, my skin can end up feeling as parched as the landscape itself!  After using Face Food, I noticed immediate improvement with diminishing fine lines and moisture retention.  My face now has a nice youthful, dewy glow it&#x27;s never had before.  Loving this great new product!  Way to go, Face Food - now on my second order.</li>
    <li> I never thought about using a face cream before. &amp;#34; Thought it was for girls&amp;#34;  I have tried it and it feels great! i&#x27;m looking forward to long term results.&lt;br /&gt;J.T.</li>
    <li> Just tried my face food and the recipe was just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I am new to this market but the name face food really got my attention and my skin loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Have been using Face Food for a few weeks- a friend remarked that my skin looks &amp;#34;AMAZING&amp;#34;.  I love the product- &amp; plan to continue using it-  Now I have used FACE FOOD  for about two months &amp; my face is loving it.  This is a forever product for me- fine lines are diminished-  thanks Dan-</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I like it.  It&#x27;s not greasy and it makes my skin feel smooth.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Finally! Valid help for the skin of males over 50!  (It&#x27;s &amp;quot;unisex&amp;quot;; works on both genders!)&lt;br /&gt;This Face Food definitely takes of a bunch of years off the façade!&lt;br /&gt;And I waited till I&#x27;d used it four times before I wrote this review, just to be sure..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s NOT greasy. Doesn&#x27;t leave your face shiny. And you can slip the tube into a briefcase or overnight bag.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying more!</li>
    <li> Just tried this product.  It feels great.  After applying it, my face felt like velvet.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice light texture and its coverage goes far, which I liked. Not your typical creamy milky face lotions. I&#x27;ve been using it 2 weeks now which is probably too soon to judge the effects of my anti-aging quest since I still have those icky wrinkles. But I wanted to say I like the way it feels and the fact that my makeup applies easily over the cream. Being the type of person that takes the time to use good, natural facial products, I&#x27;m impressed with this product&#x27;s ingredients. I also like the fact it&#x27;s made in the USA (company in Beverly Hills, CA) because that is also important to me; I just won&#x27;t say why.</li>
    <li> I love how smooth and fresh my face and neck feel after using Face Food. It&#x27;s not heavy at all and works great alone or under make-up. For a cream that&#x27;s so light, I was surprised how well it works!</li>
    <li> I have used many moisturizing anti aging creams that cost way more, and this by far is the best! I love it! End of story! - JS</li>
    <li> My face loves it! It&#x27;s shocking how small of an amount I need to use to cover my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I have been using this a few weeks now, and really like it. During the day I mix it with my serum and sunscreen, at night I put it on under a heavier night cream.  Great texture, no odor, and my skin has taken on  a nice glow. I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I use it every night! I am hooked.  It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  It really works - seriously love this stuff! Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> Skin was softer and visibly better after a week! Highly recommended and it isn&#x27;t too greasy which is a huge thing for me.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This stuff really works. So many products on the market offering so many promises.... It&#x27;s hard to believe in any of them any more. I figured I had nothing to loose with the discounted promo price.  Then I tried it. It was surprisingly clean feeling. I have combination skin so I&#x27;m always concerned with products either drying out my skin or making them even greasier in the T-zone. But with Face Food, it felt light going on and soft and nourished when I was done. I never thought I&#x27;d say &amp;#34;nourished&amp;#34; about a moisturizer but the name really does seem to live up to it. I even had my husband try it and now the cream seems to live in his bathroom. My mistake. :). Guess I&#x27;ll have to buy more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  a bit early to fully know...as I  received  this last evening  and could  not  wait to try it out.  This morning, after only ONE application . ...my face had a glow I haven&#x27;t  had in years.  I couldn&#x27;t  wait  to reapply this  morning.  I think (and hope and pray) this is the ONE product  I&#x27;ve  been waiting  for.  Thanks for the beginning  of a long  lasting  relationship.  :)</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry and sensitive and this cream is very hydrating, it leaves my face feeling soft and supple, not greasy. Also, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It feels like it gives my face a dose of vitamins. As soon as you put it on it does give a slight tingle. I would say why not give it a try.</li>
    <li> Your skin is the most important thing to take care of but that can be difficult in this day and age (suntanning, makeup) so finding the right skin care product is something I tend to be picky about. There&#x27;s so much hype and marketing it&#x27;s hard to choose sometimes. I mean with good skin, makeup looks better, you feel better, everything is just better. Well this product FEELS good. I am so happy to have gotten it referred to me. Actually, I will never use anything else. And the best part is that the results are VISIBLE. It&#x27;s like stumbling on the fountain of youth - and don&#x27;t we all want that?! I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> So far I love this cream.  It&#x27;s light and seems to be working on my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way this feels - it has a great texture and seems nourishing without leaving any weird residue.  I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to evaluate long-term effects, but would have given this a 5 star if I were more clear about the ingredients.  They aren&#x27;t listed on the tube itself and there are two areas on the box for ingredients - one says Key Ingredients (more like promo) and the other shows Ingredients - but the list isn&#x27;t the same.  So I&#x27;m wondering what really are the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and really noticed the difference. I saw some older women who had great skin and now I am motivated to try and have beautiful skin at any age and this product will help me&lt;br /&gt;~cathy M.</li>
    <li> I find this product very effective. I have been using it for about 4 days now and already notice a difference. I use it before bed and when I wake up and it seems to have made my face smoother, softer and youthful. It was the first time too after only 2 days a friend mentioned how great I looked and how my skin looked really good. That was pretty nice I must say. I want to thank NutraNuva for helping me look more youthful! Thanks again</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product. The natural ingredients absorb quickly and nourish my skin. For more tips on health living, download a free copy of my book, &amp;#34;Take Control of Your Health&amp;#34; here: http://craigbrockie.com/take-control-of-your-health.html</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always prepared to be disappointed and products that aren&#x27;t from big beauty companies.but I was pleasantly surprised to find initial results with this. It&#x27;s nice to see that you can get something that really helps you and is in $1 million dollars. If you&#x27;re skeptical like me this might be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I will order again. This has a nice light scent and my skin looks smooth and Yeah..I have less wrinkles</li>
    <li> I have a shelf full of face creams, but this is the one I reach for. It feels fabulous on my skin (besides the fact that it has all sorts of great ingredients). I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial lotion.  It is not greasy at all.  It makes my face feel soft and is great for under makeup.</li>
    <li> Super light - so if you&#x27;re worried about breaking out, don&#x27;t!  Often I would put on a second layer, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older and my skin is super dehydrated.  Feels really good to know you&#x27;re putting the best ingredients possible on your skin.</li>
    <li> The product arrived amazingly fast and is very much as it is described.  I did not get the tingly feeling that others have described.  But the quality of the product feels excellent.  It compares to more expensive brands I have been buying, yet is less than half the price on this site.  I would definitely buy this again. SEE UPDATE:  Only con:  Be careful to only squeeze out a small amount at a time.  I realized I was squeezing out far more than I needed, due to the larger hole opening, which wasted some.  A little goes a long ways because it goes right into the skin.  UPDATE: 7/11/15:  Been using the product since it arrived every day.  EXCELLENT product!  I am very happy.  I reordered and will recommend it to friends.  It is as good as many of the far more expensive face creams I have used. UPDATE:  12/23/15:  Now on 3rd reorder.  This product is great and every bit as good as far more expensive creams.</li>
    <li> I am 61 years old and just started using Face Food. I wish I had this product years ago!&lt;br /&gt;Even at my age and the older skin I have, this is a wonderful moisturizer , not oily, feels great on!&lt;br /&gt;I will pruchase again &amp; again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>
    <li> Being a man, I never thought of using any cream for my skin. This product is amazing. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the way this goes on.  It&#x27;s not greasy!  It absorbs easily and my skin does not feel like it has a layer on top of it.  NICE!</li>
    <li> For the first time in my life my face has developed dry patches, so I thought I’d try this.  This arrived quickly, about five days after I ordered it with standard shipping.  It comes in a 2 fluid oz tube, but a little goes a long way.  After several applications it handled a chronic dry patch.  Though it goes on lightly, in my case, for my whole face (formerly oily!) it&#x27;s best for night use. BTW, I did not notice the mentioned botanical scent (which I consider good).</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful skin product. I have used many skin products over the years and I&#x27;m very picky.. this one has a great texture, a  natural very light fragrance which is not artificial at all. it goes right in and it smoothes lines beautifully. I can tell this is a very high quality skin care product..my skin gobbles it up! and loves it...thank you for creating it.</li>
    <li> After trying this product for about 2 weeks, I can honestly say that I love it.  It is so creamy when I apply it to my face, I feel that it starts to nourish my face immediately.  My face looks smoother and the lines have diminished. GF</li>
    <li> Face Food is everything it promises. I applied it under my usual moisturizer and noticed a difference in just three days--fewer lines and a more even complexion. My face looks and feels cleaner, more vibrant and youthful. Thank you for a superior product!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent face cream. It&#x27;s silky, it&#x27;s light and it has very little scent. It absorbs into my skin quickly and easily without leaving my face feeling heavy or greasy. My face looks very fresh and nourished, say goodbye to your foundation. Great product!</li>
    <li> My ex felt that it was a little vain for a guy to be using a face cream, but I get a lot of exposure to the sun and liked what it did for me. So she tried it, and now she&#x27;s going to be ordering some of her own.</li>
    <li> Wow, Great product and it does live up to its claims. My wife loves it (I bought it for her as a surprise present). A nice gift that was surprisingly well received. Now wife is pretty picky so if SHE likes it, it&#x27;s gotta be good.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.  Due to a little snafu on my part I got too much of the cream out on my first try.  I put some on my face and the rest on my arms.  OMG my arms looked like those of a 20 year old and I am 67, soon to be 68.  Needless to say my face looked and felt amazing too.  I hope this company carries a cream for your overall body.  If they do, sign me up.  I will never be without Face Food from here on out.</li>
    <li> My wife said: A really nice product with lots of benefits.  And, at a good price too!  I’ve used it for about 6 weeks now and my face and neck area look and feel much healthier and happier, with small “spider lines” diminishing.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It goes on smooth and feels great on my skin. I have real oily skin so I have to be real careful on my anti-aging creams. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and it certainly lives up to my expectations! I have sensitive skin and rosacea, and NutraNuva didn’t irritate my skin, in fact it was the opposite and my skin absorbed it right up. My skin is so soft and hydrated afterwards, perfect for every day and under make-up. It has a pleasant non-greasy texture and just the right combination of ingredients. It&#x27;s truly anti-aging done right. Immediately you could tell this is a quality product and I’m such a happy customer! I would highly recommend NutraNuva Face Food.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I have now used up my original tube of Face Food and gotten a second. While awaiting my shipment I was squeeeeezing that original tube for all it was worth! (My prediction of shipping time was definitely off!) Even with my best efforts, I was not able to use Face Food both morning and night, so I opted to use the cream I had &amp;#34;loved&amp;#34; before for one application a day. Now, this is a natural, good-ingredients cream - and it was the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; for me. Using it again, I was disappointed with how my skin was feeling. I didn&#x27;t lose any of the benefits and improvements from the Face Food, but it just wasn&#x27;t the same.&lt;br /&gt;Today my new shipment arrived and first thing, Face Food goes on the face!! And with that, I immediately knew the differences.&lt;br /&gt;Applying Face Food I found I had to put on to two applications - because my skin had become so dry; it practically inhaled the Face Food! Within 2 minutes my skin felt alive again; before putting on the Face Food I couldn&#x27;t have told you that it was feeling dry, tight - afterward I could immediately tell the difference! With the Face Food the suppleness was back, the &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34; was back! My skin felt like &amp;#34;mine&amp;#34; again and it was &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; (silly to say about skin, but that is how it felt!). My skin itself was soft, moisturized, supple - it was not a layer of cream on my skin that felt that way, but my actual skin!  And I realized that with all of the different products I have use, all the different types of creams, lotions, serums, etc., there was always a layer over my skin. With the Face Food it is actually being absorbed by my skin and the skin itself is healthier, softer, more supple - and all those things that healthy skin is supposed to be!&lt;br /&gt;I was &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; on Face Food after the first two weeks. Now - I don&#x27;t intend to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;Have used this product for approximately 14 days. stopped using all other products to be able to judge Face Food on its own merits.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed. Have always tried to take care of my skin, pay attention to the products I use and the results.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used Face Food, noticed how smooth &amp; supple my skin felt within 1-2 minutes of application. The product absorbed readily, no heavy perfume stench, easy to smooth along the skin. I kept touching it through the day and the noted the same things: smooth, supple. And it remained that way through the full day. As I continue using it I notice  my face seems to &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; more easily - no tightness, no feeling of dryness, just really supple (I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it!)&lt;br /&gt;After a week I had several people I work with ask me if I had changed something, as my skin was looking &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34;. I also noticed my facial lines were not as noticeable - my overall skin seemed healthier, more alive. After 2 weeks the improvements have just continued: skin very healthy, supple, no tightness, lines disappearing. Product continues to absorb readily, no greasiness, no heaviness. I have recommended this product to many, which I do not normally do. I know each person will get different results based on what their skin needs and its condition - no matter, I highly recommend it.rits. I am impressed.

    <li> I have only used the product for a few days, but feel like some of the fine lines around my eyes have disappeared. I&#x27;m anxious to see the results in the coming weeks!</li>
    <li> Worked better than expected</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few ago, and absolutely love it.  I have noticed a big difference in my skin in just a couple of weeks.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used Estee Lauder, Lancome and Oil of Olay for over 15 years.  Face Food has surpassed them ALL within just 30 days of using the product.  My skin is prone to breakout and very sensitive.  Face Food has tightened, brightened and cleared my skin like no other product.  The combined ingredients that Face Food incorporates are surprisingly placed into one product for the ALL over age defying effect!  Ladies, this product is a must for your morning and evening routine.  I am incredibly happy with Face Food!</li>
    <li> I only started using this product so no visible changes yet. I do like the texture &amp; that it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I’ve use other products that had some of these ingredients but did not work as well as this.  I guess it’s the unique combination of all these many anti aging ingredients that make it so effective.  Finally a product that actually lives up to its advertising. Really like this product and am seeing good results in a relatively short time.  Would recommend it to anyone out there to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I can definitely feel a tingling sensation when I apply the cream to my face and neck.  it goes on smoothly and wears well under make-up and BB creams.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot!</li>
    <li> It seems like it&#x27;s giving my face some things it never got. I have noticed some slight fine lines diminishing.It&#x27;s encouraging.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It goes on light and creamy, and makes your skin feel very soft.  The product is loaded with great ingredients, so your skin gets a nourishing treat with each application.  It can be used for daytime without any heavy or greasy feel.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I live in the South and everything else I&#x27;ve tried has felt heavy, not very absorbent, and really made me sweat.  Face Food is light, absorbent and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it on one side of my face to see what differences I really get and so far that side has less bags and lines are a bit less noticeable. I&#x27;m going to do this for another month and see. So far it&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve used which is a lot of different things. Really absorbs well and is good under makeup. So far, great!</li>
    <li> After having used FaceFood for only one week, it is far too soon to see - or expect! - any significant effects; however, so far I am pleased with scent, smooth, non-greasy texture, and blend of ingredients.  In my opinion, listing ingredients in order of their proportions relative to one another would be even more helpful.  My five-star rating, at this point, is based primarily upon NutraNuva&#x27;s much appreciated speedy delivery and genial customer service.</li>
    <li> Just started using this, like it so far Absorbs quickly and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now, twice a day. I don&#x27;t see much different for my wrinkle but my skin likes it. I&#x27;ll order it again. Update  I really like this product because it makes my skin looks younger. So i give it 5 stars now. Some people asked me that what have i done to make me look younger, so i told them that I&#x27;m using Face food and even gave them the picture of it. I&#x27;m going to oder the third tube now in case I&#x27;m running out of it. One tube is just last one month for me because i use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Smooth and light and makes my skin feel soft and moist all day!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I received my first order of Face Food and loved the result I got on just my first night!  My skin tends to be very dry, and this product&lt;br /&gt;works 100%.  I will definitely use this for a lifetime!!!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This lotion feels nice going on and absorbs into skin really well, not oily or greasy at all. Also, it seems to help heal blemishes. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This product is a lotion consistency. I know a cream works better for the face. Lotion is good for the body. I didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products that claimed to get rid of wrinkles that were very expensive. What a relief to finally get a product that works for a change and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> Hey, if they can make a pain medicine go into the skin with a patch, why not real nutrition (Food) through the ski?. Got me thinking!&lt;br /&gt;L. Marshall</li>
    <li> Really love how this feels on my skin. Its just the right consistency to spread evenly over the face without using a lot, yet it lasts. Skin drinks it up but feels silky, not greasy. And makeup goes on well over it right away. Very nice product! .. Now I am really a regular with this product. I can&#x27;t find anything better. I have to say it also works great on hair! Leaves it really silky!</li>
    <li> I tried many different anti-aging products. This one stands out. I have not used it long enough to see it reduces wrinkles but my skin feels great after just 2 applications. I started with my face and now apply on my neck too. This cream is very light and almost translucent but the hydration lasts all day. Addictive! I would certainly recommend it to anyone with dry aging skin.</li>
    <li> I just recently got this moisturizer, and after the first day of applying this, there was already a big difference! My nasolabial folds weren&#x27;t as deep and my skin feels bouncier to the touch. The product itself smells really light and fresh, and after applying it, there&#x27;s a nice tingling sensation—but nothing painful or burning. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to smooth out wrinkles. I will be using this till eternity, lol!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week and I can see the lines in my forehead are diminishing... I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if it can also help me with the lines between my cheeks and nose-mouth area.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels.and the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
    <li> I do really like this product and in one week, I am impressed. Also this lovely company has good ethics.  Product comes sealed and very professional.</li>
    <li> Just started using this and seeing an improvement I my skin. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My skin feels very soft and looks great.  I would give it a 5 star if it had sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product, but it does feel nice on my skin and does not leave a greasy feeling at all. My skin feels well moisturized.</li>
    <li> So far I love this product.  The smell is fantastic, it goes on smooth and you only need a little.  I do notice a difference when I use it consistently my skin feels and looks more hydrated.</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel refreshed and moisturizes.  It is light and non-greasy. Would recommend to all who have dry issues.</li>
    <li> Amazing results--and without waiting months! Love the way it makes my skin feel as soon as it&#x27;s applied. Extremely soft --almost a satin finish!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. I ordered 2 but one of the tube is unsealed at the bottom, causing it to leak.</li>
    <li> I just got it and I can feel how it&#x27;s working to nourish my skin. Feels great and not greasy. I don&#x27;t like greasy products. I just put a small amount under my eyes and I could feel the ingredients going to work. Has a kind of energy, tingling feeling at first and then it disappears into my pores. Check this product out.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s truly nature and science combined to give a great feeling and do it&#x27;s job!&lt;br /&gt;I like that there&#x27;s no sticky or residue feel of the product and absorbs beautifully.  Great product so far,&lt;br /&gt;will continue to purchase.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Was hesitant to purchase this because I have extremely sensitive skin.  After using it a few weeks I have had no issues and my skin feels very soft.  I guess it&#x27;s a little too soon to say whether it will improved wrinkles, but I am happy with the product. .</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about another anti-aging cream.  I buy them regularly and then wonder why I did.  Usually it takes time to notice ANY difference at all.  I have been using this cream for 4 days now and already I do notice a difference in fine lines, moisture level, firmness of the skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this face cream. It&#x27;s very light, not smelly, not greasy. But it makes my skin feel nurished. I was pleasantly surprised. When you&#x27;re buying things online you&#x27;re never totally sure what you&#x27;re going to get. I really really like this product!</li>
    <li> Just finished my first tube of Face Food - so far so good. I wear contacts so I like the fact that I can wear around my eyes with no irritation. I do not see any diminishing effect of fine lines but my face has an overall smoother appearance after I&#x27;ve put the product on. I don&#x27;t wear foundation so I cannot speak to how Face Food works with layering liquid makeup, but my blush and eye makeup work great over this cream. I DO notice with every application that I have a couple of clear &amp;#34;gluey&amp;#34; balls of product in my hand or on my face that I have to remove; I&#x27;m not sure if this has happened to others or if it&#x27;s just the batch that I ended up with, but it makes me wonder why the cream has these globs in it (I close the cap properly after each use, so I know it&#x27;s not dried up product). I am certainly willing to try another container as I do like the fact that my skin feels soft, has a healthy glow with the product on, and I am experiencing no unusual skin reactions.</li>
    <li> I genuinely think my skin looks healthier and more vital after using Face Food for a little over 3 weeks. I love the way it feels. I use it under my moisturizer and sunscreen... and my face feels light and fresh. I&#x27;m 42, active/&amp;#34;outdoorsy&amp;#34;, and spend a on of time on the beach...but, my skin doesn&#x27;t show it. I feel like using Face Food will help keep it that way. It feels like it&#x27;s really good for my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Not heavy at all and didn&#x27;t have any break outs. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this moisturizer. It instantly fills any fine lines around me eyes but really anywhere and gives my face this all day fresh luminous quality that I really enjoy, also this really helps my skin tone I feel. I would definitely recommend this product because it really does work well!</li>
    <li> It is great to have found a cream that does what it says in smoothing fine lines and wrinkles. I have made it a part of my routine and based on early results have a very good feeling of what my skin will look like months from now.</li>
    <li> Love this product, made my skin so moist and dewy. I would highly recommend this cream. Truly lives up to it&#x27;s name Face Food!!!</li>
    <li> Really love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  My face feels smooth after using.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I swear lines look not so deep.  My husband thought so too!&lt;br /&gt;3.  It smells good.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like chemicals are on my face.  Feels healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Can&#x27;t use on eyes.  Honestly, everything else is so good, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> This formula works better then others I have purchased for hundreds of dollars. I have used some of the best anti-aging, anti-wrinkle moisturizers on the market and after a couple days, this has shown more promise and better results then any I have used. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not moisturizing enough</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a month and very happy with the results. If you expect an  immediate face lift or significant wrinkle reduction, this one alone might be not the best choice, but it is a truly great moisturizer after a serum. It&#x27;s light and works great. I really like it and definitely will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;We used to instant short term results, but this one seems to be a healthier alternative for your skin in a long run.</li>
    <li> Honestly....if I had half the money I&#x27;ve spent on &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; face products, I&#x27; be sitting on a cruise boat right now instead of at this computer.....but, WHOA!!  FINALLY!  Face Food is the most incredible skin product I have ever tried and I write those words as a skeptic of the highest order.  Incredibly light, luxuriously smooth - my skin drinks it in like it&#x27;s honey.  I still look like the same old me (we should all probably strive to be a bit more comfortable with our aging) - but my skin has a noticeable glow and healthiness to it that can only be credited to Face Food.  Fabulous under makeup, by the way....</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but I almost immediately saw results. My skin is looks smoother.  The product is not greasy at all and is scent free.  A great find!</li>
    <li> I just received this product. My skin immediately looked and felt more refreshed and nourished. So far I think I have found a facial moisturizer that I will use continuously. Seems to be just what I have always been looking for !!!!  after spending hundreds of dollars, if not more on subpar skin care products that do absolutely nothing but sit on top of your skin. I will still continue to use additional 100% hyaluronic acid to keep moisture &amp;#34;locked in&amp;#34; even though this product also contains hyaluronic acid. I look forward to being a regular user of this product for many years to come. Thank You. :)</li>
    <li> I just received this and already I am loving this.  It is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup, and feels amazing.  I have high hopes that this product will actually perform as the other reviews I have read.  I will write back in a few weeks to let you know!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months and I have to say that I am really thrilled with it. A first I thought it would be a nice addition to some of the many products that I have been putting on my face but with increasing use I’m noticing that a small dab of Face Food is only item that I really want under my make-up. It’s really light but covers and completely moisturizes and smooths out wrinkles, feels wonderful and really does make my skin younger! I have looked around for similar products and have not found anything I like nearly as much!  It’s the product I’ve been looking for.</li>
    <li> Drying on my face.....</li>
    <li> I like this, my only complaint is that it makes my face greasy</li>
    <li> Aside from loving the name, Face Food, I am extremely pleased with the product. It is truly a moisturizer and feels nourishing to my face.</li>
    <li> Face Food arrived incredibly fast as advertised!  This goes on very smoothly and a little goes a long way.  My skin felt warm where I applied the cream and soft.  It left no greasy feel and the smell is very subtle and nice.</li>
    <li> Face Food is a really nice product. I have been using it for a few days and I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy upon application plus I feel like my face is better hydrated as a result. So far so good!</li>
    <li> This product is light and absorbs quickly. A little goes a long way and my skin seems clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I will be reordering!! I can see a definite improvement in my skin!!</li>
    <li> yes i can really see a difference in certain lines on my face. makes a significant improvement. plan to continue using.</li>
    <li> I love how this product makes my face feel so soft!  It absorbs readily with no strong smell.  I am very sensitive to smells, so I was happy for its extremely light scent.  I live in Arizona and am used to my skin feeling dry and lifeless by the end of the day.  I have only used this cream for a week, but because I love how it makes my face so soft all day long, I have already ordered the product a second time!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer ,great for summer ,is lite and smells great .</li>
    <li> My face looks brighter and clearer.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nicely and I notice a difference in my skin after just 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. A friend told me about FACE FOOD.  As a physician I am skeptical about many products.  This moisturizer works great!  Minimal scent, goes on lightly but lasts a long time.  Easy to integrate into any daily regimen.  I recommend FACE FOOD for women and men.</li>
    <li> When I shop for products like this, I&#x27;m all about transparency of ingredients.  If companies don&#x27;t make their ingredients very clear, I won&#x27;t buy them.  I researched this product, and was very impressed with the ingredients.  When I received it and used it for the first time, I was quite pleased.  It is almost a combination of a cream and serum.  It went on so smoothly, and my face felt great.  Some creams are so heavy that they make your wrinkles look worse.  I can definitely say that I thought my skin looked immediately better after use.  I even use it around my eyes. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short time, so I can&#x27;t comment on long-term results; however, I do think this has the right ingredients to improve the quality of my skin over time.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this product and it really has made an improvement. I noticed my cheeks and around my eyes started looking better. My skin is smoother and softer with less wrinkles, who could ask for more!</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome! When I put in on my face goes, &amp;#34;YES, THANKS!&amp;#34; I have noticed that my face isn&#x27;t as dry since I started using it. I will definitely order more!!!</li>
    <li> NutraNuva Face Food is an excellent moisturizer. It smooths fine wrinkles and evens out uneven skin texture that&#x27;s come with aging. Feels great the moment you apply it;  it&#x27;s non-greasy and has no artificial fragrances. I&#x27;m a 65-year-old guy who still feels like he&#x27;s in his 20&#x27;s, thank goodness! This product  help helps me look like I feel--GREAT!</li>
    <li> I was amazed after 3 weeks how the crows feet around my eyes started to diminish.  I will continue with this products.  I love my eyes looking younger</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars if it had added SPF protection.</li>
    <li> I love the application of the cream.  A little goes a long way!  I feel my skin tightening up and smoothing out.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice! I am a skin care junkie and use lots of product like peptides, vita c, hylauronic serum, alpha hydroxides and retinae. At 60 my skin looks pretty good since I&#x27;ve cared for it since I was 12 years old. Face food contains many of these ingredients. It was nice to simplify and still see my skin looking moisturized and plumped. No great difference for me because I had already been doing an intensive skin care routine but that is a good thing. I will be purchasing this again. The only thing I did not love about face food was it was it left my face a little tacky longer than usual.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of using this I notice that my complexion is more even-toned and my lines in my forehead are beginning to diminish. I am going to buy this again as I am seeing positive results and I think the ingredients are excellent.</li>
    <li> I regularly try new products all the time. Sometimes it&#x27;s good. Most of the time it&#x27;s a bust. Once in a while I stumble across a product I never want to be without. This is one of those products. I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin on the first use. Pores were noticeably smaller within a couple of days. Complexion brighter and clearer within a week. I&#x27;ve found a moisturizer to stick with here.</li>
    <li> This skin care product is amazing! I have used it for a week, and I&#x27;ve been told my skin is young!!! I am 39 years old. I would like to add that I use a brushing system that I bought here on Amazon. I recommend to use both.</li>
