<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Results well worth the discomfort. Added bonus my over plucked eyebrows starting to regrow. Deep set lines between brows softening. It is painful to start but you get used to it. Key is to use often and gently, the needles are puncturing your skin and doing what the product states without the need to apply extreme pressure. I use every other night for about 10 minutes followed by Vitamin C serum and moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> Have to be very careful when using this product. you don&#x27;t want to press to hard. Make sure you use a moisturizer after your done. Depending on what your skin problem is will determine whether this product works for you. For acne scar problems this is not a quick fix that will fade scars in 2 weeks. The company that makes this product is very helpful as they will email you tips and want feedback from you to see if it is working for you. It is useful but a lot will depend on what type of skin you have and how sensitive your skin is.</li>
    <li> This is great!  Works!</li>
    <li> The item shipped on time and is awesome. The staff is extremely nice and more than welcome to answer any questions you may have. They also send emails explaining the product and giving tips on how to make the most of your product and tips on how to use the product to its  full potential. They went above and beyond my expectations!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 3 1/2 months. For me, it took more than 2 months to see the result. I have a sensitive skin, acne prone, and big pore from old cysts. I could see now my big pores aren&#x27;t as deep as before, the discoloration on my left cheek is almost disappear, new acne heals faster. I only use it once a week, follow by good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> really works... good price and good product</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this derma roller. I had extremely prompt delivery and excellent follow up from the company. I have sun damage, melasma,  large pores, acne scarring, and am very proactive with using anti-aging products, and this is an excellent addition to my routine. I use it once every 2 weeks, following with a vitamin C serum,  and notice extra radiance the day after use. I do believe this product will continue to give me continued results, as it is a brilliant way for skin cells to regenerate. Do your research on how to properly use this and let your skin do its magic! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Guys!!!!!!! Seriously this is amazing it makes you feel so good the next morning after using this because you see great results. Im 17 &amp; i had acne since middle school so after getting it control for a year i decided it was time to renew my  skin from the horrible red tiny pitted scars! I wanted to stop wearing makeup and feel confident and this product is definitely helping :) I&#x27;m going to buy the next size later because i love these results!! As far as pain from 1-10 its a 6 not too bad because you know your going to have beautiful skin once you rest and wake up the next morning with new skin. thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just order 5 of them for my family members to try it. I love them. I was hoping for a good discount though.</li>
    <li> helped with stretch marks but not a very high quality product needles bent after a month.</li>
    <li> There is not a woman on the planet who doesn&#x27;t want to reduce their cellulite because afterall about 85% of us have it to a degree. Treatments are usually frightfully expensive, often invasive and have varying degrees of success. So for under $20 it was worth trying this Derma Roller SGF. Admittedly I had apprehension regarding the thought of thousands of needle picks in the quest for beauty, but was amazed to find it really wasn&#x27;t painful at all. Instead, it stimulated the skin and allowed my firming cream to better absorb. Its early days yet but I do feel it is making a difference. I  will continue to use as part of my body skincare ritual.</li>
    <li> I have been using another brand of derma roller and recently broke it. So I saw this one and thought I would try it. It&#x27;s the same needle size as my other one but is so much gentler on my face. I use it on the upper lip, crow&#x27;s feet and then over my cheeks. It really gives my face a nice glow and I definitely think I look a lot healthier. The crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes are very much less visible. The upper lip is improving but needs more work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using it on a couple of marks on my legs. I will update this review when I have been using it for longer. All in all, a great product, nice quality and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> My wife started noticing small differences right away.  She had one little &amp;#34;trouble&amp;#34; spot and this has helped with the Stretch marks from having kids.  It is a little scary to use at first but once you get the hang of it things go smoothly.</li>
    <li> I received the dermaroller a few weeks ago and have been using it nightly on my crow&#x27;s feet.  I am excited to continue and watch the effects.  I believe that this roller along with the essential oils I am using will be a winning combination.  Side note-light pressure is best when using the dermaroller.</li>
    <li> I am 30 yrs old and have dealt with acne all my life.  I bought this derma roller in hopes that it would help with some of the scars that I have acquired.  I was amazed that within just a couple of days my skin tone had already started to improve.  I have been using this on my face for about 3 weeks now.  Not only have my scars become less visible, but I also had some dark pigmentation  spots on my face since I had kids.  The pigmentation has lightened quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this once a day, in the evening before bed.  I wash my face with a mild soap, then I spend about 5 minutes using this derma roller on my face.  I then wash my face again with an acne wash and apply my night cream.  My face feels great and my skin tone is evening out.  So excited.  I think I may add this to my morning routine and possibly try in other areas too (stretch marks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it is really simple to clean also.  I just keep a small baby food jar of rubbing alcohol in the bathroom that I dip it in when I am done using it.</li>
    <li> I have to admit at first a was scared to use mircro needle roller because it just looks painful, but after all the buzz and me getting older I said, &amp;#34;What the heck let me buy it!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised it doesn&#x27;t hurt as I imagine it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had great results, after two weeks of using it every single day, I can see the finer lines from my forehead disappear and looking firmer. I&#x27;m so happy I bought Derma Roller SGF, only regret I didn&#x27;t purchase it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In another six months I will purchase Derma Roller SGF again because from researching I read needles get dull. Great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have only used a couple of times, but I do like it, had no problem using it, all reviews I have read say it will take time before I see any results!  Great customer service!</li>
    <li> This little device runs over your skin like a tiny lawn mower.  It rolls so smoothly because there are so many needles tightly packed together.  My first concern was that it wasn&#x27;t actually puncturing the skin like expected, because it rolls so fast and smoothly.  But it is in fact, because I can see the red strips on my skin where I just rolled the dermaroller over, meaning its doing the job.  No pain, no tricky skills needed.  It feels good and prepares the epidermis for skin care. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like it. i hope it would give me best results for me</li>
    <li> I just used it for the second time this morning.  Since there is a small learning curve, I think I&#x27;ve got it now.  I feel great about it. Even though I&#x27;m not expecting to see big results for a while, I do feel confident that I will.  The roller itself is quite fine, and made well, even pretty,( as opposed to the first one I bought, before finding you, that fell apart while rolling!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s great that you make an effort to keep in touch with your customers. I love it that you give tips.&lt;br /&gt;Claudia</li>
    <li> My ordered arrived within a few days, I started using the derma roller right away, Is too soon to tell, so far I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> So far after 5 mo no change is noticable. Will continue using it as described and as advised by a user - once per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash with peroxide before and after usage.&lt;br /&gt;I apply light to mid pressure and do all directions and try longer and more rolling even.&lt;br /&gt;Last time I tried harder to see if this will deliver the hopeful youthful look, lol, and felt some parts in skin near my lips sort of &#x27;pop&#x27; and got an terrible attack of skin herpes a couple of days later, just on time for my 48th birthday, bummer. I usually only ever got lip herpes over past 25 years, after unfortunately kissing a most handsome Aussie in HK in my foolish youth. Oh well. Wasn&#x27;t even my best remembered kisser, but def left his mark on me that dude. So I assume not a good idea to try harder with rolling, hehe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will give it a few more months as who wants to give up on hopes of youth and beauty. If I regain the promised land I will update here.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Great comunication through the company. I wouldnt have even started using it because it is a little intimadating...but with the wonderful check ups from the company, I was encouraged to use it. And love it! Thanks for &amp;#34;holding my hand&amp;#34;! Amazing product:)</li>
    <li> I started using the Derma Roller about a week ago and haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference. I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles and etc but its probably a little too early to tell. I try and use the product at least once a day. Hopefully I&#x27;ll start seeing results in about a month or so.</li>
    <li> I see results just after a few weeks of using. i was skeptical on using it at first since it looks like it hurts but tried it and really feels good after. feels like my skin is smoother and cleaner.</li>
    <li> I was terrified to use this at first but now I&#x27;m a pro. Its worked so well with my vitamin c serum afterwards and my essential oil concoction. Don&#x27;t be afraid. Order today!</li>
    <li> Totally worth buying! Don&#x27;t pay to get induction therapy, this is the exact same! Just be consistent, it is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks. I do have a couple of small scars on my chin and haven&#x27;t noticed them diminishing yet. I like it, so far.</li>
    <li> So excited to see results</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is helping yet.  Been using for a couple of months.  Will review later if I notice significant changes.  I will say that my vitamin C serum seems to soak into the skin easier after using this.  It&#x27;s a little hard to get to some areas on the face with this because the roller is kind of large.  I wish it was sold including a smaller one for hard to reach areas of the face.</li>
    <li> These dermarollers are all the rage right now. There are companies that sell them for over $200. I thought I&#x27;d cheap it out and try this one. Does it work? I think so. I haven&#x27;t taken before and after photos.The expensive skincare people all say that dermarollers help stimulate new collagen, I use the roller 3 times a week and I apply a great anti-aging serum after I use it, followed by night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It is a crazy thing...but it works!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing it.  I find it hard to imagine that many people use it several times a week.  I find it very time consuming and pretty unpleasant to use--it is not super painful, but it definitely does not feel good.  And, your face is mildly swollen and all red afterwards.  Looks quite unlovely.  I try to do it only when my husband is out of town--ends up being about once every couple of months--and I have no desire to do it more than that!  Even when doing it, I think about how I am buying into this whole cultural thing of abusing our bodies to look good.  My main reason for doing it is that I have started using vitamin C serum, and some people commented that the roller is very good for increasing the absorption of the vitamin C--and I have a lot of sun damage, so that sounds like a great benefit.  My skin IS looking a lot better than it did a couple of years ago, but I have started several different things (hyraulonic acid, vitamin C serum, sea buckthorn oil), and I&#x27;m not sure how much of the improvement is due to the derma roller.</li>
    <li> I have had some acne problems on my back in the past... and so I thought hey i&#x27;ll go for it.  It looks scary at first - but it&#x27;s really not that bad.  Already seeing the acne clearing up!  Sweet!</li>
    <li> Good quality worked well but I upgraded to a deeper needle and larger rolling area.  If using for streatch marks go with 1.5mm or deeper.</li>
    <li> Needles are a length which is only recommended to be used by a medical professional.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product for acne scars. I Only used the derma roller twice so far along with vitamin c serum. And I have noticed a mild reduction in the darkness of the blemishes on my face. I&#x27;m sure with a few more uses, my skin will be completely clear. I&#x27;ll keep you guys updated with my progression.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for weeks and have found that I have much clearer and softer skin. I would highly recommend the Derma Roller.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product. Didn&#x27;t see how it helped anything. I can&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> You &amp;#34;Really&amp;#34; have to commit to using this , I did not so cannot at this time really good any type of review of seeing a different in stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;Seller good.&lt;br /&gt;If I do commit I will let you know.</li>
    <li> Would be nice to have a wider roller.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant that this would hurt to use this item, but did not at all!  I have been trying to use this regularly and believe I am starting to see a difference in stretch mark areas and scars!  I will continue on in hopes that they disappear altogether!  I liked that it came in a storage container and just leave it on my bathroom counter so I will remember to use it twice a day as recommended!  I bought 2 more as a gift for my mother and sister and they also said they are seeing results!  I recommend this to anyone who would like to get rid of old scars or stretch marks!</li>
    <li> Ordered 1.5 mm, it hurts..however  the quality and price were good</li>
    <li> Received the product on time.  Didn&#x27;t open it until Christmas.  I am now using it and I really like the product and feel it enhances the use of my other beauty products that I use to moisturize my face with.</li>
    <li> happy with the product</li>
    <li> Doesnt work at all, hate it !</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ll see how it works once i start using it more!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and expected.  The needles are really sharp and with the high about of them, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  I&#x27;ve bought rollers with less needles and they REALLY hurt.  So, I will buy this item again when the needles get dull.</li>
    <li> I started using it about a week ago. patience is the main key to the results i want so i cant give a full rating on this product as yet. package came as described, i also bought a vitamin c toner to go with it. lets see how this thing will turn out.</li>
    <li> Derma Roller is great, it&#x27;s invigorating to use in the morning and I&#x27;m noticing drastic improvement in scars.</li>
    <li> First off...it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, even when applying considerable pressure. No pain and no bleeding, just some redness and slight sensitivity that lasts for about an hour after use. This surprised me because of the needles length. I thought it would be painful. So glad it is not. Anyway, this is the skin rolling routine I use for my oily skin. First I wash with a gentle foaming cleanser and I do two or three passes. Then I soak a cotton pad with medical grade (higher then 70%) alcohol and wipe my face not only to prep for the roller, but also to ensure that there is no trace of cleanser left. I also dip the roller head in the alcohol as well and then start rolling as per the directions that came with the unit. I roll until my face is very red and then I apply a sheet mask, usually My Beauty Diary&#x27;s Bulgarian White Rose, or something similar that is gentle and non-irritating. I leave the mask on for longer than the recommended 15 minutes...usually 45 minutes to an hour. Then I remove it and just let my skin sit for another 10 minutes and then I apply an eye cream to the eye contours and a light moisturizer to the rest of my face and that&#x27;s it. I do this two to three times a week, always before bedtime. That way, my skin has a chance to really relax. In the morning my skin is very smooth and silky with no trace of redness. Then I just splash my face with cool water, apply a toner and moisturizer, and go about my day. The results are obvious...my entire face is more toned and the contours are more defined, especially my cheeks. Plus the skin itself has a finer texture and looks very smooth and silky..almost like a child&#x27;s (and I&#x27;m really &amp;#34;over the hill&amp;#34;, so that&#x27;s saying a LOT). I really believe that this roller combined with a healthy lifestyle can work wonders on anyone&#x27;s skin...you only have to give it a chance.  :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little intimidating when you first use it because its a ton of tiny little needles gracing your skin.  After about a week i noticed my face started peeling more.  Once that first layer was through though my skin began feeling even softer than before.  Will continue using and see how my progress increases after a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about long term results yet since I&#x27;ve only used it twice but it&#x27;s easy to use, simple, safe, nice storage box, etc.. For the low price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I purchased this roller for my stretch marks. I have only used it one time and can already tell a difference! Will buy again after the needles get dull.</li>
    <li> I am seeing results after 2 weeks.  My skin is a lot smoother.  Brown spots are noticeably diminished.&lt;br /&gt;This something you have to be committed to and be consistent in the usage.  I am fair skinned and 68 yrs old and I have sun damage.  Just seeing results after 2 weeks is quite impressive.</li>
    <li> This really is a miracle for my acne scars and current acne. I use this and acne subsides by the next morning.</li>
    <li> For a minute there I thought I give up on finding a solution on how to get rid of my stretch marks. But then I found the derma roller. It says it can get rid of wrinkles, scars, and stretch marks. So I thought I give it a try. This derma roller is AMAZING. The first time I use it I had a little redness and a little tingling feeling, but they say those thing will go away once you start using everyday. I like to feel the pain because I am so use to it because at the end I like to see the result. You might see a little prickle spot that is totally normal because the skin is  being penetrated.</li>
    <li> I am not qualified to rate this. I got it fast and looks ok. I followed the instructions and looked up in YouTube, but it hurts a lot and leaves marks on the face. Will try ot again sometime. Then I will tell.</li>
    <li> I actually went with the reviews and ratings, I am very glad I did. However, I am very busy and work long hour days which makes it hard to use the derma roller very day. I sometimes go for days at a time and may get in a roll once a week. Even with this very few stokes, I am please with my skin, I notice the difference in a week and 1/2. Like my dermatologist I would recommend this product over chemical peel, for nerves skin pickers like myself, who has very damage skin. I have dark spots that&#x27;s beyond repair because I pick when I am stress, but the derma roller (no. I am not a doctor or a rep for this product, and yes I was on skin medication for 8 months. My acne was cleared but my dark scars and marks stayed.) is working, and my doctor suggest I try it because of my unwillingness to continue with my acne meds, due to my serious side effects. I also would more so suggest derma roller for woman of color, because I don&#x27;t know the effects on pale skin. I am loving what I see so far and please use the timeless skin care products with the derma roller. The Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz. And 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz.</li>
    <li> Works very well with my lotions and creams. 👌</li>
    <li> I love this roller. I have used every night for a week or so. It looks the results start to show a little.&lt;br /&gt;This roller is a must for every woman.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting use to the feel of it.  The product is as promised.  The packaging was very professional.  It was in a clear neat container to keep it when not in use.  Since I had researched the roller I knew how to use it and care for it.  There was no real directions that answered questions that may arise.  Too early to see if it&#x27;s doing any good yet.</li>
    <li> My item delivered on time, was as described, my sister loves it a must have she says</li>
    <li> I have only used the roller three times. My face is really dry because it&#x27;s winter so I thought it best to use it twice a week instead of three times. I&#x27;m looking forward to the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything..</li>
    <li> I started to use this for about a month now and I could definitely see an improvement</li>
    <li> When I bought this, I had little confidence it would do anything. I have since been pleasantly surprised. I use this about twice a week (cleaning it before and after use with rubbing alcohol) and it has helped take care of my major problem with clogged pores. It also seems to have plumped up my cheeks a bit and my skin no longer looks dull and lifeless. The change was not instantaneous. It took several weeks to notice a change. During the first couple of uses I had to use very little pressure because it was slightly uncomfortable. Over time I&#x27;ve increased the pressure a bit. I&#x27;ve learned that I need to moisturizer with a serum immediately after use to keep my skin from burning a bit.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s done anything yet, will try a little longer</li>
    <li> This roller seems to be made really well and the case it comes in is well done, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not painful to use -- and I wasn&#x27;t sure that would be true. I could use a bit more instruction on what sort of skin products to use after using the roller (but that may be something I need to research for myself and not so much something the manufacturer or seller should provide -- although I wouldn&#x27;t mind the help!) ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have only been using it a couple weeks and am really interested to see what it can do for a bit of sun damage (dark spots). Guess I&#x27;ll have to report back later on that.</li>
    <li> I have been getting older, so I have been reading reviews to help alleviate some age issues. I used this item for 2 sessions. I believe you should not use this item everyday, so to help your skin rejuvenate. So far this product is working great with other moisturizers. If things change, I will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I used it religiously in saw 0 results I&#x27;m so tired of falling for gimmicky products because of excessive reviews</li>
    <li> still did not see any results but keep using it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Needles are small enough to be painless and large enough to actually feel decent pressure. Product is easy to use and  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing results!</li>
    <li> This is a well made product  and easy to use.I also find it much  more comfortable than other dermal rollers that i have used.</li>
    <li> This works as expected.</li>
    <li> I yr. ago I purchased a Derma Roller with Vit. C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid. I assumed the roller was useful in depositing Nutrients below the top skin layer. This is True, but I recently discovered that there are many more Medicinal  uses. THESE USES ARE TRULY IMPORTANT: the Derma Roller is Useful for removal of Acne Scars; Wrinkles and Lines, Dark Marks and Uneven Skin Tone. During the last month I have used this tool and noticed Smoother, less wrinkled and lined skin and evening out of Acne Scars. Now that I know the manner of its use I can&#x27;t wait for more time to use the Derma Roller and see how many more benefits I will notice!! (instructions are enclosed)</li>
    <li> I noticed a change after the first use! I have been using it religiously since it arrived and could not be more pleased with it.  I have acne scars that have smoothed and the overall texture and color of my skin has started to even out.  Excited to see what long term use will do for my scarring!</li>
    <li> Love the roller. It helps plump where I need it and opens up the pores to allow my skin products to absorb.</li>
    <li> Love it. A little uncomfortable at first. I use it once a week and have noticed smaller pores and wrinkles disappearing.Will def. continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> When I began to see changes in my skin due to age I began to research serums and magic creams that woul reverse or slow the natural process of skin aging. The biological idea behind this gadget is a solid one. After only a couple uses I see less fine lines and a more even skin tone. I do not easily fall for &amp;#34;fad&amp;#34; treatments and I don&#x27;t see this as one. Don&#x27;t expect miracles but positive changes in the right direction. This will remain a treatment I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This 540 needle roller hurts far less than the others with only one hundred some needles that are so spaced out that you can feel every needle piercing your skin.  This one just feels like your rubbing sand on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results go, I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and I don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; your wrinkles or aging skin but I do think it slows it down.  I&#x27;m 36 now and I have a 15 year old son, people always think I&#x27;m his (much) older sister than his mother.</li>
    <li> This thing hurts. People lie about it not being uncomfortable to use but its not horrible. I am used to it now and enjoy using it</li>
    <li> The second day after using this I felt my skin get smoother and the pores visibly tightened up. My husband asks me to roll the roller around his facial skin as a daily treatment before sleep. Yes, his wrinkles also got improved.</li>
    <li> It helps improve my skin condition. Over time, it peels the skin off gradually but I think through that process, it improves your overall skin texture. If your skin gets flaky and peeled, make sure to do the exfoliating when you feel its needed. The tool started making squeaky noises really badly at some point but one time I was using it with collagen moisturizer on my skin and surprisingly the noise was gone (I think any type of moisturizer or facial cream/lotion can work as lubricant and eliminate the noise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For maintenance, I make sure to sanitize it with alcohol before and after using it. For before use, I spray it wet with alcohol, let it dry and wash off with running water. After use, I wash it off with running water first and spray it wet with alcohol and put it back in the case. No infections/problems with this procedure so far. If I have to apply skin products, I would roll my skin with this for I believe it will help better absorb the products so I will continue using it!</li>
    <li> Does it hurt, and does anyone have before and after pictures?</li>
    <li> I purchased it a month ago and finally used it a few days ago.  After using the derma roller I applied a Vit C serum, waited then used my moisturizer.  The next morning and for the next couple of days, my face felt taunt, almost like I had a facial mask on. When I apply my make up, I always us a tissue to blot any moisturizer, and for 3 days now, there is none.  My skin is drinking up the moisturizer.  I did do a before pic and I will do another one in a month.  After that, I will post another review.. But for NOW I&#x27;m SOLD..  Check out You Tube for  the reviews.. I&#x27;d say 99% of people that use the derma roller are sold.  In doing more research, you can use it on cellulite as well as stretch marks and scars... cellulite here comes the derma roller :)</li>
    <li> This derma roller is of exceptional quality.  After cleansing face, I derma roll, then apply peptides to stimulate collagen growth.  My face is looking awesome.</li>
    <li> It hurts alot but i saw results fast. Remember to clean this with alcohol before and after each use becuase it goes in your skin.</li>
    <li> Nice but you need to get some expert help with it..so, no damage to skin.</li>
    <li> I was sceptic before I started to use a product. In  several days the Derma Roller produced amazing results - much quicker and with better results than expected. Surprised and delighted! Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. It helps to renew your skin in order to help get rid of stretch marks.</li>
    <li> At first, i was like ,WHAT?~really.~Roll a wheel positioned with miniscule needles over skin to help skin products penetrate layers of skin more efficiently???!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I like it!......Its a little tingly till you become accustomed to it...but women have done a lot stranger things in life to improve skin appearance....and you don&#x27;t have to sell one of your kidneys to fund it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell ya&#x27;s something.....The place where i really noticed a difference was on the lumpy,bumpy skin of my underarms and legs....I figured if it works for your face,why not?~~~~I had purchased a wonderful cellulite cream called LUXODERM some time ago.  SOOOO, i sterilized roller, ran it up and down cheesy areas of my body(NOT BREASTS OR NECK)and then applied my cream...What a difference in a few days.....It helps products penetrate, thats for sure....Roll away.&lt;br /&gt;Maya Pinion</li>
    <li> Being 52, a cancer survivor, divorced and stressed! I was looking for a product to give permanent results. I struggle financially and can&#x27;t afford spa treatments so I tried this at home to help terrible deep set wrinkles. Right away I had smoother more even skin on my face and neck. I use the roller twice a week. After about two months a red spot on my nose disappeared. After three months wrinkles are lessening. It is a little painful but not too bad. I LOVE the results I am seeing and will use this forever! Immediately after rolling I use a Hyaluronic Acid serum. It is quickly absorbed and I use my usual daily Olay cream.  Very much worth the price!</li>
    <li> The delivery was very fast. I have been using it only for about two weeks, three times actually and I love it, I think that I can see already some changes in my acne scars. It seems painful but it really didn&#x27;t hurt or gave me pain that bad, I purchased a cream for the pain but I didn&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried microdermabrasion and laser treatments but I think that this roller will actually do a better work. I read a lot in the internet, the reviews and decided to try it and I am happy I did........ I think that the actual results are still to come......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed by its fast renewing effect on my face. I started using two days ago after my skin is healed from acid peeling. It reduced scars on my face and evened skin tone. It works fast but you might need a little bit patience to roll it on your face.</li>
    <li> I think I am seeing some results and it is not painful. Have to see in a few weeks. Hope so!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 26 years old and have been struggling with acne for years. I have tried antiobiotics and different creams and medications that dermatoligists have recommnded but nothing really works... I&#x27;ve been doing the derma roller for a month now and its amazing the results that I&#x27;ve gotten!! Within the first week I started seeing results. A few pointers- make sure to wash your face throughly before use and disinfect the roller after every use. A month into it my acne bumps are gone, but the scarring from all the years of popping pimples is still there but has significally decreased. I used to not leave the house without cover up but now I can and feel so much better about my skin. I started using it every day but realized that it was changing the texture of my skin too quickly ( made it too dry) and my make up was not going on properly because of that. Make sure to moisturize after use as this does dry out the skin a little... I have found that using it 3 times a week is great because it gives your skin time to heal and does the job... I did get a little itchy the first week of using it but it gets better as you keep doing it. I have bought a couple of these and recommend it to anyone who has acne. I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to use it for the other uses ( stretch marks and hair growth) but thats next for me and this product. I TRULY recommend this to anyone who has stubborn acne that they cant get rid of... Im crossing my fingers that this will also take away the acne scars that have been there for years ( but im sure that will take time) I will update in about a month to see where that takes me and when I get a chance to see if the other uses for this roller work too~!</li>
    <li> I love my Derma Roller!  My skin stung after the first few times that I used it, but it no longer does now that I have been using it for over a month.  I live in a cold climate and my face is dry and sensitive in the winter, so I have  been using it only about three times a week.  I have noticed a difference though more so than with any other product that claims to help diminish wrinkles and age spots.  I am 33 and my lines are not deep, but the forehead wrinkles that plagued me are all but gone.  My dark spot (sun damage--argh!) has lightened too.  I apply anti-aging moisturizer immediately after using the Derma Roller.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to improve their skin!</li>
    <li> Great product.  High quality.  The emails from the company following shipping were supportive and informative.  Great company to purchase from!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a week for my Melasma. I&#x27;m 34 and have been battling with my spots for 2 years since my son was born. The dark spots were winning!!! Now, either I&#x27;m hallucinating or the dark spots are fading (in addiontion to old mild acne scars). I&#x27;m so happy. Even my husband has noticed a difference. I will write another review to follow up in one month which is the reason why I have it 4 stars (still early). I have a feeling that next month my rating will definitely be a 5.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Definitely don&#x27;t push to hard your first few times. It took a few time to get an accurate pressure down.. it hasn&#x27;t been long so I cant say how well the results are but I use it all over not just my face. I also follow with a moisturizing oil like e or c:)</li>
    <li> So far I been using the derma roller for a few months it seems like this is product you won&#x27;t see any results for a long time.  I won&#x27;t stop using it I will see if I see any results in 6 months or a year.  One thing I can say do not press to hard on your face you will bleed.  If you are very sensitive in any area you will use derma roller use it lightly.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, easy to keep clean, and has a nice, solid, plastic case for storage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was using this correctly but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me and left a really red mark for a couple days.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly does not hurt.</li>
    <li> I got this item at a discount price in exchange for a review but all my opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to take better care of my skin and hair this year. This looked like it could be a great way to refresh the skin and get rid of some of the dead skin. I have used it twice. I have sensitive skin so I will not use it more than once or twice a month. I have had no problems with it yet and it has not caused a reaction to my skin so I am happy about that. I know it is a little nontraditional but I am enjoying the results and love that it does not use any chemicals.</li>
    <li> My skin was positively affected by the product. I hope this good effect long lasting~</li>
    <li> I used the derma roller a few times so far and its been about 5 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any different. I am going to keep using it for a few more months to see if it makes any improvement because it did say that it takes time and percistance for best resalts. We&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> I have been using the derma roller for two weeks, I have not seen much progress but I do have very bad acne scars I will continue to use derma roller I like it and expecting good results.</li>
    <li> Good quality and GREAT customer service!</li>
    <li> I can see positive result using this Derma Roller. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The thing does what it is supposed to do.  Not for the weak of heart because 1mm length needles definitely draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;Its exactly what I was expecting!  This roller also has the highest needle count available and they are nice and sharp!</li>
    <li> tried this to see if it would make my face products more effect and I think it does as well as stimulating the skin</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for stretch marks, I used for more than one month and didn&#x27;t work at all, I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> hi, I bought two derma roller one by SGF 540 1.00mm and another one by MT roller 1.5mm.&lt;br /&gt;My face have acne marks from the past when young. I started using the MT roller 1.5mm for a few days, the rolling  can be quite discomforting as I can feel the needle poking my face and can be painful especially the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to use the shorter length of 1mm by SGF. I feel it is more comfortable to use the roller by SGF 1.00mm. When I roll it over the face, it is definitely less painful then the 1.5mm.&lt;br /&gt;I started to roll every 3 days and was happy with the results so far and decided to start rolling every day on my forth roll. Now this is my sixth roll. My pores is definitely more tighter than before.&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I had one derma rolling done by a professional dermatologist and he rolled really hard during treatment which resulted in blood all over my face and the there was long downtime of 3 to 5 days as my face peeled alot. During the downtime, I could not go out to socialize. Though there was some improvement but you think about the trauma your face goes through and the inconvenience downtime you have to face plus every treatment is $350.&lt;br /&gt;From the 6 sessions of DIY rolling by myself, I believe the results will be better in the long runs and we can help save lots of money. If you do it at night, there is no downtime at all the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;Happy rolling to all and a better skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about derma rollers for awhile now but didn&#x27;t take the plunge until i saw this one. at 43, my skin has enough damage from the years of sun worshiping and now it&#x27;s really beginning to show. i got this device to help with uneven skin tone, large pores and wrinkles. at first glance, this looks scary but once i followed the directions, it was simple and painless. i use it with my favorite skin care products and after a month of using it, my skin looks a lot firmer, healthier and the wrinkles are less pronounced. i&#x27;m impressed! i will definitely continue using it long term to see how it looks in the long run. you&#x27;ve made me a believer!</li>
    <li> It really works ! After only a couple of days using it , my acne scars are really less visible.</li>
    <li> I did not experience any change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also got a nasty skin infection using it.  I keep my skin very clean.  My Doc said to stop using it asap</li>
    <li> The product offered a \\&quot;free travel kit...Titanium needle rollers\\&quot;. I expected to receive two needle rollers (travel kit and regular size)...and as the title says rollers (plural). I emailed the company and was told the plastic case was the \\&quot;travel kit\\&quot;. I bought a $10 range dermaroller and they came with a case as well, I don&#x27;t know whats so special about their plastic case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using my derma roller for 1 week and already see a difference!  Really didn&#x27;t believe all the other reviews but had to try it. Especially for the price!!!  So worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 with sensitive and far not perfect skin type. Used this roller twice so far. Had a little bit of gyperemia on my face day after, but then my skin looked as usually. Don&#x27;t want jump with conclusion but it seems like i already got some positive effect . My skin looks lighter, pores tighter, overal skin complexion is improoved. Just one thing to add, i used 30% glycolic acid peel between derma roller applications.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I can already see a diference in the texture and tone of my skin. I&#x27;m excited to see what it will do in a month! I dont think it hurts, but it doesn&#x27;t feel good... It feels like a sunburn... The area around my nose is the only part that bleeds slightly, but I still dont think it hurts.. I put a vitamin c serum as soon as I&#x27;m done and an extra mousturizer like 10 mins after. make sure to disinfect the roller with perixode and boiling water before/after use; and cleanse your face before. Only do this at night, your face will be red!  You need the 8 hours of sleep for it to heel. As soon as you wake up your face will seem more radiant. I will only be using it twice a week because I dont want to over do it. I really recomend this product ! dont be scared its worth it!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this about 2 weeks but I&#x27;m excited to see results, which usually take about 3 months or so to really be noticeable. I love the concept of creating micro wounds in the skin (no bleeding involved) in order to entice the body into creating more collagen in that area as part of the natural healing process. I soak mine in 70% rubbing alcohol for about 5 minutes before I use it and again after to keep it super clean.</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of my skin after a few days of being used. Excellent product and fair price. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over 60 and use it every other day, started to see a Difference in my skin. My skin looks a lot more lively and more supple.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been two weeks so I expect to see a lot more changes in my skin after month.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had this 20 years ago&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Sandra</li>
    <li> It clears up my dead skin on my face. It just does not work on my leggs. but i still think it deserve 5 stars</li>
    <li> i dont see any difference after 2 weeks. disappointed. cant believe i bought 2 of these skin destroyers. my scars are still as deep.</li>
    <li> I am a former aesthetician. Do not use on you face with out testing on a small area, near you ear or arm is best. I choose this one because the needles are Titanium not Stainless Steal. I&#x27;m middle 50&#x27;s with normal white skin. Pick a day when you will not wear make up, don&#x27;t do it and go to bed. Thoroughly cleans your face and apply your favorite treatment product for your skin type be it acne or dry skin. I like Aveda&#x27;s Essential Oil Dry Skin Remedy. (Top Shelf) Be gentle the first time so as to get a feel for what you skin can take. You will have some redness when done. Let it completely heal before your next treatment. Follow the directions on the package for its use, finish with a Retinol Serum or OZ Naturals Anti Aging Serum. If you have a facial steamer &amp; high frequency use it. You could steam your face over a pot of water being extremely careful not to overheat you face. I also have a RX Retin-A 0.05% which will cause you face to peel. We all get old but you don&#x27;t have to look it! Use a good quality night cream to finish.</li>
    <li> This is as advertised.  Seems to work very well.  If you are looking for a derma roller this is a good one.</li>
    <li> i got the derma roller yesterday and so far I love it. i got it out of preventative measures for future wrinkles and skin pigmentation. i was scared at first because i thought it was going to hurt, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. in terms of sanitizing the roller, i bought a bottle of 91% isopropyl alcohol at duane reade (very common drug store owned by walgreens in NYC). i just roll the roller in the alcohol before and after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having problems with excessive dry skin, which was semi treated by korres greek yogurt facial creme. but after using the roller, my skin feels a lot softer and moisturized. when I woke up today, i noticed my skin was drastically softer than normal. it&#x27;s been a couple hours since i woke up, and my skin is still feeling great and some of the problems i was having with dryness has improved. it&#x27;s still day 1, but i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it thought it is a bit rough on the face. When I used my face was litterally bleeding and dripping over the sinck.&lt;br /&gt;My face stayed red for 2 days and started peeling and the redness went away. The final results are OUTSTANDING!!!!!</li>
    <li> After using the Derma Roller over a couple of weeks, I thought I could see a difference in my complexion. But, I was worried I was just seeing what I wanted to see. I traveled to visit family over the Thanksgiving Holiday and my brother and my father both commented on how nice my skin looked. Not just wishful &amp;#34;seeing&amp;#34;. The Derma Roller is one of my favorite beauty tools!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and not painful. I look forward to seeing results of increased collagen production from daily use. Love it.</li>
    <li> the 1.0 is not painful at all... I was terrified and after using it I was like well that was silly to be scared of haha... I have acne, acne scaring, discoleration, fine wrinkles, HUGE pores and they have ALL be greatly improved.... my scaring and pores are 1,000x better now... which I thought would never look smaller... I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about it.... now my husband wants one hehehe</li>
    <li> Oh how I hate to have my sceptisicm about anything disproved. Yeah, right ... puncture your face with 500 plus needles from a glorified meat tenderizer and in weeks or months be on the cover of some runway mag ... Press too hard and bleed,turning youself into something that looks like the victim of an Investigative Channel documentary .... Lighten and even remove wrinkles and small blemishes by disfiguring your face with mini acupuncture .... are these people insane ??? .... Uhhhhmmmm ... Actually NO .... they are not and I&#x27;m as speechless as I am less wrinkled . This is medically approved, it works, and the whole idea is simply insane ... still, they shall be awarded a cake ....</li>
    <li> This is horrible to use! Hurts a bunch and haven&#x27;t seen enough results to say its worth the pain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the roller about two weeks and although it doesn&#x27;t do miracles my skin is waaaaaayyyyyy better. I use it in combination with emu oil and make sure to exfoliate skin with Shea sugar scrub. My scars and imperfections are slowly smoothing away I LOVE IT!!! :)</li>
    <li> Well, I read all the reviews before purchasing it and the jury is still out. I have been using it a week and as mentioned, it does make you look like you have a slight sunburn. After doing some more research, I roll it across my face, up and down my face and both directions diagonally. In other words I create a super absorbent face. I put the serum on for 30 minutes, then put on moisturizer. I was ecstatic with the results! My face plumped right up! The problem is (at least so far) it doesn&#x27;t last. By the next morning I have the same old face. I will keep using it faithfully and can only hope that at some point my face will be so full of vitamin c serum that the results will last longer than overnight!</li>
    <li> This is truly a remarkable product.. for years i have struggled with acne scars and the humiliation and embarrassment for everyone staring at me. Due to my olive to medium complexion (tan skinned) I used retin-a, peels and it took forever to get the results i had gotten with using this dermaroller for almost 2 weeks now. I have been taking pictures to catalog my results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i first got this product of course i was sort of skeptical but i still wanted to give it a try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took pictures to i can see the before&lt;br /&gt;cleaned roller with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;wash skin,  then began dermarolling&lt;br /&gt;my skin was tender and sort of red  from my first application&lt;br /&gt;applied hyaluronic acid and rosehip oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cleaned roller with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2&lt;br /&gt;wash skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin same thing tender and alittle red from second application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;applied hyaluronic acid and rosehip oil&lt;br /&gt;cleaned roller with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3&lt;br /&gt;wash skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin same thing tender and alot red from third application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;applied hyaluronic acid and rosehip oilcleaned roller with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4 and Day 5&lt;br /&gt;skipped&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wash skin&lt;br /&gt;applied hyaluronic acid and rosehip oil  cleaned roller with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin same thing tender and alot red from fourth application and i continued my routine for the next two weeks and the results i achieved was amazing. My skin is tighter and the scars i have had for decades are not almost disappeared. The most important thing is that i followed the directions of how to use this product and giving my skin a break from dermaroller 2 days out of the week so for 3 days in a row i would dermaroll and then rest my skin for 2 days. I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wished i had of gotten or heard about this product before but i am very satisfied for i get compliment and the results are very noticeable especially being tan skinned</li>
    <li> I was so excited to purchase this after reading over a hundred reviews and doing a bit more research on a derma roller and why it could work. This was inexpensive and people seemed to be pleased with it for the most part so I ordered one for myself. Upon arrival, I was not impressed with the little roll thingy and the cheap plastic container AKA travel case it came in but that wasn&#x27;t a big issue, I just needed it to do it&#x27;s magic! Magic, unfortunately never came however and neither was lowered expectations met. After reading reviews of people compIaining about crying, a red face, or a bleeding face I expected SOME type of action. I rolled this thing so many times on my skin, I almost activated my Carpal Tunnel. I couldn&#x27;t understand all the reviews crying about pain. Yeah, it doesn&#x27;t feel like a deep tissue massage but it doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all!  Worse, this thing did absolutely nothing!</li>
    <li> This is a surprisingly good product for a decent price. It does take getting used to; it can be painful, but not intolerable to use. I consulted YouTube for directions and it&#x27;s many applications for use.</li>
    <li> This product is literally the only thing I have tried that you see results instantly!  It is painful, but I do it 2 x per week, and my skin looks amazing and glowy!  I first tried it in conjunction with the vitamin C serum that is pimped with it, and it did a good job.  But then I thought I would try it with my Strivectin creams...and OMG!  I look 10 years younger!!  I even got my husband to try one for his occasional break outs on his head, and it works.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. No pain at all. I can take it anywhere. My face feels smoother already. Helps absorb serum better too</li>
    <li> HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR TWO WEEKS AND ALREDY MY SKIN IS LOOKING YOUNGER THAN ITS 47 YEARS. LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE HOW MY SKIN LOOKS IN A FEW MONTHS!</li>
    <li> I was used it the first time on my face and I can see the different in the morning. The second day I used it on my body I am not sure if it work but only one time of both. But I love it anyway. I am going to buy one more for my mom.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I was scared to use this porcupine contraption on my face. Mainly because I&#x27;m not a fan of any type of needle (I cringe around a sewing needle!) BUT, I figured since my body has decided to throw its aging card down on me I would buck up and buy the Derma Roller. I mean anything to keep the fine lines and wrinkles to a minimum and your face looking youthful, right? Well, I&#x27;m still scared using it. I lightly roll it over my face (like directed) with little to no pressure, else I&#x27;m hyperventilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe because of this way I&#x27;m not seeing any difference at all. My face still looks the same before I started using. Maybe I need to use *grabs a paper bag* more pressure *breathing into paper bag*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it another week, a little more pressure *eye twitch* and if still no noticeable changes then..I&#x27;m giving up.</li>
    <li> RESULT: I used this product to battle my acne scars, large pores, and prevent wrinkles (age 30+). It has significantly improved the appearance of acne scars and pores on my face. I would summarize my review of the product in the following points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Patience: The product does not work after one application. You need to be patient and continue using it &amp; you will see the magic over time.&lt;br /&gt;2- Pain: Applications are painful but bearable (depending on your pain tolerance); You will get used to it over time and also once you see some results you will be willing to take the pain, in fact it is a pleasure!&lt;br /&gt;3- Price: The pricing of the item considering the results, packaging, and quality is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Tip: I use organic coconut/ rose hip seed oil after each application at night &amp; the next morning I would try to stick to more natural/organic facial products.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this roller it worked great. The second time it stopped in the middle of a roll and cut my face a bit. I&#x27;m going back to my stainless steel model.</li>
    <li> My mom has been going and getting this type of thing done as a cosmetic surgery once a month, so I came across this an decided I&#x27;d give it a try for myself using this little derma roller to see if the results were similar to her surgery that she pays so much for; and it definitely does the trick! She wants me to get one for her too! This derma roller is made of titanium so it stays sharper for longer. I use it every night and do as the directions say &amp;#34;roll diagonal on your face, then roll vertical and horizontal on your face&amp;#34; I have noticed that my face is clearer, more even toned, my fine lines are diminishing, and it does seem to be not necessarily plumping my face, but it gets things moving around and alive under the surface that my face seems more awake and alive. I haven&#x27;t bled and I hardly get red anymore after using it, but the fact that you can determine your own pressure is fantastic! Another factor that I love is since it causes micro holes in a sense, it absorbs serum or lotion better immediately after you use it. I use a triple action vitamin C serum and vitamin E &amp;#34;vitec&amp;#34; lotion; the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> This works. Easy to use and has results that you can see if you faithfully use it at least once a week. Beats any serum, cream, or expensive potions.</li>
    <li> Never heard of the Derma Roller until I read the reviews! All I can say is WOW!!! My dark spots are fading &amp; im on my third week of using it! I have tried every cream cheap &amp; expensive &amp; nothing works.It makes your skin tightened glowing &amp; healthy looking! Its amazing!</li>
    <li> I actually put this in my wife&#x27;s stocking but she refuses to stick needles in her skin so I tried it and I got very red and itchy after using it. I do have sensitive skin though but I probably wont continue to use it either.</li>
    <li> This product works great to help all my age defying products soak in better. Would recommend to anyone needing a deep absorption for your expensive products.</li>
    <li> Delivered within specified time frame.  My skin looks better, has a glow to it and several broken veins appear lighter, skin feels smoother &amp; softer</li>
    <li> this is a well needed appliance for the foot and i would use it any other place you may want to recommend it&#x27;s usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;thank you.&lt;br /&gt;CES</li>
    <li> Wow!  A great product!  I love this!  Much better  than the one I had.  It arrived quickly too!  This is just a fabulous beauty tool!  Great to prep skin for a good lotion or oil to diminish scars etc.  love it!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday &amp; I love the way it brings circulation to my face.  I use my serum after at night &amp; my face feels soft &amp; amazing</li>
    <li> The product is what was expected. However, being a former TCA peel, Retina user, and then on up to CO 2 laser on entire face, I&#x27;ve tried a lot, and the pin dot scars don&#x27;t go away. An esthetician suggested I try micro needling. My dermaroller is 1mm. It also comes with instructions and good follow up if you have questions. My problem&lt;br /&gt;With it is that my skin is very thick, as most people who suffer lifelong acne as well as adult onset adult acne. I wanted to be able to produce openings in the surface of my skin to apply my glycolics, as these products don&#x27;t absorb into my skin because of the texture. I did it anyway, at least 3 of the times I use it, with no ill effects. I use it once a week in consideration of collagen production, and have been using it about 4-5 weeks with little to no noticeable effects. I gave it two stars because of its construction and the customer service that contacts you several times after purchase to make sure all is going well, and allow questions.</li>
    <li> Product came promptly and was as described.</li>
    <li> great tool - quick shipping</li>
    <li> I was lucky to receive this as a gift and boy am I glad I did. I wondered what it would feel like to roll the tiny little needles over my face (and its wrinkles :-/ ) But it felt cool and the lingering stimulation was good and invigorating to my skin. I&#x27;m looking forward now to the obviously beneficial long-term results. You&#x27;ve got to try this thing; it is sooooo worth it!</li>
    <li> Little painful haven&#x27;t noticed a change as of yet will keep using.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I went through a bout of hives that resulted in scarring on my arms.  Several dermatologists had no solutions to what I consider hideous scars/spots on my arms.  I started researching plastic surgery and based on feedback from forums determined it was risky and the scarring might likely become worse and maybe no better for thousands of dollars.  I do stress, that most sites do not necessarily advocate a Micro Needle Roller for scar removal as it seems more geared towards wrinkling from age, help with acne, etc.  I like anyone else was hesitant about pricking my skin with 540 needles.  At first I ended up with a less expensive roller which was slightly painful.  More research and I ran into this roller.  It is like night and day.  No pain at all and it is even more effective.  I have combined this product with some copper peptides, glycolics and other skin repairs.  In less than 2 weeks I can just about wear short sleeves without cringing in public.  This is NOT going to work for everyone, but I highly encourage doing the research.</li>
    <li> worked the first time! to 9 year old scars. Felt sore for a few days after 10 rolls for each spot i wanted covered and red with slight blood, but felt like a sun burn, a mild annoyance. Looks partially gone, after a few more practices im sure ill be satisfied more than i am now.</li>
    <li> excellent - bristles stay sharp, create pinpricks in facial skin and actually allow better penetration of treatments. the last is truly noticeable in the condition of my completion.</li>

I&#x27;ll give the company 5 stars for being nice and the item a written 3 stars for just my own use. As for what i would have wanted to know before purchased product, would have wanted to know that the FDA didnt approve the product. that should not be taking aspirin or blood thinning products, How long before needles become dull from use and what affect dull used needles have on your skin. Would like to have known that medical people recommend heaing for 40 days. Also all the medications to use to heal and how often to use them. Dont forget to stay out of the sun once done. if you roll 540 needles 3 times on your face you have many tiny wounds that need to heal and need medication. product is not a toy. you have to be armed with lots of information. i only looked up things after i saw blood. it doesnt seem to make sense to try it out a lot and see what results you get, you could get in trouble, if your diabetic or prediabetic definetly dont use it is another thing to be aware of. It raises a red flag so I looked up some information on the internet. caution. You cant go backwards afterwards so use at your own risk. i hope noone has problems. i wanted to write some of these things down so people will think things through before just using it. ask your doctor if you have one for their opinion. Thanks</li>
    <li> ive had a keloid on my arm for 10 years ive been usinh this for about 3 weeks its almost gone i cant believe it!!</li>
    <li> After having my boys,  i was left with my stripes but this roller had helped reduce the appearance of them greatly and i highly recommend the product to all</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month now, once a week.  I noticed improvement in the texture of my skin after the second use. I wouldn&#x27;t say the results are dramatic, but I have noticed that with each time, it gets a little better. I will continue to use this and hopefully get great results I am looking for.  It is somewhat painful, but not enough to discourage me from using it.</li>
    <li> Clear difference in my skin. I love this! Hurts a tad, but tolerable. Skin remains red for a couple hours.</li>
    <li> I just wish I was more clear on how often any derma roller can be used in general. Different sites say different things. So I don&#x27;t know if you can overuse. But it feels like it does plump up the skin. I will keep doing it. As of now I only do it once a month. Any suggestions from customers with this product would be welcome.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me at all. People, don&#x27;t waste your time and money, I have tried this for about 8 weeks and nothing noticeable at all!!!</li>
    <li> Love this derma roller it helps my serum and cream soak into my skin and not sit on top like it did before I started using the derma roller. My skin has improved so much with the derma roller making my fine lines disappear, deeper lines are smaller &amp; pours are shrinking more &amp; more every day. I am very impressed with this product it&#x27;s so easy to use. Highly recommended will buy from again Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably my fault.  I&#x27;m actually pretty tough.  But why did I order something with bunches of tiny needles in it?  I should have returned it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Would consider getting one with different needle size.  If it is good enough for Jennifer Aniston is good enough for me.  I&#x27;m an older woman with lots of issues to work on and see changes in the crows feet and the texture of my skin.  Love it!  I have tried a lot of sin products and this one is so good.  Follow the directions and use the creams recommended!  It has made small bleeding points, at times but those heal immediately.  The needles do not hurt.  So recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and basically its not going to do anything more than help a moisturizer be more absorbent.  If thats all you expect, then you&#x27;ll be pleased, but if you think this product will help reduce acne scars or stimulate collagen renewal you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> First it really doesn&#x27;t hurt, it is recommended to be used for ten minutes daily at night.  It can be used vigorously or according to your comfort level, most importantly you should feel some kind of sting afterward then put on your anti-aging cream and your moisturizer.  This facial gadget is a keeper.  It really does aid in making the skin tight and flawless; of course you need to use it for two to three weeks to see the effect.  I noticed a difference in my skin after the third day of using it.  I love this roller and it has become a must in my skin care regiment.  I highly recommend this product for those of you that want real results.  Great invention!</li>
    <li> I have started using this with the vitamin c serum and then a retinol cream I also purchased on amazon. I am really starting to see some results! Im Not sure if its more this or the other items or maybe all 3 together are whats working.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little scared to try this after reading some reviews talking about how painful it is and the need for a numbing cream. I did not find that to be the case. yes, you do feel the little needles but not what I would describe as painful. Maybe I just have a high pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;The results im seing are after only 3 times in the last 2 weeks. I do It at nIght before bed and I follow it with the vitamin c serum and after that dries I use the retinol cream. My skin looks brighter and more even. Your face will turn red like a mild sunburn right after but will be back to normal by morning. Im excited to see what it will do after a few months of use!</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference but it hurts a little.  My skin is more full and smoother after a treatment.</li>
    <li> Neat product. Do use as instructions direct. It is a medical grade tool. Don&#x27;t use this product without first reading up, or you could seriously scar yourself, but I have a high expectation. Time will tell. Gave it a 4 because it&#x27;s made of quality materials. Would have been a 5 because it takes a lot of time and precision to use not just simple like it reads on the first glance. Misuse it once and get scars for months. Be careful.</li>
    <li> Amazed at how it improved my acne-prone skin.  In fact, a new acne spot healed so much faster after I rolled over it.</li>
    <li> THis one SQUEEKS LIKE CRAZY from day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;MelodySusie 192 Needles Microneedle Skin Care Therapy System&amp;#34; works a lot better with only 192 needles.</li>
    <li> This little roller works better than a charm! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but since I started using the roller my skin feels alive! I use it everywhere, including my post-pregnancy pouch &amp; after a couple of weeks my skin feels tightened &amp; looks refreshed. This device is a must for everyone! Men &amp; women who want to &#x27;turn back the clock&#x27; or just maintain that youthful glow...</li>
    <li> Well made. Easy to use. Packaged nicely .I think I picked a good needle length for a first time user.  Looks like and does what it claims!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best thing ever. I was skeptical at first, but I bought it anyway hoping for the best. I have used this twice and just bought it a week ago. Noticable difference in my skin. Works wonders on dark spots and fine lines. A must have!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I got this to get rid of some stretch marks. It&#x27;s only been about 2 weeks but I see some progress already. I don&#x27;t use any numbing cream, I just suck it up. Roll it over the area but clean the skin and tool with rubbing alcohol 1st and press firmly... it will make the skin a bit red. The way I do it the redness goes away in about a day and a half, then I wait another 24 hours and hit it again. I don&#x27;t know if that is correct so don&#x27;t take my word for it. I believe the other option is a laser treatment. That would cost a fortune. This little thing is the old school way to do it at home I suppose. I also used Neosporin after. Again, this is just the way I did it. I&#x27;m no doctor so to each his own. I&#x27;m eager to see a positive effect after dealing with this for so many years so I&#x27;m hitting it hard. But so far I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its good and made of quality material, however it some irritating pain while using. Maybe i&#x27;m not used to it yet!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those who has an idea about Derma Rollers..</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim but don&#x27;t regret it. I have to be careful not to overdo it and now use it 3-4 times a week. I truly believe that it is helping the products I use by Oz Naturals and Civant to work more thoroughly.  The roller is packaged nicely, extremely easy to use and comes with instructions. It&#x27;s also very easy to keep clean. I just pour rubbing alcohol to sanitize it before and after use. I even put a little alcohol in the well in which the roller head rests. I must be careful to hide it from my granddaughters&#x27; who want to try everything in my cosmetic and beauty boxes.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t used to receiving tips from the vendors with whom I do business and I was wary when I received the first email. I had the option of removing my name from their mailing list but chose otherwise. Now I&#x27;m so happy that this company has reached out to me and other customers. After I use it for a while, I&#x27;m sure that my rating will change to five Stars*****. What am I talking about? I&#x27;m beginning to see changes already. I&#x27;m changing my rating now!</li>
    <li> Not good. Made my mom&#x27;s throw up because she used this. It is dangerous and not approved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, but I&#x27;m already getting results. I&#x27;ve had two (large) babies. My stretch marks are 8 years old now, but not completely &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34;, as old scars get. The dermaroller has definitely promoted new growth and affected not only depth of my stretch marks, but also toned the skin. Very happy with the results so far, and can&#x27;t wait to keep doing it!</li>
    <li> I ordered the derma roller to go with another product. I recieved it quickly and it has worked wonders on my skin! very impressed</li>
    <li> Never used a derma roller before or any face products for my acne scars used it about 5 days and just made the areas I rolled nasty like if you look closely you could see the fine lines so I wasn&#x27;t happy but then it heal and my skin was better than it was before&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with this product didnt make my deep scars go away but it definitely made them smaller and less noticeable so I will be continuing using it and. Hoping for the best</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this dermaroller yet but I&#x27;m excited to use it based on others reviews. Seems that many get fabulous results from something that seems so simple. I&#x27;m just giving it an average rating until I&#x27;ve actually used it a few times and will then update the review. I do thank the other people for their reviews, as I would have never thought of purchasing something like this until reading others opinions on this item. I never had acne a day in my life until I hit 40. I&#x27;m now 43 and have a few light scars from cystic acne therefore my skin appearance is not smooth. I&#x27;m hoping this will change that in time. I will update this review in the weeks to come. In my opinion for the price based on all of the reviews it&#x27;s worth a shot at having smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a week and I saw improvement the very first day...and now it has made my skin look years younger.  What is my skin going to look like after a month? I am using it in conjunction with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  The difference in my appearance is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this roller after reading about their use in beauty articles.  I have only had it two weeks but feel the skin on my face seems a bit plumper and firmer after using it twice a week. I also use it on my neck hoping to firm the area under the chin as well.  The roller is a bit uncomfortable but is not unbearable. I will continue to use this a few times a week to see if there is continued improvement.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly in a sterile package.  After on weeks use, I&#x27;m seeing plumper fuller skin quality and age spots fading.  I use this in conjunction with retin A.  I&#x27;m confident that with continued use, I&#x27;ll see even greater benefit.</li>
    <li> I researched the roller before I bought it, however I didn&#x27;t realize how painful it would be or that there would be scratches on my skin that last about 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied minimal pressure but it still left little cuts/scraped on my skin. I only used it once, but I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast though and the product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> been using the derma roller for about a month now on my triceps stretch marks i got from weight lifting and it is defiantly helping lighten them up will continue to use and am sure the results will progress.  used derma restore skin cream with this im sure that aided the the speed of the results.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it just once a day, usually in the morning.  Easy to apply light presure,and manuver around my face.  I use a Vitamin C product as a follow up with Hyluronic Serum/Gel.  I feel like I see positive changes in the two-weeks since I began using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times so far.  Once a week with light pressure.  Enough to make my skin look pink but nowhere near bleeding.  I use a vitamin c serum afterwards and my other products.  Stings a little but not too uncomfortable.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t look great the day after but I&#x27;m going to stick with it. Hope to ramp it up soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily to get rid of the adult hormonal acne that had cropped up the last 2 years around my chin and jaw line. I had low expectations because getting rid of acne is not the purpose of the derma roller.  That said, I also was hopeful that it would even out me skin tone, help reduce some of the dark spots left from the acne, and maybe help the light forehead wrinkles I&#x27;ve developed the last few years.  For reference I am 38 years old.  I&#x27;ve been using this product every other day for 3 weeks now.  I have noticed a pretty remarkable difference with my wrinkles. The scarring seems slightly improved, but then again because it is winter and my skin is dry I am not using my acid treatments very much so the jury is still out.  The acne seems to have decreased by about 50%, which is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to use because of the acne spots</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every other day after I wash my face and apply Vit C serum.</li>
    <li> I purchased this derma roller with high expectations after hearing a friend rave about derma rollers in general. But it FREAKED me out. I must have stared at this--what looked to be a TORTURE DEVICE--for over a month before finally deciding to pick it up and try it. My problem? My saggy postpartum belly. I had 2 back-to-back pregnancies within 2 years and by the end of the second pregnancy I had gained over 80 pounds. My tummy had been stretched to the moon and back and even though I lost ALL of the weight (and then some) the skin on my belly was just hanging there. It had been a year and a half since my last child was born and my belly had not improved for months. My first use of the derma roller I LITERALLY had to PICK UP my belly skin and stretch it out while I rolled. And honestly? It wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I had made it out to be in my mind. I could tell it felt \\&quot;prickly\\&quot; but it was not painful like I had feared. My skin did not bleed, but after the treatment it was red, which made me think my body was already working on healing this area. I have continued to treat my belly every day for 2 weeks now and I do actually see a major improvement. My skin doesn&#x27;t overlap now where the extra skin was hanging down and the skin in what WAS a very saggy area has tightened up tremendously. I have noticed an improvement in the texture as well--it is not as thin as it was since it is not so stretched anymore. Don&#x27;t expect to see overnight results but just as anything worth having, you must stick to it and be consistent. I have recommended this to others who have also had a baby. I don&#x27;t want to over-hype it since I am sure results vary, but I am pleased with my own experience. I have had more results in these past 2 weeks than I have the whole year and a half since my baby was born. If you do buy a derma roller, just remember to stick to it and give it time. The human body works at its own pace.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this but figured it was worth trying.  I first heard about a derma roller while reading an article on Jennifer Aniston and she said she used one.  So I figured - what the heck.  I have used it now for a little over a week and I can really tell a difference.  At nighttime, I wash my face and use the derma roller, swab my face with rubbing alcohol and then put on my retin-A and C cream.  I guess using the derma roller helps with the absorption of the creams because I really can see a difference.  Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a microderm roller and I think it is starting to work. I was hesitant with the concept assuming my face would be bleeding after use but it only is minimally uncomfortable and produces no apparent trauma. It is more uncomfortable when used on forehead. I think the quality of the product is at least equal to other similar products that are 10x more costly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and have used it three times. A bit of history: I am in my late 30&#x27;s and have hyper pigmentation on my cheeks and some fine lines that I wanted to get rid of. Also, I don&#x27;t like my nasal labial folds, and one of mine is deeper than the other one. This has bothered me for quite awhile. I had bought a Jessner Peel from Amazon and have done 2 in the last 3 months, so my face had already shown a little improvement from the peels. I am using this product once a week and haven&#x27;t done any chemical peels since i&#x27;ve been using this. I don&#x27;t even know if I will need to do any peels anymore since the results from the Derma Roller have been so dramatic for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: Each time that I use this, my skin seems to get better and better.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines between my eyebrows have almost disappeared. I actually have to get really close in the mirror to see them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft and has a creamy appearance-I actually don&#x27;t have to wear foundation anymore since i&#x27;ve been using this because my skin looks great without anything.&lt;br /&gt;My nasal labial folds are plumped up and the deeper one that I had is barely noticeable now.&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical about this product before buying, but I saw so many great reviews that I wanted to try it. I have to say that the results are so great for me that I will always use this little tool as part of my beauty routine. I feel that it will save me a ton of money on all the products I have been purchasing that promise results but don&#x27;t actually do anything. I&#x27;m really excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: When you roll your face, you will notice a bit of stinging. It&#x27;s really not as bad as you would think. It hurts more on the bonier areas of the face and across the top lip, but the good thing is that you are in complete control of the pressure and the areas of the face that you roll.&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not feel comfortable rolling my skin hard enough for it to bleed. It&#x27;s really easy to damage your skin if you go overboard, but you will notice how much pressure you can handle when you use it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Also, afterward I use hyaluronic acid serum and it plumps my skin even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a product that actually works on virtually EVERY skin issue, then this is the device for you. You will notice results really quickly, and it just keeps getting better and better! Good Luck!! :)</li>
    <li> Ive been using my roller for two weeks and already see a difference in my acne scars and stretch marks! I was so please to see how clean and sanitized this product was when it came in, as i am an esthetician. Great product from a great company! Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> I like this (I think) ... or am I just vane and thinking &amp;#34;I look younger&amp;#34; ... LOL  I am a fanatic with daily cleansing, moisturizing, sun screen, etc.  And I am at the age of fine lines ... so can I say that this is helping (I&#x27;m not sure) but I think it might be.  I only use it a couple of times a week.  I make sure to &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; it with alcohol prior to using, I also alcohol my face slightly before and after each use.  And definitely use a hydrating moisturizing lotion after using it.  I use it at night.  If you don&#x27;t use a good hydrating moisturizer you skin will feel stingy ... so be sure to have a good moisturizer on hand before using this.  And I have received compliments on my complexion ... I am just not sure if it is because of this ... or all the hydrating natural products I use on my face daily.?.?</li>
    <li> Have to be honest. I was scared to use this on my 50++ sun damaged skin but.... Makes my skin plumper , smoother , nicer color even. Clean roller with really good alcohol. Wash your face with good face wash. (Neutropena) anything.  Don&#x27;t pivot on skin. I hold the roller loosely and don&#x27;t push roller on your skin until it hurts. It shouldn&#x27;t hurt. Then put your good serum and vitamin C cream. I rub easy but till all rubbed in. I even apply a little more serum. I&#x27;m so impressed really. You have nothing to lose. If you don&#x27;t like it , return it. Buy what is recommended with it. They&#x27;re not expensive products either. If you want to use products you like already , use them. Thanks. L Busch</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I had no idea what this was until I saw it on the Amazon&#x27;s list of bestsellers. I decided to buy it after seeing rave reviews along with lots of youtube videos about the product. I&#x27;ve used it ~2x/week for a month now and my skin definitely feels softer. After the very first time I used it, my face felt really tingly and kind of raw the next day, like I got a sunburn. With each subsequent use, I can hardly feel it anymore even when I press a little harder. I always clean it with EtOH pads or spray-on 70% EtOH before using it. A plus on the roller is that it comes in a small plastic case, so it&#x27;s not like you just leave it on the shelf, which might get unsanitary. After using the roller, I put a thin lotion (essence) - some people suggest essential oils or hyaluronic acid - you can do whatever regimen you&#x27;re used to and I do think the skin soaks it up better. My skin is really soft in the morning after doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole purpose of the dermarollers is to cause controlled amounts of &#x27;damage&#x27; to the skin to induce collagen production and healing without having any visible scars/damage. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a baseless gimmick, so if you&#x27;re curious, like I was, I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
    <li> It is nice for the price I paid. working great and every thing is like what it says  great deal for the price,</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out. Cleared up when I stopped using it. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a tool to use for clear skin</li>
    <li> Have been rolling for over a year now and am very happy with the smoothness of my neck.  This product is made well and is a great price.  Will buy from this manufacturer again.</li>
    <li> I got this a couple of weeks ago and have only used it twice, so I will update my review as I get more use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research, but was still very concerned about how my skin would react to the Derma Roller. I have very sensitive skin and constantly have acne breakouts. My skin problems didn&#x27;t start until I turned 18, prior to that my skin was perfect. I suffer from all forms of acne from blackheads to cystic acne, and haven&#x27;t had any relief in the 10 years since it started--despite trying everything recommended by the dermatologist, including SEVERAL laser treatments and chemical peels. As you might have guessed, on top of the constant breakouts, I also have severe scarring. I am very self conscious about my skin and even though I have spent thousands of dollars in search of relief, only to be let down again, I am still open to trying anything and everything that could potentially help. Which leads to me purchasing the Derma Roller...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon ordering this, my primary concern was that I would cause some sort of additional infection and only end up making my skin worse. In addition to be concerned about how my skin would react, I was also concerned about the pain. Well, I am happy to say that thus far, my acne is actually gone and my skin is already improving AND best of all it&#x27;s nearly painless!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, my skin is very sensitive and stays red for a solid 24 hours following a Derma Roller treatment so I have only been doing it every 5 days. Actually, every morning when I wake up my face is red, but as soon as I wash it, it calms down. I can&#x27;t figure out why my face is doing that and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel sensitive, whatever as long as it looks normal during the day. :) As for how the treatments feel, it feels exactly like when you have a sunburn and something touches it--not bad at all! I don&#x27;t use any numbing cream either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen:&lt;br /&gt;1. Place roller in highest alcohol you can find for 20 min.&lt;br /&gt;2. Let roller air dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash hands for 20 seconds with antibacterial soap.&lt;br /&gt;4. Remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;5. Gently exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;6. Wash face for 20 seconds with antibacterial soap.&lt;br /&gt;7. Wipe face with alcohol, let air dry (this is probably way extreme for people with normal skin, but I&#x27;m so concerned about an infection with my skin that I feel like I have to do this step).&lt;br /&gt;8. Start rolling!(I was careful not to roll over any active acne, just around, so as not to spread that bacteria. Next time I won&#x27;t have to worry about that though, because there is no active acne now!)&lt;br /&gt;9. As I finish each area, I apply a serum with Vit C, E, B, Hyaluronic Acid and Ferulic Acid (sold by Trove of Goods on Amazon) and Colloidal Silver (fights infections and speeds up skin cell renewal).&lt;br /&gt;10. Place roller in alcohol again for 20 min, let air dry before putting back in the case.&lt;br /&gt;11. Any time I wash my face in between treatments I use a mixture of a drop of my favorite skin lotion (Boots Expert Sensitive Skin Lotion), a few drops of the Vit C serum, and a few drops of Colloidal Silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for world&#x27;s longest review, but I hope it helps someone out there suffering from anything similar to what I have experienced. I am documenting the journey with pictures and I am very excited to see how those continue to improve!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the company SGF has been great about following up with me regarding my purchase, answering any questions I have had and giving me tips for using the roller. Thanks, SGF!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually too early to see the difference in my &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34;, but I feel that it is working - the company says to give it 90 days.  It definitely stimulates the face and that&#x27;s got to be good.  I do it 4-5 times a week and plan on continuing.</li>
    <li> I am totally new at using this item. The product came fast and has simple directions I wish I new more about what the size differences do but the one I have works great! I used it once and about 2 weeks later went to a seminar and sweated  for about an hour ,my face felt like it had grains if sand on it. It was dead skin and salt ,it let  my skin breathe better. I want to use it all over!</li>
    <li> This is our third dermaroller and our first 1.0mm which is longer than the 0.5mm we were used to. Out of the three, this also has the best detailed literature that we have tried so far. Slowly at first until we got used to how much pressure to apply to make it comfortable. After the session is over, it gives more redness and tingling pain. It goes deeper which stimulates more of the collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the titanium needles, you are assured that it will not rust. We spray it with alcohol to sterilize, before and after each use. There are many rollers out there and this is one is better constructed than most. The built is sturdy and has a convenient handle to hold. Some rollers have each individual plates that holds a row of needles rotates freely which I prefer better. This one, although consists of eight rows of needles, are stationary; all rows rotates in a single motion. Overall, the quality and build is way above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> A little squeaky but does the job. Great price. Doesn&#x27;t say after how many uses the needles go blunt and need to get a new one.</li>
    <li> it does help some scars. i just need to give it some more time.&lt;br /&gt;i think it will take a few months to totally get rid of my scars.</li>
    <li> Way more painful than I had anticipated. If I weren&#x27;t paranoid about almost all topical lotions/products I&#x27;d consider getting a numbing agent to use before rolling sessions. If you don&#x27;t mind the (sometimes scary) ingredients of most topical facial preparations, I highly suggest getting a numbing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t noticed lasting results in the 6 weeks that I have used this, the results within 2-3 hours after use are nice. My skin has a warmer tone, my skin is tighter and a little fuller. I love the way my face looks a few hours after using my roller, but not immediately after! My pores are smaller now however.</li>
    <li> This roller came carefully packaged and with very clear instructions on how to use it.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it is going to help with my wrinkles.  I really hope so.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this very long. It does feel like the C and E serum enters my skin better than without it. Visually I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my complexion.</li>
    <li> Here is the deal, I use physician quality serums on my face, and body while using this product, not cheap stuff.  I was hoping that this would be able to help with some of the stretchmarks on my stomach from having a 10lb baby.  The marks have gotten less defined, but are not gone.  I will continue to use this, and i hope to continue to see results.  I am not overweight, I have good skin elasticity, and again I use high quality products.  If you are expecting the world, this probably isn&#x27;t it, but if you are looking to try and improve as much as you can for a much smaller investment than lasers, this may help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the derma roller for over a month now for my acne scars and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference as of yet. Hopefully I will see some improvements over time.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and I feel that it is helping the look of my skin.  I had never used one of these before but had friends that do and  I am with them it does a good job. I would tell anyone to get one of these Derma Rollers.  I have scares on both of my shoulders due to surgery and it is helping them to look a lot less noticeable than before I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;I would tell anyone to get this item and try it for your self.  I did and it seems to be helping me in the way I got it for.</li>
    <li> My friend had this procedure done only 1 time for $150.  I bought this and so far have used it 3 times, and I get the same effect.  My skin looks very healthy, and noticably smoother. It does have a small amount of pain involved, but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading great reviews and I gotta say, it exceeded my expectations. I have moderate rolling scars and hyper pigmentation from acne during my pregnancy. I have tried everything (expensive, cheap, organic.. ect) to get rid of them and nothing has worked... until this. The first time i used it, I was surprised at how easy it is. It is a tad uncomfortable. To me, it feels almost like a tattoo, but not nearly as intense, and after I was finished, my face felt like it had a very mild sunburn.. it is completely tolerable. On a scale of 1-10, I&#x27;d say the pain is about a 1 or 2. The pain is completely irrelevant to me because the next morning, I woke up and wow! My indented scars were about 50-60% better and the hyper-pigmentation is about 40% better. I know that may not seem like a whole lot to some, but for me, who has struggled with this for years, it is amazing. I look forward to continue using this to see just how much improvement I can achieve.&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend this to people with mild acne scarring. I know not everyone will get the immediate results i got, but I think patience and consistency are key with this product. I also recommend only doing it one to two times a week because it does take a few days to heal. A liberal coating of organic coconut oil right after really helped to ease the redness and seems to speed up the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still not sure about if this will work for you, all i can say is just try it! It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive and easy to use so it&#x27;s not that big of a risk. It&#x27;s better than wondering if you&#x27;re missing out, right? Good luck to everyone using this great product! Personally, I am one happy girl!</li>
    <li> I got my roller on Monday and by Thursday my frown lines are considerablly better looking. I actually thought that most of these reviews were exaggerated...not at all!&lt;br /&gt;I have used nightly all over my face but I work harder over the stubborn forehead and frown lines - it has definitely made a very big difference in less than one week.&lt;br /&gt;I even used the roller on the back of my hands! Although the piercing of the skin is far more irritating and itchy after you roll, the next day I saw my hands were much improved, less veiny and wrinkly looking. I&#x27;m so impressed. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin fairs after a month!&lt;br /&gt;I use a vitamin c serum before I roll and again afterwards. My only regret is not having taken before and  after pics for proof. I would say though that the before and after pics you might see on websites do appear to be realistic in my little opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I also will add that I have never had results like this with any cream, gel, solution etc....and like most women of my age (43) I have pretty much tried them all. The money I spent on this little device is minimal in comparison to even 1 months supply of a good wrinkle eraser (that won&#x27;t work)&lt;br /&gt;I roll at night for the best results, by the time morning comes around any irritation is long gone!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a friend who didn&#x27;t have amazon prime. Looked at the product when it arrived &amp; can&#x27;t see how this can be beneficial or hygienic for skin. There can&#x27;t be anyway that puncturing the skin hundreds of times can produce longterm benefits. &amp; what about maintaining sterility? even if ointments or sprays will \\&quot;sterilize\\&quot; the needles, i&#x27;m sure that over time there will be a build up of dirt, dead skin, etc. around the needles. Overall it seems like the only thing this product will do is cause inflammation and irritation. Strongly suggest doing heavy research before deciding whether or not to buy.    [...]    According to this link there are only partial benefits to using this product and many false claims. Though more costly, frequent massage, proper vitamins/nutrition, &amp; skin ointments/moisturizers may be your best bet for better skin.</li>
    <li> It does not hurt. It feels great on your skin. Esay to carry in your purse and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I have been looking at derma rollers for over a year and was very skeptical. I finally decided to give it a try.  I have sun damaged skin with many indented acne scars, some deeper than others. I have lost a lot of elasticity in my face and neck from long term use of prednisone which gave me a \\&quot;moon face\\&quot; and my skin never bounced back. Wrinkles are not a problem for me.  The first time i used it (it hurts) i followed with murad essential c daily renewal cream with retinol and a vitamin c moisturizer (it burns but goes away ) i let my skin heal for about 4 weeks. Just prior to the second time using it, i closely inspected my skin and noticed that my acne scars looked different. I can&#x27;t honestly say they were better, but the look is changing so it&#x27;s doing something.  I also have a surgical scar at the bottom of my neck and i can say that after using the derma roller twice, that scar is almost invisible.  My skin didn&#x27;t peel as expected (from other reviews).  The reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because i have only used it twice.</li>
    <li> I actually love this product...yes, the little needles are a bit painful..but as they say no pain no gain. I have used this little guy on some of my..uh hmmm dimply areas and in no time I have seen some great results of my skin smoothing out and less appearance of hail damage.. :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether this micro needle would help or not. However, the product seems to be of a high quality. It was recommended to me by someone who said this could help the scalp absorbing more of a substance and absorbs it quicker.</li>
    <li> I really like this derma roller.  I use it about once a week.  The only area that I experience discomfort is on my forehead.  I have been using it for a couple of months and I think it has helped the discoloration on my face.</li>
    <li> Be very careful with this product, my grandson bought it and it has sometimes broken him out. Be sure to use as instructed and don&#x27;t overuse.  I believe a soft wash with a semi abrasive cleanser would work just as well.</li>
    <li> I am a 52 year old female with sensitive skin. I had this item in my shopping cart for about a month before I actually purchased it. Once I got it  delivered, I started using it. I was def light handed at first and I had no reactions at all. I am not one to follow rules, and I found that the way they suggested using it was taking too long, so I developed my own little system. I have been using retin A right after and 2 days later, my skin is  really peeling, so it absolutely helps any product penetrate better. I am also using Watts Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid / Vitamin C / L Serum. I think it&#x27;s too soon to tell if there is any transformation, so I will check back.</li>
    <li> I love this. It is a great way to get your face products into the skin. Such an awesome thing. Some places are more tender than others but it has never caused me to bleed or have bad pain.</li>
    <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t expect such an immediate noticeable effect with this product.  I purchased to product to help my skin get rid of the hyper pigmentation (dark spots) that I get after pimples.  They take WEEKS to clear up normally.  With with only 2 applications of the derma roller with a vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve already noticed a dramatic difference in my face, and so has my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, the prickling feeling can be a bit uncomfortable, but not painful though.  Just remember not to push too hard or go too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos on a cheap and wonderful product that actually WORKS!!</li>
    <li> Great item in that it gives results in about 2 weeks.  You need to use a high quality serum for the best results.  I used the roller and the scar on my face is lighter.  I found it best right before bed...wash face, then roll, and apply serum and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This thing really works!  I was skeptical at first, but I can really see a difference with the scars on my face.  Also my skin feels a lot more smooth! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews say that it hurts too much or that the product broke.  The needles don&#x27;t hurt at all unless you put tons of pressure on it, which you aren&#x27;t supposed to anyway.  And for it breaking, I find this product to be really sturdy, it would be hard to break!</li>
    <li> So far the results I have seen are amazing! I am using it on a scar from a tattoo I had removed as well as the my facial complexion and it has dramatically improved both! I would highly recommend this product to anyone especially for the low price! It is slightly painful in sensitive areas but the results I  seeing in are more than worth it! Get this product if you want amazing skin!</li>
    <li> Great customer service. The roller is not painful and the high needle count allows for shorter rolling sessions. Have already recommended this product to friends and family. :)</li>
    <li> Derma rolling is so good for my skin after i do  a treatment whatever serum or moisturizer i use i can feel it going deep into my skin!  I plan to use derma roller for a long time!</li>
    <li> Love it. It gets great coverage over my neck and face. Skin is very much improved</li>
    <li> nothing dont even  why i thought this would work. still trying it  scratching on face ,  try it for i more wk. then see</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this to my friends and I have already.&lt;br /&gt;I love the travel case it helps with keeping it clean also.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped with my fine lines already!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You-</li>
    <li> I feel severe pains when using it. No effects are seen after using it for almost 3 weeks. It&#x27;s more comfortable to use some scar remover cream. At least, it&#x27;s not painful!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I actually bought 2. It works amazing helped my acne scars fade away and made my skin transform, it does hurt a little.</li>
    <li> All this did was hurt and turn my skin red. Would not recommend. If you have sensitive skin especially it will be a very bad choice.</li>
    <li> I only use it about 2ce a week. I don&#x27;t \\&quot;press\\&quot;, I just lightly roll it across/around my face. No one should press hard enough to hear popping noises! Even though I am gentle, the next morning if I work out I can feel sweat stinging my forehead where I used it. I&#x27;ve started, a month ago, using a Hylauronic acid/Vitamin C serum and am very satisfied w/ the results. This tool is intended to help the serum sink in, and apparently it does aid in that.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend it; it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable but the results are well worth it &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I guess it feels like you&#x27;re doing something that should have an effect! Always use before treatment creams&lt;br /&gt;to reap the most benefits! Might see more benefits if I used it more judicially!</li>
    <li> It is very useful. Really worth its price. I think I will buy this again and recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have quite some acne dimpled scars on my face. For the past ten days, I use Derma roller SGF almost everyday, once a day, after shower/washed my face. As Derma rolling is not new to me and I don&#x27;t really push very hard, (I used to spent hundreds at beauty salon and they rolled for long time and pushed much harder) my skin seems to be able to adapt to it well and not very sensitive to the rolling. After rolled, I applied cold aloe vera gel and cold hyaluronic acid onto my face, then continue with moisturizers.  My skin is fairer and scars improved, skin firmer and face becomes smaller, as I occasionally roll on my neck to firm it up, so i hope to see my double chin dissappearing soon. One point to take note that my skin has more breakouts and white heads, so I just do extraction every 3 or 4 days, but I think this is just temporary due to skin renewal process.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend because I like mine so much. My family has noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and I am looking forward to even more improvement. &amp;#34;Came very quickly, great transaction, exactly as described! Would definitely purchase from seller again.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Just whsy i ordered&amp;#34; Thank you&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me but at the office it is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I use at home and wash with warm water and soap and spray with alcohol afterwards as well to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using on my face I apply Hylauronic acid:)  My face looks so much plumper and my skin is really good, pores smaller, no blemishes, fine lines are better....  LOVe this and swear by it!!</li>
    <li> I was pressed to write a review of this product only a few days after receiving it, before I can establish results.  I received several emails from them requesting a review, so here it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the science behind this product is correct.  It tricks the skin into thinking there in a injury and therefore your immune system response is triggered for repair.  I have used it on my face a few time, never to the point of bleeding like one customer, but very gently and lightly.  There is a slight tingling and redness for a couple of hours and that&#x27;s it.  It takes time for the healing process so I don&#x27;t have any results yet.  I&#x27;ll write again after 3 months.</li>
    <li> I was surprised about the quality of the product and happy to say that I truly really like it :)</li>
    <li> Even though I am in the preliminary stages of using it, it seems to be working since the skin is pink after I use it.  I&#x27;m still using it once a week, and may change to twice a week.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this.  It allows your skin to absorb whatever product your using.  The results are great...  I&#x27;m very happy&lt;br /&gt;with my face....</li>
    <li> I got a defective item, my roller did not roll easily. I emailed to the seller, and new roller was sent to me at no charge on the same day. I received it just a few days later, and now it is time to try it and see if it is working.</li>
    <li> After three weeks of use, 2-3 times per week, I can definitely see a difference in the quality of my skin texture. I bought the 1.0 mm as well as a .50 mm (from another vendor). For my skin type I have found the .50 mm to be much more tolerable. My skin seems to have &amp;#34;plumped up&amp;#34; a bit more and I&#x27;m noticing my wrinkles seem to have decreased already.&lt;br /&gt;I find the larger 1 millimeter size needles to be a bit more painful, and based on what the experts say, collagen can be stimulated with a .50 mm size.&lt;br /&gt;So I can say for sure, they both work!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any positive results with this and have used it as directed. Skin still feels the same and scars haven&#x27;t changed from what I can tell. A little disappointed but you get what you pay for. Did make me feel like I had better circulation to areas though</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it with vitamin C amino blend Hydraluronic acid acid 20%, during and after using this product at night. My skin looks refreshed brand-new and glowing! Painful a first but, worth it! I had 20 years of acne scarring just disappear!</li>
    <li> I just purchased the derma roller and am so lost on how to use it :( Do you just clean the area then rub on your skin dry up down side to side for a few mins ... or are you suppose to put some type of cream on your skin and rub it in that way??? I&#x27;m so lost, If anyone sees this please let me know the proper way to use it! thanks in advance</li>
    <li> Received on time. I love the case and use it for storage after cleaning and letting it completely dry. I also received a follow up email with a lot of Q&amp;A. That was very helpful. I use my Derma Roller several times a week and I have seeing some wonderful results. My skin is glowing and feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks but I&#x27;ve noticed a difference so far! It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how well this works yet.  However, I was disappointed that it did not come with much information on customer results.  If I had not read about it on the internet when I ordered it, I would not have know the correct way to use this.</li>
    <li> I had an elevated scar on my hand and this really made it better - smooth and not nearly s noticible. I wouldn&#x27;t say I had same luck with fine lines on my face but I don&#x27;t think it hurts to keep trying it.</li>
    <li> Product gorgeous and totally inadequate ..</li>
    <li> After years and years of trying creams and gels and spending 100s of dollars. I use this thing once and noticed such a big difference. My face is brighter and smoother. I have a nice glow and it helped with my current breakout that I was going through. My makeup even looks better and I don&#x27;t need a primer anymore.</li>
    <li> This product is working great! I have been using it for several weeks and already feel a noticeable difference in both the texture and smoothness of my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see the wrinkles disappear!</li>
    <li> OK, so this is the very first derma roller I have ever used. I never had any facials or anything done to my face. Started to notice small fine lines under the eye and a few hormonal pimples here and there that bugged me from time to time. I have been using this roller for 4 days now and I can honestly see the difference in my skin complexion and texture. I have to be honest, it does pinch around when you roll it on your skin, so please please be careful and don&#x27;t press the roller to hard on the skin. I wash my face first, use the roller then apply my moisturizer which in my case is pure virgin coconut oil. The first time I used the roller was right before my sleep and my face itched all night! I could not fall asleep and I was terrified to wake up in the morning with red spots allover the face. I am not sure if the itchiness was from the first use or I rolled it more than I was supposed to on the areas. After the third time it did not itch. Also make sure you clean the roller with rubbing alcohol after each use to prevent infections and bacteria.</li>
    <li> I really liked the packaging and the travel case. It is definitely useful for lightly penetrating the skin where I need to apply products. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It did firm my face a little and reduced the scar on my chest just after two uses, two weeks apart.  I would give it a five but the shorter needles 1.0mm is actually harder to use and more painful than the longer 2.0mm. I had to press harder and it hurt more.  I ordered a 2.0 from the same manufacturer and it was less painful.</li>
    <li> only been using it a month and really bad acne scars on my face have drastically faded. i love it!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t do anything for me no matter how I used it, what I used it with, how often (or not often) I tried it. No luck. Bought products to try in conjunction, adjusted usage. No such luck with any modification. I really had high hopes because of all the positive reviews. I actually used this as a product to review on my person blog, which shows pictures, etc, and proof that nothing magical happened. Oh well. chalk it up to an interesting, mildly painful experience.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works great as long as you use as directed.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to make all scars and stretch marks disappear over a period of time. I&#x27;m not sure it really does, because it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable when you roll it on your skin. I&#x27;ll keep trying it though; it&#x27;ll be totally worth it if it works!</li>
    <li> I love my SGF Derma Roller!!!!!  &amp; highly recommend it to Everyone!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes my skin feel but even better I am loving&lt;br /&gt;the results I am seeing.  At 63 a woman needs alllll the help she can get&lt;br /&gt;&amp; I love the price the feel &amp; the way it is eliminating my wrinkles &amp; working&lt;br /&gt;on my dreaded cellulite.  Better get one NOW  ladies!</li>
    <li> Have had it for a little over a month now and my scars are so faded now. It can be painful but my scars are fading with a little help for my acne with Proactiv.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot!  Fast service</li>
    <li> There are absolutely no instructions that come with this instrument other than directions on the box telling you which direction to roll the roller in.  I used it twice, two days in a row.  Obviously you are not supposed to use it daily.  My face was bloody afterwards.  I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical -- did a lot of homework looking at reviews. After using several times I can see quite a difference in my skin tone.  I use Vitamin C serum immediately afterwards.  Waiting to see if it reduces pores.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it about 10 times so far.  Does not hurt!  Actually feels sort of good because I know it is making a difference.</li>
    <li> This device was scary at first, but let me say this, the company shipped it fast AND sent me several emails explaining how to use it, tips for best results and continued to check and see if I was happy. That was awesome. Additionally, after using it with the Retinol A cream, my acne scars are DEFINITLEY less visible. I won&#x27;t say it feels good, however it is worth the small discomfort. I&#x27;m 44 years old and have not been this happy about my face in 20 years. So glad I read the reviews!</li>
    <li> I was shopping for a replacement for my Dermaroller MT and thought I&#x27;d try this one and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Even though the needles are the same length (1mm), this one doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt as much, maybe because they&#x27;re closer together and there are more of them.  And, most importantly, after using it my skin looks so much better. Acne scars are definitely becoming more shallow and pores are barely visible. Nice and smooth :)  Hyper-pigmentation is gone too. I recently turned 50 and I can honestly say that my skin has never looked better (and it was a wreck before). For the first time in my life women much younger than me are complementing me on my clear and smooth skin. And that&#x27;s not botox or fillers my friends, it&#x27;s this dermaroller.</li>
    <li> The idea of a bunch of tiny needles poking at you can be a bit scary but it&#x27;s really not bad. The results are visible after just 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I use it with a smaller one.. Alternating them.. Every 20 days I do a treatment.. The larger one does not hurt as badly.. The smaller one is better around the nose area..  It hurts though.. Don&#x27;t think otherwise.. I even used a numbing cream.. It hurts but I love  it anyway..</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks now, from what I undersand, use it for about  3 months, then stop for about 3 months to give your skin time to heal.  I can say, that using it the face cream I am using works better, there is some redness, blotches etc, but nothing really bad, it tingles a bit when using it, and it depends on the pressure you&#x27;re using, at this point I say go for it and get it if you are looking, nothing bad has happend so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product not knowing that it should not be used by someone with keyloid condition which I have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this device four nights a week for about a month now. My hyperpigmentation has already begun to fade somewhat, and my smile lines are reduced. I use this in conjunction with a Clairsonic, Effaclar Face Wash, Vit C serum, and Vit C moisturising cream. I&#x27;m already getting compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to work up the nerve to use this thing. Received it in an okay amount of time. Will try to remember to update when I work up the nerve</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference after using this, and it is downright painful to use. I cannot use it around my nose and over the cheekbones due to the pain it causes. This is where i need to reduce scars and tighten pores. So it really was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I have old scars all over my face and it sometimes feels kind of dead. After a few days of this, my face really looks like it has much healthier blood flow. There is an obvious improvement in the scarring. I&#x27;m looking forward to further results in the future.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;icepick&amp;#34; acne scars on my cheeks and began to see results only a few days after using the SGF Derma Roller.  Now after a few weeks my skin is close to flawless. I&#x27;ve also begun using the Derma Roller on new a scar on my knee and noticed a significant lightening in it&#x27;s color. This product is a GAME CHANGER hands down.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try to push back the hands of time in regard to the wrinkles on my face. I have been using it before going to bed at night and am happy with the results. I was a little scared at first but it doesn&#x27;t hurt and only takes a few minutes each evening so it has become part of my nightly routine. I highly recommend anyone wanting to erase wrinkles give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using my derma roller for only about two weeks, and I already can see a difference in my skin.  It is probably the best beauty product I have ever found, and it doesn&#x27;t cost much or run out!</li>
    <li> This device is great, it gets results but I would suggest to start off with 0.5 mm then jump into this one, you know to get you accustomed to piercing your skin with small needles, maybe my skin is too sensitive, other friends of mine have this same dermaroller and they have no complaints, so go ahead and buy it but make sure is the one with titanium needles they don&#x27;t give or breakout allergies.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! works! love it. My wife even bought one after seeing how great my skin was looking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin. But depending on what kind of cream I use after it I can truly feel the effects of it. If I follow it with a good retinol cream I can feel tingling and slightly burning sensation.</li>
    <li> I wanted to really love this product, but so far I am not sure. I am still giving it a 4 - I like the way my face feels afterwards, I  know it is clearing my pores and removing dead skin. My only problem is this. I have been having a problem with the formation of &amp;#34;milias&amp;#34; - small white bumps, not whiteheads, under my eyes and along the sides of my nose. I am 57, and a year ago my dermatologist gave me Retin-A, but it hasn&#x27;t helped. When I used the derma roller, not only did it not remove the milia, I started getting more! I am not sure what to do. Each time I followed the rolling with a Vitamin C serum, and later used hyaluronic acid serum as well. I also followed all the instructions, cleaning the unit, using peroxide, etc.  I have used the roller 3 times or so in the last month, which may have been too often. If anyone out there has any suggestions.  Thanks in advance for your help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would welcome them. I also would love to see a Derma Roller with this same number of micro needles but not as wide, to get in areas where this roller is too wide. Perhaps half the width of this one.This is provided I can solve my milia issue....</li>
    <li> i revived my drema roll thank you  i love your work . it good work&lt;br /&gt;thank you bye friend .</li>
    <li> I am súper happy with my new Derma Roller SGF. It&#x27;s an excellent product! I&#x27;m seeing the results in a couple of days. And the Product is as described by seller. A+</li>
    <li> I have now been using this for two months (yes, I kept hoping to see a difference) but no, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have made any difference.</li>
    <li> Does the trick. I use this with a vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> Okay, i am not sure how long its suppose to last. but if i have to buy a new one every so often, i am not using this. After 5 weeks of use the needles have gone blunt. and i don&#x27;t get the same result i used to get when i first start using.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Great customer service, they sent me a new one and this one is doing so much better. thank you. Changed from 1 star to 4 stars. Will change to 5 stars if this one holds up.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a week.  Definitely need to practice my touch with it.  First time did it too hard on my hand.  Learned a lighter touch for me is better.  Ordered the 1mm.  May order the 1.5 as I gain more experience.</li>
    <li> Seriously! This works! I&#x27;ve been rolling for about 2 weeks now and the results are really noticeable. I am telling my friends. Make sure to use with your serums etc. I do a good clean- use the roller and moisturizer with the best product in the world.... Coconut Oil. Buy this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much on writing reviews, but a couple words on this product is due. Helps with alleviating toxins from the muscular system and with other skin impurities. Recommended to anyone with similar goals...</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for this product when it came up in my Amazon as something I may like.  I started to review the Derma Roller and kept seeing all the great reviews on this one.  I the. Did as I always do. Encore I buy anything:  I went out to the internet to research Derma Rollers and the &amp;#34;needling technique&amp;#34;.  Based on what I found, the process totally makes sense to me.  Think about it:  people pay good money to irate their lawn to help new grass grow thicker so why not irate your face to allow new cells to grow and skin to thicken?  I have been using this almost every day for about 2 weeks now and I am seeing a difference already.  Wrinkles don&#x27;t appear to be as noticeable and skin texture is better.  My friends have said that my skin looks awesome and pores look smaller:  This was BEFORE I told them what I was using because I wanted to see if they noticed!  I would highly recommend buying this product!</li>
    <li> Its been a couple weeks and I do not see any results yet.  I will keep using it though since I seem to be in the minority.&lt;br /&gt;And PS it hurts, no blood but it&#x27;s definitely is uncomfortable. No worse than an IPL laser or acid peal though.&lt;br /&gt;Fingers and toes crossed.</li>
    <li> I have mild acne scars and one raised prominent scar above my lip that was actually caused by a laser treatment trying to get rid of my acne scars.  The raised scar was very hard to hide with makeup and I have had it for several years. I have gone to plastic surgeons and they lightly zapped it with a laser and said that was about all that they could do. (No results!) I consider this derma roller my little miracle worker.  The scar has significantly diminished!  It is not longer raised and is flat against my skin and the improvements are continuously occurring with each use!  It is barely visible at all now.  In addition my mild acne scars have also significantly been reduced!  I use it every other day and on the alternate day I use my Retinol.  I have been using it daily on the raised scar.  I am not sure if this is what doctors would recommend and I am very vigilant and watch my skin carefully...  Scars are painful and I will not risk damage to my face.  I know when I need to back off and will do so if  I see it is too much.  I don&#x27;t put that much pressure on it for my face and the acne scars but do apply more pressure to the raised scar.</li>
    <li> stupid, does nothing-showed it to a dermatologist friend who first was upset about the possiblility of transferring staph, and also that it really has no way of really doing any deep tissue alteration that would require collagen to activate-stupid and wasteful purchase</li>
    <li> Used on my stretch marks... Seems to be improving in tone and texture on stomach area. I use bio oil after</li>
    <li> Love this item. It really works!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but decided to try it and am very glad I did.  I notice the difference already and have only used it a few times.  I have smile lines around my mouth that have deepened and become more pronounced with age.  I am 65 and would not consider a lift or using fillers.  My preference is a natural look and I have been quite pleased with Derma Roller and the subtle changes I&#x27;ve noticed since using this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the derma roller because it was cheap and the theory behind it made sense. I&#x27;m a male in my 20s. I lost 150lbs and had surgery last year to tighten loose skin. Specifically on my chest and stomach. I was happy with the results and though I was prepared for scars I couldn&#x27;t help but be self-conscious about them. Especially since the scars were thick and raised (hypertrophic). I had tried silicone gel and sheets (I find the sheets to be more effective than gel) but hadn&#x27;t seen many long term changes in the appearance of the scars which remained raised, thick, hard, and dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last straw came when someone was rubbing their hand over my chest and upon feeling my surgical scars, jokingly asked if I had formerly been a woman and undergone a mastectomy. I bought the derma roller soon after and in the month or two that I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve noticed an absolutely amazing change in the appearance of my scars. As other reviews note, changes can be seen after only one or two uses. I simply rolled the derma roller back and forth over my scars 10 times. Then applied cocoa butter. I did this 1-2 times a week. That was enough to cause my scars to noticeably flatten out, become softer, and even a little thinner. The color seems to be closer to that of the surrounding skin so the scars are less visible. Now when I rub my hand over my chest, I can barely feel them, which I hope means I won&#x27;t get any more ignorant comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I completely understand why it helps but if my haphazard use of the derma roller could produce such impressive results so fast, there is definitely something to the process that works. I don&#x27;t know if my scars will continue to improve or if further use will meet with diminishing returns but so far I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
    <li> I have used the Derma Roller for about a month now and have seen the pores on my face greatly reduced.  I bought it to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, I will give it more time.  I am definitely going to continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> does it job, keeps your skin firm and healthy by stimulating it. It takes a little getting used to so start out slow but use every day and your chin firms nicely.</li>
    <li> I have used this roller a couple of times on my thighs and butt and I have seen a reduction in cellulite. Clean roller with alcohol prior to use. Use retin A on skin after roller usage.</li>
    <li> I thought I never see the day my stretchmarks slowly disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;Today is a month from the day I&#x27;ve purchased and used the Derma-Rollor once a week on my face, legs, arms, and stomach were I have the most stretchmarks and cellulite. My results were amazing! If you&#x27;re tired of wasting your time with other products, this product will be your last search, and solution you&#x27;ve been looking for. Thank you Derma-Roller for making me more happier, and confident with my self image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works!!!</li>
    <li> This left scab trails on my body.</li>
    <li> Not that great. Still not sure if it actually does anything.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever used and will use until the days of time. I am an african american female and my skin is medium brown, I had no down time and it healed in a week. It is very painful but, you can buy some numbing cream too cut down the pain. I am goning to start doing this on a monthy basis. I will highy buy this again over time.</li>
    <li> Best product I had use ever</li>
    <li> so far so good...will keep an update after 3 months ;)</li>
    <li> I did not see any real results while using this product. I do not think that it helped to minimize the scar that I was working to remove/reduce. I used this product for approx. five months.</li>
    <li> Works great! Just keep it clean and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize! Every time I use it I can see a difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! I started using this product a couple of weeks ago and the changes I&#x27;ve seen were remarkable.... I totally recommend this product to anyone... Love it.....!</li>
    <li> Excellent conditions delivered as expected. 100% Recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this with a cream to reduce stretch marks on stomach. Lines and appearance have lightened in appearance. More detailed review in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> This kind of hurts and I don&#x27;t notice any difference in skin. I break out some after use.</li>
    <li> really like this. when i wake up the next morning and look in the mirror I can definitely tell a difference after Ive used it the night before.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.. I could tell a change in my skin after first use.</li>
    <li> This thing rock is all I can say.  It does help penetrate whatever you are using on your skin.  My lines are softening rapidly.</li>
    <li> Order came very quickly and since I have never used a Roller before I watched a lot of video&#x27;s on it. I have used it a few times now and of course I know I won&#x27;t see any results yet. The first thing I noticed was the redness in my face but was surprised how quickly it went away and happy I had no bleeding. However after about my 4th time I noticed my skin got really dry to a point that other people noticed. One of the video&#x27;s I watched a woman used vitamin E on her face before she started using her roller so I gave that a try and it helped a lot. When I am done rolling I gently blot the oil off and then apply my Vitamin C Serum hyaluronic acid. This burns a little but the sting goes away. I then leave my face alone and when I go to bed I use Alba aloe&amp;green tea moisturizer. I always clean my roller with warm water and soap and then rubbing alcohol before I put it back into the container. I have a lot of deep wrinkles that I don&#x27;t expect will go away but I am hoping to soften them some. I can&#x27;t afford botox or fillers and I am sick and tired of trying every new cream/serum that comes out claiming to do miracles. Watching so many video&#x27;s on the roller was helpful but I am still not sure what the best products are to use with the roller. I will update my review in a few months and in the meantime if anyone could direct me on the best products to use with my roller it would be very helpful.</li>
    <li> The oddest thing, right.  Who would think that micropiercing your skin would be a good thing.  For my skin it has been a good thing.  I have been using this about once a week and following up with my serums and moisturizers as normal and am seeing improvements in my skin.  I always struggle with large pores and hyperpigmentation and this has made a difference for me.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product as of now i saw some improvements to my face. I will continue to use it, and i will update how it goes.</li>
    <li> I like to be able to clearly see the needles-(for cleanliness &amp; to be certain none are bent).&lt;br /&gt;Also, this one seems sturdier than some of the others offered here.</li>
    <li> I had considered purchasing this item for quite some time.  I go to an esthetician monthly for microdermabrasion. I don&#x27;t have any serious skin issues but go for anti aging purposes as I am in my early fifties.  Its&#x27; been difficult to swing lately and I haven&#x27;t gone for about 5 months now.  Time to take matters in my own hands!  I have only used this roller twice and already see a difference.  I have fine lines and mild acne scarring in my chin area. My lines look much better and plumper.  I&#x27;m thrilled so far!  I immediately apply hyaluronic acid serum followed by a moisturizer w/vitamin C in it.  Plan on experimenting with applying collagen cream after as well.  My skin glows and looks great without makeup. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my future results will be. My results are much better than professional microderm treatments were for me. I wish I had tried this a year ago when I first saw it. The theory behind it makes absolute sense.  In an attempt to heal, your skin naturally repairs itself by producing collagen. Your products also penetrate deeper when applied after.  I also take Biosil which is an oral supplement to promote collagen from within.  This was recommended by my doctor.  As far as this seller goes, quick shipment and follow up emails to offer tips on how to use the roller. A+!</li>
    <li> I have used the derma roller maybe five times so far, and although my skin is super sensitive it has taken to it well. The jury is still out but I like the concept and it has done me no harm. I follow up after with either vitamin c serum or a peptide and a nice moisturizer. I like it and will continue to use it. I will most likely buy another to use on my scalp!</li>
    <li> Use it every day.  Like the feel of it on my face. A bit tingly - then I apply lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It is very squeeky now, tho.</li>
    <li> Not sure how it&#x27;s working on my skin appearance but will keep using it once a week, it feels good in a bad way, :)</li>
    <li> This works but only if you are very gentle.  Don&#x27;t use any pressure while rolling and it will work beautifully to allow serums and lotions to seep through your skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt; I like the way my skin feels after I use it. It feels awake. :) . I am able to apply pressure that feels good and doesn&#x27;t hurt but I still know that it is working. I would recommend this Derma Roller. I also like that is comes with a storage container when not being used. It stays sanitized.</li>
    <li> just got the item, have been using all most every night.  the 1st night i did see some result.  but after that no difference&lt;br /&gt;will continue using it &amp; hope it will help with the wrinkles</li>
    <li> Only used twice but I think it is making a big a big change to the crows feet around my eyes. I will revise this as time goes on. However I will be getting old, lol</li>
    <li> I have not seen any results and it hurts if you but it more than twice a day - but I am still hopeful it will improve the texture</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no instruction sheet, just what&#x27;s printed on the outside of its box. But I read the reviews and questions, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I cleansed my face, sterilized the roller, and counted as it went across my face. My skin started to burn. When I looked in the mirror, it appeared as though I had a sunburn. Then, my face started hurting real bad. Thinking I might&#x27;ve applied too much pressure, I waited 2 days before using again. My skin felt smooth though. On the 2nd use, there was pain again, and I stopped without finishing all the strokes, even though I made sure the pressure was minimal. Days later, I tried a 3rd time but stopped after doing a small section on the right side of my face. This time my skin felt numb, with very light strokes, but when I increased the pressure just a tiny bit, it hurt. I decided this thing could do serious damage to me, so I laid it aside. When I contacted the seller for a possible refund, explaining what happened to me, he said he&#x27;d be glad to refund my money...provided the product was unused, and the box unopened. So, buyer beware. If it causes problems, you wasted your money, and you&#x27;re stuck with it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly. But had to return as it said on the box not to use if you have Rosea. I did not see that in the description</li>
    <li> I use it twice a week and I apply organic vit c serum afterwards.  I notice after a week that my skin is more smoother, and clearer!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, it relaxes the tight muscle on my face after a long 12 hour day work.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The roller seems to be of good quality but gets 3 Stars because it came with no instructions.  Have used it only twice.  Read nearly all the reviews for this product before purchasing so was aware there might be some pain involved with the Derma Roller procedure.  I have a high tolerance for pain so rolled without numbing the skin.  I was able to do it but not comfortably or at the level of abrasion that I believe would be necessary to do any good.  Plus there are several areas on the face (the bony areas) that are particularly painful.  As a result I dreaded rolling the second time. So my recommendation is to start off by numbing the face with Lidocaine or another product before derma rolling the first time.</li>
    <li> Are all you people stupid or what? 1.0 mm are not for home care microroller. 1.0 mm are for physicians use only. Home care microroller a are suppose to be .25 mm then for esthetician use its .50 and .75. No wonder a lot of you are screwing up your skin because it&#x27;s not for home care and you don&#x27;t know how to use it properly.</li>
    <li> Good but I think the needle are little dull so I think it  doesn&#x27;t make me feel painful so much than I expected, it&#x27;s good though, I&#x27;m a bit suspicious that its needles pierce my skin enough or not.</li>
    <li> No surprise.  It&#x27;s not fun, but I clean my face, roll this as explained then follow it with vitamin c serum and rosehip oil.  Only use it maybe 4 or so times a month and the facialists say to &amp;#34;keep doing what I&#x27;m doing&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. I am not sure how I got million pimples on my face after using it. I had only one blackhead may be.. I used 99% alcohol  to disinfect every single time but..</li>
    <li> Derma Rollers work if you follow the directions.  This one has the shorter 0.5mm pins so its primary use would probably be for the face.  If you have scars or stretch marks elsewhere, a 1.0mm roller might be a better choice if this one doesn&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should go without saying but this is a personal device like a toothbrush.  You don&#x27;t share it and need to sterilize it in alcohol in-between uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now .. Not sure yet still I&#x27;m a instant gratification person and I know that&#x27;s bad so I&#x27;m going to keep it up. Does not hurt at all!!</li>
    <li> this product is just as good as the expensive ones!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this every other day for 2 weeks, and haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. hopefully soon! Will come back and do more reviews.</li>
    <li> I use this all over my face, back of hands and some scars.  I notice immediately better absorption of skin products.  My skin tone has already improved.  Wrinkles and scars still need work but haven&#x27;t been using product for very long.  It really gives my face a nice glow and I definitely think I look a lot healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will update this review when I have been using it for longer. All in all, a great product, nice quality and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but pay attention to needle thickness.  This one says &amp;#34;medical use&amp;#34;, so if you&#x27;re worried they do apparently come in different sizes.  I wash my face w/ warm water, then use this product, then apply vit c serum, then thick moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a month ago and the results are already amazing.  My skin is softer, my facial lines are smaller, and I am so impressed.  I use it about every 4-5 days, on my face, chest, and hands.  I am 44 and live in FL so I have some sun damage and sun spots.  The Derma Roller has already shown so much improvement in these things..I am putting off getting Botox indefinitely.  Not sure I will ever need it now that I use this regularly.  I love this product!!</li>
    <li> As you are only suppose to micro needle once every 5-6 weeks, I have only used once so far.  It worked as I expected.  The product is nice and I am happy.  I did not give it 5 stars just because it has not been long enough for me to truly evaluate it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product recently and used it for the first time Friday night however I DID NOT use it properly. Silly me. The instructions are not great, it says roll on skin in a downward, horizontal and diagonal motion 10 times over the skin area. I did this but lifted the roller every time I rolled my face. BIG mistake! My face not only became extremely irritated but my nasal labial folds (the area I am interested in treating the most)  became severely  inflamed, it was downright painful to say the very least. So In order to prevent an infection I had to use Neosporin over the areas I stabbed my face and was forced to stay home all weekend. Tylenol was my dearest friend I was in some serious pain not to mention the lines around my mouth looked 10&#x27;x worse. UGH!    As of right now I am still  sore and I have serious peeling all around my mouth.  Not the first time experience I was looking forward to, however this was entirely my fault. I should have looked for tutorials on youtube BEFORE I tried this product which can cause some serious damage to the skin if not done properly. So if you plan on buying this please make sure you know what you are doing!    I do plan on trying the derma roller once again, since I purchased the Doctor Oz vitamin C serum., I will also update this review and share my results with all of you.      *UPDATE:**    I cannot recommend this product unfortunately I did not get the results I expected. After watching a couple of tutorials I felt confident to try it again and although the pain wasn&#x27;t as bad as my fist experience it still left my face swollen and bruised every time I used it. After about 6 weeks (once a week)  and getting little to no results I decided to toss it. Not worth the pain ! My skin is just way too sensitive. On the other hand I can only speak for myself so I am NOT saying that the product does not work overall , it just didn&#x27;t work for ME. I do however highly recommend Dr. Oz Vitamin C serum which I have used for over 7weeks and my nasal labial folds are literally gone and my skin has never looked better! If you are skeptical to try the roller skip it and go straight for the serum.    Cheers!</li>
    <li> If you take a picture or look at the &#x27;needles&#x27; under a magnifying glass,  you will realise that they are actually small knives instead of needles. Needles are circular; these have 2 sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 but i will not be using them on my face at all. I wish i could post pictures of my dermarollers.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Believe all the hype.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt. Not sure if it works yet. Still working on it.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this consistently (not because of the product) but when I did I noticed my skin looked firmer.  Seller is very good to work with so please don&#x27;t hesitate to try it.</li>
    <li> It was well packaged when it arrived.  I use it once a week for about 7 weeks now.  It was a bit scary when I first started, but it was ok after a couple of times.  It does sting a little and my face does get red afterwards.  I decided to try this derma roller to improve my skin tone, maybe to help lighten my age spots, but so far no improvement on age spots, but it seems to help with tightening my skin.</li>
    <li> New to this device.  Feels good some places; causes tingling, even irritation other places.  Can leave minor cuts without any extra pressure.  I am combining with Vitamin C serum and other topical creams.  I hope to see healthier skin soon...</li>
    <li> have only had for a couple of weeks.  Have used and it appears to making a difference.  Hoping it continues though.  Can be annoying to do each night (it doesnt hurt -but doesnt feel great either).</li>
    <li> I ordered this due to a recommendation of a friend.  She was correct, it is amazing.  I just started using it about a week ago so I am sure it will continue to work.</li>
    <li> My ONLY complaint is that there was nothing in the box explaining how often to use the derma roller. I had to use several websites to come up with an answer. Otherwise, I saw an immediate change in the tone and texture of my skin. I belie this was due to the fact the products can better absorb into my skin the first few days after using the derma roller.</li>
    <li> Purchased one on a whim. Got alcohol and Loreal Men&#x27;s anti wrinkle cream. I am am ironworker who spent everyday in the sun and heat and icy cold winters. I washed my fave then used the roller as directed. Then applied the cream and as I applied the cream tons of dead skin cells just kept peeling off.  Yes I had a a few hours of redness but now I use it every two weeks and I can see a huge difference. Even teenage acne scars are fading</li>
    <li> Derma Roller is horrible, buyer beware!  It arrived on time.  It started out okay but man by the time my wedding came around I had mounds, of zits all over my face, thank goodness for photoshop!</li>
    <li> Wow, does this ever work.  A little nervous at first, but now it has become my daily routine.  Skin is more supple and firm.  Takes a little while to see the results, and a little pinching at first,  but it out weighs any creams with absolute results!</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected, but I liked the fact that it&#x27;s made of titanium.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week for my stretch marks and it seems to be blurring them out. I use it with 100% natural Shea butter from Africa instead of hydrauluronic acid.I think these things take time so be patient. The effect isn&#x27;t huge but it&#x27;s noticeable and that&#x27;s enough for me. (It kinda hurts though) and beware of an infection!</li>
    <li> I only recently started using the product so i can&#x27;t speak for long term use, but for the few times that i use it, i felt like it gave a lot of color to my face. I can say that some of my acne scaring is evening itself out, and right after i use it feels like my face got a sunburn, but i use an oil free moisturizer. I&#x27;m also using this product for the stretch marks on my stomach and although i haven&#x27;t seen the results yet, i am using it with confidence and i feel it is making a positive difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once a week for two weeks,haven&#x27;t see the result yet. But I like the idea and believe it will help my scar,also it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Seems daunting at first, but easy to use.Never caused any pain or bleeding, and definitely helping with circulation, and bringing rosy color to face after only one and a half weeks.</li>
    <li> it looks nice, and very convenient to use. No problem during the using, highly recommand.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product because I have box scars as well as ice pick scaring;therefore, I am wondering if I use a dermaroler will it develop more keloids..thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used dermal rollers before, and generally stick to the cheapest versions since I replace them after 3 months use (I&#x27;m a slight bacteria-phobe, even after dousing these with alcohol after every use).  The Dermal Roller SGF is by far my favorite version!  No sticking or pulling and it&#x27;s super comfortable to reposition (and the 1.0mm length really isn&#x27;t painful for me).  Love love love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermal rollers in general:  I was skeptical that puncturing my face repeatedly with needles would lead to noticeable improvements, but 2+ years of use has made me a firm believer.  Fantastic results in clarity and texture!  I generally try to roll 2x a week, and that seems to be enough to maintain impressive results.  I occasionally fall out of habit, but as soon as I hop back on, am continually amazed to look as if I&#x27;ve spent a long weekend receiving ridiculously expensive facials at a BevHills spa.</li>
    <li> Love this little medieval face roller!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement whatsoever. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Needles are dull. Does not roll smooth. I am not sure it is titanium.</li>
    <li> I was previously using a .3mm dermaroller and liked it but have moved to the 1.0mm.  I use it about every 4 days and I&#x27;m finding that my skin is flaking and then it begins to have a softer appearance where the deep wrinkles were.  This is an ongoing process for me as I&#x27;ve had many surgeries (every year) and the anesthesia has wreaked havoc on my face and hair.  I am determined to continue using a dermaroller as I believe it will continue to soften these wrinkles.  I am going to be 57 soon and this is about the only treatment I&#x27;ve found that - if done consistently - is very helpful.</li>
    <li> This product IS AS DESCRIBED. But because of the conflicting information on how often to use the product, I can&#x27;t say that it works. I can&#x27;t find photos of actual wrinkle reduction that haven&#x27;t been retouched. Other photos show a dramatic result, then to find the caption reads &amp;#34;laser resurfacing/Botox/Juvederm. Some websites say to use it every day/other day. Others say ONLY EVERY 4 WEEKS-otherwise the natural healing/collagen production process is always being interrupted and the skin is a constant state of irritation.  Another pretty reputable website says they are a gimmick and can cause much more damage than help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it twice, going with the every 4 week recommendation. It does not hurt at all. So far no results. Until I get some clear information and factual results for wrinkle reduction this is all I can report.</li>
    <li> Like it, but hard to use.</li>
    <li> I Loved this!! My pores felt so open after using this!!</li>
    <li> Been using this for 2+ months- see no difference</li>
    <li> Love this! I noticed for true results, I need to use it consistently. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great seller and product.  I am still in the midst of results but, so far so good.</li>
    <li> Good product i like it.</li>
    <li> Immediately after using this on my back and face, I had doubts about whether or not it actually did anything besides give me a tomato face! My face was red and my back stung, but two days later i noticed the acne on both my back and my face had significantly cleared. I would recommend this product, but I would not recommend using it often on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am 47 and bought this hoping to improve my skin&#x27;s texture which has some minor wrinkling and drying. Instead, it actually caused visible little blood vessels to come to the surface of my skin that will not go away!  Instead of just looking old, I now have to wear foundation to cover up the blood vessels! Hideous product - I cannot believe I fell for this hype!</li>
    <li> It was a HUGE waste of money because I could not use the product. It looked like it was used. There was caked on dirt under the needle roll and on the handle. Very upset I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> Came in timly fashion. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference but my face has improved maybe slightly. I think i need to use it a little longer to know how effective it really is. I&#x27;m hoping that I&#x27;m using it right. I don&#x27;t want to push to hard and yet not enough either so not totally sure about that but I&#x27;ll keep trying it out.</li>
    <li> This item dosn&#x27;t do anything at all i been trying  for over 1 month no result.</li>
    <li> The sensation from this is like nothing ive ever felt. Its too soon to comment on the surface effects on my face, but it feels envigorating none the less. Amazingly, childhood scars i thought would be permenent have nearly dissapeared over night. I did apply extra pressure which lead to some painless, momentary bleeding so be cautious. Personally, more needles would suit me better because im a guy. It seems pretty good quality so far and Im optimistic to see the full possibilities of this neat little thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it three times and already see an improvement in my skin texture. The most visible acne scars are still there but there has been a change for the better with the enlarged pores. I&#x27;m not where I want to be yet. I&#x27;ve been rolling \\&quot;gently\\&quot; ( have not sern blood yet or felt unbearable pain). I rather go slowly and see gradual results.</li>
    <li> Not a lot to say.  Have to wait months to see if it actually works but it feels good.  Sounds weird but it does.</li>
    <li> I have used this about 8 times (once every other week or so).  While I do notice a difference after using it, I am not pleased with the quality of this particular product.  The last time I used it, I felt like it was pulling on my skin at some points.  Upon closer inspection, I saw some of the needles are bent.  Keep in mind I haven&#x27;t&#x27; used it that much and I don&#x27;t press that hard on my skin because I haven&#x27;t built up a pain tolerance yet.  I don&#x27;t plan on using this particular roller anymore, so I am on the market again for something with a little more quality.</li>
    <li> Love this Derma Roller!!!  I have only used it for a couple of weeks and I have really noticed a difference already!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Derma Roller for about 10 days, off and on. I have unsightly scars on the calf of my leg due to hair follicle infection (folliculitis) caused by a tough common bacteria, Staphlococcus Aureus. It&#x27;s been embarrassing to wear short pants in public. So I am giving the Roller a try. I read all of the instructions carefully, as well as most of the comments. I remember hearing about using needles to prick a scar to help heal it many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The first day, I cleaned the area with soap and water, and used the Roller. I used too much pressure, and it irritated my skin, but I did apply creams I bought on Amazon: Derma-e (a really nice cream); DermaRESTORE -scar cream;  and Homeopathic Scar Cream. I waited a couple of days for the irritation and redness to subside, then I tried it again, using the Roller with less pressure. I also applied the scar cream FIRST, thinking that the Roller would help the cream to penetrate into the scar. I followed up with Derma-e, for the antiseptic and vit-E healing value. Since then, it&#x27;s going well. I know that it&#x27;s too early to notice a difference. I am planning on a six-month usage period, and I know that healing scars takes time, especially in a 54 year old. But I honestly believe that the scars do not look quite as dark and defined as they were. I think that today, I&#x27;m taking a cell phone picture of the area, so that I can compare it later, post-treatment. But the roller itself is fine. I clean it after each use running it under hot water for a couple of minutes with a dab of soap (although the instructions do suggest alcohol to disinfect.)  At least, nothing is worse, and maybe even better.</li>
    <li> I have been using derma roller for 3 times already , once a week and I can tell this works great for my skin and I see great improvement in on my skin tone and texture, great product I will highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping my hypopigmentation gradually. Has definitely improved texture of skin overall.</li>
    <li> Worked just as good as the other one that cost $10 more :) just buy this, it&#x27;s the same.</li>
    <li> It seemed to smooth the uneven skin where I had scarring pretty fast (maybe about 3 days after I started using the roller; I use the roller at night before bed).  However, the darkness of the scar is decreasing but still present even after about 4 weeks of using the product.  If nothing else my complexion is looking better - I still use cover up on the scarring but I feel much less self conscious of the scars that I do have.</li>
    <li> I was scared so started on my legs, just to see what it would be like. After a couple of days and&lt;br /&gt;it was no big scary deal, I tried it on my face. Seems to be not a big deal...not scary at all. Seems&lt;br /&gt;to be minimizing my wrinkles and scars a little. Probably too early to tell after only a few days, but&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s doing something.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product about 3 times now. I am waiting for the healing inbetween the treatments but I can already see the difference in my skin. Who knew that acne scarring could be helped with using a device at home! Thanks so much</li>
    <li> This thing is a Scam , it Doesn&#x60;t work at all . all the positive videos and doctors recommendation are fake , I believe they got paid to do that ! I have been using it for two months on my acne scars , there&#x60;s 0% Improvement .</li>
    <li> So great!!! It took a minute to get used to, but after that, WOW! My skin looks more radiant than it did before and it seems to be firmer. If you have the means, I suggest investing in a Derma Roller.</li>
    <li> I love my Derma Roller!!! Great quality, convenient travel case and easy to use. Little discomfort and really does brighten your complexion. I have  a few dark spots from tanning and have used the derma roller three times a week for two weeks now. I have received compliments on my skin - where people just comment on how bright my face is. Better than a facial and so easy to use. I recommend this to everyone trying to achieve a nice complexion without having to spend thousands on fillers or a face lift.</li>
    <li> I like it.The result is super!</li>
    <li> love it i use it every night</li>
    <li> I have found this tool to be fantastic.  I use it 2 -3 times a week followed by a product with retinol or Vitamin e and moisturizer.  The lines above my lip are fading, my skin looks better and better.  My husband even noticed! Not a quick fix but in my mind it is the best way by using my own skin to heal. So much better than gobs of chemicals.  I highly recommend.  Another note is that this company has followed up with me and answered any questions promptly which is another plus!  Win win!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother, and she was very impressed with it.  Naturally, there was the initial discomfort from using it, but once she got past that, it worked very well.</li>
    <li> Its working wonderfully. Ive noticed a big difference in the effectiveness of my serums after using the roller.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for couple of weeks now and I am impressed. It works well on my sensitive acne prone skin type. Already see great results. Thumbs-up !!</li>
    <li> Skin became clear from past sun damage and lines have diminished. I&#x27;m a guy so this was what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I purchased the derma roller because I have very bad acne scarring and am getting lines! Ahhhhhh... old age is creeping up on me! I am almost 57 and had really given up hope of ever having nicer looking skin because bad skin runs in my family. After using this once a day for about 3 weeks, I have really noticed a difference. The scarring seems to be lessening and my face is now smooth to the touch. I&#x27;ve also been using it on my neck, right under my chin and I believe it&#x27;s plumped a little so the wrinkle onset isn&#x27;t so noticeable now. I follow up with hyaluronic acid serum, and wow! I am impressed. Will try it on my legs next!</li>
    <li> Fantastic item.  It really works.  I add a serum afterwords.  I totally recomend the derma roller!</li>
    <li> Anyone that is hesitant to try this at home should not be  this is a quality product and it really does what it says. You can \\&quot;over do\\&quot; it but if you approach this like any other skin care regiment - with moderation in mind, you will like it! Happy rolling!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Needle sharp, stopping packed. There is a case for storage. Arodavets very attentive. Use a little time, I hope for a good effect. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product like this and I decided to try it based on the other reviews. It is easy to use and is slightly irritating to the skin, but not painful. I think it definitely allows your skin products to penetrate into the skin better. The redness goes away within a couple hours and while I didn&#x27;t have any major skin issues to begin with, my facial skin seems smoother and tighter after about a dozen uses over an eight week period so far.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> When I first used it the pain was horrible but after time I&#x27;m used to it. I have noticed that my pores aren&#x27;t as large but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my acne but will try it again once my hormones/acne are more stable.</li>
    <li> It feels good until now hope for good results in the future !!</li>
    <li> This is a great derma roller.  It glides well over your skin.  I&#x27;m still waiting to see full results, but in the few months I have used it, my skin texture is better than it ever has been.  I like that my serums feel like they soak right into my skin after using the roller.  I just use it once a month.  I wish they gave you a guide as to how often you should use it to get the best results.  There is a lot of mixed info online about the timing.  So I decided to go on the safe side of once a month.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for only about two weeks now and see a slight reduction in scarring on my cheeks already! You get used to the feeling of the needles--it isn&#x27;t painful at all, just a little &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; feeling. I also see a reduction with the size of my pores and it has been making my skin much softer. I use it everywhere except around the eye area, I have been even using it on my lips and my lips look much more supple. I expect/hope to see an even bigger improvement with my skin as I continue using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Shipping perfect.</li>
    <li> this is nice, it works</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER, AND SHE TELLS ME IT HAS AND IS WORKING WODERS FOR HER SKIN,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS . I AM GLAD I BOUGHT IT FOR HER.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare this roller to other than expectations based on other Amazon.com reviews. I followed the instructions included with the roller (there was also a case included in the package), and have used the roller 4 times so far over the course of 2 months. I assiduously cleaned the roller before and after I used it, keeping in mind that I was essentially puncturing my skin hundreds of times with these itty bitty needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I did not enjoy the process of using the roller--it was uncomfortable having my face pricked over and over, and a little painful when I rolled a bit too deeply. The first time I tried the roller, I followed my usual skin care regime with toner and moisturizer. Ouch! The toner was a very bad idea. The following 3 times I just rinsed my face with tap water and applied moisturizer. My skin did look pretty good two days following the procedure (actually got compliments on my skin by a neighbor), but by the time I got around to rolling again a couple of weeks later, I looked the way I normally do... kind of old and saggy, like any other 40+ year old lady who eschews the siren calls of plastic surgery and laser treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to that one little compliment, I will keep using the roller--though perhaps on a weekly rather than bi-weekly basis.</li>
    <li> This roller is a dream! I haven&#x27;t got continued use out of it yet but the quality is awesome. The directions are very clear and I love the case that it came with. I believe this product will last a long time with continued uses on multiple areas of my skin! I&#x27;m anxious to see all the possibilities of skin improvement with this roller! Recommended!</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail a few days ago but have yet to try it. It&#x27;s a little scary and intimidating looking, and I have very sensitive skin. I read the good reviews and have read about the many benefits online so I will come back to update this once I give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;It did come in a nice case to keep it clean and sanitary.</li>
    <li> I heard some recommendation for derma roller and decided to give it a try. It only my first use of it so I really can&#x27;t tell. But so far so good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of fun, rolling teensy little needles across my skin.  But it&#x27;s not very practical.  I&#x27;m supposed to clean it between uses, roll it all over, use it regularly...  This all happened for maybe a month.  Then life called, and I had better things to do.  I might pull it out again for kicks, but not for a regular part of my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Absolutely obsessed with rolling now! After my first use I can totally feel a difference. My skin has never felt this tight before. I was scared of doing this because I didn&#x27;t like the idea of tiny holes in my face that could allow bacteria to get in and cause breakouts right after you do it, but as long as you are extremely sanitary I think this is the best tool ever. I alcohol my hands before touching it, wash and then alcohol my face before rolling, soak the head in alcohol before rolling, roll, then alcohol my face again before applying Vitamin C serum all over. I have cotton pads with the Vitamin C and alcohol all set to go before so I don&#x27;t contaminate my face prior to applying them.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend doing this at night so your skin can recover before applying any makeup. After my first use the next day I put makeup on and couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and tight the application looked. It looked like I airbrushed my face because my skin was so much tighter and pores so much smaller than before.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was sensitive for the next two days, it just felt like a mild sunburn, nothing horrible. The actual rolling process didn&#x27;t hurt too badly, maybe just a little under my eyes and by the nose. The whole theory of &amp;#34;injuring&amp;#34; your face so it produces more collagen makes 100% sense.</li>
    <li> I have this Derma roller for about 3 weeks and I can see some improvement on my face, but I think I will need the 1.5 mm from now on. I will recommended this 1.00mm for the first 3 or 5 times to start, them get the 1.5 mm. I use to improve my face of acne scars.</li>
    <li> Wow what a difference, but you can&#x27;t press too hard and you shouldn&#x27;t use it every day.  I saw an article where Jennifer Anniston is using the same or a similar product.  It works!  I will use this for a long time!</li>
    <li> I recently started using the roller &amp; I am currently undecided. My main complaint is that the roller doesn&#x27;t roll smoothly. It hesitates during rolling, like it&#x27;s catching on something which makes it awkward to use. Too soon to review how my skin will react to this treatment.</li>
    <li> First of all its is painful to use and second of all, I developed a huge rash after using it. Would not recommend it all.</li>
    <li> It was my first time buying a dermaroller and I am not sure I made the right choice, I had a lot of expectations about this product and have researched a lot, my roller has a couple of uneven needles and event though I have not had one before, Im pretty sure its not supposed to be that way, I don&#x27;t feel confortable using it. I had already order another roller of another brand to see how that goes.</li>
    <li> works well, really stimulates without being harsh</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love!  I use it very gently and feel &#x27;Alive&#x27; for a couple of hours after.  I&#x27;ve never turned red or irritated.  I use it under my eyes and it seems to make the bags go away faster.  Of course it&#x27;s a very very gentle application there.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it yet, but so far I am attaining a little bit of the result I want. Just be cautious at first to learn how your skin reacts to it.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great way to get rid of stretch marks. But here&#x27;s the thing. You need to use it OFTEN. you cannot use it for a month and then stop using it. The color of the stretch marks will come back and be the same. I can usually endure pain, I have many tattoos, but this is seriously a different thing. You can&#x27;t just lightly use it, you have to slightly press for it to work. After a while, it really does become painful.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without it. I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin be careful. I recommend looking for tutorials on how to use this product correctly before use and properly clean afer each use. I haven&#x27;t seen results yet have only been using for a week.</li>
    <li> I have been working with computers for all my life and developed very bad habit making faces during work. I am over 50 and my forehead was my shame. Tried to cover with hair. It was so bad that I thought I have nothing to loose and ordered 2 rollers. I am doing twice a week for a month. I have very sensitive skin so the procedure is painful for me but anyway, I am doing it. Results are incredible. I can not believe what I see in a mirror. No, wrinkles still there but they are not so deep (I had reeeealy deep ones). I will keep rolling as long as it takes as it works for me, not only against wrinkles but skin tone of my face looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It will make your skin dry so be prepared with good moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I have used this Micro Needle Roller twice.  I am just taking it from the other people that have reviewed this item that over time, it will work.  Sort of uncomfortable using it but not really bad.  You can control how much pressure you use with this.</li>
    <li> Does miracles for my skin!!</li>
    <li> First of all, my skin is perfect. Just purchased this item because I am addictive to amazon and all products that I don&#x27;t need. Anyway, first time use was fine. Face was red and peel later during the week. I made sure to moisturized my skin and stay out of direct sunlight. Second time use, not so good. I applied more pressure and I end up scratching the right side of my face. My face burned for two days (due to sweat, I live in Texas) Once the burning went away, it started to peel but the scratches left created blemishes. So now my perfect skin isn&#x27;t so perfect anymore. (That was 2 months ago) The blemishes have lighten up but I can still see them on my cheek. Needless to say, the second time was the last time that little devil wheel touch my face. It is now resting with the rest of my impulsive buys.</li>
    <li> This has helped to heal a lot of scars and also alleviate the urge to pick at certain areas. This is by far the best solution I&#x27;ve found yet for compulsive skin picking.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve used this only 4 times in about a 2 month period but can already see a noticeable difference in my complexion and texture of skin. Will continue to use for further improvements.</li>
    <li> I started out using a .5mm roller, then moved up to this one.  The .5 was very light, but it did help.  I have been using this 1mm roller for only a couple of weeks, but I can already see a difference in my complexion.  I follow it with vitamin C serum in hopes that the serum will be absorbed better after derma-rolling.  I am very gentle with my skin, and the needles don&#x27;t hurt my face, but I definitely would NOT recommend using anything any heavier without a doctor&#x27;s supervision.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she said she loves it.</li>
    <li> I like it. I use it Frequently and have noticed a big difference so far. It&#x27;s not to shabby at all !! Have already recommended to people I know!</li>
    <li> I am learning how to use this without using it to much. I don&#x27;t want to over due and get opposite results. So far I am happy but it only been a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I received the product dented, but I decided to give it a try anyways. The needles weren&#x27;t sharp at all! I saw many videos on youtube and many consumers said that the needles slightly enter the skin but this one didn&#x27;t at all. It felt like many forks poking my face, and if that&#x27;s the case I might as well go to my kitchen and get a fork to do a better job.</li>
    <li> This device caused hyper pigmentation on both of my cheeks. I have dark spots that I&#x27;ve had a few weeks and they&#x27;re not showing any signs of going away!  I never had discoloration of the skin on my face before so I&#x27;m really very upset. Be very careful! Buyer beware!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the derma roller for about 3 weeks now , the only reason I am giving a 4 stars because I am not seeing any results on my stretch marks, my pores and on my scar. However, I am seeing little hair growing back on my hairline. Yay!!!!! I am keeping my fingers crossed for it to work on everything else as well. I will post it back once I start seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to everyone out there who is looking to purchase a derma roller. I think it&#x27;s worth trying it because you&#x27;ll never know unless you try them.</li>
    <li> This is an upgrade from a shorter needle length one I started out with and it&#x27;s been working well so far.</li>
    <li> I should review this later. Just started using it. I am not sure how often I should use it. Some reviewers use it every two to three day and some say we should only use it once a month for optimum collagen promotion. What&#x27;s a girl to do? Am I negating the collagen growth by using it once or twice a week?? For someone who wants instant gratification, this is a big question. The instructions are fairly vague. I do have high hopes.</li>
    <li> I have only been using 10 days and am beginning to see results. Will report back again in 30 days for updates</li>
    <li> this really does help with acne scarring, but man is it painful.  Anyhow, the roller has lasted me awhile, and I still do not feel that I need to replace it yet (I ordered it almost a year ago). I use it about every 3 weeks to once a month.  It is nicely made and quality materials.  Doesnt feel like a cheap piece of crap like some of the ones out there in this price range.</li>
    <li> Definitely noticed a difference. I&#x27;m 36.  I walked into my sons school and a parent said , &amp;#34;you look like you can go to school here!&amp;#34;  BIG SMILES!  I use it about twice a week and put eminence 8 greens serum and moisturizer on afterwards.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very unique and do what it says it does. Wish they weren&#x27;t currently out of stock or I would get one for my mom for mother&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m slowly seeing results I only have been doing it twice a week &amp; slowly seeing results. I&#x27;m going to start doing it more although my skin turns really red and burns. The needles are not that bad and really don&#x27;t hurt it&#x27;s the after effect.</li>
    <li> Surprising, then you get use too, it give you a beautiful skin, Use it with Collagen, I recommand that product</li>
    <li> It refreshs my skin and it seems like my skin is shading ,it hurts a little at first but you get use to it ,my face feels more firm and I dont look so sagy.</li>
    <li> I received the Derma Roller as as gift and I absolutely love it! It has been very effective and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received the Derma Roller as a gift. The Derma Roller works wonderfully in stimulating the tissues in my face, especially around the eyes. I can sense a tightening of my skin and an overall healthier look and feel to my skin. I am anxious to see the benefits in reducing age marks and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have keloid scars in a couple places after having a breast reduction. I&#x27;d heard that a derma roller can help with that, so I bought this and started using it. It&#x27;s definitely helping to flatten them out, which is amazing, but after a while I stop seeing progress in some areas, which may mean that I need to get a version with longer needles. I use A&amp;D ointment afterwards, I figured that if it&#x27;s good for healing tattoos, then it&#x27;s probably good for nourishing my skin after using my dermaroller, too.</li>
    <li> Had for nearly three weeks. I use once weekly. It really is a quick way to fade my horrible embarrasing cystic acne scars. Im starting to see the prettiest skin ive seen in my life! Btw ive had cystic acne for 5 long years so if this roller fades 5 years of scars in weeks then I caught myself a deal!</li>
    <li> Improved my skin within 2 weeks</li>
    <li> after 3 times all my sceen repaired it self about 70 %&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with it :-)</li>
    <li> Already gave the review</li>
    <li> i followed a review with simple instructions and my skin with scars from adult onset acne has improved in a week.</li>
    <li> This derma roller is a God sent product for anyone suffering from stubborn acne scarring. I&#x27;ve had moderate (to sometimes severe cystic) acne for around 12 years. I have tried every potion, cream and lotion to get rid of acne and the horrible scarring. I have both red marks, as well as pits. I saw immediate results from my derma roller the next day. After around 6-7 sessions, I&#x27;m in total awe. This derma roller did more for me in 2 weeks than 4-6 months on heavy duty glycolic cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously incredible product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Derma Roller with 2 day shipping and it arrived right on time. The roller came in a very nice box with the instructions on it. In the box, it was stored in the sturdy see-through plastic box.  There was no damage or scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the roller for a friend of mine.  She used it right away and told me that it was so easy to use, that she felt her skin tighten up immediately after using it and that the skin looked so healthy.  I am so glad that I bought this for her.</li>
    <li> i had really good hopes for this products instead of getting rid of my stretch marks it darkened the area , do not buy</li>
    <li> This is crazy good beauty fun that&#x27;s simple, and it works!  It feels like pins and needles running across your skin...not a sensation you love, but entirely tolerable for the results.  I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now.  I use it almost every day, in spite of the many opinions on frequency.  The dermatology focused companies seem to usually recommend frequent use for the first 2-3 months, then cut down to once a week.  What I notice is glowing skin, and much greater absorption capacity of the skin.  Makes sense, because you actually are punching tiny holes in it!  Anyway, skin products obviously have more action (you will see the difference!) when used in combination with this product.  It was enthusiastically recommended to me, and I have, and will continue to recommend it to others.  One more thing, I use it (gently!) on my eyelids and on my neck.  I pretty much have to dance about while doing these areas because they are delicate and sensitive, and sometimes I press too hard and end up looking like I have an odd rash, but it has had great results on my eyelid skin especially.  I use it in combination with OZ Naturals vit C serum and my lids look younger every day!  PS, I&#x27;m 44 years old (and I have a 1 year old).  Try this, I think you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I did not get the results that I expected from this product.  It is very easy to use.  It does hurt a little but nothing that you should not expect rolling needles over your face.  I would not recommend this product; however, every one is different and it is one of those trial and error type of things.  Others received results, I just wasn&#x27;t one of them.  It is made from high quality materials the needles anyway.  It did make a squeaky sound when I was rolling it over my face, but that comes from the plastic used. It did leave my face red but again you are running tiny needles over your face so this should be expected.</li>
    <li> As far as the product is concerned, it&#x27;s sturdy, well put together, etc. That&#x27;s not why it receives a low rating. I would not recommend it because it&#x27;s a concept that is highly dangerous. Allowing skin to regenerate itself by producing collagen as a result of &#x27;damaging&#x27;, or pricking in this case, the skin, mostly face, is the latest hot procedure within the esthetician/med spa community. Yes, I&#x27;ve had it done, but the point is they are trained practitioners using a sterile safe device AND have to numb your skin prior to use. Nerve endings are more exposed through thin skin or skin that doesn&#x27;t have a fat layer like forehead. Putting this product in the hands of the layman is inviting trouble and possible permanent damage. Is this product cheaper....by leaps and bounds. Does it come with proper instruction.....yes, very well explained. Should anyone not trained use it.....absolutely not.</li>
    <li> If You Have A Metal Allergy Do NOT buy!</li>
    <li> This product is simply AMAZING!!!!! it tones your skin and allows your product(s) to absorb and penetrate deeply into the skin. I have been using this product for 2 weeks and my skin is flawless. The dark pigmentation spots are 98% gone, which normally takes over 3 months to disappear. Also the customer service is simply exceptional!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and works well, people comment all the time how nice my skin looks.</li>
    <li> It is very uncomfortable to use so nothing past maybe 10 seconds and no pressure used at all is where it ended, I moisturized my face afterwards and all seemed ok until the next day, I had several raised red bumps everywhere! It looked like I had either severe acne or my face was covered in poison ivy, it looked horrible! Thankfully there was no pain at and no itching but looking at it someone would assume it would be painful. As I did my research on this reaction I found a few other people using google search that experienced the same and it passed within a few days. I used with hazel, used coconut oil to moisturize and 3 days later it is almost all gone . I will not be using this ever again because I couldn&#x27;t have been easier with it than what I was so this is just clearly not for me and my skin type.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and making my skin smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> I have used the scientia derma roller and really liked it. I thought that I would try a different one to see if a cheaper kind would work. Because the scientia one is quite expensive. So I gave this one a try. I am not impressed. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all. It is worth the money to buy something that works. If anyone knows of a different derma roller that actually works please let me know.</li>
    <li> Very happy with Derma Roller! Quick delivery and good quality!</li>
    <li> Not sure it works or maybe I am doing something wrong. Can be sensitive to the &#x27;needles&#x27; so it takes a gentle roll.  I will keep trying it though to see what I think over more time.</li>
    <li> I love it! Only about a month of use, and I&#x27;m a least noticing a difference with the tiny holes on my cheeks from past acne. I recommend that you do use an oil free lotion afterwards. Specifically one with Vitamin E. It helps the process :)</li>
    <li> The roller works great. It arrived on time, works as expected and I am excited to see some results. My skin feels more &amp;#34;alive.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Doen&#x27;t do much, poses infectious risk.  I tossed mine after two uses because I just couldn&#x27;t find the data/science to back it and I wasn&#x27;t seeing anything on my stretch marks</li>
    <li> The product details on the web site didn&#x27;t mention that it can&#x27;t be used on skin with certain conditions.  Frankly, I was afraid to use it.  I didn&#x27;t try it or open it, but I would be leary to use this on my face.</li>
    <li> This product is a great find. After years and years of putting lotion on it was not doing its purpose. Using the Derma Rolla it allows the lotion to penetrate the skin. I really like this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the derma roller for a week, so I can&#x27;t comment on any significant differences in my skin, but I think I have seen some small improvements. What I can comment on is that the company has very proactive customer service that seems genuinely interested in receiving feedback, which I definitely appreciate. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have heard that using this will improve the condition of the skin.  Looking forward finding out if this happens</li>
    <li> i got mine in the mail rather quickly and i have been using it for a little over a week now and the clarity and hyperpigmentation in my skin is already showing improvement, i was a little skeptical at first but i use it nightly and am very happy with the results so far. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I actually stumbled across this product by accident. My dermatologist had recommed a $300 laser treatment to remove some hyperpigmentation/minor acne scars. Add to this the fact that my face was still actively breaking out. I had tried everything - antibiotics, Retin A, and other prescription creams, etc. NOTHING worked. Finally, I ordered my dera roller and paired it with the Amara Organics Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, most nights of the week. So far, the results have been amazing! I am well pleased!  For once I don&#x27;t have to be embarrased over my skin!</li>
    <li> Please do it at night before bed if you can because it hurts and feels like burning.&lt;br /&gt;Also watch YouTube videos before actually doing it on your face.</li>
    <li> This is great thing. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Well this thing left lines in my skin for weeks and didn&#x27;t do the job. Not to mention the seller writes you 20x&#x27;s trying to coax you into leaving a good review in return for a 50% off on lotion. Well let me keep this short...it sucks and doesn&#x27;t do anything but damage your skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen results yet but I think that it will work over time, the company sends lots of emails on tips on the best results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the Derma Roller for a couple of weeks, but I can already tell that my skin is responding to it. It&#x27;s very smooth and the fine lines are going away. I roll my skin 3 times per week and use it along with the Rodan and Fields skin products. I&#x27;ll be purchasing one for my mother for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and I&#x27;ve yet to notice any difference in my skin.  I get facials once a month and I have two rollers different needles sizes and I have yet to see a difference.  I use retinol products on my skin and I often times use this twice a day morning and night since I work out of my home office.  No difference, but I&#x27;ll keep it up for another 2 months to make sure I&#x27;m getting the full effect.</li>
    <li> Still too early to tell if it&#x27;s working or not, but it definitely stimulates the skin and I have not had any irritation problems.  Good communication from the Cedars of Life folks, they are there and ready to help very quickly.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased, but I need to use more often</li>
    <li> I did a good bit of research before purchasing this derma roller. After reading all the reviews and such I decided to give it a try. Last year I was being treated for cystic acne and if any of you know anything about cystic acne then you will know that it leaves your skin damaged. Ice pick scarring galore. Now, I haven&#x27;t seen too many people review this product who have ice pick scars and that really made me doubtful that this will help. I have been using this product for a week now and I don&#x27;t know if its just wishful thinking or if change is really happening but I do feel like my acne scars are softening up. But it isn&#x27;t enough for others to really notice. My skin feels a little softer and I believe that my pores are less noticeable. Hopefully I can continue to receive results from using this.</li>
    <li> There is something similar to ink came from it when I cleaned it !!</li>
    <li> I was speaking with mother after a visit to the dermatologist, the visit was for consultation for $1,600.00 treatment that would help shrink my large pores. Recently, I have been so self conscious about the way my face has been looking lately that I am about to try  and pay anything to Look/Feel better.  My mothers had two concerns, my sensitive skin countering with abrasive treatment and the cost for each treatment, they did not guarantee the 3 treatments would be enough.&lt;br /&gt;Instead my mother suggested Derma Roller SGF and sent me direct link for purchase. I ordered and I am very happy already with my results. I have been using Derma Roller SGF faithfully twice a week for 4 weeks, this is just to start and see how my sensitive skin would react. I have already notice changes, my pores are looking smaller and my face has a radiant glow that I have never had before. I look forward to the future with Dera Roller SGF, Thank God for Mother!</li>
    <li> This work pretty good.</li>
    <li> When I use this I really do see a difference in my scars. I unfortunatly don&#x27;t use mine as often as I was planning on, but I think it does work if used regularily.</li>
    <li> Works well with Vit C oil</li>
    <li> It is of a sound quality, but I have only used it twice. The efficacy still remains to see.  Make sure you apply some serum afterwards especially for a facial treatment. And a sanitizing method is required pre- and post- treatment.</li>
    <li> I received a discounted sample of this product in return for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;The package is very sturdy and nicely done. The hard plastic case comes enclosed in a disposable surgical-type outer wrap. It is compact and would travel well in a suitcase or even a cosmetic bag. No concerns whatsoever about contamination or risk of damage in travel.&lt;br /&gt;The picture is so close-up that it makes this product look scarier than it actually is. That said, make no mistake, these are NEEDLES and they&#x27;re sharp. You do NOT want to press hard when rolling this thing over a delicate area like the face. However, the needles are close enough together that they&#x27;re not drawing blood. It is mildly irritating to treat the skin. I may be sensitive, but I could not touch my face with this without some level of stinging. But considering some of the other things I have applied to my face over the years, this is not worse than the sting of astringents or tightening masks. And unlike astringents, the sting of the derma roller stops the second you discontinue contact. It left no lingering sting or outward signs of irritation (like reddening).&lt;br /&gt;Results: The treated area of my face did feel softer immediately after application of roller plus serum, but I obviously didn&#x27;t see my scar disappear that quickly. I&#x27;m a little bit wimpy and not sure I would brave the mild discomfort regularly enough to obtain results, but then again, my scars are relatively unnoticeable to begin with. Someone who has more to gain might not find the minor irritation that much of a deterrent. If you really hate your scars, this would definitely be worth a try.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of a derma roller but heard thru a friend how they worked.  What a neat gadget!  When I first got it I&#x27;ll admit that looking at it was a little intimidating but it&#x27;s really super easy to use.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I had a couple of surgeries in 2010 which left some scars... This actually helped reduce the scaring! And it didn&#x27;t hurt! Ok - I&#x27;m afraid of needles... Don&#x27;t judge me!!!</li>
    <li> Derma roller very fine needles and works really well to get products beneath the skins surface. Good product . I recommend it .</li>
    <li> I have just started using this after reading about ten million reviews.  I like it and think it is having a positive effect.  I notice the wrinkles around my eyes are lessening.  It does hurt, but beauty is pain, right.  It&#x27;s not killing me, so must be making me better.  I will have to use longer to see about lasting results.</li>
    <li> I have acne scarring from adult onset cystic acne and some fine lines and wrinkles that I&#x27;d like to diminish/erase. When I first received the SGF Derma Roller it was a bit intimidating. First off, who pokes holes in their face? Secondly, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work and thirdly, I didn&#x27;t want to walk around with a reddened/scabby face. So, I did some research (mostly youtube) and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed at the results I&#x27;ve seen in just over 2 weeks! Astonishing... truly. I can&#x27;t speak for everyone but for myself, I&#x27;ve had amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;I use a Vitamin C, Vitamin A and Hyaluronic Acid serum immediately after followed by Origins Night-A-Mins. I&#x27;ve also used it every evening. It does make my skin red but it is fine by the AM. My family and friends have noticed a huge improvement in my skins overall appearance and it&#x27;s really nice when other ladies ask what I&#x27;m using to get such a beautiful complexion.&lt;br /&gt;My husband thought I was nuts &amp;#34;poking holes&amp;#34; in my face when I began, he doesn&#x27;t think so now.</li>
    <li> Derma Roller really makes your moisturizer many times better by absorbing deeper into skin tissue. I&#x27;m already seeing results after 1 week!</li>
    <li> I love this product,is simply amazing, I use it once a week and my face is firm and delicate, I deffeniyly recommend it to everyone. 😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times but it seems to be working pretty good on my forehead and laugh lines and my complexion seems to be evening out</li>
    <li> I am 65-years old and is true for most people, women and men, I have cellulite on my thighs.  I have tried the creams and nothing worked.  The SGF derma roller seems to be helping.  I have been using it for 2 and one-half weeks and, so far, I have noticed an improvement in my thighs.  I am realistic and expect my thighs to take longer to improve.  I had a &amp;#34;mini face-lift&amp;#34; 7 months ago so, I won&#x27;t be messing with the results of the lift for years.</li>
    <li> This implement does squeak a lot as it rolls over your skin, but that&#x27;s OK as much as it&#x27;s OK that it also stings a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Why OK?&lt;br /&gt;Because it actually regenerates the skin it bites.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my face now every other day over the past 6 weeks, and I see that some scars have softened and the texture of my cheeks and brow looks smoother. At this stage my entire countenance looks clean.&lt;br /&gt;...The SGF representative, Amanda, was very helpful and attentive; she gave direct and straightforward answers to my questions.&lt;br /&gt;My only peeve was that the company wanted me to review this product within a few days to a week after I&lt;br /&gt;started using it though they well know and have even stipulated that results from using the Derma Roller would not be noticeable for at least 6 weeks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and already have noticed a huge difference. My skin has a glow that it never had before! It gets my daily products that I use such as vitamin C and anti-wrinkle cream deeper into my skin for better results. Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Product review: I love this derma roller! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for it to rid my winkles too much.  However, when I wake up ( I roll before bed ), I see that my face looks plumper and it sorta glows, it&#x27;s really nice. My face does look younger! I like to put my face cream on after I roll, because it can soak deeper into my face. Can&#x27;t wait to see how my face will look the longer I use it! I&#x27;m keeping this a secret from my friends! Get your own secret tool to battle aging, it&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> The roller makes a very loud annoying squeaking noise during the rolling session.... I have only been using it for a week so not sure of any results just yet... Am considering returning due to the noise though.</li>
    <li> based on reviews , i bought it last month and so far, so good . i think , i see some change on my face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Derma Roller over the past two/three weeks and have enjoyed my results so far. My dermatologist had recommended the professional treatment which is why I first looked on Amazon because those will get really expensive really quickly. This device does hurt a bit while using it, I guess it&#x27;s more uncomfortable rather than pain. After your face will be red and will need time to calm down, I usually put a soothing lotion on it or one of my various acne medications so it can get deep down into my pores. I noticed immediately after one use how soft my skin felt. I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times since and each time am impressed with how my skin feel after the fact. I do not expect it to immediately get rid of my acne scars, but I have noticed that they&#x27;ve diminished a bit and I look forward to continuing to use this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this roller. It really helped my skin. I will continue to use and will purchase again when necessary.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I was a bit timid about applying too much pressure when I first used this product, and later was a bit too aggressive in the pressure application which made my face red for a day.  You just need to find that happy balance since the &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34; are definitely needles and will cause bleeding on sensitive areas of the face.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a coupe months and have seen no results.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. I am not even great at being consistent and it make a difference on the first couple of rolls. Try this item.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on this.  Very irritating and no benifet.  I can&#x27;t believe I fell for it.  Waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> saw the result immediately after 2 usages. worth the pain.</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews, I didn&#x27;t think there would be pain involved.  Puncture your face with a bunch of little needles on a roller.  Plow up and down, back and forth, criss and cross.  Ouch.  Your face does get red from the punctures.  I haven&#x27;t detected any changes that I can attribute to the punishment so far.  Keeping with the program to give it a fair shot.</li>
    <li> I am loving my Derma Roller! My skin products finally are doing what they&#x27;re supposed to do! It has softened the deep wrinkle between my brows!</li>
    <li> excellent Derma Roller.  Easy to use, came I a nice plastic case.</li>
    <li> Easy to use does not hurt</li>
    <li> I love it I can see results already. I use it with mederma stretch marks. I just wish the box came up more instructions like how often to use it. Other than that I highly suggest it. I have dark stretch marks on my sides and they seen to fading so we&#x27;ll see in about another month.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely love this roller.  I just use it for two weeks and already see good result.  My pores are getting smaller. My skin is glowing with radiance.  The roller is very easy to use and can be cleaned easily with hydrogen peroxide. The roller also comes with the case so I bring it everywhere without worrying about the needles being damage. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed in the quality of this roller.  While it is marketed as a micro needle roller, the sharp bits are actually micro \\&quot;knives\\&quot; that are stamped out of a disc of metal rather than individual cylindrical needles mounted into the head.  This creates cuts in the skin (which might actually harm the skin as it cuts into collagen fibers laterally) rather than piercing the skin vertically to create a channel.  Because the construction of this unit is hard to ascertain without taking a magnifying glass to it, I used this for a year and was confused by why my results have not been as good with this roller as with my previous (***different brand***) roller, which used true needles.  In searching for answers, I came across an online derma roller review page where they include this 540 \\&quot;needle\\&quot; roller and saw the magnified photo showing the head of stamped \\&quot;knives\\&quot;. I then took a magnifying glass to my own roller -- indeed, the \\&quot;needles\\&quot; on this unit are identical to this photo of micro \\&quot;knives\\&quot;.  I feel misled by the marketing by this roller, as these micro-blades may actually be harmful to use, and because the aforementioned web site also suggests that this stamped-knife design is less expensive to manufacture than the true needle design.  The clinical results in the dermatology literature are from using a product with true needles, and in retrospect I would have rather purchased a unit with fewer true \\&quot;needles\\&quot; for the same cost.  I regret falling into the \\&quot;more-needles &#x3D; better\\&quot; mentality, and will be looking for an alternative product!  I wish I had discovered the construction of the \\&quot;needles\\&quot; on this unit before the end of the return period.    EDITED to remove the brand name of my previous roller, to assure anyone reading this that this review is an honest one for this product and is not meant to promote a different product.</li>
    <li> I have used just 3 times. It&#x27;s easy to do. You can look up videos on YouTube. It does not hurt. I did not numb my face first. It hurts way less then getting blood drawn. I did notice a difference after each use. There was no swelling or trauma. No down time. My pores are starting to diminish. The lines around my mouth appear to be diminishing as well. I will continue to use about 2 times a week for 15 minutes. It&#x27;s better than paying 500 for someone else to do it.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once as I read it takes several weeks for collagen to replenish and so cannot really rate it yet.</li>
    <li> I lightly tested it on a few spots on my face the first night just to see how it would feel and my skin would react. It felt prickly but wasn&#x27;t painful so next time I&#x27;m going to use more pressure because I think I was being overly cautious. I read that your supposed to wait 4-6 weeks between so I&#x27;m waiting to use again. My device arrived quickly and was sealed up well in its case. Happy with purchase so far and looking forward to using more.</li>
    <li> hope it works like they said it does!</li>
    <li> I dont quite know exactly how to use this but with the way I have been doing it just doesnt seem like it&#x27;ll be efficient but the seller rather well with delivery........</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a derma roller before. I think I really like it. It&#x27;s a tad painful but not terrible and definitely worth it. I have only used it on my face so far but looking forward to getting some numbing cream and trying other areas for cellulite.</li>
    <li> I have has a hard time using this, it hurts so badly!</li>
    <li> There are a lot of people that are posting videos on how to use this so it is very simple to use. There are not many guys showing how to do it but I thought I would give it a try. I was in football while I was in High School and I got a lot of stretch marks on my biceps, chest, shoulders, and shoulder blades. So i decided to get this to help me in getting rid of the stretch marks. After using it I saw a difference, my stretch marks were lighter. This derma roller does work. I am very happy with derma roller and I would even recommend this to my football buddies. I received a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> After using this my face broke out terribly so I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll try it again</li>
    <li> After I use this I feel like I went to the spa and received a facial treatment. I&#x27;m still waiting to see if this, in time, the added benefits.</li>
    <li> I got this about a week ago, I am looking forward to seeing results which may take several weeks.. I am going to buy a intensive moisturizer to assist and maybe an anti-wrinkle cream.  The one catch is that it is VERY painful.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to hurt so much.  Then again it is tiny little needles so I should have expected nothing less.  I like it a lot though.. I can see a little difference after a week.</li>
    <li> Have only used the Dermal Roller maybe 7 or 8 times over a 4 week period.  Today my sister-in-law asked me what products I have been using on my face.  I told her and she wanted one.  I could tell the fine lines are fading and acne scares are plumping up. I did know anyone else could tell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the roller itself is fine, but the process doesn&#x27;t work like people claim it does (in my opinion).  I fell for this after lot of research.  Now it just sits on my shelf.  It also takes a LOT of time, attention and work, not including the time you really should take to sterilize it after every use.  I&#x27;d rather just save my money and invest it in lasers.</li>
    <li> This is the best Derma Roller you can find on the market. I tried another Derma R. before but this one I can say is the best. Smooth&lt;br /&gt;(unless u wanna hurt yourself) I use it with \\&quot;Triple Action Vitamin C Serum + Hyaluronic Acid\\&quot;.Only after 1 day of use I already love&lt;br /&gt;my face. They also give you email instruction of how to use it and everything you want to know just ask and they will provide you with&lt;br /&gt;the most satisfying answers.By the way, I also started to use it for my stretch marks also. I will update after a week or two with more news. SGF Limited you rock!!!! I would definitely use their products in the future!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Feb/22/14 My sister visited me today ( because of work and distance we see each other like once every month). All I she can say was WOWW....she told me that my face really look different, more radiant, clear and that I started to have a beautiful face again. You have to be consistent on using the Derma Roller in order to see some progress. 5 more stars!</li>
    <li> The Derma Roller is great!  Use it as recommended once a day and then follow with Vitamin C oil and any other topical fading cream.  Does the job it&#x27;s suppose too.  Very sturdy.</li>
    <li> The Jury is still out.  So far i do like the fact that you apply your product on your skin, roll your skin, product gets deep into your pores and is way more effective.  I will do a follow up in an another week,</li>
    <li> My favorite skin product thus far! I was a little skeptical at first since I have basically  tried almost everything on the old acne scars I have. The product is inexpensive and I got it sooner than I anticipated. I have only used it twice and already see the results. I have used it once a week and it is not painful at all. I did feel some slight discomfort. I suggest using the product in the evening since I experienced some redness but it went away over night.</li>
    <li> Painless and works like a charm I have been using it for a months now, I do a session every 2 weeks on my face and it has improved the texture of my skin and it&#x27;s pigmentation. This piece is best when equipped with a serum after use. I use the &amp;#34;Hyaluronic Acid Serum&amp;#34; from OZ Naturals and the work it does is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my Derma Roller!  I am 54 years old African American woman and my skin is in pretty good condition before using it.  But as you get older, no matter how great your skin is, it looses volume.  I use this almost every night and I wake up with glowing plumped skin.  I am amazed.  While using it, your face becomes a little red, but that&#x27;s good because you are making your skin work again, to rejuvenate itself.  I am very happy with it.  Its not a miracle worker, but it really does make your skin look much, much better.  My makeup goes on effortlessly.  My pores seem smaller.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I will never be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Derma Roller, then use Watts Hyralunic Acid Serum with Fresh Beauty Oil.  A great combo for me.  I look at my face in the mirror and I am very happy to see my skin look younger!  II&#x27;d like to get the 2mm size for some stretch marks. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use this for a different reason than most I&#x27;m guessing (haven&#x27;t read a lot of other reviews). I use it as part of my anti hair loss regimen. I use the Derma Roller over the part of the scalp I&#x27;m going to treat and then apply Lipogaine (similar to Rogaine) onto the same area. I&#x27;ve done extensive research and using a roller such as this potentiates the effects of the Lipogaine. The Derma Roller seems really well designed and solidly constructed. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality micro needle roller. My acne scared skin has dramatically improved. It needed a bit of time to get used to the rolling experience (which for a beginner is rather painful at the start of the treatment).</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in my skin, my daughters say the can see it too, they will be ordering theirs soon !!!</li>
    <li> “Like getting a facial without leaving home or paying big bucks.” I am a member of the skeptics society. I always choose the seeing is believing route. This product does show results. Having large pores I have tried all products out there, expensive store bought and natural home goods. The Derma Roller diminishes them and adds plumpness to your skin. Watch how hard you press at first to find your limit. I use it before bedtime and apply a vitamin c cream afterwards. My skin is sensitive to creams and lotions so you must find the one that is right for you. I was not sure which to select for various rollers and price ranges run the gamut. Settled on this one after some research and am very satisfied. I have only been using it for a month but I am curious to see the long-term results. Nothing can be accomplished in life without taking a risk.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than i expected, makes a little squeaky sound like its going to break but does what its supposed to do. Travel case is made out of thick material, small and portable.</li>
    <li> I have only had this a couple weeks and have not yet noticed any difference, but that does not mean it doesn&#x27;t work.  I also have been rolling one back of hand but not the other to see if I can tell a difference I have only been doing that for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every night before bedtime.  My face gets a little pink, and I don&#x27;t want to put on makeup after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roller does not hurt. It seems to be fairly high quality, as far as rollers go.  The service was excellent.  It was delivered promptly.  It looks exactly like the picture.  The company had excellent service following up with instructions and just to see how I was doing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I am giving it 5 stars for service , quality and follow up since I have yet to have it long enough to see any real difference.</li>
    <li> I only recently started using the Derma Roller and with carefully following the recommended treatment I am seeing results and feel better about my apperance, I will diffinately continue with the care.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product really. Its so hard to use and makes you uncomfortable. I thought it would result faster than I thought</li>
    <li> This device should work in principle but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see the possible results. It is easy to use, can be adjusted based on the pressure and frequency used, and is easy to sterilize.</li>
    <li> I would recommend the derma roller! It&#x27;s great for fine lines and makes my face feel great. It&#x27;s a little painful when I use it but soooo worth it! I notice a huge difference in how my makeup looks too. My entire complexion looks better. We&#x27;ll worth the price.</li>
    <li> This needle roller is a little narrower than most, which makes it easier to trace around eyes and crow&#x27;s feet.  It has a feeling of a more finely made implement than others. it has a nice ergonomic handle and very smooth needles that do not scratch</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really soon to tell my experience cos I&#x27;m trying only a few weeks. It&#x27;s bearable and feels like a chemical peeling.&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I Love how my skin is responding in such a short time. My brown spots seem less noticeable and skin has a glow</li>
    <li> After doing quite a bit of reading and research I decided to get the 1.0mm roller for my face.  Let me say it does not hurt at all!  I began rolling very lightly and was able to increase pressure right away...but I did not put heavy pressure as this is contraindicated for any rolling.  It actually felt good...sounds weird but true.  Afterward my face was red like a light sunburn and that is normal.  It was actually more uncomfortable after rolling than during as it felt like a sunburn, which again is normal.  I used my all natural products following the procedure.  The next day my face was still had a sunburn appearance until mid afternoon and I rolled the night before.  My face felt tight and smooth.  My main goal is to even out skin tone, erase darkly pigmented areas and produce collagen to fill in some forehead lines that are starting and lines vertical  frown lines on the inner sides of my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a RN and after much research here are my recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;-  Make sure and cleanse face thoroughly prior to rolling and clean face with alcohol on cotton fully two times...with fresh cotton swab on second time.&lt;br /&gt;-  Make sure hair is pulled back completely&lt;br /&gt;-  Soak your roller in at least 70% alcohol 15-30 min prior to procedure and afterwards&lt;br /&gt;-  Make sure to only use 100% natural products on your face afterwards!  This is very important so read your labels thoroughly.  Since the absorption of the product you use on your fact afterward is increased +1000x or more, you must use all natural even organic products.  No chemicals.  This was recommend on reputable research material over and over.&lt;br /&gt;-  DO NOT roll more than every 30 days.  I know there are a lot of reviews where people are rolling several times a week, every two weeks, etc.  But I have done the medical research on this and for collagen formation, if you roll more often than every 30 days the collagen production cycle will be interrupted and it will defeat the purpose.  Yes, people do see increased &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; in their face and diminished lines when they roll more often, but this is not attributed to collagen being produced...but it is attributed to the tissue being in a constant state of inflammation.  Read the cycle of collagen production at the cellular level and you will understand why rolling more often is contraindicated and will work against the formation of collagen and not for it.  This process takes time...many months for your body to produce the amount of collagen to fill in lines and that is based off medical research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this process takes many months to see the true results and you will need to roll monthly up to 18 months or more to achieve maximum results (although visible results will be noticeable in 6 months) I can only give a four star rating now but will update later.  The product is quality and painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, you will see results in the first 12-26 hours following rolling, but keep in mind this is the ACUTE response phase by your tissues and inflammation.  Peak collagen production does not start until approx. 2  weeks...look up research for exact dates as data not in front of me as I write this review.  Over TIME you should see the fullness in your face lasts even after the initial tissue inflammation after rolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps and happy rolling.  Remember, it takes a lot of time for lines to form and it will take time for them to lessen or go away.  This is not an overnight cure...it takes time for the body to produce collagen and consistent use should produce results according to medical research.</li>
    <li> Whoo! Be very gentile and delicate when you first use this item! A light touch works best! I have been using it every other day with good results.</li>
    <li> it works but I wish it was bigger I didn&#x27;t know or understand how small it was going to be</li>
    <li> I had never tried a derma roller, but heard and read many good things about how well they work on wrinkles, I decided to give it a try.  I purchased both, a 1.0 and a .5, since I was unsure which would work best on my face, (and if the 1.0 was too much for the skin on my face). I also decided I could use this 1.0 on other areas of my body (to work on cellulite!). I&#x27;m glad I did. This 1.0 is a little painful on my face, so for now, I&#x27;m using it on my body. Maybe after using the .5 on my face for a while, I&#x27;ll build up a tolerance and will need/want to start using this one on my face too. It came very securely packaged and in addition to the storage/travel case it fits into, it was sealed in sterile packaging (the same way that surgical tools are sealed). I followed the instructions and felt very safe using this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice now. (and will continue to use) I am seeing marked reduction in marionette lines and other wrinkles on face. Also the general tone of my complexion has changed to something I recognized as my &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; complexion. Note: I am over 60 years) My complexion is lighter (it was pretty light to begin with, now it is almost porcelain and the texture is incredibly smooth.  I am so thankful I followed this recommendation and purchased this product based on reviews by others as I was checking out reviews on moisturizing crèmes at Amazon.  Also, it is up to the user to decide how much pressure to apply to your rolling.  Start with  gentle rolling and increase, if desired, and always sterilize device by using 70%(or better) iso. alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and clean your face both before and after per the enclosed directions.  This device is without doubt the best money I have ever spent for skin care and enhancement.  If you are afraid of needles or using them then maybe this device is not for you, but just be gentle at first and you will find the perfect pressure to apply to get the maximum benefits.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a miracle tool but unfortunately results aren&#x27;t as miraculous as hoped.  I have terrible stretch marks and hoped this would save them.  After testing a small area I found that this really only penetrates the top superficial layers of skin so the deep scarring from the stretch mark isn&#x27;t even phased.  The worst part is how squeaky the roller is, I can only use it upside down to minimize the awful screeching squeak.</li>
    <li> My pores have become clearer and my face is breaking out much less.  This is a great product!  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Well I don&#x27;t give wonderful reviews on the norm, unless it is truly wonderful, BUT THIS WORKS!! Don&#x27;t roll too hard, very gently. Using this for back acne, although, I have not used on the face seeing a significant improvement! Super excited to see the end results! Works great with Rose Petal With Hazel. (IF you are looking to get rid of acne) Purchased these both at the same time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I have acne scar &amp;#34;dents&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34;. Basically it&#x27;s for scarring. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and I have not seen any results yet. I will continue to use this and see what happens but I hope there are better products out there that will work.</li>
    <li> Only been using for a couple weeks daily, only took 1 or 2 days off. Hoping for even more results but i think it&#x27;s actually doing something. I&#x27;ll update in about a month to review my progress.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the derma roller for 5 days &amp; already notice a huge difference in a more even skin tone on my face. I&#x27;m not going to lie though, it hurts some, but nothing unbearable &amp; I&#x27;m not using numbing gel &amp; don&#x27;t feel I need to. Very pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using roller for 2 weeks and it has been an useful tool for reducing my acne scars. I will use it longer and make a more complete review</li>
    <li> So I was really chicken about using this but it really is no big deal.  I  think it is important to have a soothing serum/gel/cream to follow the treatment.  I make sure my face is clean and I use alcohol to clean the roller.  I use it when I have a few minutes and it has reduced my pore size and makes my other skin care products absorb nicely.  I&#x27;m not into radical skin treatments and this is gentle and can be advanced at my pace.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using the derma roller on a regular basis and I must say I really love the product.  I couple it with a Vit C serum (Xfacio) and see a containing positive difference in my skin.  I have looked over other reviews and I must say if you don&#x27;t go nuts it is not painful at all.  Just make sure you are cleaning it properly and using it on clean skin.  It is staying as part of my routine for sure.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product!</li>
    <li> WOW......in just one months time I look 5 years younger in the face, friends are asking me whats going on, that I look happy and alive, that something about me looks different.</li>
    <li> This thing works awesome! I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
    <li> It feels like it might be working :)</li>
    <li> Purchased the Derma Roller SGF from Amazon hoping it would give me results for wrinkles without investing in expensive creams or injections.  It seems to &#x27;pump up\\&quot; the area where used like having collagen injections.  The process doesn&#x27;t last as long as an injection, of course, but it is simple to use and I can see results when I use it.  Cost was very reasonable, too.  Was concerned about the &#x27;pain&#x27; factor, but just use a light touch and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I use my derma roller every night and I feel like it&#x27;s been wonderful for my skin! I notice a huge difference in tone, texture and overall appearance. My fine lines are less noticeable and my skin feels tighter and more plump, like when I was younger. It&#x27;s so wonderful to get these results with something that I can use at home… and for so little money!!</li>
    <li> This product is well made I love it!&lt;br /&gt;My friend purchased this item after I shared with her how great of a product it is..</li>
    <li> Well, first off, I will say that this truly does hurt, and I have tough skin; however, like the prior reviews, “no pain, no gain”.  I recommend doing the four strokes in small segments.  Just about the time you can’t stand it any longer, you’re on to the next spot.  I’ve used this roller about four times, and I will say that my sebum deposits are completely gone.  I do not see any change in the wrinkles, but I have always had a problem with under-the-skin sebum deposits clogging my pores, and like I said, these micro bumps are completely gone.  I also recommend that you give yourself a day for your skin to calm down.  If you do it at night, then your skin will still be a little freaked out the next day; but, by the day after, you will have a “glow”.  Your skin also feels so good after the treatment is completed.  It stings, and your face is red, but it does feel like you’ve made a difference.  Also, don’t use on the bridge of your nose – there is no skin there, and it will just bleed.  Not sure how effective this roller would be on hair, it would appear to me that these sharp needles would slice the hair follicles; however, I have not had a chance to research the benefits for the hair.  I will update this review after I have had a chance to really use this roller.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m not sure about the scarring yet but my pores have gone down tremendously. When I washed my face before using this, I used to feel a lot of bumps(I think they were black heads). All those have disappeared. My face does get red after I used this but as suggested, I moisturize with avocado oil, vitamin e oil or tea tree oil(and eventually cocoa butter oil). After that I followed up with aloe vera gel and african shea butter. It&#x27;s quite a bit of layers of stuff but those products are great and don&#x27;t cause break outs due to their organic nature. I used to use it nightly but now I don&#x27;t have a need for it anymore. I&#x27;ll probably keep doing it everyone week at least twice. I&#x27;m very happy that I found this product. My face is smoother and tighter and soon it will hopefully be scarless as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this roller ones a month and I am happy with the results. I&#x27;m not going to lie, the first time was quite painful, but I am a chicken when it comes to pain. I follow the treatment with vitamin c serum, and then collagen cream.  Be brave ladies.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week and it looks like it is doing something good on my skin.</li>
    <li> I do really like it. I just don&#x27;t have that much time to use it.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to clean. The only thing that could make it better is if it came WITH a bottle of peroxide.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product at first but this did great to my skin. I have been using it for more than a month now and it has done better than the proactive plus I tried before. But you do have to follow the instructions as I read online somebody didn&#x27;t and had rashes on their face.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best skin treatment I&#x27;ve ever done. I&#x27;ve only used it once and the improvement is noticeable! The device came with a case and delivery was fast. I have a high threshold for pain so it was not painful for me. I really recommend it. I plan to buy a few to give away this Christmas.</li>
    <li> Great roller glad I bought it!!</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference yet. I was using it every night, but, it made my skin too dry.</li>
    <li> Hard on sensitive skin for first time users because of the slightly painful and agitating feeling (sort of like prickly/tingly) you get from the needles on derma roller. Overall good product so far! I have been using it for about 2-3 weeks and so far have not run into any problems with skin after use.</li>
    <li> I am 28yo and have been using the Derma Roller on and off for about 2 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t used it consistently so it is hard to rate the results as of now.  I have acne scars and other scars that I have used it on. Some days they appear to be less noticeable than others. I have never used a product such as this so it&#x27;s taking some getting used to-It is very easy to use, and does not hurt unless you are really pressing hard into your skin(you might have a little bleeding). I do not roll over my whole face just certain areas and then I apply a lightening cream or serum and moisturizer. I will try and update this review when I feel like I have attempted to make it a daily routine and can see results or not.  I do feel like it will help more than buying all of those scar reducing creams....</li>
    <li> This thing is magic and everyone needs one. Makes skin super supple and undeniably smooth. Love love love you won&#x27;t be mad get 1!</li>
    <li> I am a hard working mother of 3 in my 40&#x27;s with really bad sun-aged skin due to years of working outdoors. My skin has aged beyond my years. I have tried all sorts of products to rid myself of my fine lines and wrinkles without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks before purchasing the derma roller I bought this [[ASIN:B00GPWYF94 Hyaluronic Acid serum]] by Nicci Marie Skincare and I started to see some good results. Then a friend recommended this to me (who also uses the same serum) and she said that the two products combined work really well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I’ve been using the 2 products together for 3 weeks now and I’m truly staggered by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin (which used to be like leather by the way) is now as soft as a baby’s behind, but it’s also much firmer if that makes sense? And the glow is amazing. The fine lines around my mouth, eyes and forehead are hardly noticeable anymore. Pretty much everyone I know has given me compliments about my skin recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night before I go to bed I wash my face with my favorite cleanser. I then spend a few minutes lightly rolling the derma roller over my face. I then spray my face with water and apply the hyaluronic serum I mentioned. I then apply my favorite Nuetrogena night cream and go to bed with a big smile on my face :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can’t recommend this highly enough.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Derma Roller for my wife after she saw it on TV. After a few weeks of using the product her skin appears younger and her facial pores have almost disappeared. Great!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to a derma roller when I scheduled a facial with a new aesthetician.  She explained its function prior to using it. I ordered this one as soon as I got home and have been using it every day since. My skin is showing the benefits of the combined use of the derma roller and serum application. I have smoother healthier looking skin.</li>
    <li> o.k. Normally I don&#x27;t give negative reviews until I tried the products for at least two weeks, and now my weeks is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews before ordering the products and  I followed the instructions on the package, going horizontal, vertical and diagonal. I did not push too hard and I used it on an average of 3 times a week. And I put serum after each treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I notice anything positive change? None. My skin is burning after each treatment, and my skin now feel more uneven than before; my scars do not go anywhere. I am not happy about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still going to give it another trial for another two weeks trying to treat twice a week, I will come back if I notice anything different.</li>
    <li> Read about this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Can&#x27;t say yet if it is working. It would have been nice to have more instruction on how to use. The vendor was prompt.</li>
    <li> I think it hurts, but I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll help with milia, brown spots, acne scars, lines, etc. I applied a serum afterwards, and that soon calmed down the irritation. Will see how it feels in the morning. Here&#x27;s the serum from Amazon:  Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum for Face 20% - With Vitamin E &amp; Hyaluronic Acid - Best Natural &amp; Organic Ingredients - 1 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After a few days, I noticed that two large acne cysts developed from the irritation. They are healing naturally but will take a few days to be completely gone. I overdid the rolling a little, and this caused the inflammation. Will have to be more careful! I was painstaking with sterile technique, but I stressed the skin too much. These 2 cysts appeared seemingly out of nowhere, and I&#x27;m treating with usual acne treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, some hardened milia (or whiteheads--?) are finally going away, after years! They&#x27;re like little hard white seeds under the skin and are not easily removed. Soft milia around eyes and forehead are now smaller and hopefully will eventually go away. Hoping some pitted scars will eventually soften.</li>
    <li> Product seems to be ok.  Just a little picky when I roll it but not uncomfortable.  I was supposed to receive a free extra roller if I gave a review, but the link that was sent to me by email took me to another product so I expect to not receive the free gift.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an item like this because I have very sensitive skin.  It really feels good on my face and and the back of my arms.  I would like more information about this company.  I&#x27;ll bet I can use creams from your company too.</li>
    <li> dont see any improvements</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any change...</li>
    <li> Great tool for home facial. I read it has shorter &#x27;needles&#x27; than the ones they use for a professional dermabrasion. This one was long enough for me to see/feel a difference. My face is usually red the first day I use it but the skin feels much tighter and smoother on the second and third day. I like to use it about once a week.</li>
    <li> So far I used it only for a couple days and it does wonders. I have a few acne scars and they seem to disappear. I&#x27;m so glad about purshesing this product.</li>
    <li> The Derma Roller is easy to use. I received numerous helpful suggestions from Your Favorite Store on how to use this item. Item arrived earlier than expected! Nicely packaged. Thank You.</li>
    <li> it was a little rough to use at first but then my skin became used to the needles.  I can press a little harder each time.  only in my sensative areas to I bleed some but its not bad and if you use a good serum and have a clean complexion you reduce the risk of dirt clogging or infections. Its also a good idea to use a cotton swab and wipe alcohol over your face when complete. (very little) just to reduce bacteria.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re willing to make yourself bleed a little, this will lead to smaller/less noticeable pores if yours are enlarged. I press harder than they suggest,  heal in about 2- 3 days. I&#x27;ve had 2 treatments of laser skin resurfacing (this feels similar in the sense that it burns after and makes the skin a bit tight when it&#x27;s healing) which did help to reduce more my pores significantly, however a few deep ones remain and instead of paying for more treatments, this works! I&#x27;ve done it 3 or 4 times now, but noticed a difference after the 1st time. Great if you&#x27;re willing to go through the somewhat painful process, then the healing. I do it every 2 weeks about.</li>
    <li> I have been using the dermaroller 2 a week for 2 weeks and already have seen amazing results. I have using vitamin c serum and retinol night cream after. I do recommend watching some tutorials on the use. I have to press quite firmly to actually see blood so I may be upgrading to the 1.5 next time and perhaps won&#x27;t need to press so hard. It is a little painful I&#x27;ll admit but the results are beautiful.</li>
    <li> I read the directions &amp; I did exactly as directed. I woke up the next day with little bumps all over my face that eventually turned into little white pustules. Took a week or so to get my face back to normal. Don&#x27;t waste your money get a real facial instead!</li>
    <li> love this product!!  it helps, face feels better after using it! Love derma roller, happy with it! worth it !</li>
    <li> Sorry. There is no established science for this product. No randomized, controlled studies.  Likely to have no effect, except irritating your skin. I should have returned it, but it was pretty cheap.  People really want to believe..... If you are even seeing any results, it&#x27;s inflammation.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Also great customer service!</li>
    <li> This works great.roll real smooth and actually not that painful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and I&#x27;m glad it came in the mail early. I was able to replace my old one with this. I like that it was sealed carefully and I checked on the needles and it was all straight. Yes, some needles I have seen are crooked but not on this derma roller. Crooked needles will cause damage to the skin. Im happy i got it on a discounted price</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to try this product, but after 2 months of using it, I can visibly see the results. My pores are getting smaller, and the texture of my skin is smoother after each use. My scares are also diminishing and not noticeable. I would suggest for those who have sensitive skin to use this product once every 3 weeks or once a month. Let your skin regenerate the new collagen and let your skin breath. Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Be careful with these. You can really damage your skin.</li>
    <li> Great quality fast delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile now. It&#x27;s a pretty good product. It tickles a little but I&#x27;ve seen some pretty nice progress. I&#x27;m very happy that I got this. I don&#x27;t see anything that could&#x27;ve been better</li>
    <li> It is terrible. I would really like a refund. It has not helped on bit and I spent my money on this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fine lines and then I read somewhere that this can be used on spider veins as well. I had a few spots on my legs, some were a little lighter and some are darker and wider. The finer ones disappeared right before my eyes the instant I used it for the very first time! I will say that I already got my money&#x27;s worth just for that! My larger area shrunk immediately as we&#x27;ll but not completely. This one is being more stubborn but it has gotten much smaller and a lot lighter. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and I won&#x27;t complain because online I read that it could take months to get rid of them. I think it will be completely gone soon. I&#x27;m also using it on my face and neck and I&#x27;m really excited to see how this will work for lines. This is the best purchase I have made for skin care. So far I love this thing and I will definitely buy another one soon so I have it when this one doesn&#x27;t work anymore. My mother couldn&#x27;t believe my spider veins are just disappearing, she remembers how dark they were. She&#x27;s also going to order one now that she has seen the results.</li>
    <li> I see a professional dermatologist regularly plus an esthetician, they both said that this is BAD NEWS, in fact, it&#x27;s illegal for them to use it on patients.</li>
    <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
    <li> Always on the prowl for the newest creme, potion, or treatment that will at least keep Father Time reigned in just a little bit, I stumbled upon the Derma Roller. Does it work? YES! Does it hurt? Not really... it feels more like slight scratching... Having used it for only 2 weeks, I already notice a difference in the luminosity of my skin (which had been pretty dry) a slight improvement in an annoying wrinkle perpendicular to my eyebrow... and, excitingly, my acne meds have begun to work miracles. Try it! You have nothing to lose, except 10 years off your face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the dream roller several times, giving my face a few days break each time, and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my superficial acne scarring, tone, etc. I use OZ vitamin C serum after and then my normal moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes after reading just about every review for the product.  I&#x27;m hoping that it takes some time, at least I&#x27;ve read this on other sites, for my skin to begin healing itself. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve used the Derma Roller only 4 times since I received it, I can already see the results!  The pores on my nose and chin are noticeably smaller and my skin seems to have more of a glow.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in another 6 weeks, and I&#x27;ll write an update review with my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean my face with makeup remover and then roll the DERMACARE roller across all areas of my face. I then use hyaluronic acid, I let my face completely air dry, and follow up with a facial moisturizer.  So far, I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I use it on my stomach from having a baby and wow did i see results. i almost have my pre pregnancy belly back! You have to use it at least 3 times out of the week</li>
    <li> Kinda small but its good</li>
    <li> I have been using it since 4 weeks. I used it alternate days. So far it has not shown any results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a couple times i love how your skin feels tight right away and you know that its working cuz you can feel it inside. But i have a feeling thats what broke me out after using it. I have pimples all over my fave now even forehead where  i never get pimples! Really bad acne, I&#x27;ve had acne way before using this product but it just broke me out so much after. I don&#x27;t know if its just me but i wonder if it has happened to anyone else?</li>
    <li> This works and for me and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. It seems to get dull a little fast. I was told to change it out every three months, but after only six uses (once every one to two weeks) I think it is getting time to switch. But really, it&#x27;s so inexpensive, it doesn&#x27;t matter. More to the point, it works. I know there is controversy on frequency of use, but I found every 1-2 weeks shows improvement. Your results may differ.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff. Making my acne pigmantation go away and nothing new coming out! Best stuff ever</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  I don&#x27;t think it hurts that bad.  I feel it works good for my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service plus fast shipment. I have used it for about a month and can slightly see the difference. Acne scars and marks are the same but skin looks brighter. (Not sure thought if its because of this or the serum that I am using with it)One thing make sure DO NOT use on active acne skin. IT WILL SPREAD BACTERIA all over. Be very careful. I had a small whitehead that looked dry and dead. BIG MISTAKE. Next thing I know my face was covered with acne. So make sure your skin is bump free, acne free, whiteheads free and then use it.    UPDATE: I have used it for 2 months and seen a slight difference in my acne marks. 3 weeks ago when I used it on my face, my face turned red and swelled up and afterwards, I breakout like crazy. Its been 3 weeks since I last used it and I am still breaking out. I was very confused as to why this happened as I have used it for 2 month without a reaction. NOTE that you are suppose to discard it after 3-4 months, but not after 2 months. Last night I decided to inspect the roller and when I rolled it on a black piece of paper, I was shocked to see that only the outer needles were working and the other inner needles didnt even poke a tiny dip on paper even with intense pressure. And moreover, the outer needle did make holes but they were huge as compare to the needle size. Its hard to explain but I would suggest everyone to roll it on a dark paper and see how the needles are working. This way you can check if the needles are messed up before using it on your face. I wish I could attach the pic so you guys will know how to test it. Anyways, my verdict is it does work on acne marks and will slightly lighten them. Scars might get worse. But most importantly, if you got a bad roller or if its mess up after one or 2 months, then you will be left with severe acne and afterwards acne marks. ALWAYS, test your roller. I will not be using it after my experience because I again have acne marks (much darker) and scars seems more obvious andbigger.</li>
    <li> Wow! My purchase was based heavily on reviews especially one given by RN who suggested once every 30 days. After one time use I can see why people want to use it more often, my skin looked great! I followed with OZ naturals Vit C and awaiting the New Serum CL. I am going to go by the 30 day suggestion since in my 50&#x27;s I would like to see increase in collagen production. Although I have no medical background I do have extensive cosmetic training from my past career so I was curious as to how a very inexpensive product could reap such BIG results. I would easily drop $100+ for a facial or micro peel or other more intense treatment. Before I placed on my face I watch several videos on You Tube. I was surprised no instructions with device? It&#x27;s really quit simple and because of needles I did not want to apply deep pressure the first time. I rolled everywhere even throat, didn&#x27;t really get noticeably red but I do have thick skin and was cautious first time. After rolling complete placed in alcohol to sanitize before &amp; after rolling then applied OZ naturals Vit C all over, no stinging with this product. The overall appearance of my skin looked youthful and glowing, I&#x27;m really trying hard not to use it again before 30 days as suggested.</li>
    <li> It worked on my wrinkle but it&#x27;s really painful. If you have very sensitive skin, you may not be able to tolertate the pain.</li>
    <li> great for staying young looking</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to determine if this really works.  I have noticed some difference in stretch marks, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the roller or the moisturizer that I&#x27;m using.  Previously, I had given up on getting rid of stretch marks.  We shall see.</li>
    <li> product is as advertised.</li>
    <li> Im a First time user of this product for my scar on my leg. It hurts but i can tolerate it. I will update the result in a couple of months.Cross finger it will work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay to use but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s works for my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this so far.  My skin is not bruised and no breakouts. The process is quick and surely makes serums, etc. penetrate better.  I cannot tell yet if increased collagen production has been stimulated since that will take weeks and months to notice.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how delicate a tool it was. I&#x27;ve used it a number of times but was unsure as to how often I should use it. While the product doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, there is a great deal of information and videos available online. I believe it is a  good product. I also think it will take some time to see results.</li>
    <li> I made sure to read through the questions and reviews before using this roller. I was also very happy to receive helpful emails from the company to ensure that I use the product the way it was intended for maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that I went gung ho and was using this everyday for the first week and a half or so, gently though. I then started applying more pressure and am now experiencing the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; face afterward but it is a good feeling. I am using the hyaluronic acid serum and rosehip eye serum and also Doterra Vetiver essential oil blended in sweet almond oil after rolling. This all seems to be helping because I have noticed fading of my age spots and am even noticing my sagging eyelids lifting up a bit. I don&#x27;t use the roller over my eyelids...I&#x27;m to chicken to do that but I am rolling over my eyebrows and slightly below. Since doing this I am noticing the lift which is just amazing for me. I was worried that I would need surgery to correct this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is week 3 for my use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely sold on this product!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this does much? But I haven&#x27;t really used it that much.</li>
    <li> It works. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I have small and big stretch marks on my stomach from having my son who is now two. I have tried tons of expensive creams without any results. I have used this derma roller only 4 times now and I have seen derastic results &amp; am so happy!!!! This was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. I would highly recommend it to anyone else with a similar situation.</li>
    <li> I like it !!! I&#x27;m not  pressing hard so no blood  but my face gets really red then I  put my moisturize on and I feel it penetrating more. I only been using it for a week I&#x27;ve been doing it every day is a keeper.  In the morning red is gone&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps ladies!!</li>
    <li> Great product, I use this on my face when I use other creams an it helps for sure. Love it.</li>
    <li> I do not like this skin roller. It actually has bent needles, I am afraid to use this. I think the bent needles may hurt me and I really cannot understand why this has such good reviews.</li>
    <li> Both my friend and I ordered one of these things from Amazon and we both rendered it useless. We are both in our mid 30&#x27;s and very interested in skin care and have tried many &amp;#34;fads&amp;#34;. To be absolutely honest this remind me of a mini torture device from the dark ages. It does nothing to make your wrinkles go away unless you think the swelling from the agitation of your skin is an answer! I would rather eat healthy, excersize, and drink more water than out myself thru this bulls#*%!</li>
    <li> I use this about once a week and have noticed my skin looks more refreshed since I began.</li>
    <li> I have been doing at home facials for years. I just ordered the roller about 3 months ago. When I use it I can use less chemicals to exfoliate. Sometimes I just use the roller and the amlactin and vitamin C serum. A great face product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the feeling on my skin</li>
    <li> I really like this roller!! I thought it was a crazy idea, but I gave it a try any ways. Boy am I glad I did!! It really works to minimize the pores and tighten the skin a bit. Who knew this little roller would work so well!!!! It&#x27;s kind of prickly, but you get used to it after awhile. It&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic and now believe. In several days the Derma Roller produced amazing results for me - much quicker and with much better results than expected. I found the Derma Roller easy to use (despite the idea of a bunch of needles - it does not hurt) and can be used anyplace (like while watching TV). My skin has a healthier look and feel which of course makes me feel better about myself.  Suprised and delighted at how well this has worked for me.

    <li> I have been using this to 2 to 3 times a week for about 5 weeks and it is working better than I dared to hope! There was a noticeable difference after using it the first few times. I&#x27;m truly amazed! I use it with Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal cream and Source Naturals MSM cream. I also take the supplements recommended in Chris Kresser&#x27;s blog series on skin health and glucosamine/chondroitin and hyaluronic acid.</li>
    <li> I had to order this from an external website, since this one I ordered DID NOT SHOW UP at my residence, so perhaps my neighbor is using this item from this vendor....haha.  I do not know if it is the exact brand, but it looks just like this.  Great for softening the look of scars.  It kind of blew me away with an old Frankenstein scar I have on my forehead.  Now it can hardly be seen without really looking closely.  Had the scar for 15 years, never stitched, so this really did a great job for that.  But as far as using it on my face, be careful because I over did it a little, and my face was inflamed and sore for awhile.  I purchase .5 mm from an external website, as well as a 1 mm from the same site for less than they charge here, so look around.  I did get a refund from Amazon since I didn&#x27;t get it, but customer service with whoever this vendor is was quite rude.  Rate an &#x27;F&#x27; on service.  But I do believe in dermarolling now.</li>
    <li> Works great - just wonder how long I can use it til it gets dull!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the deal. This product really does work it, it</li>
    <li> Love it! I would definitely suggest the numbing cream tho, but for my first time- not bad. I noticed a difference that next morning and I derma roll about twice a week.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a 3 weeks now and I think I&#x27;m starting to see small results in some of the scars however the past two times I&#x27;ve used it, it&#x27;s been squeaking, leaving scratches, and I&#x27;ve bled in a few spots. I&#x27;m going to keep trying it but it seems like maybe I got a faulty one or something.</li>
    <li> great delivery product as expected</li>
    <li> saw in a beauty magazine.  I like it.</li>
    <li> My very favorite product this year!  Not only have I been able to turn back the clock with my skin, but I feel empowered to enjoy real results at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Ouch. But, seriously, needles. I&#x27;m not complaining. Baby, it hurts so good.&lt;br /&gt;Since my skin discolors easily with any kind of scarring or scabbing, I tested this on the back of my hands to see how much pressure to use.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to move it several directions, going over the same area. Not a chance on this face, even if I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;I do it in one direction, light to medium pressure, every 2 weeks on the lines between my eyebrows. They&#x27;re not quite as deep anymore, and my skin doesn&#x27;t get too angry. Less is more with this roller. I&#x27;m due up for another one soon, as I can feel the needles getting duller.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to clean this roller after each use! I cannot stress this enough!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent. No other words can describe this product; it just works wonders in reducing pore size and clearing acne scars and what not, while opening your pores up for you to apply other facial treatments. This is the next best thing to get rid of acne scars right after you change your diet to avoid olive oil cooked food and regular milk; switch to almond milk and avoid dairy products - watch your acne problem greatly reduce or even disappear - pure truth that doctors and all those pharmaceutical companies don&#x27;t want you to know. Acne is simple a symptom of hormonal changes which is mostly due to diet or puberty. it&#x27;s that simple. I had to figure this out myself + with some research from one rare source and I have a very strong medical/scientific background. You&#x27;re all welcome in advance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend without any reservations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason A.</li>
    <li> I bought the Derma Roller for my wife to try on her stretch marks.  At first she was very skeptical, but she figured she had nothing to lose since she had tried so many other things that hadn&#x27;t worked.  After using the Derma Roller for just a few weeks, she started to notice a difference in the visibility of her stretch marks around her belly and after 60 days, has seen a noticeable difference.  We were both surprised to see such great results from a simple product.  I&#x27;m giving this product a 4 star rating right now because of the results I have seen so far.  If my wife&#x27;s stretch marks disappear altogether over the next few months, I would definitely rate it a 5 star.  Definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Just bought one for my girlfriend, too.  She noticed the new effects on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use the Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serium after I roll.  I can tell a difference in my skin when I roll 3 x a week.  (If only I did it on a regular basis my skin would probably look GREAT!).  :)&lt;br /&gt;Roller is solid!</li>
    <li> For me, after months of use, I saw no positive results.</li>
    <li> Well made roller.  See improvements in my skin after use.</li>
    <li> This is a great Derma Roller by SGF and I had no problems using it and the seller is very helpful. I got it for some deep acne scars (not just hyper-pigmentation) that I have and it is helping to reduce them. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and I do notice a difference, however, my scars are so deep I&#x27;ll have to do this multiple more times before I get desired results, but I see it coming!</li>
    <li> Just from a few uses I have noticed my large pore size reduce. I Thought it would hurt to use on my skin but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Just the overall smoothness of my skin and my complexion looks better. I do use a rubbing alcohol to clean it after each use. I use it at night and follow this with vitamin c serum. The derma roller helps your skin absorb serums and creams much better.</li>
    <li> I need more time to determine whether or not it works. Will follow up.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it once a week and can tell it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> The roller is smooth and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This took a little getting used to but worth it. My skin looks and feels renewed. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My facial salon offers the same treatment but for a few thousand bucks. Product probably works but I didn&#x27;t have the perseverance to do it routinely. I&#x27;ll probably pick it up again. Not sure how this should be cleaned but I ran surgical spirit through the needles before and after use.</li>
    <li> I love this roller and I am seeing results. I feel like I have a littles secret for making me younger!! Lol</li>
    <li> I really feel like it is helping and I am very satisfied with the purchase. Will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Very good product! If u r looking for some tool to help you to change the texture of ur skin.</li>
    <li> Just received this product, but so far I like it. I was worried about the pain of the needles, but it actually does not hurt at all.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! The derma roller scares me a bit cus a hurts haha. But I got it at a great price! Thanks to Michelle from sharing on her Instagram!</li>
    <li> Ordered this product at a promo recommendation from a social media site. Easy to use - look forward to continue use and seeing results.</li>
    <li> This product is not for me because the needles, 1mm, seem too long for me and cause some discomfort. This product does exfoliate the face well and promote new regeneration.  I&#x27;ll try to find a better way to control my strength and maybe I&#x27;ll enjoy it more.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot - hoping it doesn&#x27;t dull up too soon - as you obviously can&#x27;&#x27;t sharpen these things ;)</li>
    <li> It squeaks when I roll it. I don&#x27;t use it anymore because it is way too painful even with numbing cream. But if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing, I suppose this is a good roller. Please make sure you clean it with alcohol before and after use. Also if you have acne, don&#x27;t roll your acne. It will spread it to the rest of your face.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, as matter of use, i used it in my dark spots and it worked on the acne marks but didn&#x27;t removed the cheeks marks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Derma Roller SGF for two weeks now. My skin looks amazing! I feel and see the difference.</li>
    <li> Love it, keep at it, use only about once a week and get a good skin cream to go with it. Face will be red for a while so use it Friday night it will be fine by Saturday night.</li>
    <li> I had surgery on my right shoulder about 15 years ago, and it left a pretty good size scar on top of my shoulder.  A friend gave me the Derma Roller to try to see if would actually reduce the visibility of my scar.  At first I certainly had my doubts, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  There is just a minor pricking feeling when you are using the product, but it is certainly not painful.  Amazingly, after just a couple of weeks I started to notice a distinct difference in the appearance of my scar, and after one month I can see a huge difference.  I&#x27;d highly recommend checking this product out, especially since they offer a 90 day guarantee, you have nothing to lose.  I have been very happy with the results so far.</li>
    <li> Great product.  great quality for price</li>
    <li> I had this for a year, used it for first 6 months.  It hurts a lot at first, then I got used to it, but still no changes.  I was hoping it&#x27;d help my acne scars...</li>
    <li> I really think this is a great product!  I have had several facials done at med spa&#x27;s.  Including microdermabrasion and other peels.  I found this to help with fine lines and wrinkles and it helps the syrums I use penetrate deeper into the skin and work more effectively.  I notice a smoother \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin.  I would recommend this to others.  Worth the investment.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had not heard of this product until I was told by a friend, so I purchased this one and am very pleased. It stimulates the  skin and does make creams and serums absorb more fully after treatment.  I will revisit this review after some extended use and post my results.</li>
    <li> I get the concept and have seen some results but not sure if I can say its because of this but I will continue using.</li>
