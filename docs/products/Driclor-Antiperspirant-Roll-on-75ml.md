      <li>Amazing, honestly more than what I expect Thank you very much</li>

      <li>Two days after I was fine and started it.</li>
      <li>I have been loving life and have even purchased loads of new tshirts as it works so well!!</li>
      <li>Apply at night, wash off in the morning, apply deodorant, and enjoy a day not worrying about whether or not sweat will begin to soak your clothing.  </li>
      <li>I speak about this primarily about underarm sweat.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it works so quickly is fantastic.</li>
      <li>But every 3 days or so is best once you do a few days.</li>
      <li>have said they don&#x27;t even know if it will be ever so you can imagine my panic when I went with my prescription to get filled as I&#x27;ve been on it for years</li>

      <li>so worth the money!</li>
      <li>I have noticed a significant decrease in underarm sweat.</li>
      <li>at first we all want to put more on</li>
      <li>so I decided what do I have to lose specially for the price even though my insurance covered the drysol  </li>
      <li>One swipe is all you need, and it starts working right away!</li>
      <li>a tank top something you don&#x27;t really care about it will stay in it</li>
      <li>a tank top something you don&#x27;t really care about it will stay in it</li>

      <li>I live in America now and tried soooo many deodorants none worked.</li>

      <li>-which is a prescription from a doctor,  I was on that for many many years it is now unable to be filled by any pharmacy as it is on backorder most drug stores</li>
      <li>no sweat welts for the first couple of week but worth it</li>
      <li>thanks very much!</li>
      <li>Just walking through town shopping I would get huge sweat patches and I was so self conscious about it.</li>
      <li>I made that mistake the first night using it.  </li>
      <li>I use to sweat soooo much, but after using this my sweat minimized!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to reapply deodorant on hot or stressful days.</li>
      <li>Works the first couple times</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I absolutely must tell you that driclor works. It did womders tried the sweat block wipes it did nothing at all. But this stuff works if you follow the instructions you&#x27;ll be dry as a whistle all day. But my fast time using it was this most irritating burn I couldn&#x27;t sleep at night it felt like I had walked through poison ivy and I was tied up and couldn&#x27;t scratch but other than that it&#x27;s amazing if you sweat bad and want to keep your shirt sleeves dry this product is for you</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. This is the only deodorant that has ever helped with my hyperhydrosis . I was originally prescribed it by my doctor back home in the UK when I was a teen and had my first episode of hyperhydrosis . After using it a couple of months eventually I stopped needing to using it as the sweating stopped. However years later (Now in my 30&#x27;s) it came back!. I live in America now and tried soooo many deodorants none worked. I was considering going to doctor and getting a prescription deodorant, when I remembered this one. So I looked it up on Google and found it on Amazon! I was so happy! Now here I am, a few weeks later and no more sweating! The only bad thing I will say is sometimes after use it can cause itching and a little irratation. Would not use it after shaving either.</li>
    <li> Great product with fast shipping!! I was nervous to use it at first but it you only apply a small amount, you&#x27;ll see results! One swipe is all you need, and it starts working right away!</li>
    <li> My pits used to be drenched. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to get rid of armpit sweat all together. I noticed results within 2 or 3 days. After about 5 days of applying Driclor last thing before bed every night, I felt like my issue was solved. Now, I&#x27;ll never worry about my shirt on a 90 degree day. Because this happened: it was 90 degrees and my whole body was sweating except for my armpits.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and as described.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t for my but It seems that works well.</li>
    <li> First of all i feel like a new person when i read the reviews i was reading the problems i was going through and i questioned it but then i decided to buy it because i am tired of sweating for noreason whether im sitting, walking, working anything at all im just constantly sweating so i bought this and the first night it was really really itchy i couldnt sleep thats the bad part about this i thought it was just me but its actually the deodorant it itches extremely badly that i cant sleep at all but then the next day i dont sweat not once it feels like it but you arent and im so glad i bought this buy it trust me its worth it</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to combat nervous sweating and it wrecks your skin! A lot of reviews mentioned &#x27;a little stinging&#x27; or &#x27;slight burning or itching&#x27; and for me it was much more than that. Definitely not worth the benefit that it was supposed to provide. I then went and bought a bottle of Certain Dri, which I much prefer. Milder formula and it works just as well, if not better.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I didn&#x27;t experience any sort of pain or itching that other people said. I think if you follow the instructions and only put on a small amount you should be good to go. I put in on at night like recommended and the next day i did not sweat at all. The only thing that was wierd was it felt like i was sweating under my skin but it was completely dry, and this cannot be healthy for you at all. But, it works and does exactly what it says it will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a week now but I used it once and I haven&#x27;t sweat at all since. I seriously am so excited about it and I hope it continues to work as well as it is now. The only bad thing is it itched a lot for a couple hours after I put it on... But honestly it&#x27;s worth it for how well the product works.</li>
    <li> This product does help, my condition it&#x27;s not severe but it was to the point where I was embarrassed to lift my arms at work. I would sweat everyday and was forced to wear a loose jacket on top of my scrubs. Well, I am pleased to say that after the first application (at night) I did not sweat at ALL. I was amazed. I did even put my regular dehodoran, just to test. I used it two nights in a row and had to stop because the third night I used it right after shaving my underarms and it burned the whole night and day the next day. Two days after I was fine and started it. Now I am using it three time a week only. I don&#x27;t sweat or smell. It does work!  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I tried several antiperspirant/deodorants stick, roll on. They helped reduce sweat, but not much. Still soak wet underarms. On top they left stains on my shirts. This one works well. No more wet underarms in hot summer in Texas! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This review is a 100% honest review &amp;amp; you can read &amp;amp; see from a ton of the other reviews this product is the real deal everybody! I am somebody who was on drysol -which is a prescription from a doctor,  I was on that for many many years it is now unable to be filled by any pharmacy as it is on backorder most drug stores have said they don&#x27;t even know if it will be ever so you can imagine my panic when I went with my prescription to get filled as I&#x27;ve been on it for years and that has worked for me perfectly and took away my embarrassing sweating problem to be told no longer available so I said right away in my mind Amazon I have to look and see on Amazon if I can find anything close sure enough I found this great product right away Driclor,I read all the reviews of course first and 1 review even comparing it to dry soft which I am very very familiar with so I decided what do I have to lose specially for the price even though my insurance covered the drysol  but still the price is not bad for this Driclor to beat this embarrassing issue, now my issue is my armpits are wet all the time they sweat not a smelly sweat but just always wet even in the winter time, wet, I lift my arms I have wet spots we all know that embarrassing part :(  I do real estate I have suits on at times n with big with clients and it&#x27;s so embarrassing to have this issue and as an assistant I have to really do good for my boss and put a good impression on for him and that&#x27;s embarrassing it&#x27;s embarrassing no matter what you do even just going out to a store it effects u all no matter what where who when lol,,  we&#x27;re all together in this so we cannot be embarrassed talking about it we&#x27;re all human but I promise you guys this product works but as you will read you will have to deal with and get through the burning itching and irritation at first now I figured because I was on drysol so long it wouldn&#x27;t affect me it has a little bit but not as much as others because I was on the drysol So long But I guess due to it being a new product it did give me a little bit of irritation nothing unbearable and believe me this goes away after time bear with it because the results in the end are so worth it and after using this product long enough you only have to use it once a week sometimes I went without using it for a week that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re on a product 6 months or more don&#x27;t quote my words everybody&#x27;s different but you&#x27;re reading the reviews once you&#x27;re on it long enough you do not have to apply this every night go without it as long as you can until you need it again use your daily deodorant because this does not help with smell you will feel so confident again to wear those certain shirts we like to wear men or women and lift your arms up and not be embarrassed keeping our arms tight to our body we&#x27;re all together in this guys and girls we know how it is now I don&#x27;t know anything about this working anywhere else but under the arms but as far as under the arms it works like a charm fight through the irritation at first and the burning and you&#x27;ll be in love now make sure your dry at night when you put this on put it on at night time right before bed with an old shirt on you don&#x27;t care about make sure you wash it off in the morning even if you&#x27;re not taking a shower at first wash it off with a washcloth or rag dry yourself off and you&#x27;re good to go don&#x27;t forget to wash it off before you put on a good shirt and leave the house make sure you do not what so ever shave the same day or night when you apply this product you will go through the roof and have such a bad irritation I did that one time and wanted to die lol I&#x27;ll tell you something that I found that helps put a little baby powder or talcum powder over your armpits after this product if it starts burning or itching a little I dab on a bunch of baby powder and it helps a lot I found a lot of reviews they do that as well I give this product attend it really works use it for a while if you&#x27;re new to it and youdo not have to do this every night follow the instructions but like I said you do it at night don&#x27;t over put it on I did that at first we all want to put more on we think that helps just put enough on make sure your dry you haven&#x27;t shaved that day or night wash it off when you get up or after breakfast wear an old shirt at bedtime with it a tank top something you don&#x27;t really care about it will stay in it it could ruin it I&#x27;ve even seen holes go through certain shirts with the drysol and apply it for a while every night and then you could go back and cut back a little and then you get to a point you don&#x27;t even need to use it but once a week a couple times a week if that like I said I got to a point once a week sometimes once every other week sometimes even three times a month I&#x27;ve used it that&#x27;s after I was on for a year where I could actually skip weeks but I&#x27;m not saying skip weeks but you&#x27;ll find how your body works with it and how much your body needs it at first do it often to get your body used to it you will not go wrong with this product and then it last you longer want your body get used to it you won&#x27;t need it as much good luck everybody your embarrassment is about to end once you click the button to buy this product this seller ships it so fast that&#x27;s why I pay the extra money with this seller because he got it to me within days good luck everybody I know how you feel but I promise you this will help you:-)do not have to do this every night follow the instructions but like I said you do it at night don&#x27;t over put it on I did that at first we all want to put more on we think that helps just put enough on make sure your dry you haven&#x27;t shaved that day or night wash it off when you get up

    <li> I have tried numerous antiperspirants and none of them worked... until now.  Sweat is completely blocked with Driclor, fighting against the appearance of pit stains.  Watch out, its a little itchy!</li>
    <li> Before Driclor I ruined a lot of shirts and I was very self conscious.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use for palm and no more swetting. After apply this no swetting for one month and do it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Great quality! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Do not purchase! I just received mine and the bottle had already been opened and spilt inside the packaging.</li>
    <li> Worked well for 2 years. Now does NOT work.  I think my palms got adapted to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. After use at night, it typically lasts me a couple days where I then have to reapply. Unlike the other reviews, I have yet to go more than a couple of days without having to put it on again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Ive tried numerous roll on antiperspirants, and this one has worked the best!</li>
    <li> I usually never leave reviews for anything but this one is a must. I noticed the sweating under my arm pits in 5th grade and ever since then, it was just a battle. I tried many different deodorants, even Certain Dri. That worked for me but only for a few months. Then I came across Driclor in July 2014 and have just bought another one earlier this month because it lasted me that long. This is THE product, guys! First couple of nights I didn&#x27;t feel the stinging everyone complained about. The third night it stung so bad! It was very uncomfortable. This lasted for a week and my armpits never got itchy again. It stopped my sweating 100%. I now wear my favorite colors without being paranoid of sweat stains. This product is a miracle and like I mentioned before, the 75ml bottle lasted me 8 months! I highly recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively under their armpits.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! I use to sweat soooo much, but after using this my sweat minimized! It didn&#x27;t come to a complete stop but it isn&#x27;t as noticeable as it was before and I am so greatful!!! The only down side is it dry your arms out after a few days of use, your arms become itchy but it isn&#x27;t unbareable that goodness!!!</li>
    <li> Brilliant!  It definitely works!</li>
    <li> Just like Drysol. Just be careful as it will dry out the skin in areas that don&#x27;t sweat much. I use on my feet and it has been a lifesaver, especially in Summer when I&#x27;m wearing flip flops!</li>
    <li> best ever solution to my problem!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Certain Dri for over a decade and it was the greatest deodorant ever.  I&#x27;d tried them all, from regular, to maximum strength and nothing worked until I found that one.  The problem was... they changed the formula to make it &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; (because it was a clear liquid, like water... ).  I don&#x27;t know why they did this since it was working well... maybe some people complained (??).  Anyway, to make story short, Certain Dri doesn&#x27;t work anymore, so I&#x27;ve been trying the alternatives and it seems they all have the same or similar formulation, so they don&#x27;t work as good as my old Certain Dri.  I will give it three stars because it kind of works, but not good enough for me not to keep on looking, I still sweat a little bit and there is a little BO smell with it... and I noticed that when it stings (luckilly not all the time) it stings for a few days, unlike the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Good product no sweat welts for the first couple of week but worth it</li>
    <li> I have always had an issue with extreme sweating. This is the only product that I have found that has actually worked to prevent the excessive sweat.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. It really does work!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing, honestly more than what I expect Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Shipping is a little slow to the US, but that is customs&#x27; fault, not the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Certain DRI is good, but I can go longer without reapplying with this product.  It will sting if you put it on the same night you shave or trim your armpits.  I made that mistake the first night using it.  No stinging since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a larger size than Certain Dri, so you&#x27;re getting a great value.  Just be sure to order when you still have a few weeks left of what you&#x27;re currently using.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine life without this product now that I&#x27;ve started using it. It&#x27;s incredible. It worked the day after I applied it which is pretty crazy. I expected at least a week or two before I saw results. The fact that it works so quickly is fantastic. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I went from profuse sweating to barely anything to nothing. Within a week. I used to sweat if the air was above 65 well not anymore I don&#x27;t have to worry about wearing a shirt and looking disgusting. I am So happy I found this product.</li>
    <li> It realy works. I like it.</li>
    <li> It took a little bit to come in the mail. I was very excited too try this .. And not so much anymore.. My armpits were on fire!! And I even tried to ride it out thinking it would get better but it only got worse.. Thank god I had cream left over from radiation cause that&#x27;s how bad it blistered.. Plus I could not wear no deodant for a week..</li>
    <li> I have to say it&#x27;s amazing how fast works... the next day i see no suet at all. I used for 3 days and them 2 times a week.. so far so good</li>
    <li> it work good for the body, it also keep the body clean from body odor. this product is good and i recommend for anyone who have a problem with body odor.</li>
    <li> always love this roll on! thanks very much!</li>
    <li> The best antiperspirant I ever tried. This stuff burns/itches a lot so you probably wont like putting it on daily. But every 3 days or so is best once you do a few days. During the summer you will most likely sweat anyway, but a much smaller amount and if you wear an undershirt it will dry very quickly and wont ever be noticed. I was wondering what would happen if I put it on my forehead and wrists....unfortunately it did not work or at least not very well.</li>
    <li> Its effective for me, I&#x27;ve been using this already before! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Extremely effective. Spared me from having a surgery to stop sweating.</li>
    <li> After I used second time my skin was burning. I cant use it was painfull. I dont know what to do</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work as well as I would have liked. I did see some decrease in sweat, but not enough to make me buy the product again.</li>
    <li> so. i sweat like crazy under my armpits no matter how hot or how cold. no matter what color i have on you are able to see all the sweat. it has always been embarrassing and disgusting &amp; stains and my nice shirts. I would try to use powder and deodorants and little home remedies but NOTHING worked.so i googled some times of &amp;#34;deodorants to stop sweaty pits&amp;#34; &amp; this came up  and OMG its everyyyythangggggggggg ! okay like ive been looking for this product all my life !! it is EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m self diagnosed, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I have hyperhydrosis under my armpits. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of methods and antiperspirants, this product is the first one to work. It works almost too well, and I don&#x27;t sweat at all under there. I love it! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this almost two weeks and almost every night. I have noticed a significant decrease in underarm sweat.</li>
    <li> IT worked AMAZINGLY, I strongly recommend this for anyone who sweats a lot, very little itching, just don&#x27;t apply a lot and you should be fine! TOTALLY worth it</li>
    <li> This product works as intended and am very pleased about this purchase.  I cannot express how well this works so long as you use it as instructed.  Apply at night, wash off in the morning, apply deodorant, and enjoy a day not worrying about whether or not sweat will begin to soak your clothing.  I speak about this primarily about underarm sweat.  I am an active person who works out 4 to 5 days a week.  I wear slim fit clothing where the clothes fit snug around my upper body, especially at the armpits.  I have been using this for nearly a week now and am very impressed.  I experience excessive sweating at the armpits that frequently becomes embarrassing in public.  I have had to use tissues to place under my clothing to limit sweat exposure on my clothes.  I frequently had to wear dark clothing in order to mask the sweat.  I have tested this wearing bright clothing and am extremely happy about the results.  The biggest drawback is that if you have any cuts or irritation, this product will find it and it will sting.  The stinging can last for a while.  On one day, I resorted to wiping it off later in the night because the stinging was keeping me up.  The product still worked the following day.  If you can get by this, you will be happy to have found a product that works.  If you experience excessive sweating each and every day you get out of the house for any activity, check this out.  You will be impressed.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm the first times I&#x27;ve used it. It has gotten a little hotter, or maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not applying enough, but it seems to have reduced effect the last few times</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked it very much.It&#x27;s, what I realy need.Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had excessive underarm sweat issues my entire life.  Working in an office environment, I&#x27;ve had to wear darker color shirts to hide it - otherwise I have huge sweat circles under my armpits, which is terribly embarrassing.  I&#x27;ve never found a product that works - I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market.  I finally did an online search for the best antiperspirant and this product came up #1 on a review, so I decided to try it.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  The first day, absolutely NO sweat circles - my armpits were completely dry!  I&#x27;m absolutely amazed!!  I can now wear any color shirt and not worry about the embarrassment of excessive underarm sweat!!</li>
    <li> I swear this is magic! and lasts forever! so worth the money!</li>
    <li> I thought I would never find something that would work to stop me from sweating. I thought about the surgery or even about Botox. It was embarrassing. It does irritate your skin but the results on the next days after using are unbelievable. I couldn&#x27;t believe it was happening, I would go check on the mirror every 20 minutes to see if there was anything under my armpits and there wasn&#x27;t!! Not even a drop of sweat... I stopped using for one week and still worked for three or four days, then I started sweating again but nothing like it used to be. I got my confidence back to wear what I wanted when I wanted. Awesome product, I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Works the first couple times then it&#x27;s back to being sweaty</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing, worked after the first night! Bone dry the next day!. Before using this I refrained from wearing ANY long sleeve tshirts and used to were vests as much as possible. I am a active young women that does a lot of exercise so i never understood why I sweated to much. Just walking through town shopping I would get huge sweat patches and I was so self conscious about it. But since the first day (yes first day!!) I have been loving life and have even purchased loads of new tshirts as it works so well!! After the first night of using it, the next day in events I would normally sweat, there was NOTHING! Bone dry! Definitely recommend this! Life saver.</li>
    <li> Works great to control sweating and odor. I don&#x27;t have to reapply deodorant on hot or stressful days.</li>
    <li> Seriously works! Makes you itch at first but so worth it!</li>
    <li> works mirracles,exactly what it says,watch with sensitive skin</li>
