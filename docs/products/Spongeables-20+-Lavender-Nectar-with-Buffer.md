    <li> I absolutely love these sponges !!!!!!!!!!!  It makes my skin feel so soft to the touch. Men just love to feel it. I buy these all the time and I highly reccomend them to everyone !!!!!!!!! &lt;3 them</li>
    <li> Love my sponges.  Lasts a long time smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> The light aroma of lavender is soothing, and the buffer invigorates blood flow, what&#x27;s NOT to like??</li>
    <li> I saw this in T J Maxx before Christmas and I bought my couple and myself one.  I just ordered 5 more!  People, you will just love this soap!  Just try it once, you will never go back to just bar soap in a wash cloth again.  As you are lathering, you are removing dead skin, leaving such soft skin.  My elbows and knees are so soft, I can&#x27;t believe, I didn&#x27;t do anything extra, just soaped up and rinsed off!  You are going to love it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the spongeables, plus they really soap up big time. Which I always say the more bubbles the cleaner lol. My little girl got a kick out of her little sponge it worked the same was as the big one and she couldn&#x27;t get over not putting anything on it and it soaped up. I also love the fact that on the package it has shown how many washes each sponge has which is really nice to have a estimate. A great item for just to buy or to get someone or even a teen for a gift.</li>
    <li> Love them. Very cersatile &amp; the scent is not too heavy. Wish I could find them in my area retail(originally found in Safeway) the shipping charges online almost double the cost😳</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this item online. I got one spongeables for Christmas and I can&#x27;t find them in any stores in my area. I plan to buy the 3 pack. I might also try some of the other items too.</li>
    <li> This is a soap contained in a sponge which exfoliates and stimulates your circulation leaving you refreshed...I will order more soon!</li>
    <li> Convenient, smart, &amp; makes your skin feel great! Love this product. Glad I can buy it through Amazon as it is no longer sold at Rite Aid.</li>
    <li> These smell great and really lather up, but the best part is the exfoliation.  I always feel so refreshed after using these.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges!  Great scents and excellent exfoliation. Have been using them for a couple of years and will keep on doing so.</li>
    <li> Must buy this product.  I was so impressed, I ordered six more to get me through the rest of the year.  The scrubber is not to rough, and the other side is very soft.  Works well on feet also, but would recommend the pedi scrubbers.  I am outside a lot, collecting a great deal of dirt working in the garden, and this product removers dirt and grime extremely well without drying out the skin.  I was skeptical in the beginning about how long these Spongeables would last, however, I am on my second week of using the product and it still lathers nicely.  Would and will recommend to others.  Lastly, the scent is not overpowering, and very economical.</li>
    <li> This is truly a very nice item. Great smelling soap and love the buffer, I will probably use these forever. Great bargain</li>
    <li> Love love love these.  A sponge with the soap already in it.  Wonderful scent and had a scrubbing side to get the tough spots.  And it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue makes you feel squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> the soap and fragrance last a long time</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. I&#x27;ve seen these other places and this is the best price by far.  Add one to your makeup bag when traveling. All in one clean up!</li>
    <li> Very calming and it last pretty good.</li>
    <li> this is the best product especially for traveling.  the entire family uses them now. so convenient. and they smell great.</li>
