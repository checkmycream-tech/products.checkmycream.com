      <li>I did receive this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
      <li>so I appreciate honesty and will always post my honest review.</li>
      <li>I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to look back in the mirror and see these beautiful results.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this!  </li>
      <li>It works so wonderfully for those furrow lines that I plan to use it regularly, especially when I have somewhere special to go and want to look softened, relaxed, and good.</li>
      <li>I have tried both over and under and neither of them I love.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with putting more on if need be.  </li>
      <li>Many people get Botox to soften those lines.</li>
      <li>I also use Amazon Reviews for most of my purchases (even if I am not purchasing at Amazon)</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how many lines and wrinkles disappeared.  </li>
      <li>I suspect the skin temporarily tightens up to make those lines &amp;#34;invisible.&amp;#34; I was very excited</li>
      <li>When I tried it, I followed the instructions and dotted it lightly on the lines, then I made sure I didn&#x27;t move that area for three minutes.</li>
      <li>Ok, I am baring my make-up free face to show the difference between one eye with this product and one eye without.</li>
      <li>I am excited I was able to test this product for my review.</li>
      <li>I was super excited that I opted in to do a review of this product!</li>
      <li>but I soon got comfortable with it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really amazing and well worth the very reasonable $15.99 that I paid for it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s very easy to put on, and doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of times</li>
      <li>After those three minutes, I could see a significant softening of the area.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as good and the jeunesse instantly ageless.  </li>
      <li>You simply break off a tube twist the top and make sure you apply to a clean face.</li>
      <li>and I certainly need makeup!!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t rub &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; It dries quickly and has no smell.</li>
      <li>I really like this product !!</li>
      <li>But still worth it</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face, laugh lines, etc., but I plan to.</li>
      <li>I think that I was kind of expecting something that would just be like a face cream and not be something that was just going to actually work, immediately...</li>
      <li>so I ordered this for myself right away.</li>
      <li>I did reapply it before going home from work and when I walked in the house my wife noticed right away  </li>
      <li>Shipped fast, product exactly as described..thank you!</li>
      <li>Until now this is the first time trying a Ageless product.</li>
      <li>It would be ironic if the product caused me to shed skin cells and improved my skin under my eyes, but that wasn&#x27;t why I ordered the product!  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t help but think that this is something that is only going to get better over time.</li>
      <li>At first appears to tighten and blur skin.</li>
      <li>great product, last a very long time.</li>
      <li>It is an instant fix and after allowing it to dry completely, I applied an application of BB Cream and definitely noticed a smooth, and flawless texture to my skin.  </li>
      <li>This one differs from Instantly Ageless in that this one doesn&#x27;t leave the whitish film I got from the Instantly Ageless, and trust me, that is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>The gel works but leaves a very noticeable film that you can&#x27;t cover with makeup.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think much about it, but I contacted the company and they immediately sent me a label to return the product.  </li>
      <li>You tell him what I was doing, so much as just be here</li>
      <li>Ok, that&#x27;s extreme.</li>
      <li>I would definitely use the product if I was going to a special function.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 55 year old man who is very self conscience about the bags under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>once I applied the jel like substance to most of my face (as you can see there are lots of wrinkles there), I could feel the tightening as the product dried.  </li>
      <li>definitely think it&#x27;s worth every penny, &amp; I would recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Within a few more minutes, they were almost gone.</li>
      <li>I smile big and it includes my eyes, after smiling awhile, the skin that I tried to tighten loosens some.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to sit there and explain it to him for 45 minutes a new skin regimen.</li>
      <li>I saw instantly, the change to really tighten,lift, and plump up my skin!</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>wow!  </li>
      <li>It does tighten the skin around my eyes but it doesn&#x27;t last a whole day.</li>
      <li>I think this will last longer on him because it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s smiling a whole lot or interacting with a bunch of people and having emotions on his face.</li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.</li>
      <li>8 hours later, and he still looks really young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I simply dabbed of the clear paste on a tip of cotton and applied to my problems areas.</li>
      <li>For the price, and you can compare this to you other ones, but he doesn&#x27;t even take that much.</li>
      <li>My husband is a very serious person, and sits in front of his computer for most of the day.</li>

<li> My husband is a very serious person, and sits in front of his computer for most of the day.</li>
<li> The amount of product in the individual single vial was enough to use on my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area as well.  </li>
<li> In less than five minutes the product was completely dry,and I was amazed at the difference.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it to see what other areas it can help with.</li>
<li> this like &amp;#34;sudden change&amp;#34; leaves a dry residue on skin.</li>
<li> I did apply makeup after it dried and found that I had to be cautious as it caked in spots where I had apparently applied the product</li>
<li> Cannot put moisturizer or foundation over it as it breaks down and dissolves the instant facelift residue on face.</li>
<li> People constantly tell me I look exhausted and that the bags make me look older.  </li>
<li> You can use the same little tube</li>
<li> It totally erased those ugly bags under my eyes and erased those pesky fine lines..</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t work as I had expected.</li>
<li> All packages came empty what a rip off</li>
<li> know that this was going to be as extreme as it was.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to use the other four to see the results.</li>
<li> It felt a bit weird at first</li>
<li> I have tried all kinds of products and have never gotten such a dramatic result almost instantly.  </li>
<li> The lines were visually reduced by at least 50% at that point.</li>
<li> This stuff is amazing..removes wrinkles, dark spots, puffiness and bags under the eyes,  Ive included my before and after photo of my forehead.  </li>
<li> I was seriously thinking about going back to bangs to cover up my forehead</li>
<li> the review is not true</li>
<li> after putting this on one time my skin was so tight.</li>
<li> so I tried a little dot of it on my &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34;, those darn vertical lines between your eyebrows that come from expression, squinting, etc.</li>
<li> I use this mostly to help my under-eye area, gets rid of those ugly bags!</li>
<li> This product softens and minimizes those little lines around the eyes and along lip lines.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> I only used it once, but was not happy with the results.  </li>
<li> A friend mentioned this product and brought in a few samples.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure HOW that happens.</li>
<li> Not sure how this stuff works, but it works.  </li>
<li> that I didn&#x27;t look as beat as usual.  </li>
<li> Place a small amount in your finger and tap the product on, do not rub it in.  </li>
<li> I sent the product off, but noticed now that the skin under my eyes is very dried out and peeling.</li>
<li> Plus, he never understands what I mean anyway, so it&#x27;s frustrating.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a tragic mess.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the review is not true</li>
    <li> I  used one tube &amp; couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes so I made my mom try it also and we both love this product!!! It will be perfect for my wedding day!!!</li>
    <li> Ice. This is so disappointing. It leaves gross residue all over my face. I couldn&#x27;t wear makeup over it. I can&#x27;t even wear it alone it&#x27;s a tragic mess.</li>
    <li> I did notice firmer areas around my eyes after one application. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it to see what other areas it can help with. I was given a discounted price to try this product and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.</li>
    <li> All packages came empty what a rip off</li>
    <li> WOW! after putting this on one time my skin was so tight. I can&#x27;t wait to use the other four to see the results. It was east to apply. I just dabbed it with my finger. Don&#x27;t rub &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; It dries quickly and has no smell. I am excited I was able to test this product for my review. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a different product when I ordered it.  But when it arrived and I put it on, it burned under my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t think much about it, but I contacted the company and they immediately sent me a label to return the product.  I sent the product off, but noticed now that the skin under my eyes is very dried out and peeling. :-(  It would be ironic if the product caused me to shed skin cells and improved my skin under my eyes, but that wasn&#x27;t why I ordered the product!  This product is similar to the 90 second wrinkle eraser you can get at drugstores.  I would not recommend it be used under liquid makeup, as it would likely just wash off or flake.  I only used it once, but was not happy with the results.  The company, however, was wonderful about the return.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. The gel works but leaves a very noticeable film that you can&#x27;t cover with makeup. The moment I put concealer on the gel dissolved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 55 year old man who is very self conscience about the bags under my eyes.  People constantly tell me I look exhausted and that the bags make me look older.  A friend mentioned this product and brought in a few samples.  I dabbed the product on as instructed and felt the skin tighten.  It felt a bit weird at first but I soon got comfortable with it.  Ten minutes later I looked in the mirror and the bags were 90% gone!!!!  I&#x27;m not kidding!  Not sure how this stuff works, but it works.  The only draw back, if it can be called a drawback, is it doesn&#x27;t last all day but several hours.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with putting more on if need be.  I did reapply it before going home from work and when I walked in the house my wife noticed right away  that I didn&#x27;t look as beat as usual.  If they could make the results lasts longer they would have an end all, cure all for baggy eyes.  Very, very pleased!</li>
    <li> I hesitate to show pictures of me without makeup, but you can see a shot of me before using the product and one after using the product.  once I applied the jel like substance to most of my face (as you can see there are lots of wrinkles there), I could feel the tightening as the product dried.  I was amazed at how many lines and wrinkles disappeared.  I would definitely use the product if I was going to a special function.  I did apply makeup after it dried and found that I had to be cautious as it caked in spots where I had apparently applied the product too think.  I use products from Amazon on a regular basis and receive products at a discounted rate in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had some of this so I tried a little dot of it on my &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34;, those darn vertical lines between your eyebrows that come from expression, squinting, etc. Many people get Botox to soften those lines. When I tried it, I followed the instructions and dotted it lightly on the lines, then I made sure I didn&#x27;t move that area for three minutes. After those three minutes, I could see a significant softening of the area. The lines were visually reduced by at least 50% at that point. Within a few more minutes, they were almost gone. I&#x27;m not sure HOW that happens. I suspect the skin temporarily tightens up to make those lines &amp;#34;invisible.&amp;#34; I was very excited so I ordered this for myself right away. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face, laugh lines, etc., but I plan to. It works so wonderfully for those furrow lines that I plan to use it regularly, especially when I have somewhere special to go and want to look softened, relaxed, and good. It&#x27;s really amazing and well worth the very reasonable $15.99 that I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I found this works as well as the more expensive competitor. Will definitely continue using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold!  I have tried all kinds of products and have never gotten such a dramatic result almost instantly.  I applied it under one eye saw some change.  But after I applied it on my forehead which has some deep wrinkles....wow!  I was seriously thinking about going back to bangs to cover up my forehead and I hate bangs...so I&#x27;m sold!  This stuff is amazing..removes wrinkles, dark spots, puffiness and bags under the eyes,  Ive included my before and after photo of my forehead.  I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great! almost instantly!  I use this mostly to help my under-eye area, gets rid of those ugly bags!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the results!  After watching a couple of videos on FB I decided to give it a try.  It totally erased those ugly bags under my eyes and erased those pesky fine lines..I will be using this product from now on!</li>
    <li> great product, last a very long time. I have stubborn brow lines, and I can notice a big difference!!</li>
    <li> So my package came in the mail! I was super excited that I opted in to do a review of this product! You simply break off a tube twist the top and make sure you apply to a clean face. I simply dabbed of the clear paste on a tip of cotton and applied to my problems areas.As it dries very Quickly an no sudden movements or expression.I saw instantly, the change to really tighten,lift, and plump up my skin! I was so happy to look back in the mirror and see these beautiful results. Until now this is the first time trying a Ageless product. I&#x27;m just extremely satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good and the jeunesse instantly ageless.  But still worth it</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, product exactly as described..thank you!</li>
    <li> this like &amp;#34;sudden change&amp;#34; leaves a dry residue on skin. I always use Instantly Ageless&amp;#34; but tryed this . Will keep it for a backup</li>
    <li> Seconds after applying product under and between my eyes, I could feel the tightening, almost like a mask.  In less than five minutes the product was completely dry,and I was amazed at the difference.However,when I went to apply makeupit was very obvious that something else was on my skin. I could not blend my make up so it would not look patchy.  overall, the product does what it says it will do but I would not recommend using make up over it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!  This product softens and minimizes those little lines around the eyes and along lip lines. It is an instant fix and after allowing it to dry completely, I applied an application of BB Cream and definitely noticed a smooth, and flawless texture to my skin.  The amount of product in the individual single vial was enough to use on my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area as well.  If you&#x27;re like me, and want to do everything in my power to maintain that youthfulness appearance, then don&#x27;t hesitate to try this product yourself.</li>
    <li> i have only used it once and it did reduce the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I really like this product !!</li>
    <li> At first appears to tighten and blur skin. Feels like glue on face. Cannot put moisturizer or foundation over it as it breaks down and dissolves the instant facelift residue on face. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Could not get this product to blend. Caked</li>
    <li> Ok, I am baring my make-up free face to show the difference between one eye with this product and one eye without. I am several months away from 50 years of age.  I have used another product, similar to this, called Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse.  The two products are very similar.  You can definitely feel your skin tighten.  You do need to tap the product on.  I knew how to do the Jeunesse product so used it the same way.  There are no instructions that come with this product, you only get the 5 tubes, so I&#x27;ll share how I applied it.  Place a small amount in your finger and tap the product on, do not rub it in.  Then just fan it to speed up the drying time.  You will feel your skin tighten as it dries.  This one differs from Instantly Ageless in that this one doesn&#x27;t leave the whitish film I got from the Instantly Ageless, and trust me, that is a good thing.  The problem I had with both is with smiling.  I smile big and it includes my eyes, after smiling awhile, the skin that I tried to tighten loosens some.  I also have an issue with applying makeup with the product.  I have tried both over and under and neither of them I love.  The best option is over (because you do see some of the product over makeup).  It just seems to lose some of the effectiveness when you put makeup over it.  It does work, as a temporary face lift.  In the photo, the eye on the left (as you look at the picture) has the product.  I did receive this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  I also use Amazon Reviews for most of my purchases (even if I am not purchasing at Amazon) so I appreciate honesty and will always post my honest review.</li>
    <li> I did&#x27;t  know that this was going to be as extreme as it was. I think that I was kind of expecting something that would just be like a face cream and not be something that was just going to actually work, immediately...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on my husband because I do not like testing skin products on myself, and holy crikey mama I definitely saw the man that I used to know! Ok, that&#x27;s extreme. But he looked younger. You tell him what I was doing, so much as just be here and we use your face. And then I handed him a mirror so that he could see what I was doing and he was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s very easy to put on, and doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of times I don&#x27;t have to sit there and explain it to him for 45 minutes a new skin regimen. Who has time for all that? Plus, he never understands what I mean anyway, so it&#x27;s frustrating. With this one, he can do it himself without my help. Men...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t help but think that this is something that is only going to get better over time. I think the results will vary from person to person, only because people have different face movements. My husband is a very serious person, and sits in front of his computer for most of the day. I think this will last longer on him because it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s smiling a whole lot or interacting with a bunch of people and having emotions on his face. 8 hours later, and he still looks really young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wanted to just try out something. For the price, and you can compare this to you other ones, but he doesn&#x27;t even take that much. You can use the same little tube repeatedly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think it&#x27;s worth every penny, &amp; I would recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
    <li> it basically leaves your face feeling numb, but no noticeable difference!</li>
    <li> Cannot wear makeup over product and I certainly need makeup!!</li>
