      <li>I ordered the purple to pink variant of this and loved it.  </li>
      <li>It does chip pretty quickly</li>
      <li>My ONLY problem with it, is that it chips VERY easily.</li>
      <li>But it drys very quickly and is still a greal color, but it didnt turn as light blue as the picture shows.</li>
      <li>The polish doesn&#x27;t stay on natural nails very well, it starts to chip right away even with a top and bottem coat.  </li>
      <li>I used a good top coat and it seemed to last a little longer.</li>
      <li>The color is so pretty, however.</li>

      <li>It is a pretty color</li>
      <li>I gave these as a gift, was told &amp;#34;The nail Polish does not change color, but is still pretty.</li>
      <li>Pretty color</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to trying this every since i saw the movie Aquamarine!</li>
      <li>The paint chips off very easily when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
      <li>Fun new color.  </li>
      <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t change color like one would think from the way it is advertised.</li>
      <li>and it really does work.</li>
      <li>Does Not Change on real nails or aclyillic.</li>
      <li>Very disappoint and</li>
      <li>I bought this for girls at camp and it really does work</li>
      <li>Fast service</li>
      <li>I put another coat on over the area that peeled off only because I just got it done for the mothers day weekend, and would like to have my nails looking nice going back to work and</li>
      <li>Kind of a waste...</li>
      <li>This polish initially starts nice bright blue and quickly becomes a dull blue that NEVER EVER changes color!!!</li>
      <li>tried painting twice and once dry, the paint chips from normal activity on first day!</li>
      <li>It goes on a pretty blue and stays that way.  </li>
      <li>It goes on dull even the salon person notice, and to get any shine you use a top coat.</li>
      <li>You have to squint to really tell that its a different shade.</li>
      <li>but it chips off really quickly and doesnt really last that long</li>
      <li>it got thick very quick</li>
      <li>and I used a very good base coat.  </li>
      <li>you can barely see the difference</li>
      <li>It work for my toes as far as staying on, but peeled off the very next day of my hand.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find mood changing polish, I use to have two a few years ago that would change under hot/cold water, this one doesn&#x27;t, in fact it only changed color once for me, and I wasn&#x27;t doing anything I just looked down</li>

<li> I was so excited to find mood changing polish, I use to have two a few years ago that would change under hot/cold water, this one doesn&#x27;t, in fact it only changed color once for me, and I wasn&#x27;t doing anything I just looked down</li>
<li> The color is flat and rather dull and a not so pretty blue.</li>
<li> I used a white base and than two coats of polish and a glittered top coat, so maybe I did too much and could have taken away from the mood changing formula IDK.</li>
<li> I will try again just using a clear base two coats and a clear top coat and see how it works.</li>
<li> Color change is noticeable, but the color chips off easily and the bottle dried up in a few weeks despite being closed tightly.</li>
<li> Even with a bottom AND top coat, it still chips like crazy.</li>
<li> Stays dark blue no matter what.</li>
<li> Only dull blue.</li>
<li> This one on the other hand, is a dud.  </li>
<li> I know the amount for this is inexpensive, but know to me my opinion it is not worth it.</li>
<li> I can see a slight color difference between cold and hot but not much.</li>
<li> To get it to change I had to run my hand under hot water/put it in cold water to see the change.</li>
<li> I tried running my hands from hot to cold water and the color never changed a shade.</li>
<li> I try cold and hot water but it wont change.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, there was no major color change and chipped off the next morning.  </li>
<li> I could have gotten past that because I still like the color it is, but it chips way easier than my other nail polishes.</li>
<li> waste of money .</li>
<li> Save your money on this one, plain blue nail polish can be purchased a lot less expensively.</li>
<li> And when it does chip chunks of it fall off, not just small pieces.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t change colors, and it was really dull.</li>
<li> but it was hard to tell if it changes.</li>
<li> Sucks peels off in a day</li>
<li> Such a disappointment.</li>
<li> DESCRIPTION IS FALSE.</li>
<li> Does not change color dramaticly.</li>
<li> Stop selling this product its so fake .</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t buy- way too expensive for a defective nail polish.</li>
<li> the color change based on temperature like putting your hand under cold water.</li>
<li> I bought it at Claire&#x27;s and tried it out, but it was terrible!</li>

    <li> I thought that this would be interesting for my granddaughter since she is a teenager but it really doesn&#x27;t change color like one would think from the way it is advertised. The color is flat and rather dull and a not so pretty blue. I would never buy this again thats for sure.</li>
    <li> I ordered the purple to pink variant of this and loved it.  It was so pretty and watching the colour change was a whole lot of fun.  This one on the other hand, is a dud.  It goes on a pretty blue and stays that way.  NO colour change whatsoever, even if you run your hands under hot water.  Save your money on this one, plain blue nail polish can be purchased a lot less expensively.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find mood changing polish, I use to have two a few years ago that would change under hot/cold water, this one doesn&#x27;t, in fact it only changed color once for me, and I wasn&#x27;t doing anything I just looked down and it was the lighter tone. It is a pretty color, Im not going to hassle sending it back lol Im a sucer for blue and I&#x27;ll get some use out of it :)</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to trying this every since i saw the movie Aquamarine! I bought it at Claire&#x27;s and tried it out, but it was terrible! It didn&#x27;t change colors, and it was really dull.</li>
    <li> There was no change in the polish at all</li>
    <li> This nail polish is cool. It does chip pretty quickly but I don&#x27;t mind. I used a good top coat and it seemed to last a little longer.</li>
    <li> peeled off after one day.  color change was not noticeable.</li>
    <li> Used on my pedicure my toes looks nice.</li>
    <li> Does not reallychange colour you can barely see the difference</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! This polish initially starts nice bright blue and quickly becomes a dull blue that NEVER EVER changes color!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, there was no major color change and chipped off the next morning.  Went from air conditioning to heat, no color changes, even in water😢</li>
    <li> Nail polish is cheap and do not stay on.</li>
    <li> Yea, I purchase this one in which I was not at all impressed with.  This one did not, nor was not visibly noticeable to change at all. I even went to get a manicure, pedicure and ask to have this used on my toes and hands. It work for my toes as far as staying on, but peeled off the very next day of my hand. And if your wondering if I had my hands in water a lot no I did not, and honestly even if I did it should not have peeled off the very next day honestly is has. It goes on dull even the salon person notice, and to get any shine you use a top coat. I put another coat on over the area that peeled off only because I just got it done for the mothers day weekend, and would like to have my nails looking nice going back to work and all... I know the amount for this is inexpensive, but know to me my opinion it is not worth it. This is nothing against the seller at all just about the product.</li>
    <li> The color change does not look the sane as the picture</li>
    <li> Never buy this nail polish never changed at all</li>
    <li> Happy just as described</li>
    <li> Good nail polish, I love the color change but unless u out a top coat on top it chips and flakes off.</li>
    <li> Does not change color dramaticly. I can see a slight color difference between cold and hot but not much. I used a white base and than two coats of polish and a glittered top coat, so maybe I did too much and could have taken away from the mood changing formula IDK. I will try again just using a clear base two coats and a clear top coat and see how it works. But it drys very quickly and is still a greal color, but it didnt turn as light blue as the picture shows.</li>
    <li> The color is so pretty, however. Even with a bottom AND top coat, it still chips like crazy. I ended up with some in my food, on my skin and even in my mouth. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I thought the nail color turned with your mood. To get it to change I had to run my hand under hot water/put it in cold water to see the change. Glad it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> It goes on and dries quickly. Color change is noticeable, but the color chips off easily and the bottle dried up in a few weeks despite being closed tightly.</li>
    <li> awesome product. me likey.</li>
    <li> I dont recommend it. I cant get it to change colors. I try cold and hot water but it wont change.</li>
    <li> Does Not Change on real nails or aclyillic. Very disappoint and I d o my nails a lot. I have learned to read the reviews after this.</li>

    <li> I bought this for girls at camp and it really does work you just have to have an in the sun !</li>
    <li> It shipped fast and I love the color that it starts as and changes too. My ONLY problem with it, is that it chips VERY easily.</li>
    <li> DESCRIPTION IS FALSE. the color change based on temperature like putting your hand under cold water.</li>
    <li> Bought the blue- purple. Total scam. Doesn&#x27;t change color. Only dull blue. Don&#x27;t buy- way too expensive for a defective nail polish.</li>
    <li> Fun new color.  Delivered exactly as promised in good shape.  Good value for your dollar.  Great color and unique idea.</li>
    <li> no color change at all</li>
    <li> I tried running my hands from hot to cold water and the color never changed a shade. I could have gotten past that because I still like the color it is, but it chips way easier than my other nail polishes. And when it does chip chunks of it fall off, not just small pieces. Kind of a waste...</li>
    <li> doesnt have as noticable of a difference as it shows its suppose to</li>
    <li> I love the concept of the polish. It does change color like it says.  The polish doesn&#x27;t stay on natural nails very well, it starts to chip right away even with a top and bottem coat.  However, stayed on my acrylic nails for 2wks.</li>
    <li> Sucks peels off in a day</li>
    <li> I have receive the item and love it, I look the same as the picture and the polish change colour just exactly as what the shop describe</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does</li>

    <li> i liked it &amp; does change color like it say it does but it chips off really quickly and doesnt really last that long</li>
    <li> Ehhh. I like the color, but the differnce is nowhere that signicant. You have to squint to really tell that its a different shade. Sparkly though, but not so \\&quot;moody.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product did not change colors.  Stays dark blue no matter what.</li>
    <li> After one day this turned my nails orange and I used a very good base coat.  I had to order a bleach cleaner for my nails to get rid of the orange.</li>
    <li> Unique and really meet expectation !</li>
    <li> The paint chips off very easily when it&#x27;s dry. tried painting twice and once dry, the paint chips from normal activity on first day!</li>
    <li> Pretty color but it was hard to tell if it changes.</li>
