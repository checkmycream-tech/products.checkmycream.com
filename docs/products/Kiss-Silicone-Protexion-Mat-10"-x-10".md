      <li>This product arrived incredibly quickly, and it serves the purpose that I purchased it for.</li>
      <li>This does what it is advertised to do, can be folded up and put away, and looks a lot better on my bathroom counter than the hand towels I normally use.</li>
      <li>perfect for someone like me who always worries if I left the flat iron on</li>
      <li>Perfect little silicone mat to protect our counter top from heat damage from curling or flat irons.  </li>
      <li>With two mats I am able to comfortable fit my 1&amp;#34; flat iron, 1&amp;#34; inch tapered wand, 1&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tested it with straight heat from my curler and it seems to handle it perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large enough to be able to lay two appliances side by side without touching your counter.</li>
      <li>Nice and big.</li>
      <li>I was waiting for this product well worth the wait</li>
      <li>works as described and quite useful</li>
      <li>The price was right and does the job.</li>
      <li>This is pretty good and nice to make sure you can put your flat iron or curling iron down without burning something - I got it because I didn&#x27;t trust my teenage girls to not wreck something -</li>
      <li>BUT I have to say that things underneath it still get amazingly hot.  </li>
      <li>Works exactly as it should.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to anyone!!</li>
      <li>If you use any type of hot hair tool, this item is a must.</li>

      <li>This mat is pretty large.  </li>
      <li>Simple and easy.</li>
      <li>I have a large curling iron and three differently sized flat irons that fit easily on the mat.</li>
      <li>It is easily washable and will lay completely flat, even if you store it rolled up.</li>
      <li>I believe I still could&#x27;ve fit at least 1 more wand.</li>
      <li>very practical.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works perfect. Doesn&#x27;t overheat or burn and unrolls flat</li>
    <li> Perfect little silicone mat to protect our counter top from heat damage from curling or flat irons.  It&#x27;s large enough to be able to lay two appliances side by side without touching your counter.</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist, this mat comes in handy! Good for wands, curling irons and straighteners! Both in and out of the salon usage. Can withstand heat and won&#x27;t burn any surfaces! Would highly recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for protecting any surface.  I had my waver at 250 and no marks on my white vanity table.  Super fast shipping and great price.  I always check and do my research before purchasing.</li>
    <li> I have granite countertops in my bathroom.  Perfect size and thickness to protect countertop.  It was in a box, but rolled out perfectly flat.</li>
    <li> Great mat...Great service</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my blow dryer to stay on the counter!!</li>
    <li> works as described and quite useful</li>
    <li> This product does protect against heat but it is hard to clean. Dust and other particles such as hair gets stuck to it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Does what it says on the box. No worries so far.</li>
    <li> This does what it is advertised to do, can be folded up and put away, and looks a lot better on my bathroom counter than the hand towels I normally use. It is easily washable and will lay completely flat, even if you store it rolled up. I would definitely recommend this to prevent burnt countertops.</li>
    <li> This is a good sized silicone mat that sits on my vanity and provides me with a safe place to rest my curling iron or straightener without burning the table top.  It seems to serve this purpose nicely.  I will buy another for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I should have bought one of these years ago. This items works great. I have a large curling iron and three differently sized flat irons that fit easily on the mat. If you use any type of hot hair tool, this item is a must.</li>
    <li> perfect for someone like me who always worries if I left the flat iron on</li>
    <li> Nice, thick mat and my daughter loves it. It protects her vanity really well. I may buy another one for better coverage.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Works as expected. I was pleasantly surprised how handy this product is. If you have teenage girls, this is a definite counter saver.</li>
    <li> Nice and big. It works well.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good and nice to make sure you can put your flat iron or curling iron down without burning something - I got it because I didn&#x27;t trust my teenage girls to not wreck something - BUT I have to say that things underneath it still get amazingly hot.  I would be careful still to not put this on something that couldn&#x27;t take a high level of heat.  I wouldn&#x27;t want it on a wood table with a nice finish, for example.</li>
    <li> Love this! Although I started to use it to hold drinks on my night stand so I don&#x27;t leave white rings on the wood.</li>
    <li> This works great, good size and keeps your hot curling or flat iron from burning your surfaces. I wish it came in white or other colors besides black. I rated it 4 stars because it is so utilitarian looking.</li>
    <li> Works awesome!! Has enough room for me to put two hair appliances on it at a time. Both my straightener and a curling iron if needed. I&#x27;ve tested it with straight heat from my curler and it seems to handle it perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for this mat.  This mat is pretty large.  I can&#x27;t seem to find a cheaper alternative IN STORE, except when going into Ulta recently but it was smaller.  I havent used it just yet though...</li>
    <li> Bought one for my daughter to use for her BaByliss 1 1/2&amp;#34; flat iron. It&#x27;s the perfect size for her vanity. Bought another for my sister. She cut it in half and gave one half to her daughter. Works great!</li>
    <li> Love the look, easy to clean, non slip... Recommended</li>
    <li> works great...only downfall is it is hard for me to store, won&#x27;t stay rolled up. it needs a hole or loop in one of the corner ends so that i can hang it on a hook for storage.</li>
    <li> I protect my counter top with this. Great protection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m that person who always forgets to turn off her flat iron in the morning and doesn&#x27;t remember until getting all the way out to the car. Then when I go back inside to turn it off (making myself late for work), 9 times out of 10 I find that I did turn it off but I had forgotten. To solve this problem, I purchased this mat along with an outlet timer (one that I can set to one hour). I turn on the flat iron at the outlet and rest it on the mat. Then, even if I forget to turn it off, the timer will turn off the outlet. And just in case, if something happens and the outlet doesn&#x27;t turn the flat iron off, the mat will protect the counter. (Don&#x27;t act like this is irrational—I&#x27;m sure that almost everyone who uses a flat iron on a regular basis worries about this!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to have peace of mind (and a better attendance record at work), I highly recommend this mat!</li>
    <li> My order arrived quickly and just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Keeps all your surfaces protected from flat irons, hairdryers, and curlers. A little expensive for what it is though, but I like it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> My wife loved it so much she ordered it for my daughter, sister in law  and mother in law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why someone did not think about this before amazes me.</li>
    <li> Love this to prevent any burn marks on counter</li>
    <li> I fit 3 of my curling irons/wands on this mat with no problem. 19in Nume wand, 1 1/4 in conair curling iron,&amp; Nume reverse wand. I believe I still could&#x27;ve fit at least 1 more wand. Definitely withstands the heat of my wands (Nume&#x27;s go up to 400+ degree temps) &amp; protects the surface of my dresser. Perfect for what it&#x27;s made for :)</li>
    <li> Love these mats, I bought two. Now my hair straightener can be placed down with no fear. Good Purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am super happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s sleek and looks nice in my hair set up when I&#x27;m on set.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be too small, but it fits a curling iron and straightener with plenty of room.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the heat off of my dresser when in use and for the occasional times the straightener is left on...</li>
    <li> This mat is big enough for up to 2 items... flat iron and curly iron... yes, I do use both sometimes!</li>
    <li> perfect.  especially if you have a granite, laminate, or porcelain sink.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Good price!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should. Nice and thick protective layer.</li>
    <li> Larger than I expected, but just what I needed!</li>
    <li> It is a nice grip for my clippers but the bottom slides around so what&#x27;s the big idea!</li>
    <li> keeps my dresser safe!</li>
    <li> Love this mat for curling irons. It&#x27;s super thin, so it doesn&#x27;t bulk up your counter space and it&#x27;s relatively easy to slide something on top of it if needed. Will be ordering another one!</li>
    <li> Love it! Affordable and perfect fit for my tray.</li>
    <li> I know this is meant for salon or home haircare use, but I use it under a potted plant and it is fantastic. It controls any spillage of water and makes it hard for people who bump the plant to knock it over.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. Mind you i am a man and i got this for my wife IT HAS SAVED ME MUCH AGGRAVATION. As i sit on my couch watching tv and drinking beer waiting for her to get ready i no longer have to get up and hold her hair iron for her any more.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this mat!!</li>
    <li> Protects my counter tops and allows me to sit my double-sided straightener down anywhere. Doesn&#x27;t slip and rolls up easily for storage.</li>
    <li> i have one in every room of the house that i may possibly need to use an iron or deep waver in. everyone should have one--  washes easily</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Nice size, works great with heat, love it!</li>
    <li> What an exceptional product you have... my daughters were constantly leaving \\&quot;hot\\&quot; marks on their dresser from their curling iron, straightener, and hair dryer... not any more!! These mats are an excellent protector!</li>
    <li> i recently purchased this heat protectant may because I tend to set all my hot tools on my counter top and they&#x27;ve been known to leave marks. This may is a perfect size, a little bigger than a mouse pad, I reckon, but it fits perfectly on my countertop and protects well. I think it&#x27;s perfect especially for the price. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Really like this mat. Very sturdy and heavy and we&#x27;ll made. Works great with any hot tool I put on it. Top notch protection for whatever you need to rest your hot irons on.</li>
    <li> Wish it was bigger but works great</li>
    <li> very practical. love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few days now and love that my bathroom countertop is protected. Good product! Great delivery!</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed in my bathroom for my flat iron. I have a new counter and wanted to protect it as much as possible. This works great and is big enough but not too big to take up too much room.</li>
    <li> I was waiting for this product well worth the wait</li>
    <li> I am an On-Location Hair &amp; Makeup Artist and I needed a mat for my curlers and wands. Love this...especially love the price. It&#x27;s thin, durable, and I can roll my hot tools up in it when I&#x27;m done and packing up so as to not damage my hair case. I would suggest getting two if you are like me and have multiple tools going at the same time. With two mats I am able to comfortable fit my 1&amp;#34; flat iron, 1&amp;#34; inch tapered wand, 1&amp;#34; wand, 1 3/4&amp;#34; clipper curler, and my 3/4&amp;#34; clipper curler with enough room for another tool.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what I did without it!</li>
    <li> This product arrived incredibly quickly, and it serves the purpose that I purchased it for. I also like the aesthetic qualities of this protection mat, as it has little squares and it appealing to the eye overall. It protects my surfaces really well, and is holding up over time.</li>
    <li> I have limited counter space so when I am done with my flat iron I need to put it away on a shelf in the cabinet. This fits perfectly on the shelf and I could even use it on the counter if needed. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about and damage or a possible fire hazard.</li>
    <li> no problems. Works well</li>
    <li> I was worried this would be too small, but it&#x27;s just right. I can fit both a curling wand and a flat iron on it at the same time. The textured pattern keeps things from sliding off (and from burning you or your stuff). Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Best way to protect my wooden furniture. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it everyday. Really does the job!</li>
    <li> Got for my sis in law for Xmas as she had wanted one to protect their dresser from the flat iron. The price was right and does the job.</li>
    <li> This is great it&#x27;s big enough for me to put a large curling iron And straightener on and I know none of the heat is going to mess up my dresser</li>
    <li> Perfect for use with hot combs, curling irons or heated hair accessories.  It rolls up easily when not in use.  Simple and easy.</li>
