    <li> I ordered this item looking for a cheap matte nude lip stick. I got it pretty quick. I used it that day. Its a peachy nude pink kind of color it has a fruity citrus type of smell to it. The only con to it is because its matte is shows the lines in your lips but as long as you exfoliate and use a lip balm before you use it. I looks really good.</li>
    <li> very drying. flaky. beautiful color though. just don&#x27;t like application.</li>
    <li> This color is perfect and complements all my dramatic eye looks it really brings the look together. It glids on smooth and wears good through out the day.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a lip liner when I ordered it but it&#x27;s actually a lip color. It is still a very pretty nude color and a good base color under gloss. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this matte color! I blend it with a darker lip liner and it looks awesome</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s probably more my problem, but it wasn&#x27;t a good color for me.  Goes on well and stays an okay amount of time.</li>

    <li> I like this pencil type of lipstick! It uses, when erasing color clever of a lip! Therefore, even if this lip can be used at any time and piles up favorite lips, such as a gross, from a top, it is lovely.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and has a ton of pigment. Great for the price. Recommended for sure! Has kind of a sweet taste, so if that kind of thing bothers you, don&#x27;t buy this. Also, comes off pretty easily, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last for this price.</li>
