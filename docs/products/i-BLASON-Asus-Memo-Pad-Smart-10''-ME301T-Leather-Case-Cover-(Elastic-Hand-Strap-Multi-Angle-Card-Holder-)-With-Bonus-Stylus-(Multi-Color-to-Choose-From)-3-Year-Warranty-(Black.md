<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it except for pen broke right away</li>
    <li> This is great quality case for the price. The multifunction stylus/ pen is not so bad for what its worth, but really have no use for it. The finger is more effective. I guess it will help if you pick your nose a lot and prevent you from wiping boogers on your screen. But you don&#x27;t have to worry about it scratching the glass on the Memo Pad :-)</li>
    <li> The ASUS MeMO tablet fits perfectly in it and the controls are all reachable.  It protected the tablet when it fell off a table onto a carpeted floor. The front flips open easily and is held in a closed position by a magnet.</li>
    <li> Good case and works nicely.</li>
    <li> I love this tablet cover. It fits my Asus Memo Smartpad 10&amp;#34; perfectly with holes in all the right places.  It&#x27;s snug and looks like I paid way more than under $20 bucks for this thing.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> For the money this is a good case. I was looking for something that would offer some protection from an accidental fall but this wouldn&#x27;t help much especially if landed a corner.</li>
    <li> This product met and surpassed all of my expectations.  Cameras work with case on.  No problems to report.  This case was $10 less than the one I purchased at Sam&#x27;s which didn&#x27;t accommodate the cameras&#x27; operations.</li>
    <li> I use it daily and so far it has protected my Asus Memo Pad well.</li>
    <li> The cover is well made, fits the tablet good and looks like it will provide protection for the tablet for a long time.</li>
    <li> Mine has a light brown/sand color interior. So much for black on black! other than that, decent case for the money. I&#x27;d still buy it if it were displayed black/sand.</li>
    <li> Ordered this while I ordered my memo pad. I have this on my Memo pad since day 1 and have found it very useful. Firstly it is one of cheapest &amp; best casing available out there. I tried look for one in best buy and they were all expensive. The quality of the casing is also really good. I would have loved if they had adjustable angular hooks at the back so the tablet can be placed in different viewing angles as desired.</li>
    <li> It provides a good deal of protection to the tablet but it is kind of clumsy to hold in the open opsition.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom&#x27;s tablet. She&#x27;s a small lady and the tablet is kinda big. She uses the handle and the stand for this case. None of the ports or the power button are covered. Basically works very well with the Memo Paid 10.1</li>
    <li> The case fits my Asus Memo pad perfectly.  Well made.  The only thing I removed was the pen as it kept getting in the way.</li>
    <li> Before I found this I bought a cover from a brick and mortar for $15.00. Essentially it was 2 pieces of cardboard like material covered in cheap vinyl that wrapped around your tablet. What ever. Then I got smart and found this one on Amazon for the same price plus it came with a stylus! The leather stitched shell is beyond my expectations for $15 bucks. Interior is like a crushed velvet, not sure of the correct material name but nice to the touch. The cover is made not to cover any device features such as camera, speaker and on/off switches. There is a magnet to help keep the cover in place when not using your tablet, nice touch. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This cover actually fit my new tablet perfectly, all the ports have more than enough space and the device feels well protected.</li>
    <li> My son bought me an Asus Smart Memo 10.1&#x27;&#x27; pad from his very first job. He worked very hard unloding trucks at a local retailer and just wanted to earn extra money before going back to college. This is my first tablet and considering what he did to buy this for me I want to take good care of it. So I went to buy a case for it. I went to 2 Best Buys and 3 Walmarts, both of who sell this model only to find they carried absolutely NO accessories! And to make matters worse the wanted to sell me something that didn&#x27;t fit and ran from $40 to over $100.00!! ARE YOU SERIOUS?? So I went on Amazon, found this one, ordered it and paid less than half. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Carrying handle sewed on inside of case. I think the one I received was defective. Sent it back and got a quick refund. I did like the stylus and may reorder a new one.</li>
    <li> It fits the tablet snugly, and in its task of making it less likely your tablet will be dropped it does well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few minor complaints keeping me from adding that 5th star.&lt;br /&gt;1) There should be a handle along the spine when the case is closed. To make it easier to carry it.&lt;br /&gt;2) The pouches on the inside for credit cards seem to be a very bad decision to me. Anytime the case is open they will be exposed to the preying eyes of others. And when closed they are tapping against the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every other way I am enjoying this case. A great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Surprised that some reviews stated they&#x27;re 10 inch tablet did not fit but my 10 inch jelly bean did. Have had it a month now no complaints.</li>
    <li> Very nice design, good quality and cheap price.  This is exactly I am looking for my ASUS Memo Pad case.</li>
    <li> This is my second case cover as I bought another Asus Memo Pad,,,and the first one worked so well, it gave me a feeling of surety should I accidentally bump the tablet...it&#x27;s design is perfect for my hands and the stand alone feature works well for me</li>
    <li> Received a case the same as description. Pretty handy as I am using it. It could be better if the strut on the back is adjustable.</li>
    <li> Most aspects are good but a niche in the upper corner would avoid the extreme difficulty of accessing the on/ off button while cover is installed.  Pen is handy</li>
    <li> Great value for well made product</li>
    <li> I Very good and fast deliveryI Very good and fast delivery</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably not the most convenient out there (I&#x27;ve seen one that allows for holding the tablet both portrait and landscape in the propped position), but it feels well-made. It holds the MeMo snugly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prop angle is a little more vertical than I would like when it sits on a table, but I&#x27;m a taller individual who needs it to face up a little more. As a free bonus, the stylus was great until I lost it. Once I put a screen cover on, it had a little trouble reading properly all the time, but I&#x27;ve had the same issue with my own finger, so I can&#x27;t blame the stylus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the value of this product is amazing considering what you get. I have some wishes, but no complaints.</li>
    <li> Why pay more to protect your tablet this cover with a screen protector is all you need to do it</li>
    <li> This is a really nice case and I like it a lot. The only drawback is that it covers the USB charging port partially on mine, making it hard to plug in. Other than that, it fits great and is a very nice case. I like it enough that I&#x27;ll live with the charging port issue.</li>
    <li> The tablet fits OK and i like the functionality. It should be noted, however, that this is a generic 10&amp;#34; case and not made specifically for this tablet. For instance, when in the case the micro USB is covered so the tablet has to be slid out of the case a couple inches in order to charge it. Kind of annoying. Also, the speaker holes in the back do not actually line up with the speakers on the tablet, reducing the volume level.</li>
    <li> The grand kids love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, sturdy.  Works great.  Had for over 6 months now and had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Seller very responsive with quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy!  Not too much money and just right for what I wanted!  I really enjoy the stylus/pen that it comes with!</li>
    <li> This one is a great sturdy cheap case that holds up nicely. We&#x27;ve had others that wear quickly. The only issue is on an Asus the charger slot is really close to the case strap and if it bothers you it needs to be trimmed without cutting the stitching. It&#x27;s a great case otherwise.</li>
    <li> It a sturdy and functinal cover.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful cover. Description matches the item I received and got it when promised.</li>
    <li> I used it for over a year and I think it worked okay. For most of the year that I used it, there were only minor annoyances when using it but I still would have given it 4 or 5 stars. Recently, however, the case&#x27;s true Achilles&#x27; heel was revealed. I was getting my son out of the car and, my hands already full of stuff, he asked me to take it. In a moment of surprisingly useless worry, I closed the cover of it before taking it. About 10 seconds later, I dropped it (believe it or not, this was the first time that anyone in the family had actually dropped it) and the unprotected corner of my tablet hit the unforgiving sidewalk. This created a hairline crack that wasn&#x27;t a problem the first day but by the second day developed into a tablet that doesn&#x27;t respond to my touch. For my new tablet, I&#x27;m trying to find a case that protects corners too, or I will modify an existing case with some foam or something.</li>
    <li> This case is high quelity . fit&#x27;s perfectly on the Tablet. grate product for it&#x27;s price. recommanded. go and buy.</li>
    <li> Looked on line for a case for my 10 inch asus and came across these reviews.  I have to say that this is a great case for money, fit and the stylist is a great bonus. I saw on some of the comments people complained about not having access to the chaging port. It is very accessible on my tablet everything lined up perfect!! It is acutely better than i expected!!</li>
    <li> For the price, this case is fenomenal,  good quality, fits exactly on the tablet. The only draw back is the that the power button is a little hidden and hard to find, but I think is mostly the tablet&#x27;s design.</li>
    <li> The quality of leather was much nicer than I expected and the card holder is a lot more useful than you would think! I also loved the stylus; great quality and the pen on the other end writes amazing. I&#x27;m a student that takes a lot of notes and uses my tablet for powerpoints and these products make my life much easier.</li>
    <li> Good Cover and came as expected</li>
    <li> Nice product, ellegant and durable</li>
    <li> Terrific leather case that looks good and does a great job of protecting the tablet. The stylus leaves something to be desired, however it is easy enough to replace with something more functional. The case is definitely worth investing in and I would purchase another without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Nice case for my pad. It fits and feels nice, specially because of the holes for everything such as buttons, camera, mic, and so on. I love the hand strap a lot!!! You feel safety while using the strap, but don&#x27;t surprise yourself if you get tired at the moment, even if the tablet is lightweight...&lt;br /&gt;Those slots for cards are a bit tight, but actually I haven&#x27;t used them yet, however, it feels that when something enters, it won&#x27;t exit easily as you&#x27;d expect, but well, think about being worried if any card might fall from there... I wish I could store a micro sd card in the small slot, but, altough if possible, I tried, but because of the tiny size of the sd card, it could fall from the other edge behind. I bet you would not be risking your data that way, specially if you have a 32gb card!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stylus is great, but not for daily usage. Mind using it just when necessary. Hehe, there&#x27;s a pen on the other side of the stylus!!&lt;br /&gt;Next, the fabric stinks, but you&#x27;d get used to it...&lt;br /&gt;But anyway this case is the perfect choice to protect your pad against everything, also to stand it up, haha, and this is the best of all for the Memo Pad!!</li>
    <li> great case for memo. fits it like a glove. price is right. you cant go wrong with this case. one.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product in everything. Quality - excellent! Reasonable price. Buy you enjoy. Recommend. Do you really like it and will not regret making a purchase.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and a perfect fit.  Easy to use and the strap is staying tight. It serves its purpose at a good price - good purchase.</li>
    <li> I can not believe they are selling this item so cheap, anywhere else it would sell for over $50. The case fits perfectly on the table. The material is excellent.The handle is very convenient for reading or watching videos. The holder for the stylus is ideal since before  buying this case I was always misplacing it. Would recommend this item to everyone, delivery was fast and product would not dissapoint.</li>
    <li> I ordered this case and had it shipped two day shipping. The case arrived as expected without any delays. The case fits the Asus Memo Pad Smart 301T 10.1&amp;#34; tablet perfectly. All the controls, camera etc. are exposed for access. I would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> The plus to this cover is that it has cut outs for the sounds and camera.  The downside is that the hand hold can be hard to get hand into and it can be flimsy.  However, it does what one needs and stands up nicely.</li>
    <li> The case fit perfectly and it does not have any problem like it previously stated...&lt;br /&gt;the camera hole fit nicely and i do not need to remove the cover just to charge the tab... but the hand-grip rubber band is a bit not secure... overall it is good...</li>
    <li> The cover fits well and provides good support when set up in &amp;#34;easel&amp;#34; mode. The cover provides excellent protection for the large glass touch surface. The holes are in the right places and sound is good with the cover on. Don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> This has inside, velcro straps that wrap around the unit so that it does not shift at all, love that part of the design. Compared to an $80 (though genuine leather) case I bought for my other tablet, this one is a better value deal becuase of the fit and no shifting within it. The PU leather of htis case is thicker than some of the other low cost cases and adheres to the substrate well. Its only a month old, I anticipate that it may fray at the corner/edges over a long period of time (and I could be wrong about that), but overall, a very nice value product.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this product was available because the tablet is very new. I like it a lot. It fits my needs and the stylus/pen is a bonus.</li>
    <li> So far so good love it nice leather beautiful color it fits my pad perfectly.  Did know stylus was a pen also.</li>
    <li> excellent case. you will find a cup of places for your personal bussines card (could be bigger) and for your microsd card... NOT for SD card, cause is to tiny for SD. Anyway, just PERFECT in orden to care your Asus Memo Pad 10&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Really nice case if you are on a budget and would not like to shell out more than $15 for a case.</li>
    <li> The case is slightly too big, allowing the tablet to slide around inside the case.  When the tablet is pushed back into a position that the full screen is visibleit covers buttons (like the sleep/power button) to the point you can&#x27;t press them.  Otherwise it functioned as any other case of this design functions.</li>
    <li> I just love this case cover for my tablet. It fits perfectly and is attractive too. This cover is a definite must have for your tablet! It offers great protection for the screen, when you aren&#x27;t using it and protects the body of the tablet when you are using it. The price was very reasonable and the quality was excellent! A great buy for the money!</li>
    <li> This case fits my Asus MeMo 301T Pad exactly, it has all the proper openings, meaning I can charge the tablet while in the case. It looks very well made and includes a stylus holder with free stylus.  Two velcro tabs keep the tablet secured in the case even when the case is opened. The other thing I really liked was that the case folds back and slides into a very unobtrusive flap on the back of the case which makes the case into a stand for watching videos or slide shows when it is sitting on a table. Bought this case to protect my Asus when travelling and I can&#x27;t think of any other features I need. Also bought the i-Blason screen protector made for this tablet. Perfect! Would highly recommend this companies&#x27; products to anyone.</li>
    <li> Slender look - multi-faceted. sits up nice - sturdy.. i like it much better thsn the poetic slimeline case i bought at first.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these cases for my tablet and loved so ordered one for my husband. We are VERY PLEASED with both the product and the excellent service on our order! Will highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The case is very nice.  good quality leather, and is well made and stitched well.&lt;br /&gt;Fits the ASUS tablet like a glove. Excellent case.</li>
    <li> This case is a perfect fit and great protection for your Asus 10&amp;#34; MEMO Tablet. It is a bit heavy but very solid protection for the screen.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this case cover. Fits perfectly. It was confusing which to pick on the web and glad i pick this one.</li>
    <li> makes wife happy!! Nuff said</li>
    <li> I love the cover but it did not quite fit our &amp;#34;Asus tablet&amp;#34;.  I had to place foam inserts around the case to hold it tight and making sure both camera lens were in position to take photos.</li>
    <li> Nice cover for the Asus Memopad FHD10. Fits perfectly, except for a small piece covering part of the USB power port. This is easly corrected with a pair of scissors as mentioned in other reviews here. The other problem is even though it can be used to stand up the tablet so you can watch videos and stuff other than that it only lays flat so laying it down with a slight angle for typing is not really possible, bummer. By the way it looks great and has a great price.  We did like it enough to get 2 of them.</li>
    <li> Looks good, feels good In your hands. You can charge it in the cover and have access to all controls</li>
    <li> I really like the cover. I would buy again. The only con is the pocket for the memory card is way too tight to use.</li>
    <li> I own a lot of tablets (as I own a tablet review site) and I have to admit this was one of the best covers I have purchased. The Asus Memo Pad is a really good tablet and this case is a great match. The stylus is a nice feature, but isn&#x27;t really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Nice leather case, holds credit cards, memory cards, and fits the tablet nicely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I honestly can&#x27;t think of any. For the price, there really aren&#x27;t any cons.</li>
    <li> This case was everything I thought it would be and unlike the one I bought for my Dell, it came with stylus.</li>
    <li> I love this tablet. It is very inexpensive, and serves the purpose.</li>
    <li> handle and cardholder are on inside of case so basically useless  and doesn&#x27;t sit up like picture</li>
    <li> good..sturdy..attractive</li>
    <li> Got an ASUS MeMO tablet for the wife this mothers day.  This cover was part of a &amp;#34;bundle deal&amp;#34;.  I knew I wanted the tablet for my wife, but was unsure of the quality of the other stuff in the bundle.  Well I was very surprised and pleased at the quality of this case!!!  Looks great, feels good in your hands, the hand strap is great.  Very soft supple material that will not damage the tablet.  Also, all buttons, ports (even the speakers on the back!) and camera are easy to get to and not obscured.  The included stylus could be heavier, but that&#x27;s a non-issue, the stylus works great and my wife uses it all the time.  She says that the stylus pen writes great too and I noticed it takes standard refills that are easy to get anywhere.  So this was definitely a &amp;#34;WIN&amp;#34;.  This looks and feels a lot more expensive than what I actually paid.  My wife is completely satisfied with this and so am I.  I would certainly recommend this to anyone with this particular model tablet.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this case when it arrive. Fit was good and seams like it will last a long time. Good access to all ports/buttons/camera opening.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a tablet before, so I needed to figure out the machine before I could figure out the protective cover. Once all that was done, I found the cover to be stylish and highly functional. All of the openings for access to the cameras, the power switch, the ports, and so on, are exactly where they are supposed to be, and the cover also prevents the screen protector from lifting at the edges. There are also pockets for a few business cards and a pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was confused by the placement of the elastic handle. From the advertising picture, I imagined it to be on the outside of the cover, to be used as a carrying strap. It is actually on the inside, and is highly functional when I want to hold the tablet horizontally and do not have a solid surface to rest it on - I just slide my hand into the handle and balance the tablet that way.</li>
    <li> I am glad I chose this case. Price was great.  All the ports, speakers and cameras are perfectly exposed. Easy to tell this case was made specifically for the tablet.</li>
    <li> It is a tad bit big for example if it&#x27;s not sitting right it gets in the way of the camera. Easily fixed though and doesnt cause a huge problem or annoyance.</li>
    <li> I like it. Looks good. Build quality is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;Would have liked a vertically standing option as well with the horizontal one better.</li>
    <li> best case to put my tablet in also my cards</li>
    <li> I do like this case, there is nothing fancy about it, but it does appear to have a solid tight appearance w/ the threading and all. You can&#x27;t bet the price for what it is.  The stylus is a nice touch for free too.  I use it a whole lot more then I though I would.  Overall cant beat the price for this product.  It is advertised all black, but the interior is grey.  Which I actually like better!!  I am thrilled about my case!!  Fits my Asus tablet perfect!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to go on a tablet I purchased as a gift.  So far I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.  It didn&#x27;t look cheap and seemed pretty durable so I expect it to hold up for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;o Fits perfect&lt;br /&gt;o Nice speaker slots&lt;br /&gt;o Easy access to all buttons and ports&lt;br /&gt;o Horizontal stand position seems sturdy enough&lt;br /&gt;o Stylus works&lt;br /&gt;o Not too heavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;o No vertical stand position&lt;br /&gt;o Case not too sturdy when using hand hold. Seems to bend and flex at seams.&lt;br /&gt;o Needs to have a way to secure the cover when open&lt;br /&gt;o Not sure if I like the hard leather like business card, MicroSD card and hand hold on the screen when closed</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Memo Pad 10 and was looking for a cover. Not many options are available . May be coz this one is not a popular tablet. Decided to go ahead with the i Blason Leather case cover. Overall the cover looks good. Looks more like the leather cover on diaries. Can&#x27;t say if its genuine leather or not.&lt;br /&gt;It fits the tablet PERFECTLY.  Looks sturdy . But it makes the tablet heavy. Memo Pad is quite a light weight tablet. BUt now its a lil heavy to hold in one hand.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that it comes with a Stylus Pen. And so far the stylus works fine .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 4 stars for the overall look and quality.</li>
    <li> Just got my Asus memo smart pad and needed something to cover and protect this pad. I searched around for a decent case/cover and found this one. I&#x27;m using it right now and it feels great in your hand. I thought it was going to look cheap and feel cheep but it doesnt . Has cut outs in the right places for speakers,cameras,and inputs. Like the business card holder and the stylus/pen is actually well built too. I like how the screen cover is magnetically clasped so its easy to close. The angle that the pad sits at when on the kick stand is great. Watched Netflix on the couch in a hotel recently and sat it on the table. Could hear great and see great with my head on the arm rest. Seems durable but only time will tell. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed with this case unless you get one that is defective or you are a nit picker.</li>
