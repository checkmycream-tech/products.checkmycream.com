      <li>This is by far my favorite by bath and body works!This is by far my favorite by bath and body works!</li>
      <li>Brown sugar and fig is what they name this product, but what I smell is a very strong coconut scent, and it&#x27;s very generic.</li>

      <li>This body spray was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and sweet like the other reviewers said, but the coconut is way too strong.</li>
      <li>This body splash is light enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about using too much, and it&#x27;s not a seasonal fragrance</li>
      <li>I was really upset when the company discontinued it.</li>
      <li>Got it wicked fast.</li>
      <li>It smells absolutely edible.</li>

      <li>I know coconut milk is in the description scent, but I think it overwhelms even the fig and brown sugar which are supposed to be the main scents.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>in brand new unused condition</li>
      <li>it has such a warm and cozy feel to it.</li>
      <li>This is one of the most delicately feminine fragrances Bath and Body Works has to offer.</li>

    <li> I ordered this body spray because I had bought one many years back and I recalled this body spary and tired looking for it at the store, but unfortunately they didint have it anymore, so I searched it amazon until I found it!. It smells amazing,i fell in love with the scent the first time I bought the body spray at the store.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is SO pleasant that I use it as both a body splash AND a deodorizer for my car!  It smells absolutely edible.</li>

    <li> Everyone is in love with this scent after I purchased it online without even knowing how it smelled (I decided to try it based on reviews online). Next thing I know - my sister, my cousin, my mother and friends all want to smell like me now! LOL. It&#x27;s funny because now I&#x27;ll have to gift every one of them a Brown Sugar &amp; Fig body spray for Christmas now.</li>
    <li> I bought this scent at a garage sale, and immediately loved it, One day I was playing some games with my sister and brother-in-law , and I noticed that he kept sniffing the air , and he kept smelling things ( his wife, the pillow) to find out what it was.

This body splash is light enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about using too much, and it&#x27;s not a seasonal fragrance so it&#x27;s perfect year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer K.

    <li> Brown Sugar and Fig is my favorite Bath &amp; Body Works Body Splash.  I find it perfect for times when you want a little sophistication without the overpowering fragrance of perfume.  I think Bath and Body Works consistently delivers a quality product.  I find the oils last a long time both in the bottle and on my body.  They&#x27;re light but interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want to use these body splashes prior to dressing because the oils will cause spotting on clothing if they are over-sprayed. Other than that, no problems experienced whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite scents for over 5 years...it has such a warm and cozy feel to it. So excited to see this product available online!</li>
    <li> I love this!!!  It smells so good!  I am going to buy more Plus the body wash!&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a long time, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> The scent lasts all day and it smells so yummy.  I actually smelled a candle with this scent and I loved it so much that I searched for the perfume.  This body spray was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Brown sugar and fig is what they name this product, but what I smell is a very strong coconut scent, and it&#x27;s very generic. I know coconut milk is in the description scent, but I think it overwhelms even the fig and brown sugar which are supposed to be the main scents. It&#x27;s very feminine and sweet like the other reviewers said, but the coconut is way too strong.</li>
    <li> Bath&amp; Body works recently brought back this fragrance and when I went back to the store it was no longer there. So I&#x27;m so glad that I ordered it from Amazon!! It was so worth it!!</li>
    <li> Really happy to be able to find this perfume. I haven&#x27;t been able to locate it in the bath and body works store for years! Very exciting find.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! I was really upset when the company discontinued it. I&#x27;ve never been able to find it and now I can. My favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> I GOT BROWN SUGAR &amp; FIG BECAUSE MY MOTHER LIKES IT, AND I BROUGHT IT FOR HER FOR CHRISTMAS. IT SMELLS SO GOOD, AND AT THE TIME BATH AND BODY WORKS WAS NOT SELLING IT. THANK YOU. HAPPY NEW YEAR.</li>
