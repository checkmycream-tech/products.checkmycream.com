    <li> Very good product with very fast service. Would use this vebdor again for this and many other products. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I use this in UK and this is the first time I have been able to find it here in US I am very happy to have done so, it is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Love this product! This hair color and developer are the only products that I do not have sensitivity too.</li>
    <li> Performs exactly as represented - Very good with with Koleston colors.  Con: I need a much smaller container because I throw away a lot after 3 months (customer Service said it will work well for 3 months)..</li>
    <li> I color and retouch my hair and this works just fine with the Wella product I use. Much cheaper than a salon.</li>
    <li> Great developer! I used it with bleach powder and it did not damage my hair one bit. My L&#x27;oreal box color is way more damaging... I highly recommend this developer</li>
    <li> very good product. i love it. Best for hair use on the market. The hair stays nice and shiny with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since the last several months. It is performing well.  I have no issues whatsoever,</li>
    <li> I love this products. My sister in law introduced me to it and I have been using ever since</li>
    <li> Buy the real deal. I use Wella Kolestron as my hair dye, and am finally getting this developer to replace one I have (see reason below).&lt;br /&gt;I bought developer from another site and they put it in a different container (as a consideration for shipping costs, they say). Needless to say, the container had a wide mouth, didn&#x27;t close properly and my root touchup started to come out after only 2 weeks ,as it did recently. My bad for not buying Kolestron and not getting it through Amazon!</li>
    <li> Used with Wella Blondor Soft Blonde Cream and love the result. Thanks for offering stylist products to us:)</li>
    <li> Best developer ever!!!!!!</li>

    <li> Use with Wella colors</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I wanted and was carefully wrapped to prevent spillage.  I will order from this vender again.</li>
    <li> I have tried a LOT of creme developers and this one makes any permanent hair color better.  It has such a creamy consistency, so that the color goes right into the roots.

    <li> most gentle developer ever.  over all i just love the wella color touch and wella koleston prodlucts.  Never had any problems</li>
    <li> it is awesome product.. I&#x27;m definitely recommend to everybody</li>
    <li> The developer did the job!</li>
    <li> Excellent product to use with hair dye.  And no heavy smells</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years and have always been pleased with it.  I would&lt;br /&gt;never change from this!</li>
    <li> I wish I knew about this powder BEFORE I used Quikblue! I loaded my hair with coconut oil, then used the powder with 30 vol. It worked quickly,  efficiently, and did not damage my hair. I have curly hair, not to course, and dark. It worked in half the time the other kind did. I seriously recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Just as promised!</li>
    <li> I was happy with the developer.</li>
