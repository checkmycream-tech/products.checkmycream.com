      <li>Not to mention it has some great ingredients that are much better than the cheap brands.</li>
      <li>I purchased Sage Silk 18 just after using this and liked it better.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is ideal for people with allergy and is an all natural product.</li>
      <li>It feels so much better now.</li>
      <li>I bought these products not to make my hair look like the commercialized beauties we see on magazines or TV but to be healthy.</li>
      <li>The texture of Sage feels better when applying it.</li>
      <li>i like the conditioner more than I like the jason treatment shampoo</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner brand.</li>
      <li>smells really good, really deeps cleans.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I love this conditoner, the shampoo isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t comfortable scrubbing my hair or any part on my body (for that matter) with strong chemicals that were never meant for my body which my body in turn - rejects anyways.</li>
      <li>This is a good shampoo...makes my hair soft</li>
      <li>My hair is so much more healthy now thanks to the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Okay I had a very itchy scalp</li>
      <li>Whole foods sells this item for $3 more than amazon.</li>
      <li>Probably the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used so far to help dry, itchy scalp.  </li>
      <li>So, whenever I find a great conditioner that also cleanses my scalp along with softening and moisturizing my natural hair...it&#x27;s pretty much a keeper.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and will be back for more.</li>
      <li>This and the shampoo has helped with itching and flakes tremendously</li>
      <li>but I really felt as if I had to do a moisturizing shampoo before I touched conditioner!!</li>
      <li>I love co-washing my hair, as I&#x27;ve stopped using shampoos on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>Nothing better than being pure and washing with natural products.</li>
      <li>smells great and last a long time.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using this product!!</li>
      <li>As a suggestion I recommend this to be used after using Free &amp; Clear shampoo and use with the conditioner.</li>
      <li>Definitely would recommend it :)</li>
      <li>Very oily look and smell to my hair after using this.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works well, but doesn&#x27;t really blow me away.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This stuff really help my scalp.</li>
      <li>It does work way better than all the other natural conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, but I suspect that&#x27;s because this product is really stretching the term &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Tea Tree oil is a natural healer for skin and really helps normalize the scalp for skin allergy and dandruff.</li>
      <li>the used my normal conditioner on the ends.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
      <li>Jason&#x27;s sodium-laurel-sulfate free products are essential for me, especially the shampoo.</li>
      <li>but WOW</li>
      <li>And I know using this all natural product</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny without being oily.</li>
      <li>As long as you have a deep conditioner right at your fingertips</li>

    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this. My skin doesn&#x27;t do well with other products. Jason&#x27;s sodium-laurel-sulfate free products are essential for me, especially the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff really help my scalp. It feels so much better now. Buy the shampoo also works great together. Your scalp will thank you.</li>
    <li> I have very long color treated hair and got a terrible dandruff outbreak. I tried TGel..helped a little but took a lot of color iut if my hair. Tried Head &amp; Shoulders...horrible!! Was worse than before. Then I ordered the Jason&#x27;s Normalizing Tea Tree Shampoo and the Tea Tree Conditioner. I only massagedtake the conditioner into my scalp the used my normal conditioner on the ends. Jason&#x27;s works awesome!! Definitely would recommend it :)</li>
    <li> A great companion to the Tea Tree Oil shampoo. My hair is so much more healthy now thanks to the shampoo and conditioner. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> Awesome. My Granddaughter loves it. It is the only one she will use.</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo...makes my hair soft</li>
    <li> It works really good.</li>
    <li> smells really good, really deeps cleans. i like the conditioner more than I like the jason treatment shampoo</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I am using it together with the same brand shampoo. My hair looks beatiful. ciao</li>
    <li> I purchased Sage Silk 18 just after using this and liked it better.  The texture of Sage feels better when applying it.</li>
    <li> I love this conditoner, the shampoo isn&#x27;t anything special. For the price it&#x27;s a small amount, that&#x27;s the only downside for me.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is ideal for people with allergy and is an all natural product. Tea Tree oil is a natural healer for skin and really helps normalize the scalp for skin allergy and dandruff. People can check this on the web and see for themselves. Used this product for quite some time. Whole foods sells this item for $3 more than amazon. As a suggestion I recommend this to be used after using Free &amp; Clear shampoo and use with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Same as the shampoo.  I do not like the way it leaves my hair looking and smelling.  Very oily look and smell to my hair after using this.</li>
    <li> Just wish bottle was bigger and half leaked out in packing.</li>
    <li> I love co-washing my hair, as I&#x27;ve stopped using shampoos on my natural hair. My hair has flourished and grown like a weed because of this (never realized shampoo could be so harsh on the hair). So, whenever I find a great conditioner that also cleanses my scalp along with softening and moisturizing my natural hair...it&#x27;s pretty much a keeper.</li>
    <li> Okay I had a very itchy scalp so I decided to try this and it did stop the itching but WOW did it dry my hair out!!!! It was drier than straw!!!! Have you ever washed your hair and thought, &amp;#34;wow, I need to deep condition today?&amp;#34; yeah, drier than that. As long as you have a deep conditioner right at your fingertips then I think things will be alright but I really felt as if I had to do a moisturizing shampoo before I touched conditioner!!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner brand.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t give me immediate clearing of my dry scalp itch and or patches of dryness. i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> great stuff. smells great and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and the seller was great!</li>
    <li> Very nice conditioner.  No toxic chemicals here.  Probably a little pricey for my budget so won&#x27;t buy again anytime soon but it works well and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great and so is the conditioner. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. Not to mention it has some great ingredients that are much better than the cheap brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years, since I had an itchy/ sensitive scalp from dermatitis. It&#x27;s great and so is the shampoo!</li>
    <li> This and the shampoo has helped with itching and flakes tremendously</li>
    <li> Nothing better than being pure and washing with natural products. I bought these products not to make my hair look like the commercialized beauties we see on magazines or TV but to be healthy. And I know using this all natural product that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll get. I wasn&#x27;t comfortable scrubbing my hair or any part on my body (for that matter) with strong chemicals that were never meant for my body which my body in turn - rejects anyways. Fast Shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Healthy Product!</li>
    <li> Probably the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used so far to help dry, itchy scalp.  I love the scent and will be back for more.</li>
    <li> It stripped my hair of all its keratin.</li>
    <li> Works well, but doesn&#x27;t really blow me away. It does work way better than all the other natural conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, but I suspect that&#x27;s because this product is really stretching the term &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34; You could definitely buy a cheaper product that works just as well-- and probably isn&#x27;t much further from nature than this stuff.</li>
    <li> My teenage son loves this product and I can only find it on AMAZON.COM.  Thanks Mr. Bezos for your life-changing vision.  Amazon.com is my go-to site to find everything / anything in the world!</li>
    <li> I use this with the Jason Tea Tree Shampoo and I am very happy with it.  I just started using both of them a short time ago and I am very happy!!  I highly recommend using this product!!</li>
    <li> Another great Jason product!  I use it along with Jason Dandruff shampoo &amp; Jason  Normalizing shampoo.  I&#x27;m very happy with the condition of my hair &amp; scalp. One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner for winter-dry scalp. Makes my hair soft and shiny without being oily.</li>
