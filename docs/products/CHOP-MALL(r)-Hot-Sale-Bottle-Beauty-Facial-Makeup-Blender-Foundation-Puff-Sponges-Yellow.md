      <li>Other than that it took forever to get here, it&#x27;s pretty good with blending, and I mean, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
      <li>you can clearly smell it.</li>
      <li>This sponge didnt enlarge after being wet like normal sponges do.</li>

<li> you can clearly smell it.</li>
<li> This sponge didnt enlarge after being wet like normal sponges do.</li>
<li> It seems less expandable, and a little more stiff.</li>
<li> as long as you&#x27;re not in a rush to get it</li>
<li> The sponge is definitely smaller than I expected.</li>
<li> I had was that it took so long to get to me</li>
<li> and they&#x27;re not nearly as soft as mine,</li>
<li> but this sponge is hard even when soaking it in water for a long time it never fluffed up got bigger nor soft.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but gets the job done!</li>
<li> only down fall</li>
<li> Total waste of $2.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t expand when wet.</li>
<li> So it depends, if you prefer a firm make up sponge, this will do the trick.</li>
<li> but I recieved it a few days before Christmas and got a lot of compliments on my make up Christmas day.</li>
<li> It was a little small and doesn&#x27;t take in water when you try dampen it</li>
<li> rather small.</li>
<li> Its hard and doesnt blend make up well</li>
<li> Hard rubber</li>
<li> Has a weird smell that goes away with time.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price though.</li>
<li> This is a piece of crap!!!!!</li>
<li> Horrible!</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges - they are such a good buy and my makeup goes on so smooth with them. They are worth the 30 day wait for shipping.</li>
    <li> works well &amp; is SUPER cheap! as long as you&#x27;re not in a rush to get it (it takes about 2-3 weeks to receive), it&#x27;s very ideal for makeup lovers! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, it&#x27;s gets the job done for being a dupe</li>
    <li> These are excellent makeup sponges. I ordered two of them. I use them for foundation and these are very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Works great! Shipping did take a liitle longer then I thought but I recieved it a few days before Christmas and got a lot of compliments on my make up Christmas day.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really work like other sponges I own. Didn&#x27;t feel the same neither. It didn&#x27;t expand wen it observed water like they should.</li>
    <li> Good quality of the sponge...and the price really good.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great for blending concealer. I use mine every day.</li>
    <li> It was a little small and doesn&#x27;t take in water when you try dampen it but it is still a nice blender.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this sponge last year, and it was one of my favorite dupes. Although something seems different about the one I orrdered this time. It seems less expandable, and a little more stiff.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t expand when wet, although I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to with the price.</li>
    <li> Eh. I expected a little more to be honest. The sponge is definitely smaller than I expected. And it seems to wipe off makeup rather than blend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, although it doesn&#x27;t expand as much as other make-up sponges, and it&#x27;s denser (harder). So it depends, if you prefer a firm make up sponge, this will do the trick. If you&#x27;re looking for a softer sponge that expands more (like I do), then order something else.</li>
    <li> Not as porous/rough as it looks in the picture. rather small. is very squishy and soft. it&#x27;s better than the others I own.</li>
    <li> very soft and blends well. will buy again, and at such a great price!</li>
    <li> Knock off. Doesn&#x27;t expand when wet.</li>
    <li> Thee best beauty blender for a $1.00!! It blends and covers all areas of my face, the sponge itself is nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Works great skin looks natural with foundation on got it earlier than expected</li>
    <li> I love this, it was cheap and works well, only down fall I had was that it took so long to get to me</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Use for makeup as well as face painting. Comfortable to hold. Easy to clean</li>
    <li> This is a piece of crap!!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Way better than a lot of other blenders out there.</li>
    <li> items look new.  but did not like that they were not wrapped.  these are also gifts</li>
    <li> Love them , still have em and it&#x27;s been over a year 😊</li>
    <li> I got a really great deal but it took quite awhile for me to receive it. Therefore I give 4 stars</li>
    <li> Works very well, when it arrived it smelled kinda funky but soon faded away.</li>
    <li> Has a weird smell that goes away with time. It&#x27;s not that soft and it really doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to. I used it damp but the sponge will remove the foundation instead of blending it. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price though. But I would rather spend more on a real Beauty Blender than this imitation sponge.</li>
    <li> This sponge didnt enlarge after being wet like normal sponges do. Its hard and doesnt blend make up well</li>
    <li> Fast shipping good quality.</li>
    <li> Other than that it took forever to get here, it&#x27;s pretty good with blending, and I mean, you can&#x27;t beat the price! Would buy again :)</li>
    <li> I went ahead and bought it because of the reviews under me.. but this sponge is hard even when soaking it in water for a long time it never fluffed up got bigger nor soft. Horrible! Hard rubber you can clearly smell it.</li>
    <li> Good product will order from seller again</li>
    <li> I love using this to apply my makeup. The only reason it got for stars was it took over a month to get here! Good overall product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time!  Excelent product at a great price. I am considering to buy another one👍</li>
    <li> Luv it and you can&#x27;t beat the price😉</li>
    <li> Total waste of $2. Fell apart during first use. Took MONTHS to receive. Don&#x27;t recommend. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love love love this!!! My sisters buy knock offs from stores here and they&#x27;re not nearly as soft as mine, totally worth the wait and this honestly changed my life lol, does my makeup perfectly!</li>
